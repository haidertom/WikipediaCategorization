The '''Kol language''', '''''Aka-Kol''''', is an extinct [[Great Andamanese languages|Great Andamanese]] language, of the Central group. It was spoken in the southeast section of [[Middle Andaman]].

==History==
The Kol were one of the [[indigenous peoples]] of the [[Andaman Islands]], one of the ten or so [[Great Andamanese]] tribes identified by [[British Empire|British]] colonials in the 1860s.  Their language was closely related to the other [[Great Andamanese languages]]. They were extinct as a distinct people by 1921.&lt;ref name="vanDriem2001"/&gt;

==Grammar==
The Great Andamanese languages are [[agglutinative]] languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system.&lt;ref name=Templ&gt;Temple, Richard C. (1902). ''A Grammar of the Andamanese Languages, being Chapter IV of Part I of the Census Report on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands''. Superintendent's Printing Press: Port Blair.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have a distinctive [[noun class]] system based largely on body parts, in which every [[noun]] and [[adjective]] may take a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the [[tongue]].&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;  An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of ''yop'', "pliable, soft", in Aka-Bea:&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt; 
*A [[cushion]] or [[sponge]] is ''ot-yop'' "round-soft", from the prefix attached to words relating to the head or heart.
*A [[Walking stick|cane]] is ''ôto-yop'', "pliable", from a prefix for long things.
*A [[wikt:stick|stick]] or [[pencil]] is ''aka-yop'', "pointed", from the tongue prefix.
*A fallen [[tree]] is ''ar-yop'', "rotten", from the prefix for [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s or upright things.
Similarly, ''beri-nga'' "good" yields:
*''un-bēri-ŋa'' "clever" (hand-good).
*''ig-bēri-ŋa'' "sharp-sighted" (eye-good).
*''aka-bēri-ŋa'' "good at languages" (tongue-good.)
*''ot-bēri-ŋa'' "virtuous" (head/heart-good)

The prefixes are,

{| class=wikitable
! !!Bea !!Balawa? !!Bajigyâs? !!Juwoi !!Kol
|-
!head/heart
| ot- ||ôt- ||ote- ||ôto- ||ôto-
|-
!hand/foot 
|ong- ||ong- ||ong- ||ôn- ||ôn-
|-
!mouth/tongue 
|âkà- ||aka- ||o- ||ókô- ||o-
|-
!torso (shoulder to shins) 
|ab- ||ab- ||ab- ||a- ||o-
|-
!eye/face/arm/breast 
|i-, ig- ||id- ||ir- ||re- ||er-
|-
!back/leg/butt 
|ar- ||ar- ||ar- ||ra- ||a-
|-
!waist 
|ôto-
|}

Body parts are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], requiring a [[possessive adjective]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] to complete them, so one cannot say "head" alone, but only "my, or his, or your, etc. head".

The basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):
{| class=wikitable
| I, my
| ''d-''
| we, our
| ''m-''
|-
| thou, thy
| ''ŋ-''
| you, your
| ''ŋ-''
|-
| he, his, she, her, it, its
| ''a''
| they, their
| ''l-''
|}

'This' and 'that' are distinguished as ''k-'' and ''t-''. 

Judging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s &amp;mdash; [[1 (number)|one]] and [[2 (number)|two]] &amp;mdash; and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;

The "'''Anthon Transcript'''" (often identified with the "'''Caractors document'''") is a small piece of paper on which [[Joseph Smith]] wrote several lines of characters. According to Smith, these characters were from the [[golden plates]] (the ancient record from which Smith claims to have translated the [[Book of Mormon]]) and represent the [[reformed Egyptian]] writing that was on the plates. In 1828, this paper was delivered to [[Charles Anthon]], a well-known classical scholar of [[Columbia College, Columbia University]], for an expert opinion on the authenticity of the characters and the translation. Some adherents to the Book of Mormon claim that Anthon attested to the characters' authenticity in writing to [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] but then ripped up his certification after hearing the story of Smith and the plates.&lt;ref name="JS-H"&gt;{{cite book|title=Joseph Smith–History|last=Smith, Jr.|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Smith|publisher=[[LDS Church]]|pages=56–57|url=http://scriptures.lds.org/js_h/1/64-65|accessdate=29 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126144132/http://scriptures.lds.org/js_h/1//64-65|archivedate= 26 November 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Smith claim that Anthon believed any idea of reformed Egyptian was a hoax all along and that Harris was being deceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter XVIII|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/269/mode/1up|title=Mormonism Unvailed|author=[[E.D.

Bushman, ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Knopf, 2005), pp. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers claim that the incident between Harris and Anthon fulfilled a [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] made by [[Isaiah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Isaiah|isa|29|11|12}}, [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]] 11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed: &lt;br/&gt; 12  And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.&lt;/ref&gt; as Anthon is reported to have said to Harris, through Smith's telling of events, "I cannot read a sealed book."&lt;ref name="lds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19830717&amp;id=5OUOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C4MDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5099,1126329|title=Charles Anthon, Reluctant Witness|last=Smith|first=Calvin N.|date=17 July 1983|publisher=''[[Deseret News]]''|accessdate=13 December 2009}} {{quote |In his 1841 letter, Anthon said that "no one until the present time has even requested from me a statement in writing."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, [[Mark Hofmann]] created and sold a [[Anthon Transcript forgery|forgery of the Anthon Transcript]] to leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), which was revealed to be fraudulent when Hofmann's crimes were investigated.

==Harris's account of meeting with Anthon==
In 1838, Smith related an account based on Harris's version of the meeting. Smith wrote that Anthon "stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian. [Harris] then showed him those not yet translated, and said they were [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Chaldaic]], [[Akkadian language|Assyriac]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]"; and that they were "true characters." According to Harris, Anthon wrote Harris a letter of authenticity declaring the fragment to contain true Egyptian characters. Anthon was also reported to have confirmed the translation of these characters as correct. When informed that an [[Angel Moroni|angel]] of God had revealed the characters to Smith, Anthon reportedly tore up the authentication stating that there was no such thing as angels and asked Harris to bring the plates to him for translation. Harris then went to Dr. [[Samuel L. Mitchill]], who sanctioned what Anthon said.&lt;ref name="lds"&gt;{{lds|Joseph Smith–History|js_h|1|62|65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Elden|title=Approximate Book of Mormon Translation Timeline|url=http://www.eldenwatson.net/BoM.htm|website=eldenwatson.net|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard E. Bennett]], [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=mormonhistory "'Read This I Pray Thee': Martin Harris and the Three Wise Men of the East"], ''[[Journal of Mormon History]]'' '''36''':178 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew S. McBride, [//history.lds.org/article/doctrine-and-covenants-martin-harris "The Contributions of Martin Harris"], lds.org, 3 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthon's accounts of meeting with Harris==
In 1834, Anthon stated in a letter that, "The whole story about my having pronounced the Mormonite inscription to be 'reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics' is perfectly false .... I soon came to the conclusion that it was all a trick, perhaps a hoax .... [Harris] requested an opinion from me in writing, which of course I declined giving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe|first=E. D.|chapter=Anthon to E. D. Howe|date=17 February 1834|title=[[Mormonism Unvailed]]|authorlink=E. D. Howe|location=Painesville, Ohio|publisher=Telegraph Press, 1834|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/270/mode/2up }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthon stated in the letter that the story of his supposed authentication was false, that Anthon had identified the writings as a hoax, and that he had told Harris that the writings were part of "a scheme to cheat the farmer [Harris] of his money".&lt;ref&gt;''So What's the Difference?'', pp. 154–56, Fritz Ridenour, ed., Regal Books (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthon gave a second account in 1841 that contradicted his 1834 account as to whether or not he gave Harris a written opinion about the document: "[Harris] requested me to give him my opinion in writing about the paper which he had shown to me. I did so without hesitation, partly for the man's sake, and partly to let the individual 'behind the curtain' see that his trick was discovered. The import of what I wrote was, as far as I can now recollect, simply this, that the marks in the paper appeared to be merely an imitation of various alphabetical characters, and had, in my opinion, no meaning at all connected with them."&lt;ref name="SRA"/&gt; In both accounts, Anthon maintained that he told Harris that Harris was the victim of a fraud.&lt;ref name=EoM&gt;{{cite book|last=Bachman|first=Daniel W.|authorlink=Daniel W.

Ludlow|title=[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]|location=New York|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishing]]|year=1992|isbn=0-02-879602-0|oclc=24502140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pomeroy Tucker]], a contemporary of Harris and Smith, wrote in 1867 that all the scholars whom Harris visited "were understood to have scouted the whole pretense as too depraved for serious attention, while commiserating the applicant as the victim of fanaticism or insanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Origin, Rise, and Progress of Mormonism|last=Tucker|first=Pomeroy|authorlink=Pomeroy Tucker|year=1867|publisher=D.

==Caractors document==
The [[Community of Christ]] purchased the handwritten slip of paper known as the Anthon Transcript, or the Caractors document from the heirs of [[David Whitmer]].&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Whitmer, who once owned the document, stated that it was this slip of paper that Harris showed to Anthon. Both Mormon apologists and critics, however, claim that it is not certain that the document is the original, since Anthon had mentioned that the characters on the slip he saw were arranged in vertical columns and ended in a "rude delineation of a circle divided into various compartments, decked with various strange marks, and evidently copied after the [[Aztec calendar]] given by Humboldt," (1834) or "a rude representation of the Mexican zodiac" (1841).&lt;ref name="SRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedigitalvoice.com/enigma/essays/AAffair1.htm|title=The Anthon Affair|author=Jerome J.

The import of what I wrote was, as far as I can now recollect, simply this, that the marks in the paper appeared to be merely an imitation of various alphabetical characters, and had, in my opinion, no meaning at all connected with them."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship, including handwriting analysis, suggests the "Caractors" document was written by David Whitmer's brother John Whitmer in or after 1829 and therefore would not have been available to show Anthon or others in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;R. Scott Lloyd, [https://www.lds.org/church/news/speaker-gives-new-insights-on-martin-harris-1828-visit-to-charles-anthon?lang=eng "Scholar Gives New Insights on Martin Harris's 1828 Visit to Charles Anthon"] (webpage), lds.org, accessed 17 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols on the document were published twice in 1844, after Smith's death, as characters that had been copied from the gold plates, one of them in the December 21 issue of ''[[The Prophet (newspaper)|The Prophet]]''.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; In 1956 a request for review of the Caractors Document was made to three recognized Egyptologists, Sir Alan Gardiner, William C.. Hayes, and John A. Wilson. Gardiner replied that he saw no resemblance with "any form of Egyptian writing." Hayes stated that it might be an inaccurate copy of something in [[hieratic script]] and that "some groups look like hieratic numerals", adding that "I imagine, however, that the inscription bears a superficial resemblance to other scripts, both ancient and modern, of which I have no knowledge." Wilson gave the most detailed reply, saying that "This is not Egyptian writing, as known to the Egyptologist. It obviously is not hieroglyphic, nor the "cursive hieroglyphic" as used in the Book of the Dead. It is not Coptic, which took over Greek characters to write Egyptian. Nor does it belong to one of the cursive stages of ancient Egyptian writing: hieratic, abnormal hieratic, or demotic."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/31894670/1956_Statements_of_Egyptologists_on_the_Caractors_Document&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:漢字文化圈／汉字文化圈 · 한자 문화권 · Vòng văn hóa chữ Hán · 漢字文化圏.svg|thumb|CJKV characters derived from Ancient Chinese characters. Left to right: Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese.]]

In [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], '''CJK''' is a collective term for the [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]] languages, all of which include [[Chinese characters]] and derivatives (collectively, '''CJK characters''') in their writing systems. Occasionally, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] is included, making the abbreviation '''CJKV''', since Vietnamese historically used Chinese characters as well. Collectively, the CJKV characters often include ''[[hànzì]]'' in [[Written Chinese|Chinese]], ''[[kanji]]'', ''[[kana]]'' in [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], ''[[hanja]]'', ''[[hangul]]'' in [[Korean language#Writing system|Korean]], and ''[[hán tự]]'' or ''[[chữ nôm]]'' in [[Vietnamese language#Writing system|Vietnamese]].

== Character repertoire ==
Chinese is written almost exclusively in Chinese characters. It requires over 3,000 characters for general [[literacy]], but up to 40,000 characters for reasonably complete coverage. Japanese uses fewer characters — general literacy in Japanese can be expected with 1,945 characters. The use of Chinese characters in Korea is becoming increasingly rare, although idiosyncratic use of Chinese characters in proper names requires knowledge (and therefore availability) of many more characters.  However, even today, students in South Korea are taught 1,800 characters.

Other scripts used for these languages, such as [[bopomofo]] and the [[Latin script|Latin]]-based [[pinyin]] for Chinese, [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] for Japanese, and [[hangul]] for Korean, are not strictly "CJK characters", although CJK character sets almost invariably include them as necessary for full coverage of the target languages.

Until the early 20th century, [[Literary Chinese]] was the written language of government and scholarship in Vietnam. Popular literature in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] was written in the ''[[chữ Nôm]]'' script, consisting of borrowed Chinese characters together with many characters created locally. By the end of the 1920s, both scripts had been replaced by writing in Vietnamese using the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]].{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=113–115}}{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1997}}

The [[Sinology|sinologist]] Carl Leban (1971) produced an early survey of CJK encoding systems.

== Encoding ==
The number of characters required for complete coverage of all these languages' needs cannot fit in the 256-character code space of 8-bit [[character encoding]]s, requiring at least a 16-bit fixed width encoding or multi-byte variable-length encodings. The 16-bit fixed width encodings, such as those from [[Unicode]] up to and including version 2.0, are now deprecated due to the requirement to encode more characters than a 16-bit encoding can accommodate—Unicode 5.0 has some 70,000 Han characters—and the requirement by the Chinese government that software in China support the [[GB 18030]] character set.

Although CJK encodings have common character sets, the encodings often used to represent them have been developed separately by different East Asian governments and software companies, and are mutually incompatible. [[Unicode]] has attempted, with some controversy, to unify the character sets in a process known as [[Han unification]].

CJK character encodings should consist minimally of Han characters plus language-specific phonetic scripts such as [[pinyin]], [[bopomofo]], hiragana, katakana and hangul.

CJK character encodings include:
*[[Big5]] (the most prevalent encoding before Unicode was implemented)
*[[Chinese Character Code for Information Interchange|CCCII]]
*[[CNS 11643]] (official standard of [[Republic of China (Taiwan)|Republic of China]])
*[[EUC-JP]]
*[[EUC-KR]]
*[[GB2312]] (subset and predecessor of GB18030)
*[[GB18030]] (mandated standard in the [[People's Republic of China]])
*Giga Character Set (GCS)
*[[ISO 2022|ISO 2022-JP]]
*KS C 5861
*[[Shift-JIS]]
*[[TRON (encoding)|TRON]]
*[[Unicode]]

The CJK character sets take up the bulk of the assigned [[Unicode]] code space. There is much controversy among Japanese experts of Chinese characters about the desirability and technical merit of the [[Han unification]] process used to map multiple Chinese and Japanese character sets into a single set of unified characters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

All three languages can be written both [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|left-to-right and top-to-bottom]] (right-to-left and top-to-bottom in ancient documents), but are usually considered left-to-right scripts when discussing encoding issues.

==Legal status==
Libraries cooperated on encoding standards for [[JACKPHY]] characters in the early 1980s.  According to [[Ken Lunde]], the abbreviation "CJK" was a registered [[trademark]] of [[Research Libraries Group]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cjk.inf Ken Lunde, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; (which merged with [[OCLC]] in 2006).   The trademark owned by OCLC between 1987 and 2009 has now expired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trademarks.justia.com/736/38/cjk-73638777.html Justia listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conversational Constraints Theory''', developed in Min-Sun Kim, attempts to explain how and why certain conversational strategies differ across various [[cultures]] and the effects of these differences.  It is embedded in the Social Science communication approach which is based upon how culture influences communication.  There are five universal conversational constraints: 1) clarity, 2) minimizing imposition, 3) consideration for the other’s feelings, 4) risking negative evaluation by the receiver, and 5) effectiveness.  These five constraints pivot on the notion of if a culture is more social relational (collectivistic cultures), or task oriented (individualistic cultures).  The social relational approach focuses on having more concern for the receiver’s feelings, holding more importance upon saving face for the other person than being concise.  When constructing messages, the social relational approach takes into account how their words and actions will affect the listener’s feelings.   The task oriented approach emphasizes concern for clarity over feelings.  It places higher value on the degree to which the message is communicated explicitly in its truest form.  Cultures have specific manners and behaviors that pertain to conversational style.  These behaviors can be preferred by some cultures, and offensive to others.  Conversational Constraints Theory seeks to explain why these certain tactics work in some cultures but not in others.  It is influenced by the customs, rules, and norms of that culture.  The central focus of Conversational Constraints Theory is not necessarily what is said, but how it is said.  Conversations are typically [[goal-oriented]] and require coordination between both communicators, and messages are developed built upon various constraints, personal or cultural, in order to pursue any kind of interaction.  Kim discusses the need for approval, need for dominance, and gender roles to analyze conversational constraints.  The more approval a [[person]] needs, thus more [[feminine]], the more they view minimizing imposition and being concerned with the hearer’s feelings as being important.  The more dominant, thus more [[masculine]], the more they view message clarity and directness as being important.

==Effectiveness==

Concern for effectiveness is a constraint that is universally important amongst most all cultures.  It is focused on the influence that the message has on the receiver and to what extent.  Effectiveness explains the capability of how well the content of the message is conveyed to the listener, and if the style of verbal deliverance is soft or punctual.  Effectiveness pertains to the potency of the message, if it is strong or weak, powerful or ineffective, weighty or superficial.  Collectivistic cultures tend to use effectiveness within their conversations as more diffused and watered-down so as to lessen negativity and offense.  This aspect of effectiveness has more ease and cushion in how the message is spoken, and is structured in a way that will minimize dissonance at all costs.  On the other hand, individualistic cultures maximize the punctuality of effectiveness in delivering the message.  The tone of their message focuses on directness, frankness, and being straightforward with their listener, and intend on being bluntly honest in order to be effective.  Individualistic cultures are not generally concerned with the listener’s feelings if that sacrifices the effectiveness of the message.

==Clarity==

“Clarity is defined as the likelihood of an utterance making one’s intention clear and explicit.” Clarity is an important part of conversation because in order for a conversation to flow properly, the communication needs to be clear and precise. A person trying to [[communicate]] a specific message explicitly uses direct imperatives to ensure that the proper message is carried to the hearer. If a person is attempting to use the hint [[strategy]], the message will be less clear because the intent is not communicated explicitly, therefore is not derivable from the literal meaning of the utterances.
Kim proposes that task-oriented constraints emphasize a concern for clarity. For example, task-oriented constraints measure the degree to which the intentions of messages are communicated explicitly. When comparing collectivistic cultures to individualistic cultures, the members of individualistic cultures consider clarity as more significant than members of collectivistic when aspiring goals. Further, members of individualistic cultures have thresholds and exploit more attention for clarity than members of collectivistic cultures. Individuals who display independent and interdependent self-construals present different views on the importance of clarity. For instance, individuals who exhibit independent self-construals perceive clarity as significant in pursuing goals more than individuals who stimulate interdependent self-construals. Individuals who display both independent and interdependent self-construals focus more on relational and clarity restraints. On the other hand, individuals who do not exercise independent or interdependent self-construals do not visualize clarity and relational constraints imperative. To help further explain conversational constraints, Kim uses the need for approval, need for dominance, and [[gender roles]]. The need for [[:wikt:dominance|dominance]] and gender roles apply to the clarity of a conversational constraint. For instance, the more dominance an individual possesses to be, the more [[:wikt:emphasis|emphasis]] he or she places on clarity. Also, the importance on clarity is exhibited through to need to be more [[masculine]]. These different displays of clarity provide evidence for Kim’s conversational constraints.

==Consideration for Others’ Feelings==

When communicating with another person, individuals take into account the listener’s feelings. People acknowledge how their intended action is going to affect the feelings of the other person. The concern the speaker displays for the hearer relates to what the speaker feels is necessary in order to help the hearer maintain [[positive affectivity|positive]] [[self image]]s. Positive face, identity goals, and “concern with support” are three labels that help determine the degree to which a strategy shows consideration for the hearer’s feelings. When a person requests an explicit action, it possesses a higher chance of hurting the listener’s feelings. On the other hand, communicating with a hint sends a more implicit message, thus, delivering the message successfully. Compared to task-oriented constraints, social relational constraints stress concern for others by withdrawing from injuring the hearer’s feelings. They are strongly concerned with how their communication may affect the hearer’s and reflect on their concern to successfully accomplish these communicative goals. Some of these communicative goals affect the hearer’s still, thus, threatening their autonomy. It has been found that “collectivism influences the importance members of cultures place on relational concerns in conversation” (Kim, 1995). Therefore, members of this culture place more emphasis on face-supporting behaviors, such as avoiding harming the other’s feelings than when members are pursuing goals. Compared to members of individualistic cultures, these members “have higher thresholds for face support and select strategies to maximize face support” (Kim, 1995). Individuals who highlight interdependent self-construals want to avoid face loss as much as possible and want to feel welcomed by particular social groups. These individuals see avoiding hurt feelings as more significant than individuals who use independent self-construals. Individuals who are more feminine and need more approval than others tend to put more focus on the concern for others than more dominant individuals.

==Minimizing Imposition==

An element that is an essential component within the Conversational Constraints Theory emphasizes the role of minimizing imposition.  The theory discusses [[Cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural]] differences that have been observed when studying communicative strategies in different cultures. For instance, members within collectivistic cultures view face-supporting behavior. One way this is done is through minimizing imposition as an important component when a member is in pursuit of a goal.  There is ample reason to believe that individualistic cultures, on the other hand, do not consider face-supporting behaviors to be as important to goal oriented behavior. Conversational Constraints Theory suggests that feminine individuals place more value on minimizing their imposition. In contrast, individuals that are masculine tend to place less value on minimizing their imposition. In addition, the theory also reports that the more an individual requires approval within a given context, the higher the amount of importance they will place on minimizing their imposition. This occurs when the individuals are minimizing their imposition on hearers in a social-relational conversational constraint. In addition, this can occur in a task-oriented conversational constraint. Returning to the issue of research about conversational constraints across different cultures, researchers have noted specific concerns which are to be addressed.

==Avoiding Negative Evaluation by the Hearer==

There have been concerns found in recent studies about conversational constraints across different cultures. Current research suggests that the concern for avoiding negative evaluation by the hearer is only one of the three concerns that were observed in research studies. In most instances, this particular conversational constraint occurs when a speaker within a conversation makes an attempt to avoid negative evaluation from the individual that is hearing the speaker’s message. The concern for avoiding negative evaluation by the hearer in a conversation explains a plausible reason that explains why individuals attempt to conduct their behavior in ways that will avoid devaluation from others within a conversation. For example, a person might try to make a good first impression to seek approval in an interview by using strategies to avoid negative evaluation from the individual who is conducting the interview.  Among the various cultures that conversational constraints have been studied, individualistic cultures have been shown to have differences in comparison to other types of cultures. Individualistic cultures are more focused on the amount of clarity within a conversational constraint and less concerned with avoiding negative evaluation from the hearer. In contrast, collectivistic cultures are more concerned with behaviors that include avoiding negative evaluation from the hearer, and minimizing imposition because these constraints are considered face-supporting behavior.

'''''Crazy English''''' is a 1999 [[Cinema of China|Chinese documentary]] directed by [[Zhang Yuan (director)|Zhang Yuan]]. The film premiered along with Zhang's ''[[Seventeen Years (film)|Seventeen Years]]'' at the 1999 [[Locarno International Film Festival]]. It established Zhang's position as a "legitimate" director after years of working independently from, and often at odds with, the Chinese [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television|authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117914650.html|title=Seventeen Years Review|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|author=Elley, Derek |date=1999-09-13 |accessdate=2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to earlier films, like ''[[East Palace, West Palace]]'' (1997), ''Crazy English'' was produced with the cooperation of the state-owned [[Xi'an Film Studio]], which enjoys a "presented by" billing in the film's credits.&lt;ref name=Elley&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117914589.html|title=Crazy English Review| author= Elley, Derek| publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=1999-08-30|accessdate=2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject ==
{{main|Li Yang (Crazy English)}}

The film follows one of the [[People's Republic of China]]'s most popular motivational speakers, [[Li Yang (Crazy English)|Li Yang]], the founder of "[[Crazy English]]". Li is known for his stadium-sized presentations where he exhorts his audiences to engage in mass recitations of English phrases and [[idiom]]s, often with a strong [[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]] bent: "Conquer English to Make China Stronger!".&lt;ref name=NYer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/04/28/080428fa_fact_osnos|title=Letter from China: Crazy English: Reporting and Essays| publisher = ''[[The New Yorker]]'' | author = Osnos, Evan| authorlink = Evan Osnos | date = 2008-04-28| accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li, however, has also courted controversy. Despite the fact that he teaches a foreign language, Li has never left China, a fact not revealed in the film until the end.&lt;ref name=Elley/&gt; Other common criticisms, including accusations that Li Yang is a "nationalist huckster" and that his methods do not actually improve English-speaking ability,&lt;ref name=NYer/&gt; receive a much more subtle presentation in Zhang's film.

The film follows Li on his tours throughout China with a few interspersed interviews. Zhang Yuan has described the film as a combination of [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' and [[Robert Zemeckis]]' ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Michael (2005). "Wording up a Sweat in a Celluloid Sauna" in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a5oy2HlLth8C Speaking in Images: Interviews with Contemporary Chinese Filmmakers]''. Columbia University Press, p. 144. {{ISBN|0-231-13331-6}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production history ==
The seeds for ''Crazy English'' first arose when Li Yang's manager asked to meet with Zhang Yuan at a bar in Beijing's [[Sanlitun]] neighborhood. At the time Zhang Yuan had not even heard of Li Yang or his "Crazy English" programs.&lt;ref name=B152&gt;Berry, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting with the manager, Zhang was sufficiently intrigued by the idea of a documentary about Li to arrange for an actual meeting with the motivational speaker.&lt;ref name=B152/&gt;

Once the two men met, Zhang Yuan "immediately" decided to make the film.&lt;ref name=B152/&gt; Though made with the assent of official authorities, the filmmakers were nevertheless forced to make certain cuts&lt;ref&gt;Tasker, Yvonne (2002). "Zhang Yuan" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=xjQ7ifqiIksC ''Fifty Contemporary Filmmakers'']. Routledge Publishing, p. 427. {{ISBN|0-415-18974-8}}. Google Book Search. Retrieved 2008-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; before being allowed a limited release for their documentary.&lt;ref name="B153"/&gt; Zhang has noted that his own opinions of Li Yang vary dramatically from admiration to disgust.&lt;ref name=B152/&gt; One critic also noticed Zhang's ambivalence in the film and noted that the film seems to shift from appreciation or amusement at Li Yang's methodologies to one darker in tone, as Li Yang's mass rallies begin to resemble Mao-era [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guard]] rallies or even Hitler's [[Nuremberg Rally]].&lt;ref name=B152/&gt;

== Reception ==
Despite of its official approval, ''Crazy English'' received only a limited release in select cities within China.&lt;ref name=B153&gt;Berry, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Yuan has stated that the film's reception within China was difficult to read, given the mass adoration (and criticism) that Li Yang often elicits.&lt;ref name=B153/&gt;

While China remained ambivalent, the west also responded to ''Crazy English'' with mixed reactions. At least one critic felt that the film was too long and better suited for [[television]] than film.&lt;ref name=Elley/&gt; On the other hand, the film journal ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' showered praise on ''Crazy English'', saying, "This is a fascinating film - for China watchers, for educators and for fans of the documentary film - and is an absolute must for festival patrons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/00/8/miff/zhang.html |title=Zhang Yuan's Seventeen Years and Crazy English and Thai film Nang Nak |publisher=''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' |date=July 2000 |author=Freiberg, Freda |accessdate=2008-08-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730155548/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/festivals/00/8/miff/zhang.html |archivedate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the film's subject, Li Yang was reportedly less than pleased by the film's portrayal of him as a demagogue, and he has gone on to say that the film was "not a real documentary" accusing Zhang of manipulating the film to appeal to Western audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/NM-e/83370.htm|title=Li Yang a Crazy Talker |publisher=''[[City Weekend]]''| accessdate=2008-08-30|date=2003-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Essais     Titelblatt (1588).png|thumb|Essays of [[Michel de Montaigne]]]]
An '''essay''' is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own [[argument]] — but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of a [[term paper|paper]], an [[article (publishing)|article]], a [[pamphlet]], and a [[short story]]. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by "serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length," whereas the informal essay is characterized by "the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme," etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holman|first1=William|title=A Handbook to Literature|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=193|edition=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essays are commonly used as [[literary criticism]], political [[manifestos]], learned [[arguments]], observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all  modern essays  are written in [[prose]], but works in [[Poetry|verse]] have been dubbed essays (e.g., [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' and ''[[An Essay on Man]]''). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and [[Thomas Malthus]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' are counterexamples.

In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal [[education]]. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; [[admissions essay|admission essays]] are often used by [[university|universities]] in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.

The concept of an "essay" has been extended to other media beyond writing. A [[Essay#Film|film essay]] is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. A [[photo essay|photographic essay]] covers a topic with a linked series of [[photographs]] that may have accompanying text or [[Photo caption|captions]].

==Definitions==
[[File:Locke Essay 1690.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Locke]]'s 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.]]
An essay has been defined in a variety of ways. One definition is a "prose composition with a focused subject of discussion" or a "long, systematic discourse".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/glossary/glossary_de.htm Gale – Free Resources – Glossary – DE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425123427/http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/glossary/glossary_de.htm |date=2010-04-25 }}. Gale.cengage.com. Retrieved March 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is difficult to define the genre into which essays fall. [[Aldous Huxley]], a leading essayist, gives guidance on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley, ''Collected Essays'', "Preface".&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything", and adds that "by tradition, almost by definition, the essay is a short piece". Furthermore, Huxley argues that "essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of reference". 
These three poles (or worlds in which the essay may exist) are:
* The personal and the autobiographical: The essayists that feel most comfortable in this pole "write fragments of reflective autobiography and look at the world through the keyhole of anecdote and description".
* The objective, the factual, and the concrete particular: The essayists that write from this pole "do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Their art consists of setting forth, passing judgment upon, and drawing general conclusions from the relevant data".
* The abstract-universal: In this pole "we find those essayists who do their work in the world of high abstractions", who are never personal and who seldom mention the particular facts of experience.
Huxley adds that the most satisfying essays "...make the best not of one, not of two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist."

The word ''essay'' derives from the French infinitive ''essayer'', "to try" or "to attempt".  In English ''essay'' first meant "a trial" or "an attempt", and this is still an alternative meaning.  The Frenchman [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) was the first author to describe his work as essays; he used the term to characterize these as "attempts" to put his thoughts into writing, and his essays grew out of his [[commonplacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/bookusebooktheory/commonplacethinking.html |title=Book Use Book Theory: 1500–1700: Commonplace Thinking |publisher=Lib.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801200451/http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/bookusebooktheory/commonplacethinking.html |archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspired in particular by the works of [[Plutarch]], a translation of whose ''Œuvres Morales'' (''Moral works'') into French had just been published by [[Jacques Amyot]], Montaigne began to compose his essays in 1572; the first edition, entitled ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'', was published in two volumes in 1580.  For the rest of his life, he continued revising previously published essays and composing new ones. [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[Essays (Francis Bacon)|essays]], published in book form in 1597, 1612, and 1625, were the first works in English that described themselves as ''essays''.  [[Ben Jonson]] first used the word ''essayist'' in English in 1609, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

==History==
{{globalize|date=January 2011}}

===Europe===
English essayists included [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] (1577–1641) and [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605–1682). In France, [[Michel de Montaigne]]'s three volume ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'' in the mid 1500s contain over 100 examples widely regarded as the predecessor of the modern essay. In Italy, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] wrote about courtly manners in his essay ''Il Cortigiano''. In the 17th century, the [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] wrote about the theme of wisdom.&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/192869/essay essay (literature) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204053246/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/192869/essay |date=2009-12-04 }}. Britannica.com. Retrieved March 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], essays were a favored tool of polemicists who aimed at convincing readers of their position; they also featured heavily in the rise of [[periodical literature]], as seen in the works of [[Joseph Addison]], [[Richard Steele]] and [[Samuel Johnson]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote essays for the general public. The early 19th century, in particular, saw a proliferation of great essayists in English – [[William Hazlitt]], [[Charles Lamb]], [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] and [[Thomas de Quincey]] all penned numerous essays on diverse subjects. In the 20th century, a number of essayists tried to explain the new movements in art and culture by using essays (e.g., [[T.S. Eliot]]). Whereas some essayists used essays for strident political themes, [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Willa Cather]] wrote lighter essays. [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Edmund Wilson]], and [[Charles du Bos]] wrote literary criticism essays.&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt;

===Japan===
{{main article|Zuihitsu}}
As with the [[novel]], essays existed in Japan several centuries before they developed in Europe with a genre of essays known as ''zuihitsu'' — loosely connected essays and fragmented ideas. Zuihitsu have existed since almost the beginnings of Japanese literature. Many of the most noted early works of Japanese literature are in this genre. Notable examples include ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' (c. 1000), by court lady [[Sei Shōnagon]], and ''[[Tsurezuregusa]]'' (1330), by particularly renowned Japanese Buddhist monk [[Yoshida Kenkō]]. Kenkō described his short writings similarly to Montaigne, referring to them as "nonsensical thoughts" written in "idle hours". Another noteworthy difference from Europe is that women have traditionally written in Japan, though the more formal, Chinese-influenced writings of male writers were more prized at the time.

==Forms and styles==
This section describes the different forms and styles of essay writing. These forms and styles are used by an array of authors, including university students and professional [[List of essayists|essayists]].

===Cause and effect===
The defining features of a "cause and effect" essay are causal chains that connect from a cause to an effect, careful language, and chronological or emphatic order. A writer using this rhetorical method must consider the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], determine the [[Intention|purpose]], consider the [[audience]], think critically about different causes or consequences, consider a thesis statement, arrange the parts, consider the [[language]], and decide on a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7: Cause and Effect in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification and division===
Classification is the categorization of objects into a larger whole while division is the breaking of a larger whole into smaller parts.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5: Classification and Division in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compare and contrast===
Compare and contrast essays are characterized by a basis for comparison, points of comparison, and analogies. It is grouped by the object (chunking) or by point (sequential). The comparison highlights the similarities between two or more similar objects while contrasting highlights the differences between two or more objects. When writing a compare/contrast essay, writers need to determine their purpose, consider their audience, consider the basis and points of comparison, consider their thesis statement, arrange and develop the comparison, and reach a conclusion. Compare and contrast is arranged emphatically.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 6: Comparison and Contrast in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expository ===
Expository essay is used to inform, describe or explain a topic, using important facts and teaching reader about the topic. Mostly written in [[Third-person pronoun|third-person]], using "it", "he", "she", "they". Expository essay uses formal language to discuss someone or something. Examples of expository essays are: a medical or biological condition, social or technological process, life or character of a famous person. Writing of expository essay often consists of following next steps: organizing thoughts ([[brainstorming]]), researching a topic, developing a [[thesis statement]], writing the introduction, writing the body of essay, writing the conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nova.edu/tutoring-testing/study-resources/forms/planning-an-expository-essay.pdf|title=Subject Verb Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=Nova Southeastern University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expository essays are often assigned as a part of SAT and other standardized testings or as a homework for high school and college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://writeanypapers.com/blog/expository-essay-writing-steps/|title=How to Write a Good Expository Essay {{!}} WriteAnyPapers|last=|first=|date=17 Jun 2018|website=WriteAnyPapers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descriptive===
Descriptive writing is characterized by [[sensory perception|sensory]] details, which appeal to the physical senses, and details that appeal to a reader's emotional, physical, or intellectual sensibilities. Determining the purpose, considering the audience, creating a dominant impression, using descriptive language, and organizing the description are the rhetorical choices to consider when using a description. A description is usually arranged spatially but can also be [[chronological]] or emphatic. The focus of a description is the scene. Description uses tools such as [[denotative]] language, [[connotative]] language, [[figurative language]], [[metaphor]], and [[simile]] to arrive at a dominant impression.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2: Description in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; One university essay guide states that "descriptive writing says what happened or what another author has discussed; it provides an account of the topic".&lt;ref&gt;Section 2.1 of the Simon Fraser University CNS Essay Handbook. Available online at: [https://www.sfu.ca/cns/PDF/CNS_Essay_Handbook.pdf sfu.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lyric essay]]s are an important form of descriptive essays.

===Dialectic===
In the [[dialectic]] form of the essay, which is commonly used in [[philosophy]], the writer makes a thesis and argument, then objects to their own argument (with a counterargument), but then counters the counterargument with a final and novel argument. This form benefits from presenting a broader perspective while countering a possible flaw that some may present. This type is sometimes called an ethics paper'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Write-an-Ethics-Paper|title=How to Write an Ethics Paper (with Pictures) - wikiHow|accessdate=2016-07-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828152926/http://www.wikihow.com/Write-an-Ethics-Paper|archivedate=2016-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exemplification===
An exemplification essay is characterized by a generalization and relevant, representative, and believable examples including [[anecdote]]s. Writers need to consider their subject, determine their purpose, consider their audience, decide on specific examples, and arrange all the parts together when writing an exemplification essay.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 4: Exemplification in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An Essay on the Principle of Population.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus']] ''[[Essay on the Principle of Population]]'']]

===Familiar===
An essayist writes a ''familiar essay'' if speaking to a single reader, writing about both themselves, and about particular subjects. [[Anne Fadiman]] notes that "the genre's heyday was the early nineteenth century," and that its greatest exponent was [[Charles Lamb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fadiman|first=Anne|author-link=Anne Fadiman|title=At Large and At Small: Familiar Essays|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also suggests that while critical essays have more brain than the heart, and personal essays have more heart than brain, familiar essays have equal measures of both.&lt;ref&gt;Fadiman, ''At Large and At Small'', xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History (thesis)===
A history essay sometimes referred to as a thesis essay describes an argument or claim about one or more historical events and supports that claim with evidence, arguments, and references. The text makes it clear to the reader why the argument or claim is as such.&lt;ref&gt;History Essay Format &amp; Thesis Statement, (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative===
A [[narrative]] uses tools such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, [[Flashforward|flash-forwards]], and [[Transition (fiction)|transitions]] that often build to a climax. The focus of a narrative is the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. When creating a narrative, authors must determine their purpose, consider their audience, establish their point of view, use dialogue, and organize the narrative.

===Argumentative===
An [[argumentative]] essay is a [[criticism|critical]]  piece of writing, aimed at presenting objective [[analysis]] of the subject matter, narrowed down to a single topic. The main idea of all the criticism is to provide an opinion either of positive or negative implication. As such, a critical essay requires research and analysis, strong internal logic and sharp structure. Its structure normally builds around  introduction with a topic's relevance and a [[thesis statement]], body paragraphs with arguments linking back to the main thesis, and conclusion. In addition, an argumentative essay may include a refutation section where conflicting ideas are acknowledged, described, and criticized. Each [[argument]] of argumentative essay should be supported with sufficient evidence, relevant to the point.

=== Process ===
A process essay is used for an explanation of making or breaking something. Often, it is written in chronological order or numerical order to show step-by-step processes. It has all the qualities of a [[Technical documentation|technical document]] with the only difference is that it is often written in [[Linguistic description|descriptive mood]], while a technical document is mostly in [[imperative mood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://literarydevices.net/process-essay/|title=Process Essay - Examples and Definition of Process Essay|date=2017-04-04|work=Literary Devices|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
An [[economic]] essay can start with a thesis, or it can start with a theme. It can take a narrative course and a descriptive course. It can even become an [[argumentative]] essay if the author feels the need. After the introduction, the author has to do his/her best to expose the economic matter at hand, to analyze it, evaluate it, and draw a conclusion. If the essay takes more of a narrative form then the author has to expose each aspect of the economic puzzle in a way that makes it clear and understandable for the reader

===Reflective===
A ''reflective essay'' is an [[analysis|analytical]] piece of writing in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, or form — adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the topic in the author's life. Thus, the focus is not merely descriptive. The writer doesn’t just describe the situation,  but revisits the scene with more detail and emotion to examine what went well, or reveal a need for additional learning — and may relate what transpired to the rest of the author's life.

===Other logical structures===
The logical progression and organizational structure of an essay can take many forms. Understanding how the movement of thought is managed through an essay has a profound impact on its overall cogency and ability to impress. A number of alternative logical structures for essays have been visualized as diagrams, making them easy to implement or adapt in the construction of an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mariopetrucci.com/MissionPossible-StudySkills.htm |title='Mission Possible' by Dr. Mario Petrucci |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-10-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026012057/http://www.mariopetrucci.com/MissionPossible-StudySkills.htm |archivedate=2014-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic==
[[File:Czythumbur.jpg|thumb|[[University student]]s, like these students doing research at a university library, are often assigned essays as a way to get them to analyze what they have read.]] 
{{main article|Free response}}
In countries like the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], essays have become a major part of a formal [[education]] in the form of [[free response]] questions. Secondary students in these countries are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills, and essays are often used by universities in these countries in selecting applicants (''see'' [[admissions essay]]). In both secondary and tertiary education, essays are used to judge the mastery and comprehension of the material. Students are asked to explain, comment on, or assess a topic of study in the form of an essay. In some courses, university students must complete one or more essays over several weeks or months. In addition, in fields such as the humanities and social sciences,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} mid-term and end of term examinations often require students to write a short essay in two or three hours.

In these countries, so-called academic essays also called ''papers'', are usually more formal than literary ones.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} They may still allow the presentation of the writer's own views, but this is done in a logical and factual manner, with the use of the [[first-person narrative|first person]] often discouraged. Longer academic essays (often with a word limit of between 2,000 and 5,000 words){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} are often more discursive.  They sometimes begin with a short summary analysis of what has previously been written on a topic, which is often called a [[literature review]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Longer essays may also contain an introductory page that defines words and phrases of the essay's topic. Most academic institutions require that all substantial facts, quotations, and other supporting material in an essay be referenced in a [[bibliography]] or works cited page at the end of the text. This scholarly convention helps others (whether teachers or fellow scholars) to understand the basis of facts and quotations the author uses to support the essay's argument and helps readers evaluate to what extent the argument is supported by evidence, and to evaluate the quality of that evidence. The academic essay tests the student's ability to present their thoughts in an organized way and is designed to test their intellectual capabilities.

One of the challenges facing universities is that in some cases, students may submit essays purchased from an [[essay mill]] (or "paper mill") as their own work. An "essay mill" is a [[ghostwriting]] service that sells pre-written essays to university and college students. Since [[plagiarism]] is a form of [[academic dishonesty]] or [[academic fraud]], universities and colleges may investigate papers they suspect are from an essay mill by using [[plagiarism detection]] software, which compares essays against a database of known mill essays and by orally testing students on the contents of their papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Khomami |first=Nadia |title=Plan to crack down on websites selling essays to students announced |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/21/plan-to-crack-down-on-websites-selling-essays-to-students-announced |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427193720/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/21/plan-to-crack-down-on-websites-selling-essays-to-students-announced |archivedate=27 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine or newspaper==
{{main|Long-form journalism}}
Essays often appear in magazines, especially magazines with an intellectual bent, such as ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]''. Magazine and newspaper essays use many of the essay types described in the section on forms and styles (e.g., descriptive essays, narrative essays, etc.). Some newspapers also print essays in the [[op-ed]] section.
[[File:Harper's_February_(1895).jpeg|thumb|An 1895 cover of ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]'', a US magazine that prints a number of essays per issue.]]

==Employment==
Employment essays detailing experience in a certain occupational field are required when applying for some jobs, especially government jobs in the United States. Essays known as Knowledge Skills and Executive Core Qualifications are required when applying to certain US federal government positions.

A KSA, or "Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities," is a series of narrative statements that are required when applying to Federal government job openings in the United States. KSAs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for the successful performance of a position are contained on each job vacancy announcement. KSAs are brief and focused essays about one's career and educational background that presumably qualify one to perform the duties of the position being applied for.

An Executive Core Qualification, or ECQ, is a narrative statement that is required when applying to Senior Executive Service positions within the US Federal government. Like the KSAs, ECQs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The Office of Personnel Management has established five executive core qualifications that all applicants seeking to enter the Senior Executive Service must demonstrate.

==Non-literary types==

===Film===
A film essay (or "cinematic essay") consists of the evolution of a theme or an idea rather than a plot per se, or the film literally being a cinematic accompaniment to a narrator reading an essay.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} From another perspective, an essay film could be defined as a [[documentary film]] visual basis combined with a form of commentary that contains elements of self-portrait (rather than autobiography), where the signature (rather than the life story) of the filmmaker is apparent. The cinematic essay often blends [[Documentary film|documentary]], [[fiction]], and [[Experimental film|experimental film making]] using tones and editing styles.&lt;ref name="chicagomediaworks1"&gt;[http://www.chicagomediaworks.com/2instructworks/3editing_doc/3editing_docinematicessay.html Cinematic Essay Film Genre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808123129/http://www.chicagomediaworks.com/2instructworks/3editing_doc/3editing_docinematicessay.html |date=2007-08-08 }}. chicagomediaworks.com.

David Winks Gray's article "The essay film in action" states that the "essay film became an identifiable form of filmmaking in the 1950s and '60s". He states that since that time, essay films have tended to be "on the margins" of the filmmaking the world. Essay films have a "peculiar searching, questioning tone ... between documentary and fiction" but without "fitting comfortably" into either genre. Gray notes that just like written essays, essay films "tend to marry the personal voice of a guiding narrator (often the director) with a wide swath of other voices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=David Winks|title=The essay film in action|url=http://www.sf360.org/features/the-essay-film-in-action|publisher=[[San Francisco Film Society]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315200322/http://www.sf360.org/features/the-essay-film-in-action|archivedate=March 15, 2009|date=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Wisconsin]] Cinematheque website echoes some of Gray's comments; it calls a film essay an "intimate and allusive" genre that "catches filmmakers in a pensive mood, ruminating on the margins between fiction and documentary" in a manner that is "refreshingly inventive, playful, and idiosyncratic".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720113611/http://cinema.wisc.edu/series/2009_spring/essay.htm "Talking Pictures: The Art of the Essay Film"].

===Music===
In the realm of [[music]], composer [[Samuel Barber]] wrote a set of "Essays for Orchestra," relying on the form and content of the music to guide the listener's ear, rather than any [[program music|extra-musical plot or story]].

===Photography===
[[File:Huahine, French Polynesia, Image - Scott Williams.jpg|thumb|"After School Play Interrupted by the Catch and Release of a Stingray" is a simple time-sequence [[photo essay]].]]

A [[photo essay|photographic essay]] strives to cover a topic with a linked series of [[photograph]]s. Photo essays range from purely photographic works to photographs with captions or small notes to full-text essays with a few or many accompanying photographs. Photo essays can be sequential in nature, intended to be viewed in a particular order — or they may consist of non-ordered photographs viewed all at once or in an order that the viewer chooses. All photo essays are collections of photographs, but not all collections of photographs are photo essays. Photo essays often address a certain issue or attempt to capture the character of places and events.

===Visual arts===
In the visual [[art]]s, an essay is a preliminary drawing or sketch that forms a basis for a final painting or sculpture, made as a test of the work's composition (this meaning of the term, like several of those following, comes from the word ''essay'''s meaning of "attempt" or "trial").

[[File:FOXP2 location.png|thumb| FOXP2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of [[Chromosome 7 (human)|chromosome 7]] at position 31.]]
'''Forkhead box protein P2''' ('''FOXP2''') is a [[protein]] that, in humans, is encoded by the ''FOXP2'' [[gene]], also known as ''CAGH44'', ''SPCH1'' or ''TNRC10'', and is required for proper development of speech and language.&lt;ref name="pmid11586359"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lai CS, Fisher SE, Hurst JA, Vargha-Khadem F, Monaco AP | title = A forkhead-domain gene is mutated in a severe speech and language disorder | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | issue = 6855 | pages = 519–23 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11586359 | doi = 10.1038/35097076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene is shared with many vertebrates, where it generally plays a role in communication (for instance, the development of [[bird song]]).

The ''FOXP2'' protein contains a [[forkhead-box]] [[DNA-binding domain]], making it a member of the [[FOX proteins|FOX]] group of [[transcription factors]], involved in [[regulation of gene expression]]. In addition to this characteristic forkhead-box domain, the protein contains a [[polyglutamine tract]], a [[zinc finger]] and a [[leucine zipper]].

== Discovery ==
''FOXP2'' and its gene were discovered as a result of investigations on an English family known as the [[KE family]], half of whom (fifteen individuals across three generations) suffered from a speech and language disorder called [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]]. Their case was studied at the [[UCL Institute of Child Health|Institute of Child Health of University College London]].&lt;ref name = "pmid2332125"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurst JA, Baraitser M, Auger E, Graham F, Norell S | title = An extended family with a dominantly inherited speech disorder | journal = Dev Med Child Neurol | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 352–5 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2332125 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8749.1990.tb16948.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 [[Myrna Gopnik]], Professor of Linguistics at [[McGill University]], reported that the disorder-affected KE family had severe speech impediment with incomprehensible talk, largely characterized by grammatical deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gopnik M | title = Genetic basis of grammar defect | journal = Nature | volume = 347 | issue = 6288 | pages = 26 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2395458 | doi = 10.1038/347026a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She hypothesized that the basis was not of learning or cognitive disability, but due to genetic factors affecting mainly grammatical ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gopnik M | title = Feature-blind grammar and dysphagia | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | issue = 6268 | pages = 715 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2330028 | doi = 10.1038/344715a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Her hypothesis led to a popularised existence of "grammar gene" and a controversial notion of grammar-specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowie|first1=Fiona| name-list-format = vanc |title=What's Within?: Nativism Reconsidered|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, US|isbn=978-0-1951-5978-3|pages=290–291|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xb1pvz1JhQYC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Lyle| name-list-format = vanc |title=Biolinguistics: Exploring the Biology of Language|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-5210-0391-9|pages=98–99|edition=Revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2AN2f6GPFQC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1995, the [[University of Oxford]] and the Institute of Child Health researchers found that the disorder was purely genetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vargha-Khadem F, Watkins K, Alcock K, Fletcher P, Passingham R | title = Praxic and nonverbal cognitive deficits in a large family with a genetically transmitted speech and language disorder | journal = Proc.

This is one of the few known examples of [[Mendelian]] (monogenic) inheritance for a disorder affecting speech and language skills, which typically have a complex basis involving multiple genetic risk factors.&lt;ref name = "pmid12524432"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisher SE, Lai CS, Monaco AP | title = Deciphering the genetic basis of speech and language disorders | journal = Annu.

In 1998, Oxford University geneticists [[Simon Fisher]], [[Anthony Monaco]], Cecilia S. L. Lai, Jane A. Hurst, and [[Faraneh Vargha-Khadem]] identified an autosomal dominant monogenic inheritance that is localized on a small region of [[chromosome 7]] from DNA samples taken from the affected and unaffected members.&lt;ref name="pmid9462748"/&gt; The chromosomal region (locus) contained 70 genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genes that are essential for speech|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/d/d_10/d_10_m/d_10_m_lan/d_10_m_lan.html|website=The Brain from Top to Bottom|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The locus was given the official name "SPCH1" (for speech-and-language-disorder-1) by the Human Genome Nomenclature committee. Mapping and sequencing of the chromosomal region was performed with the aid of [[bacterial artificial chromosome]] clones.&lt;ref name="pmid10880297"/&gt; Around this time, the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the KE family, but had a similar type of speech and language disorder. In this case the child, known as CS, carried a chromosomal rearrangement (a [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]]) in which part of chromosome 7 had become exchanged with part of chromosome 5. The site of breakage of chromosome 7 was located within the SPCH1 region.&lt;ref name="pmid10880297"/&gt;

In 2001, the team identified in CS that the mutation is in the middle of a protein-coding gene.&lt;ref name="pmid11586359"/&gt; Using a combination of [[bioinformatics]] and [[RNA]] analyses, they discovered that the gene codes for a novel protein belonging to the [[forkhead-box]] (FOX) group of [[transcription factors]]. As such, it was assigned with the official name of FOXP2. When the researchers sequenced the ''FOXP2'' gene in the KE family, they found a [[heterozygous]] [[point mutation]] shared by all the affected individuals, but not in unaffected members of the family and other people.&lt;ref name="pmid11586359"/&gt; This mutation is due to an amino-acid substitution that inhibits the DNA-binding domain of the ''FOXP2'' protein.&lt;ref name = "pmid16984964"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vernes SC, Nicod J, Elahi FM, Coventry JA, Kenny N, Coupe AM, Bird LE, Davies KE, Fisher SE | display-authors = 6 | title = Functional genetic analysis of mutations implicated in a human speech and language disorder | journal = Hum.

''FOXP2'' is expressed in many areas of the brain&lt;ref name="pmid12192408"/&gt; including the [[basal ganglia]] and inferior [[frontal cortex]] where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development.&lt;ref name="pmid17999357"/&gt;

A knockout mouse model has been used to examine ''FOXP2'''s role in brain development and how mutations in the two copies of ''FOXP2'' affect vocalization. Mutations in one copy result in reduced speech while abnormalities in both copies cause major brain and lung developmental issues.&lt;ref name="pmid17428829"/&gt;

The expression of ''FOXP2'' is subject to post-transcriptional regulation, particularly [[micro RNA]], which binds to multiple miRNA binding-sites in the neocortex, causing the repression of FOXP2 3’UTR.&lt;ref name="pmid22874921"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clovis YM, Enard W, Marinaro F, Huttner WB, De Pietri Tonelli D | title = Convergent repression of Foxp2 3'UTR by miR-9 and miR-132 in embryonic mouse neocortex: implications for radial migration of neurons | journal = Development | volume = 139 | issue = 18 | pages = 3332–42 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22874921 | doi = 10.1242/dev.078063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several abnormalities linked to ''FOXP2''. The most common mutation results in severe speech impairment known as [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]] (DVD) which is caused by a translocation in the 7q31.2 region [t(5;7)(q22;q31.2)].&lt;ref name="pmid11586359"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10880297"/&gt; A missense mutation causing an arginine-to-histidine substitution (R553H) in the [[DNA-binding domain]] is thought to be the abnormality in KE.&lt;ref name="Preuss 2012"/&gt; A heterozygous nonsense mutation, R328X variant, produces a truncated protein involved in speech and language difficulties in one KE individual and two of their close family members.&lt;ref name="MacDermot 2005"/&gt; R553H and R328X mutations also affected nuclear localization, DNA-binding, and the transactivation (increased gene expression) properties of ''FOXP2''.&lt;ref name="Vernes 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vernes SC, Nicod J, Elahi FM, Coventry JA, Kenny N, Coupe AM, Bird LE, Davies KE, Fisher SE | display-authors = 6 | title = Functional genetic analysis of mutations implicated in a human speech and language disorder | journal = Hum.

There is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the ''FOXP2'' gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control. For examples, the impairments include difficulties in comprehension. Brain imaging of affected individuals indicates functional abnormalities in language-related cortical and basal/ganglia regions, demonstrating that the problems extend beyond the motor system.

A reduction in dopamine levels and changes in the morphology of certain nerve cells are also observed.&lt;ref name="Enard_2009"/&gt;

However, ''FOXP2'' is extremely diverse in [[Microbat|echolocating bats]].&lt;ref name="li2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li G, Wang J, Rossiter SJ, Jones G, Zhang S | title = Accelerated FoxP2 evolution in echolocating bats | journal = [[PLoS ONE]] | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = e900 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17878935 | pmc = 1976393 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-two sequences of non-bat [[eutherian]] mammals revealed a total number of 20 nonsynonymous mutations in contrast to half that number of bat sequences, which showed 44 nonsynonymous mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid17878935" /&gt; All [[cetaceans]] share three amino acid substitutions, but no differences were found between echolocating [[toothed whales]] and non-echolocating [[baleen cetaceans]].&lt;ref name="pmid17878935" /&gt; Within bats, however, amino acid variation correlated with different echolocating types.&lt;ref name="pmid17878935" /&gt;

== Interactions ==

''FOXP2'' [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]]s with a regulatory gene ''[[CTBP1]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid14701752"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li S, Weidenfeld J, Morrisey EE | title = Transcriptional and DNA binding activity of the Foxp1/2/4 family is modulated by heterotypic and homotypic protein interactions | journal = Mol.

==Mice==

In a mouse ''FOXP2'' [[gene knockout|knockout study]], loss of both copies of the gene caused severe motor impairment related to cerebellar abnormalities and lack of [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] [[Animal communication|vocalisations]] normally elicited when pups are removed from their mothers.&lt;ref name="pmid15983371"/&gt; These vocalizations have important communicative roles in mother-offspring interactions. Loss of one copy was associated with impairment of ultrasonic vocalisations and a modest developmental delay. Male mice on encountering female mice produce complex ultrasonic vocalisations that have characteristics of song.&lt;ref name="Holy 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holy TE, Guo Z | title = Ultrasonic songs of male mice | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = e386 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16248680 | pmc = 1275525 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030386 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mice that have the R552H point mutation carried by the KE family show cerebellar reduction and abnormal [[synaptic plasticity]] in striatal and [[cerebellar]] circuits.&lt;ref name="Groszer 2008"/&gt;

==Birds==

In [[songbird]]s, ''FOXP2'' most likely regulates genes involved in [[neuroplasticity]].&lt;ref name="pmid18052609"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haesler S, Rochefort C, Georgi B, Licznerski P, Osten P, Scharff C | title = Incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation after knockdown of FoxP2 in songbird basal ganglia nucleus Area X | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = e321 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18052609 | pmc = 2100148 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teramitsu 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teramitsu I, White SA | title = FoxP2 regulation during undirected singing in adult songbirds | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 26 | issue = 28 | pages = 7390–4 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16837586 | pmc = 2683919 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1662-06.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gene knockdown]] of ''FOXP2'' in [[Area X]] of the [[basal ganglia]] in songbirds results in incomplete and inaccurate song imitation.&lt;ref name="pmid18052609" /&gt; Overexpression of FoxP2 was accomplished through injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) into Area X of the brain. This overexpression produced similar effects to that of knockdown; juvenile zebra finch birds were unable to accurately imitate their tutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heston JB, White SA | title = Behavior-linked FoxP2 regulation enables zebra finch vocal learning | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 2885–94 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25698728 | pmc = 4331621 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3715-14.2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in adult canaries higher ''FOXP2'' levels also correlate with song changes.&lt;ref name="pmid15056606"/&gt;

Levels of ''FOXP2'' in adult zebra finches are significantly higher when males direct their song to females than when they sing song in other contexts.&lt;ref name="Teramitsu 2006"/&gt; “Directed” singing refers to when a male is singing to a female usually for a courtship display. “Undirected” singing occurs when for example, a male sings when other males are present or is alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarvis ED, Scharff C, Grossman MR, Ramos JA, Nottebohm F | title = For whom the bird sings: context-dependent gene expression | journal = Neuron | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 775–88 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9808464 | doi = 10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80594-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that FoxP2 levels vary depending on the social context. When the birds were singing undirected song, there was a decrease of FoxP2 expression in Area X. This downregulation was not observed and FoxP2 levels remained stable in birds singing directed song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teramitsu I, White SA | title = FoxP2 regulation during undirected singing in adult songbirds | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 26 | issue = 28 | pages = 7390–4 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16837586 | pmc = 2683919 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1662-06.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between song-learning and non-song-learning birds have been shown to be caused by differences in ''FOXP2'' [[gene expression]], rather than differences in the amino acid sequence of the ''FOXP2'' protein.

''FOXP2'' also has possible implications in the development of [[bat]] [[animal echolocation|echolocation]].&lt;ref name="Preuss 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17878935"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li G, Wang J, Rossiter SJ, Jones G, Zhang S |title=Accelerated FoxP2 evolution in echolocating bats |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=e900 |year=2007 |pmid=17878935 |pmc=1976393 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000900 |editor1-last=Ellegren |editor1-first=Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilbrecht 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilbrecht L, Nottebohm F |title=Vocal learning in birds and humans |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=135–48 |year=2003 |pmid=12953292 |doi=10.1002/mrdd.10073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''genus–differentia [[definition]]''' is a type of [[Extensional and intensional definitions#Intensional definition|intensional definition]], and it is composed of two parts:

# '''a [[Genus_(philosophy)|genus]]''' (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.
# '''the [[differentia]]''': The portion of the definition that is not provided by the genus.
For example, consider these two definitions:
* ''a [[triangle]]'': A plane figure that has 3 straight bounding sides.
* ''a [[quadrilateral]]'': A plane figure that has 4 straight bounding sides.
Those definitions can be expressed as one genus and two ''differentiae'':
# ''one genus'':
#* ''the genus for both a triangle and a quadrilateral'': "A plane figure"
# ''two differentiae'':
#* ''the differentia for a triangle'': "that has 3 straight bounding sides."
#* ''the differentia for a quadrilateral'': "that has 4 straight bounding sides."

== Differentiation and Abstraction ==

The process of producing new definitions by ''extending'' existing definitions is commonly known as '''differentiation''' (and also as '''derivation'''). The reverse process, by which just part of an existing definition is used itself as a new definition, is called '''[[abstraction]]'''; the new definition is called ''an&amp;nbsp;abstraction'' and it is said to have been ''abstracted away from'' the existing definition.

For instance, consider the following:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles, and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.
A part of that definition may be singled out (using parentheses here):
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': (&lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles&lt;/span&gt;), and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.
and with that part, an abstraction may be formed:
* &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;''a [[rectangle]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles.&lt;/span&gt;
Then, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; that has bounding sides which all have the same length.

Similarly, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be rearranged and another portion singled out:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': (&lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length&lt;/span&gt;), and that has interior angles which are all right angles.
leading to the following abstraction:
* &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;''a [[rhombus]]'': a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length.&lt;/span&gt;
Then, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; that has interior angles which are all right angles.

In fact, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast in terms of both of the abstractions, where one acts as the genus and the other acts as the differentia:
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; that is &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt;.
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; that is &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;.
Hence, abstraction is crucial in simplifying definitions.

== Multiplicity ==

When multiple definitions could serve equally well, then all such definitions apply simultaneously. Thus, ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' is a member of both the genus ''&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; rectangle&lt;/span&gt;'' and the genus ''&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; rhombus&lt;/span&gt;''. In such a case, it is notationally convenient to consolidate the definitions into one definition that is expressed with multiple genera (and possibly no differentia, as in the following):
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt;.
or completely equivalently:
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;.

More generally, a collection of &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; equivalent definitions (each of which is expressed with one unique genus) can be recast as one definition that is expressed with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; genera. Thus, the following:
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* &amp;hellip;
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
could be recast as:
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a&amp;hellip; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.

== Structure ==

A genus of a definition provides a means by which to specify an ''[[is-a|is-a relationship]]'':
* A square is a rectangle, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a rhombus, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a&amp;hellip;
The non-genus portion of the differentia of a definition provides a means by which to specify a ''[[has-a|has-a relationship]]'':
* A square has an interior angle that is a right angle.
* A square has a straight bounding side.
* A square has a&amp;hellip;

When a system of definitions is constructed with genera and differentiae, the definitions can be thought of as nodes forming a [[hierarchy]] or—more generally—a [[directed acyclic graph]]; a node that has no [[Directed graph|predecessor]] is ''a&amp;nbsp;most general definition''; each node along a directed path is ''more '''differentiated''''' (or ''more '''derived''''') than any one of its predecessors, and a node with no [[Directed graph|successor]] is ''a&amp;nbsp;most differentiated'' (or ''a&amp;nbsp;most derived'') definition.

When a definition, ''S'', is the [[Directed graph|tail]] of each of its successors (that is, ''S'' has at least one successor and each [[Directed graph|direct successor]] of ''S'' is a most differentiated definition), then ''S'' is often called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''the '''[[species]]'''''&lt;/span&gt; of each of its successors, and each direct successor of ''S'' is often called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''an '''[[individual]]'''''&lt;/span&gt; (or &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''an '''[[entity]]'''''&lt;/span&gt;) of the species ''S''; that is, the genus of an individual is synonymously called ''the&amp;nbsp;species'' of that individual. Furthermore, the differentia of an individual is synonymously called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''the [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]''&lt;/span&gt; of that individual. For instance, consider the following definition:
* ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'': a human that has the name 'John&amp;nbsp;Smith'.
In this case:
* The whole definition is ''an&amp;nbsp;individual''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is an individual.
* The genus of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' (which is "a&amp;nbsp;human") may be called synonymously ''the&amp;nbsp;species'' of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is an individual of the species ''&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; human''.
* The differentia of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' (which is "that has the name 'John&amp;nbsp;Smith'") may be called synonymously ''the&amp;nbsp;identity'' of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is identified among other individuals of the same species by the fact that ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is the one "that has the name 'John Smith'".

As in that example, the identity itself (or some part of it) is often used to refer to the entire individual, a phenomenon that is known in [[linguistics]] as a ''[[pars pro toto|pars&amp;nbsp;pro&amp;nbsp;toto]] [[synecdoche]]''.

==Theory==

===Background===
According to de Swaan, the global language system has been constantly evolving since the time period of the early 'military-agrarian' regimes.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt; Under these regimes, the rulers imposed their own language and so the first 'central' languages emerged, linking the peripheral languages of the agrarian communities via bilingual speakers to the language of the conquerors. Then was the formation of empires, which resulted in the next stage of integration of the world language system.

Firstly, Latin emerged from Rome. Under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]], under which an extensive group of states were ruled by, the usage of Latin stretched along the Mediterranean coast, the southern half of Europe, and more sparsely to the North and then into the Germanic and Celtic lands. Thus, Latin evolved to become a central language in Europe from 27 BC to 476 AD.

Secondly, there was the widespread usage of the pre-classical version of Han Chinese in contemporary China due to the unification of China in 221 BC by [[Qin Shi Huang]].

Thirdly, [[Sanskrit]] started to become widely spoken in South Asia from the widespread teaching of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] in South Asian countries.

Fourthly, the expansion of the Arabic empire also led to the increased usage of Arabic as a language in the Afro-Eurasian land mass.

Military conquests of preceding centuries generally determine the distribution of languages today.
Supercentral languages spread by land and sea. Land-bound languages spread via marching empires: [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hindi]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. However, when the conquerors were defeated and were forced to move out of the territory, the spread of the languages receded. As a result, some of these languages are currently barely supercentral languages and are instead confined to their remaining state territories, as is evident from German, Russian and Japanese.

On the other hand, sea-bound languages spread by conquests overseas: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Consequently, these languages became widespread in areas settled by European colonisers and relegated the indigenous people and their languages to peripheral positions.

Besides, the [[world-systems theory]] also allowed the global language system to expand further. It focuses on the existence of the core, semi-peripheral and peripheral nations. The [[core countries]] are the most economically powerful and the wealthiest countries. Besides, they also have a strong governmental system in the country, which oversees the bureaucracies in the governmental departments. There is also the prevalent existence of the [[bourgeois]], and core nations have significant influence over the non-core, smaller nations. Historically, the core countries were found in northwestern Europe and include countries such as England, France and the Netherlands. They were the dominant countries that had colonized many other nations from the early 15th century to the early 19th century.

Then is the existence of the [[periphery countries]], the countries with the slowest economic growth. They also have relatively weak governments and a poor social structure and often depend on primary industries as the main source of economic activity for the country.

The extracting and exporting of raw materials from the peripheral nations to core nations is the activity bringing about the most economic benefits to the country. Much of the population that is poor and uneducated, and the countries are also extensively influenced by core nations and the multinational corporations found there. Historically, peripheral nations were found outside Europe, the continent of colonial masters. Many countries in [[Latin America]] were peripheral nations during the period of colonization, and today peripheral countries are in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

Lastly, the presence of the [[semiperiphery countries]], those in between the core and the periphery. They tend to be those which started out as peripheral nations and are currently moving towards industrialization and the development of more diversified labour markets and economies. They can as well come about from declining core countries. They are not dominant players in the international trade market. As compared to the peripheral nations, semi-peripheries are not as susceptible to manipulation by the core countries. However, most of these nations have economic or political relations with the core. Semi-peripheries also tend to exert influence and control over peripheries and can serve to be a buffer between the core and peripheral nations and ease political tensions. Historically, Spain and Portugal were semi-peripheral nations after they fell from their dominant core positions. As they still maintained a certain level of influence and dominance in Latin America over their colonies, they could still maintain their semi-peripheral position.

According to [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], one of the most well-known theorists who developed the world-systems approach, a core nation is dominant over the non-core nations from its economic and trade dominance. The abundance of cheap and unskilled labour in the peripheral nations makes many large [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs), from core countries, often outsource their production to the peripheral countries to cut costs, by employing cheap labour. Hence, the languages from the core countries could penetrate into the peripheries from the setting up of the foreign MNCs in the peripheries. A significant percentage of the population living in the core countries had also migrated to the core countries in search of jobs with higher wages.

The gradual expansion of the population of migrants makes the language used in their home countries be brought into the core countries, thus allowing for further integration and expansion of the world language system. The semi-peripheries also maintain economic and financial trade with the peripheries and core countries. That allows for the penetration of languages used in the semi-peripheries into the core and peripheral nations, with the flow of migrants moving out of the semi-peripheral nations to the core and periphery for trade purposes.

Thus, the global language system examines rivalries and accommodations using a global perspective and establishes that the linguistic dimension of the world system goes hand in hand with the political, economic, cultural and ecological aspects. Specifically, the present global constellation of languages is the product of prior conquest and domination and of ongoing relations of power and exchange.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

===Q-value===
&lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is the communicative value of a language ''i'', its potential to connect a speaker with other speakers of a constellation or subconstellation, "S".  It is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Q_i=p_i \times c_i = \left ( \frac{P_i}{N^S} \right ) \times \left ( \frac{C_i}{M^S} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

The prevalence &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; of language ''i'', means the number of competent speakers in ''i'',  &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;, divided by all the speakers, &lt;math&gt;N^S&lt;/math&gt; of constellation ''S''. Centrality, &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of multilingual speakers &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; who speak language ''i'' divided by all the multilingual speakers in constellation ''S'',  &lt;math&gt;M^S&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the Q-value or communication value is the product of the prevalence &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and the centrality &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; of language ''i''  in constellation ''S''.

Consequently, a peripheral language has a low Q-value and the Q-values increase along the sociology classification of languages, with the Q-value of the hypercentral language being the highest.

De Swaan has been calculating the Q-values of the official [[European Union]](EU) languages since 1957 to explain the acquisition of languages by EU citizens in different phases.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=de Swaan |first=Abram |editor-last=Ammon |editor-first=Ulrich |editorlink1=Ulrich Ammon |editor2-last=Mattheier |editor2-first=Klaus J. |editor3-last=Nelde |editor3-first=Peter H. |title=Sociolinguistica: International Yearbook of European Sociolinguistics, Vol. 21: Linguistic Consequences of the EU-Enlargement |publisher=Tübingen |date=2007 |pages=1–21 |chapter=The language predicament of the EU since the enlargements [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Ao2XIClUKd8C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=The+language+predicament+of+the+EU+since+the+enlargements.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=93hHwBadOP&amp;sig=DewiQDKr-XCxt81IDwkRxLRFa-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=plxAVOfjAc6RuATT1oGQDw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20swaan&amp;f=false] |isbn=978-3-484-60490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, when there were only four language constellations, Q-value decreased in the order of French, German, Italian, Dutch. In 1975, the [[European Commission]] enlarged to include Britain, Denmark and Ireland. English had the highest Q-value followed by French and German.
In the following years, the European Commission grew, with the addition of countries like Austria, Finland and Sweden. Q-value of English still remained the highest, but French and German swapped places.

In EU23, which refers to the 23 official languages spoken in the [[European Union]], the Q-values for English, German and French were 0.194, 0.045 and 0.036 respectively.

===Theoretical framework===
De Swaan likens the global language system to contemporary political [[macrosociology]] and states that language constellations are a social phenomenon, which can be understood by using social science theories. In his theory, de Swaan uses the [[#Political Sociology of Language|Political Sociology of Language]] and [[#Political Economy of Language|Political Economy of Language]] to explain the rivalry and accommodation between language groups.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

====Political sociology====
This theoretical perspective centres on the interconnections among the state, nation and citizenship. Accordingly, bilingual elite groups try to take control of the opportunities for mediation between the monolingual group and the state. Subsequently, they use the official language to dominate the sectors of government and administration and the higher levels of employment. It assumes that both the established and outsider groups are able to communicate in a shared vernacular, but the latter groups lack the literacy skills that could allow them to learn the written form of the central or supercentral language, which would, in turn allow, them to move up the social ladder.

====Political economy====
This perspective centres on the inclinations that people have towards learning one language over the other. The presumption is that if given a chance, people will learn the language that gives them more communication advantage. In other words, a higher [[#Q-Value|Q-Value]]. Certain languages such as English or Chinese have high Q-values since they are spoken in many countries across the globe and would thus be more economically useful than to less spoken languages, such as Romanian or Hungarian.

From an economic perspective, languages are ‘hypercollective’ goods since they exhibit properties of [[collective goods]] and produce external network effects. Thus, the more speakers a language has, the higher its communication value for each speaker. The hypercollective nature and [[#Q-Value|Q-Value]] of languages thus help to explain the dilemma that a speaker of a peripheral language faces when deciding whether to learn the central or hypercentral language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also help to explain the accelerating spread and abandonment of various languages. In that sense, when people feel that a language is gaining new speakers, they would assign a greater Q-value to this language and abandon their own [[firzt language|native]] language in place of a more central language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also explain, in an economic sense, the ethnic and cultural movements for language conservation.

Specifically, a minimal Q-value of a language is guaranteed when there is a critical mass of speakers committed to protecting it, thus preventing the language from being forsaken.

===Characteristics===
The global language system theorises that language groups are engaged in unequal competition on different levels globally. Using the notions of a periphery, semi-periphery and a core, which are concepts of the [[world system theory]], de Swaan relates them to the four levels present in the hierarchy of the global language system: peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

De Swaan also argues that the greater the range of potential uses and users of a language, the higher the tendency of an individual to move up the hierarchy in the global language system and learn a more "central" language. Thus, de Swaan views the learning of [[second language]]s as proceeding up rather than down the hierarchy, in the sense that they learn a language that is on the next level up. For instance, speakers of Catalan, a peripheral language, have to learn Spanish, a [[#Central languages|central language]] to function in their own society, Spain. Meanwhile, speakers of Persian, a central language, have to learn Arabic, a [[#Supercentral languages|supercentral language]], to function in their region. On the other hand, speakers of a supercentral language have to learn the [[#Hypercentral languages|hypercentral language]] to function globally, as is evident from the huge number of non-native English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Vivian|title=Second language learning and language teaching|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ma0uAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Second+Language+Learning+and+Language+Teaching+Fourth+Edition&amp;ots=uXerrKESf8&amp;sig=In7biboNQq0s5b_8fPB6y9fF4-s#v=onepage&amp;q=Second%20Language%20Learning%20and%20Language%20Teaching%20Fourth%20Edition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to de Swaan, languages exist in "constellations" and the global language system comprises a sociological classification of [[language]]s based on their social role for their speakers. The world's languages and multilinguals are connected in a strongly ordered, hierarchical pattern. There are thousands of peripheral or minority languages in the world, each of which are connected to one of a hundred central languages. The connections and patterns between each language is what makes up the global language system. The four levels of language are the peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral languages.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

[[File:Hierarchy of the global language system (adapted from de Swaan, 2001).jpg|thumb|This flowchart depicts the hierarchy of the languages in de Swaan's (2001) global language system theory.]]

====Peripheral languages====
At the lowest level, peripheral languages, or [[minority languages]], form the majority of languages spoken in the world; 98% of the world's languages are peripheral languages and spoken by less than 10% of the world’s population. Unlike central languages, these are "languages of conversation and narration rather than reading and writing, of memory and remembrance rather than record".&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt; They are used by native speakers within a particular area and are in danger of becoming extinct with increasing globalisation, which sees more and more speakers of peripheral languages acquiring more central languages in order to communicate with others.

====Central languages====
The next level constitutes about 100 central languages, spoken by 95% of the world's population and generally used in education, media and administration. Typically, they are the 'national' and [[official languages]] of the ruling state. These are the languages of record, and much of what has been said and written in those languages is saved in newspaper reports, minutes and proceedings, stored in archives, included in history books, collections of the 'classics', of folk talks and folk ways, increasingly recorded on electronic media and thus conserved for posterity.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

Many speakers of central languages are [[multilingual]] because they are either native speakers of a peripheral language and have acquired the central language, or they are native speakers of the central language and have learned a supercentral language.

====Supercentral languages====
At the second highest level, 13 supercentral languages are very widely spoken languages that serve as connectors between speakers of central languages: [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hindi]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

These languages often have colonial traces and "were once imposed by a colonial power and after independence continued to be used in politics, administration, law, big business, technology and higher education".&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

====Hypercentral languages====
At the highest level is the language that connects speakers of the supercentral languages. Today, [[English language|English]] is the only example of a hypercentral language as the standard for science, literature, business, and law, as well as being the most widely spoken [[Second language|second language]].

===Pyramid of languages of the world===
[[File:The world language hierarchy (adapted from Graddol, 1997).jpg|thumb|This pyramid illustrates the hierarchy of the world's languages as proposed by Graddol (1997) in his book, 'The future of English? A guide to forecasting the popularity of the English language in the 21st century', published by the British Council.]]

According to [[David Graddol]] (1997), in his book titled ''The Future of English'',  the languages of the world comprise a "hierarchical pyramid", as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maurais |first=Jacques |editor1-last=Maurais |editor1-first=Jacques |editor1link=Jacques Maurais |editor2-last=Morris |editor2-first=Michael A. |title=Languages in a Globalising World|date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |pages=13–36 |chapter=Chapter 2:Towards a new global linguistic order? [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=NZ5LBcUMr28C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=graddol&amp;f=false] |isbn=0-521-82173-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The big languages''': [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]].
* '''Regional languages''' (languages of the [[United Nations]] are marked with asterisk): [[Arabic]]*, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]*, English*, French*, [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]]*, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]*.
* '''National languages''': around 80 languages serving over 180 nation states.
* '''Official languages within nation states''' (and other "safe" languages): around 600 languages worldwide (e.g. [[Marathi language|Marathi]]). 
* '''Local vernacular languages''': the remainder of the world's 6,000+ languages.

===Translation systems===
The global language system is also seen in the international translation process as explained by Johan Heilbron, a historical sociologist: "translations and the manifold activities these imply are embedded in and dependent on a world system of translation, including both the source and the target cultures".&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heilbron|first1=Johan|title=Structure and Dynamics of the World System of Translation|url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/40619/12684038723Heilbron.pdf/Heilbron.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchical relationship between global languages is reflected in the global system for translations. The more "central" a language, the greater is its capability to function as a bridge or vehicular language to facilitate communication between peripheral and semi-central languages.&lt;ref name=Heilbron /&gt;

Heilbron's version of the global system of language in translations has four levels:

'''Level 1''': Hypercentral position — 
English currently holds the largest market share of the global market for translations; 55–60% of all book translations are from English. It strongly dominates the hierarchical nature of book translation system.

'''Level 2''': Central position — 
German and French each hold 10% of the global translation market.

'''Level 3''': Semi-central position — 
There are 7 or 8 languages "neither very central on a global level nor very peripheral",&lt;ref name=Heilbron/&gt; making up 1 to 3% of the world market (like Spanish, Italian and Russian).

'''Level 4''': Peripheral position — 
Languages from which "less than 1% of the book translations worldwide are made", including Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Despite having large populations of speakers, "their role in the translation economy is peripheral as compared to more central languages".&lt;ref name=Heilbron/&gt;

==Acceptance==
According to the [[Google Scholar]] website, de Swaan's book, ''Words of the world: The global language system'', has been cited by 546 other papers, as of 16 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Swaan|first1=Abram|title=Words of the world: The global language system|url=https://scholar.google.com.sg/scholar?q=abram+de+swaan+global+language+system&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5|website=Google Scholar|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have also been several concerns regarding the global language system:

===Importance of Q-value===
Van Parijs (2004)&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2007" /&gt; claimed that 'frequency' or likelihood of contact is adequate as an indicator of language learning and language spread. However, de Swaan (2007) argued that it alone is not sufficient. Rather, the [[#Q-value|Q-value]], which comprises both frequency (better known as prevalence) and 'centrality', helps to explain the spread of (super)central languages, especially former colonial languages in newly independent countries where in which only the elite minority spoke the language initially. Frequency alone would not be able to explain the spread of such languages, but [[#Q-value|Q-value]], which includes centrality, would be able to.

In another paper, Cook and Li (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Vivian |editor-last=Cook |editor-first=Vivian |editor1link= Vivian Cook (academic) |editor2-last=Li |editor2-first=Wei |title=Big Contemporary Applied Linguistics: Language Teaching and Learning, Vol. 1 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2009 |pages=54–74 |chapter=Chapter 3: Language user groups and language teaching [https://books.google.com.sg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_5evAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Contemporary+Applied+Linguistics+cook&amp;ots=glSUNb01Ei&amp;sig=zQc-xnrhpNkI_4iTwlaR51x8L7E#v=onepage&amp;q=swaan&amp;f=false] |isbn=978-0-8264-9680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the ways to categorise language users into various groups. They suggested two theories: one by Siegel (2006) who used 'sociolinguistic settings', which is based on the notion of dominant language, and another one by de Swaan (2001) that used the concept of hierarchy in the global language system. According to them, de Swaan's hierarchy is more appropriate, as it does not imply dominance in power terms. Rather, de Swaan's applies the concepts of geography and function to group languages and hence language users according to the global language system. De Swaan (2001) views the acquisition of [[second language]]s (L2) as typically going up the hierarchy.

However, Cook and Li argues that this analysis is not adequate in accounting for the many groups of L2 users to whom the two areas of territory and function hardly apply. The two areas of territory and function can be associated respectively with the prevalence and centrality of the [[#Q-value|Q-value]]. This group of L2 users typically doez not acquire an L2 going up the hierarchy, such as users in an intercultural marriage or users who come from a particular cultural or ethnic group and wish to learn its language for identity purposes. Thus, Cook and Li argue that de Swaan's theory, though highly relevant, still has its drawbacks in that the concept behind [[#Q-value|Q-value]] is insufficient in accounting for some L2 users.

===Choice of supercentral languages===
There is disagreement as to which languages should be considered more central. The theory states that a language is central if it connects speakers of "a series of central languages". [[Robert Phillipson]] questioned why [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is included as one of the supercentral languages but [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which has more speakers, is not on the list.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillipson|first1=Robert|title=English in Globalization: Three Approaches|journal=Journal of Language, Identity &amp; Education|date=2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=73–78|doi=10.1207/s15327701jlie0301_4|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327701jlie0301_4?journalCode=hlie20#.VDN8XfmSzuw|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inadequate evidence for a system===
Michael Morris argued that while it is clear that there is language hierarchy from the "ongoing interstate competition and power politics", there is little evidence provided that shows that the "global language interaction is so intense and systematic that it constitutes a global language system, and that the entire system is held together by one [[global language]], English". He claimed that de Swaan's case studies demonstrated that hierarchy in different regions of the world but did not show the existence of a system within a region or across regions. The global language system is supposed to be part of the international system but is "notoriously vague and lacking in operational importance"  and therefore cannot be shown to exist.  However, Morris believes that this lack of evidence could be from the lack of global language data and not negligence on de Swaan's part. Morris also believes that any theory on a global system, if later proved, would be much more complex than what is proposed by de Swaan. Questions on how the [[#Hypercentral language|hypercentral language]] English holds together the system must also be answered by such a global language system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|title=Words of the World: The Global Language System by Abram De Swaan|journal=Language in Society|date=Sep 2004|volume=33|issue=4|pages=620–624|jstor=4169377|doi=10.1017/S0047404504334068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory built on inadequate foundations===
Robert Phillipson states that the theory is based on selective theoretical foundations. He claimed that there is a lack of consideration about the effects of [[globalization]], which is especially important when the theory is about a global system: "De Swaan nods occasionally in the direction of linguistic and cultural capital, but does not link this to class or linguistically defined social stratification ([[linguistic discrimination|linguicism]]) or linguistic inequality"  and that "key concepts in the [[sociolinguistics|sociology of language]], language maintenance and [[language shift|shift]], and language spread are scarcely mentioned".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

On the other hand, de Swaan's work in the field of sociolinguistics has been noted by other scholars to be focused on "issues of economic and political sociology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tonkin|first1=Humphrey|title=Abram de Swaan. Words of the World: The Global Language System|journal=Language Problems &amp; Language Planning|date=2005|volume=29|issue=2|pages=201–203|doi=10.1075/lplp.29.2.12ton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "politic and economic patterns",&lt;ref name="LINGUIST List 13.3274"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Augustyn|first1=Prisca|title=Review: Sociolinguistics: De Swaan(2001)|url=http://linguistlist.org/issues/13/13-3274.html|website=http://linguistlist.org/|accessdate=21 October 2014|ref=LINGUIST List 13.3274}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may explain why he makes only 'cautious references to socio-linguistic parameters".&lt;ref name="LINGUIST List 13.3274" /&gt;

'''Glossophilia''' is a love of [[language]], be it [[Foreign language|foreign]] or [[Native language|native]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allwords.com/word-glossophilia.html&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to people with a love for language and the [[Language structure|structure of language]]. Glossophiles also dedicate themselves to the learning of foreign languages and intensely study as many languages as possible. It is not uncommon for glossophiles to be [[Multilingualism|proficient in many languages]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8042">The '''good language learner''' ('''GLL''') studies are a group of [[Scientific method|academic studies]] in the area of [[second language acquisition]] that deal with the [[language learning strategies|strategies]] that good language learners exhibit. The rationale for the studies was that there is more benefit from studying the habits of successful language learners than there is from studying learners who [[interlanguage fossilization|fossilize]] at an early stage or stop studying altogether. It was thought that if the strategies of successful learners could be found, then that knowledge could help learners who were not getting such good results.&lt;ref name="johnson1999"&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original studies were made in the 1970s, but petered out in the 1980s as researchers concentrated on individual learning strategies. &lt;ref name="johnson1999" /&gt; However, some research on the topic has also been carried out in more recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sewell|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main body of GLL research investigated [[language education|language learning]] in [[classroom]] situations. It found that good language learners could not be distinguished on the basis of observable [[behavior]] alone, although [[personality type|personality]] did seem to have an effect. It also found that [[teacher]]s did not treat these learners differently from other students, although they could distinguish good language learners from learners who were not so effective.&lt;ref name="johnson1999" /&gt;

==Original studies==
The first studies in the good language learner tradition were made by Joan Rubin and David Stern, both of which were completed in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rubin|1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stern|1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these studies proposed similar lists of strategies that good language learners use. On the basis of this, a large-scale study was performed at the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] (OISE) which investigated 34 language learners with good learning habits. This study found a list of six different strategies, which were similar to those proposed by Rubin and Stern:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Naiman|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Good language learners find an appropriate style of learning.
# Good language learners involve themselves in the language-learning process.
# Good language learners develop an awareness of language as both system and communication.
# Good language learners pay constant attention to expanding their language knowledge.
# Good language learners develop the second language as a separate system.
# Good language learners take into account the demands that second language learning imposes.

== Later work ==
In spite of the flurry of interest in the GLL in the mid to late 70s, in the 80s and 90s interest moved more in the direction of socio/cultural influences&lt;ref&gt;Especially {{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and individual differences,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, {{harvnb|Skehan|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as developing the concept of communicative competence&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hymes|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; into a communicative approach to language teaching.&lt;ref&gt;For instance {{Harvnb|Widdowson|1978}}; {{Harvnb|Littlewood|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new millennium, Norton and Toohey re-visited the GLL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Norton|Toohey|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their new perspective emphasized the influence of situation, investment and identity on successful language learning.

Seven years later, Griffiths, harking back to Joan Rubin's original title, published "Lessons from Good Language Learners".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Griffiths|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the early work in the GLL field had tended to emphasize the role of strategies, Griffiths' work took a broader view and presented the GLL as a highly complex being involving many different variables, including motivation, age, style, personality, gender, metacognition, autonomy, beliefs, culture and aptitude. In addition, the target variables (including grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, function and skills) and some of the situational factors (including method and error correction practices) which learners must manage if they are to be successful were discussed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15028">In the 1960s, [[linguistics|linguistic]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Charles F. Hockett]] defined a set of features that characterize [[human language]] and set it apart from [[animal communication]]. He called these characteristics the design features of language. Hockett originally believed there to be 13 design features. While [[primate]] communication utilizes the first 9 features, the final 4 features ([[displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], [[productivity (linguistics)|productivity]], [[traditional transmission|cultural transmission]], and [[double articulation|duality]]) are reserved for humans.  Hockett later added prevarication, [[reflexiveness]], and learnability to the list as uniquely human characteristics. He asserted that even the most basic human languages possess these 16 features.

== Charles Hockett ==



Charles Hockett was an American linguist and anthropologist, who lived from 1916 to 2000. Hockett graduated from [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1939, and later taught at both [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and [[Rice University|Rice]]. Hockett made significant contributions to [[structural linguistics]], as well as the study of Native American, Chinese, and Fijian languages.  His work focused on detailed linguistic analysis, particularly [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[phonology]], and on the concepts and tools that facilitated such analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, Suzanne.  Biographical sketch of Charles Hockett. 23 February 2008. Retrieved 12 May 2013 from http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Found/hockettbio&lt;/ref&gt;
Up until the 1950s, language was largely viewed as a social-behavioral phenomenon. Hockett was challenged in this belief by Noam Chomsky, who suggested that language is biologically-based and innately learned.  He believed that humans share a [[universal grammar]] that ties all languages together.  Hockett staunchly opposed this "Chomskyan" concept of the nature of language. However, Hockett is most famous for defining what he called the design features of language, which demonstrate his beliefs about the commonalities between human languages.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Margalit. "Charles Hockett, 84, Linguist With an Anthropological View," The New York Times. 13 November 2000. Retrieved 12 May 2013 from https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/13/arts/charles-hockett-84-linguist-with-an-anthropological-view.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design features of language ==

'''[[Vocal-auditory channel]]'''.
Refers to the idea that speaking/hearing is the mode humans use for language.  When Hockett first defined this feature, it did not take [[sign language]] into account, which reflects the ideology of orality that was prevalent during the time (See, for instance, the argumentation of Christin, 1995) {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}.  This feature has since been modified to include other channels of language, such as tactile-visual or chemical-olfactory.

'''Broadcast transmission and directional reception'''
When humans speak, sounds are transmitted in all directions; however, listeners perceive the direction from which the sounds are coming. Similarly, signers broadcast to potentially anyone within the line of sight, while those watching see who is signing.  This is characteristic of most forms of human and animal communication.

'''Transitoriness'''
Also called rapid fading, transitoriness refers to the idea of temporary quality of language.  Language sounds exist for only a brief period of time, after which they are no longer perceived.  Sound waves quickly disappear once a speaker stops speaking.  This is also true of signs.  In contrast, other forms of communication such as writing and [[Quipu|Inka khipus]] (knot-tying) are more permanent.

[[File:Dfl.jpg|thumb]]

'''Interchangeability'''
Refers to the idea that humans can give and receive identical linguistic signals; humans are not limited in the types of messages they can say/hear. One can say "I am a boy" even if one is a girl.  This is not to be confused with lying (prevarication).  The importance is that a speaker can physically create any and all messages regardless of their truth or relation to the speaker. In other words, anything that one can hear, one can also say.

Not all species possess this feature. For example, in order to communicate their status, [[queen ant]]s produce chemical scents that no other ants can produce (see animal communication below).

'''Total feedback'''
Speakers of a language can hear their own speech and can control and modify what they are saying as they say it. Similarly, signers see, feel, and control their signing.

'''Specialization'''
The purpose of linguistic signals is communication and not some other biological function.  When humans speak or sign, it is generally intentional.

An example of ''non''-specialized communication is dog panting.  When a dog pants, it often communicates to its owner that it is hot or thirsty; however, the dog pants in order to cool itself off. This is a biological function, and the communication is a secondary matter.

'''[[Semanticity]]'''
Specific sound signals are directly tied to certain meanings.

'''[[Arbitrariness]]''' ** languages are generally made up of both arbitrary and iconic symbols.  In spoken languages this takes the form of onomatopoeias.  In English "murmur", in Mandarin "māo" (cat).  In ASL "cup", "me" "up/down", etc.  
There is no intrinsic or logical connection between a sound form (signal) and its meaning.  Whatever name a human language attributes an object is purely arbitrary. The word "car" is nothing like an actual car.  Spoken words are really nothing like the objects they represent.  This is further demonstrated by the fact that different languages attribute very different names to the same object.

Signed languages are transmitted visually and this allows for a certain degree of iconicity. For example, in the [[ASL]] sign HOUSE, the hands are flat and touch in a way that resembles the roof and walls of a house.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. William Vicars.  **This sign can be non-iconic if said house is not shaped like that.  Depicting Verbs (formerly thought to be classifiers and often still are by people who are not up on linguistics) are meant to modify (give more information about) the actual visual appearance or process.  E.g. The sign used for the generic idea of "box" is different from the one used for "PO box" because the latter has specific shapes that often do not conform to other items sharing this label.  The sign and depicting verb for "tree" does not encompass bamboo trees for example.**

American Sign Language University. (n.d.) Retrieved 12 May 2013 from http://lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/h/house.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other signs are not iconic, and the relationship between form and meaning is arbitrary. Thus, while Hockett did not account for the possibility of non-arbitrary form-meaning relationships, the principle still generally applies.  

'''[[Digital infinity|Discreteness]]'''
Linguistic representations can be broken down into small discrete units which combine with each other in rule-governed ways. They are perceived categorically, not continuously. For example, English marks number with the plural [[morpheme]] /s/, which can be added to the end of any noun. The plural morpheme is perceived categorically, not continuously: we cannot express smaller or larger quantities by varying how loudly we pronounce the /s/. 

'''[[Displacement (linguistics)|Displacement]]'''
Refers to the idea that humans can talk about things that are not physically present or that do not even exist. Speakers can talk about the past and the future, and can express hopes and dreams. A human's speech is not limited to here and now. Displacement is one of the features that separates human language from other forms of primate communication.

'''[[Productivity (linguistics)|Productivity]]'''
Refers to the idea that language-users can create and understand novel utterances. Humans are able to produce an unlimited amount of utterances. Also related to productivity is the concept of grammatical patterning, which facilitates the use and comprehension of language.  Language is not stagnant, but is constantly changing. New [[idiom]]s are created all the time and the meaning of signals can vary depending on the context and situation.

'''[[Traditional transmission]]'''
Also called cultural transmission.  While humans are born with innate language capabilities, language is learned after birth in a social setting.  Children learn how to speak by interacting with experienced language users. Language and culture are woven together.

'''[[Duality of patterning]]'''
Meaningful messages are made up of distinct smaller meaningful units (words and [[Morpheme|morphemes]]) which themselves are made up of distinct smaller, meaningless units ([[Phoneme|phonemes]]).

'''[[wikt:prevarication|Prevarication]]'''
Prevarication is the ability to lie or deceive.  When using language, humans can make false or meaningless statements.

'''[[Reflexiveness]]'''
Humans can use language to talk about language.

'''[[Language acquisition|Learnability]]'''
Language is teachable and learnable. In the same way as a speaker learns their first language, the speaker is able to learn other languages. It is worth noting that young children learn language with competence and ease; however, language acquisition is constrained by a [[Critical period hypothesis|critical period]] such that it becomes more difficult once children pass a certain age.

== Design features in animal communication ==

Hockett distinguished language from communication.  While almost all animals communicate in some way, a communication system is only considered language if it possesses ''all'' of the above characteristics.  Some animal communication systems are impressively sophisticated.

=== Ants ===

Ants make use of the chemical-olfactory channel of communication. Ants produce chemicals called [[pheromone]]s, which are released through body glands and received by the tips of the antenna.  Ants can produce up to twenty different pheromone scents, each a unique signal used to communicate things such as the location of food and danger, or even the need to defend or relocate the colony. When an ant is killed, it releases a pheromone that alerts others of potential danger. Pheromones also help ants distinguish family members from strangers. The queen ant has special pheromones which she uses to signal her status, orchestrate work, and let the colony know when they need to raise princesses or drones.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical pheromone communication between ants. antARK, 2010. Retrieved 11 May 2013 from http://www.antark.net/ant-life/ant-communication/pheromones.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Ants will even engage in warfare to protect the colony or a food source. This warfare involves tactics that resemble human warfare.  Marauder ants will capture and hold down an enemy while another ant crushes it. Ants are loyal to their colony to the death; however, the queen will kill her own in order to be the last one standing. This level of "planning" among an animal species requires an intricate communication.&lt;ref&gt;Moffett, Mark W. Battles among ants resemble human warfare, ''Scientific American''. 8 January 2012. Retrieved 13 May 2013 from http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ants-and-the-art-of-war&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birds ===

Bird communication demonstrates many features, including the vocal-auditory channel, broadcast transmission/directional reception, rapid fading, semanticity, and arbitrariness. Bird communication is divided into songs and calls. Songs are used primarily to attract mates, while calls are used to alert of food and danger and coordinate movement with the flock.  Calls are acoustically simple, while songs are longer and more complex.&lt;ref&gt;Duhamel, D. (October 2009). Retrieved from http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdcommunication.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bird communication is both discrete and non-discrete. Birds use syntax to arrange their songs, where musical notes act as [[phonemes]]. The order of the notes is important to the meaning of the song, thus indicating that discreteness exists. Bird communication is also continuous in the sense that it utilizes duration and frequency. However, the fact that birds have "phonemes" does not necessarily mean that they can combine them in an infinite way. Birds have a limited number of songs that they can produce.  The male [[indigo bunting]] only has one song, while the [[brown thrasher]] can sing over 2000 songs.&lt;ref&gt;All About Birds: Vocal Development. Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. (n.d.) Retrieved 11 May 2013 from  http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/studying/birdsongs/vocaldev&lt;/ref&gt; Birds even have unique dialects, depending on where they are from.&lt;ref&gt;CJ Kazilek, David Pearson and Pierre Deviche. "Birds and their songs", Ask a Biologist. Arizona State University. (n.d) Retrieved 11 May 2013 from http://askabiologist.asu.edu/explore/birds-and-their-songs&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honeybees ===

Honeybee communication is distinct from other forms of animal communication.  Rather than vocal-auditory, bees use the space-movement channel to communicate. Honeybees use two kinds of dances to communicate—the round dance and the [[waggle dance]].  They use the round dance to communicate that food is 50–75 meters from the hive.  They use the waggle dance when it is farther than this.  To do the waggle dance, a bee moves in a zig-zag line and then does a loop back to the beginning of the line, forming a figure-eight.  The direction of the line points to the food.  The speed of the dance indicates the distance to the food.&lt;ref&gt;Honeybee Communication. 19 March 2012. Retrieved 11 May 2013 from http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/B/BeeDances.html&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, bee dancing is also continuous, rather than discrete.  Their communication is also not arbitrary.  They move in a direction and pattern that physically points out where food is located.

Honeybee dancing also demonstrates displacement, which is generally considered a human characteristic.  Most animals will only give a food-found call in the physical presence of food, yet bees can talk about food that is over 100 meters away.

==Overview ==

Indications are that the [[prevalence]] of upper back and neck pain has increased dramatically in the decade leading up to 2016.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Hoy DG, Protani M, De R, Buchbinder R. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21665126"The epidemiology of neck pain.’'], ''Best Practice &amp; Research: Clinical rheumatology.'', 2010 Dec;24(6):783-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Amy Cuddy, ''Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges'', Little, Brown and Company, December 2015: 226-8. {{ISBN|9780316256575}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase has been attributed to the corresponding widespread adoption of laptop computers, tablets, smartphones and other small portable digital devices.

Because their screens do not separate from their keyboards these small devices cannot be set up [[ergonomically]] correctly (unless an extra screen or extra keyboard is added). They are unlike personal desk top computers (PCs) in this respect. Most commonly, the user hunches to operate them, often for many hours a day.&lt;ref name="simplyhealth1"&gt;[http://newsroom.simplyhealth.co.uk/iposture-generation-facing-a-lifetime-of-back-pain"iPosture generation facing a lifetime of back pain.’'], ''Simply Health.'', 2 October 2013, Retrieved 13 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunching increases the effective load on the neck up to several times more than does erect posture, due to increasing moment arm.&lt;ref&gt;KK Hansraj, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393825"Assessment of stresses in the cervical spine caused by posture and position of the head."],''Surgery Technology International.'', Nov 25, 2014:277-9&lt;/ref&gt; Local pain, [[cervicogenic headache]] and [[referred pain]] extending down the arms can arise from the sustained muscle strain, cervical [[facet joint]] (or apophyseal, or zygapophyseal joint) compression and diminution of the [[Intervertebral disc|cervical]] foraminal nerve exits.

A hunched posture also sends out a body language message of submission and lower self-confidence, with some research indicating it can actually promote these in the person holding it. A comprehensive view of the research and concepts is found in Dr [[Amy Cuddy]]’s book ‘Presence’ (2015).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Treatment may include analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory medications, regular breaks while using the small devices, muscle strengthening and stretching, massage, spinal manipulation and mobilsation, posture instruction and spinal fulcrums. Biomechanical analysis suggests a combination of approaches is best and gives more lasting results.

== Signs and Symptoms ==

In a neck with perfect posture (as seen for instance in young children) the head is balanced above the shoulders. In this position the load on each [[vertebra]] of the cervical spine is spread evenly between the two facet (apophyseal) joints at the back and the [[intervertebral disc]] and vertebral body at the front.

The iHunch is characterised by a posture with the head sitting somewhat forward of the shoulders (i.e., the ear lobe is anterior to a vertical line through the point of the shoulder (acromion process)). This can be very marked, with the back of the skull positioned anterior to the breastbone (sternum). The chin is poked forward.

When the patient is asked to look up at the ceiling, the hunched-forward upper thoracic curve does not change as viewed from the side. Rather, the lower cervical spine ‘hinges’ backward at C5/6/7, a movement pattern known as ‘swan-necking'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eorthopod.com/news/swan-neck-deformity-of-the-cervical-spine/ "Swan Neck Deformity of the Cervical Spine"],''eOrthopod'', Retrieved 24 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

This indicates that the upper back vertebrae have frozen in their habitual flexed positions, with the surrounding collagen of the ligaments, joint capsules and fascia shortening to reinforce this hypomobility. (This is the dowager’s hump of the elderly of earlier generations, now observable in modern (2016) late teenagers.&lt;ref name="medicinenet1"/&gt;)

Symptoms include overuse muscle pain and fatigue along the back of the neck and reaching down to the mid-back, often starting with the upper [[trapezius]] muscle bellies between the shoulders and neck. Cervicogenic headache from the joints and muscle attachments at the top of the neck is common.&lt;ref&gt;Bogduk N, Govind J.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19747657/ "Cervicogenic headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment."],''Lancet Neurol.'', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phil Page [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201065/ "Cervicogenic Headaches: An Evidence-led Approach to Clinical Management"],''International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy.'', Volume 6(3); Sept 2011:254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

The compressive load on the cervical facet joints predisposes to acute joint locking episodes, with pain and movement loss.&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Vangindertael ed. [http://www.physio-pedia.com/Facet_Joint_Syndrome "Facet Joint Syndrome"],''Physiopedia'', June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In older patients with already diminished cervical foramina spaces and/or [[osteophytes]], nerve root irritation and impingement can trigger referred pain down the arm(s).&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Jackson [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881998/"The Classic: The Cervical Syndrome"],'' Clinical Orthopeadics and Related Research'', v.468(7); 2010 Jul: 1739–1745&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

The human spine is well suited to erect upright posture, with the increased heart rate from movement shunting a good blood supply to the muscles. This is clearly not the
case for vast numbers of sedentary humans spending many hours daily bent over laptops, tablets, smartphones and similar. A biomechanical assessment of thoracic hunching shows the abnormal spinal loading and other effects which plausibly account for the recent steep rise in thoracic and cervical pain in step with the ubiquitous adoption of the small IT devices.

Hunching has always caused problems, for instance in occupational groups like dentists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dentaleconomics.com/articles/print/volume-98/issue-7/columns/preventing-pain-in-dentistry/trapezius-myalgia-making-dentistry-a-pain-in-the-neck-mdash-or-head.html/"Trapezius myalgia: making dentistry a pain in the neck — or head''], "Dental Economics, vol 98, issue 8; 2008&lt;/ref&gt; surgeons,&lt;ref&gt;Soueid A1, Oudit D, Thiagarajah S, Laitung G.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9069025"Neck and shoulder symptoms of high school students and associated psychosocial factors."],''The Journal of adolescent health'', 1997 Mar;20(3):238-42.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rheumatoid conditions like [[ankylosing spondylitis]] and neurodegenerative conditions like [[Parkinson’s disease|Parkinson's Disease]] cause characteristic excessive thoracic [[kyphosis]]. What has changed is the amount of hunching in society generally, and especially with the technologically adept young.

== Epidemiology ==

The first [[laptop]] was produced in 1981 but it took more than a decade of development for the designs to approach current (2016) levels of portability and capacity, and hence uptake. Apple produced the first smartphone (the [[iPhone]]) in 2007 and the first tablet (the [[iPad]]) in 2010. In 2015 there were 4.43 billion [[mobile phone]] (cellphone) users in the world, of which 2.6 billion had smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Piejko [https://deviceatlas.com/blog/16-mobile-market-statistics-you-should-know-2016"16 mobile market statistics you should know in 2016"],''Device Atlas'', 12 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, 45% owned a [[tablet computer]] in 2014 and 92% owned a mobile phone; for younger adults aged 18–29, only 2% didn’t own a mobile phone and 50% had tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Anderson [http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/"Technology Device Ownership: 2015"],''Pew Research Centre: Internet, Science and Tech.'', 29 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A large Finnish cross-sectional study on school-age adolescents published in 2012 concluded that more than two hours a day spent on computers was associated with a moderate/severe increase in musculoskeletal pain.&lt;ref&gt;Paula T Hakala, Lea A Saarni, Raija-Leena Punamäki, Marjut A Wallenius, Clas-Håkan Nygård and Arja H Rimpelä [http://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2474-13-41"Musculoskeletal symptoms and computer use among Finnish adolescents - pain intensity and inconvenience to everyday life: a cross-sectional study’'], ''BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders'', 22 March 2012: {{doi|10.1186/1471-2474-13-41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, the average UK 18-24 year-old spent 8.83 hours a day in front of a PC, laptop or tablet.&lt;ref name="simplyhealth1"/&gt; Neck pain per se has been a large problem for a long time, and surveyed repeatedly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; A composite review of studies with good methodology by Fejer et al published in 2006 found that point [[prevalence]] (in pain right now) of neck pain in the adult (15–75 years) population ranged from 5.9% to 22.2%, with one study of the elderly (65+ years) finding 38.7% were in pain when surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Fejer R1, Kyvik KO, Hartvigsen J [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15999284"The prevalence of neck pain in the world population: a systematic critical review of the literature."],''European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society'', 2006 Jun;15(6)):834-48&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, more urban populations had more neck pain, e.g. 22.2% of a large 1998 Canadian study had neck pain when surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;Côté P, Cassidy JD, Carroll L. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9704377"The prevalence of neck pain and related disability in Saskatchewan adults"],''Spine'',1998 Aug 1;23(15):1689-98&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on these surveys of neck pain prevalence, and adding to them the prevalence of thoracic pain and cervicogenic headache, it is reasonable to estimate that around one adult in six (15%) probably has pain in any, some or all of those areas right now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healingartsce.com/ebpneckpain.html “Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain”],''Healing Arts Continuing Education'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However the published [[epidemiological]] papers draw on raw data from surveys done at least 10 years ago, and there are indications that the numbers have been rising dramatically since then – as rapidly as the adoption of laptops, tablets and smartphones. This is reflected in the recent rise in the number of popular articles, news items and media discussions about the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=11531042"Smartphone addiction creating generation of teenage hunchbacks”],''New Zealand Herald'', Sunday Oct 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa Navarro [http://www.techtimes.com/articles/115913/20151215/blame-your-iphone-for-ruining-your-posture-and-your-mood.htm"Blame Your iPhone For Ruining Your Posture And Your Mood”],''TECHTIMES'', 15 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen August [http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/saturday/audio/2576611/steve-august-the-ihunch"Steve August: the iHunch”],''Saturday Morning: Radio New Zealand'', 16 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathogenesis ==

The iHunch is a multi-factorial problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodystance.co.nz/ihunch.php “The iHunch analysed”], Retrieved 24 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

* Thoracic hunching requires flexing of the thoracic facet joints. After sufficient time and load, they can freeze and lock in this position. The [[collagen]] of the surrounding [[ligaments]], [[fascia]] and [[joint capsules]] will shorten down around the immobile joints, reinforcing the hunched hypomobile section of spine.
* The middle back support muscles ([[erector spinae]], [[rhomboid muscles|rhomboids]], middle and lower trapezius fibres, etc.) become stretched out and weak.
* The cantilevered (poked forward) head position loads the spine up to several times more than erect posture, because of the increased moment arm.&lt;ref&gt;Hansraj KK. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393825"Assessment of stresses in the cervical spine caused by posture and position of the head”],''Surgical Technology International'', 2014 Nov;25::277-9&lt;/ref&gt; So the posterior neck muscles (especially the upper fibres of trapezius) holding the head in its forward position, often sustained for many hours, can strain, producing individual [[myofibril]] and cell damage. Repair of this microtrauma involves the laying down of adhesive [[fibrosis]], as a normal part of the [[inflammatory response]]. Adhesive fibrosis is relatively non-elastic, so after sufficient repeated [[microtrauma]] from muscle strain, the posterior neck muscles become strained, shortened and less elastic.
* In this same cantilevered head position, the [[longus colli]] muscles and other deep neck flexors around the front of the neck are hardly being used, so they become weak, allowing the chin to poke out.
* The combined effect of all the above in the cantilevered head position, with the chin poked out, is to compress every facet joint in the cervical spine. This predisposes to acute locking episodes. At the top of the cervical spine, this often manifests as cervicogenic headache, with pain referring over the head from the C0/1, C1/2, and/or C2/3 joints, and from the insertion of the upper trapezius fibres onto the [[nuchal line]] of the [[occiput]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogduk N, Govind J.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19747657"Cervicogenic headache: an assessment of the evidence on clinical diagnosis, invasive tests, and treatment.”], ''The Lancet. Neurology'', 2009 Oct;8(10):959-68&lt;/ref&gt; In older patients, especially with osteophytes and/or where the [[intervertebral foramina]] are already diminished, this compression and further reduction of the foraminal spaces can result in irritation and impingement of the nerve roots, referring pain some distance down the arm(s).

== Treatment ==

[[Neck pain]] generally has been treated with a profusion of approaches and modalities, including [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen; pain relief medications ([[analgesics]]) such as acetaminophen; low dose tricyclic [[antidepressants]] such as amytriptyline for chronic problems; [[Physical therapy]] (a.k.a. physiotherapy in British-derived cultures) which utilises a wide range of techniques and modalities; spinal manipulation from [[osteopaths]], [[chiropractors]], manipulating physiotherapists and doctors; massage; muscle strengthening programmes including gyms and [[Pilates]]; postural approaches such as the [[Feldenkrais Method]] and the [[Alexander Technique]]; stretching approaches such as [[yoga]]; ergonomic approaches including setting up desk top computers correctly and frequent breaks; [[acupuncture]]; and surgery for severe structural problems such as osteophytic impingement on the cervical nerve roots and [[cervical disc herniation]].

A biomechanical analysis of the iHunch indicates its standard, logical development from much flexed activity and its multi-factorial character. (See '''Pathogenesis''')

A composite approach which covers each component of the problem is therefore likely to be most successful and lasting. Most of the general treatment approaches to neck pain cover only one aspect. A logical response should include as a minimum:

* Strengthening, especially of (1) the middle and lower back support muscles and scapula retractors, and (2) the longus colli and the deep neck flexor muscles.&lt;ref name="healingartsce1"&gt;[http://healingartsce.com/massageneckpainpg3.html “Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain”], ‘’Healing Arts Continuing Education’’, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stretching, especially of the upper fibres of the trapezius muscle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healingartsce.com/massageneckpainpg3.htmll “Evidence-Based Practice in the Treatment of Neck Pain”], ‘’Healing Arts Continuing Education’’, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Massage, to loosen adhesive fibrotic tethering of the posterior neck and upper trapezius muscles.&lt;ref name="healingartsce1"/&gt;
* Unlocking of the hypomobile (frozen) facet joints of the thoracic spine and stretching of the shortened collagen reinforcing the excessive kyphosis (hunch). A sufficiently tight patch of thoracic spine cannot be freed up solely by patient exercises, stretches or movements. This is due to leverage – with any general exercise, the segments of the spine that are moving well will tend to move more, reducing the leverage on the hypomobile segments. A sufficiently localised external force is then necessary, such as specific hands-on spinal mobilisation or manipulation. A randomized clinical trial by Cleland et al showed manipulation of the thoracic spine reduced neck pain immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland JA, Childs JD, McRae M, Palmer JA, Stowell T. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15922233"Immediate effects of thoracic manipulation in patients with neck pain: a randomized clinical trial.”], ''Manual Therapy'', 2005 May;10(2):127-35&lt;/ref&gt;
* However unless the surrounding shortened collagen also receives sufficient stretching, collagen rebound will tend to freeze up the facet joint again rapidly. Collagen is stronger by weight than steel wire and is best stretched by a sufficiently long, strong, localised, passive stretch.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A Fisher [http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ce-Co/Collagen.html"Chemistry Explained Collagen”], ''Chemistry Encyclopedia'', Retrieved 24 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In practical terms this may be achieved by the hunched patient lying back on a spinal fulcrum device, which uses the upper body weight to provide the external force, localised over the fulcrum.

'''Language''' is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of [[communication]], particularly the [[human]] ability to do so&lt;!--Do not remove the qualifier "human" without first reading the article or consulting the discussions about this issue.--&gt;; and '''a language''' is any specific example of such a system.

The scientific study of language is called [[linguistics]]. Questions concerning the [[philosophy of language]], such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] have argued that language originated from [[emotion]]s while others like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].

Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and [[dialect]]s. [[Natural language]]s are [[speech|spoken]] or [[sign language|signed]], but any language can be [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoded]] into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]&amp;nbsp;– for example, in [[Whistled language|whistling]], [[sign language|signed]], or [[braille]]. This is because human language is [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]-independent. Depending on [[philosophy of language|philosophical perspectives]] regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the [[cognitive]] ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of [[semiosis]] to relate [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] to particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. [[Oral language|Oral]], [[sign language|manual]] and tactile languages contain a [[phonology|phonological]] system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or [[morpheme]]s, and a [[syntax|syntactic]] system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.

Human language has the properties of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of [[animal communication]]. Language is thought to have originated when early [[hominin]]s started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a [[Theory of mind|theory of other minds]] and a shared [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Chomsky|Fitch|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the [[human brain]], but especially in [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Humans [[language acquisition|acquire]] language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human [[culture]]. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[social stratification]], as well as [[social grooming]] and [[entertainment]].

Languages [[language change|evolve]] and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] by [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparing]] modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a [[language family]]. The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hindi]]; the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]] includes [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]] and the other [[Chinese language]]s, and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]; the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic family]] includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the [[Bantu languages]] include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout [[Africa]]; and the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] include [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the [[Pacific]]. The languages of the [[Dravidian language|Dravidian family]], spoken mostly in Southern India, include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become [[Language death|extinct]] by the year 2100.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Philosophy of language}}
The English word ''language'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s}}'' "tongue, speech, language" through [[Latin]] ''lingua'', "language; tongue", and [[Old French]] ''[[wikt:language#Old French|language]]''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=language |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=3rd|year=1992|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to refer to [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, and other kinds of [[constructed language|artificially constructed communication systems]] such as formally defined computer languages used for [[programming language|computer programming]]. Unlike conventional human languages, a [[formal language]] in this sense is a [[system]] of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] for [[encoding]] and decoding [[information]]. This article specifically concerns the properties of [[Natural language|natural human language]] as it is studied in the discipline of [[linguistics]].

As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "[[French language|French]]". The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word ''langage'' for language as a concept, ''[[langue and parole|langue]]'' as a specific instance of a language system, and ''parole'' for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Lyons2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="LyonsIntro"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="TraskLanguage"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.{{sfn|Bett|2010}}

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world&amp;nbsp;– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the [[linguistic turn]] and philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.{{sfn|Devitt|Sterelny|1999}}

===Mental faculty, organ or instinct===
One definition sees language primarily as the [[mind|mental faculty]] that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the [[human brain]]. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, [[creole languages]] and spontaneously developed sign languages such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely [[innatism|innate]], for example, in [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]], or American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]'s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a [[cognitive science]] framework and in [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Fitch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal symbolic system===
Another definition sees language as a [[formal system]] of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed [[structural linguistics|structural systems]] consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=93}} This [[structuralism|structuralist]] view of language was first introduced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name="Saussure"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Saussure|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is [[Noam Chomsky]], the originator of the [[generative linguistics|generative theory of grammar]], who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=130}} Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in [[formal logic]], in [[formal grammar|formal]] [[theoretical linguistics|theories of grammar]], and in applied [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=93, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|1998|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other [[formal logic]]ians.

===Tool for communication===
[[File:ASL family.jpg|right|thumb|A conversation in [[American Sign Language]]]]
Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. [[Functional theories of grammar]] explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Valin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of language is associated with the study of language in [[pragmatics|pragmatic]], [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]], and interactive frameworks, as well as in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of [[linguistic typology]], or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of [[grammaticalization]] tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as [[J.L. Austin]], [[Paul Grice]], [[John Searle]], and [[Willard van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]].{{sfn|Nerlich|2010|p=192}}

===Unique status of human language===
{{main|Animal language|Great ape language}}

A number of features, many of which were described by [[Charles Hockett]] and called [[Hockett's design features|design features]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |title=The Problem of Universals in Language |last=Hockett |first=Charles F. |date=1966 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110023354/http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2013-05-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; set human language apart from other known systems of communication, such as those used by non-human [[Animal language|animals]].

Communication systems used by other animals such as [[Bee learning and communication|bees]] or [[great ape language|apes]] are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hockett|1960}}; {{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human language is open-ended and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).&lt;ref name="Trask5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]], is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Crane |first2=Jodie S.|last3=Savage |first3=James L.|last4=Russel |first4=Andrew F. |last5=Townsend |first5=Simon W. |date=29 June 2015 |title=Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=13|issue=6|pages=e1002171|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171|pmid=26121619 |pmc=4488142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Ridley |first2=Amanda R.|last3=Townsend |first3=Simon W. |date=20 July 2017 |title=Element repetition rates encode functionally distinct information in pied babbler 'clucks' and 'purrs' |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=953–60|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1114-6|pmid=28730513|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/89798/7/WRAP-element-repetition-rates-encode-functionally-Townsend-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a [[bonobo]] named [[Kanzi]] learned to express itself using a set of symbolic [[lexigram]]s. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] reportedly uses as many as 1000 words in [[American Sign Language]], and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]; {{harvcoltxt|Candland|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ [[grammatical categories|grammatical and semantic categories]], such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"/&gt; Human language is also unique in having the property of [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursivity]]: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]&lt;/nowiki&gt;") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I see [the dog is running]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;").&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as ''modality independent''. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas [[sign language]]s and writing use the visual modality, and [[braille]] writing uses the tactile modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=165–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called ''[[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]'', and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of [[bee]]s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.&lt;ref name="Trask5"/&gt;

Oil on board, 1563.&lt;br&gt;Humans have speculated about the origins of language throughout history. The [[Christian mythology|Biblical myth]] of the [[Tower of Babel]] is one such account; other cultures have different stories of how language arose.&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;
}}
Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on the generative view of language pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]] see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ulbaek|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky is one prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"/&gt; He suggests that for scholars interested in the nature of language, "talk about the evolution of the language capacity is beside the point."{{sfn|Chomsky|1972|p=86}} Chomsky proposes that perhaps "some random mutation took place [...] and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}} Though cautioning against taking this story literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}}

Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], hold the precedents to be [[animal cognition]],&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt; whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], see it as having developed from [[animal communication]] in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 2008"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from [[music]], a view already espoused by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]].{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=466–507}} [[Stephen R. Anderson|Stephen Anderson]] states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered&amp;nbsp;... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because language emerged in the early [[prehistory]] of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a [[larynx]] capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=250–92}}

It was mostly undisputed that pre-human [[australopithecine]]s did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in [[great ape]]s in general. However, a 2017 study on [[Origin of language#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]] challenges this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus  and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101–21 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago.

{{main|Linguistics|History of linguistics}}
The study of language, [[linguistics]], has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in [[India]] more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdisciplines===
The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, [[descriptive linguistics]] examines the grammar of single languages, [[theoretical linguistics]] develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, [[sociolinguistics]] studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, [[neurolinguistics]] studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, [[computational linguistics]] builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and [[historical linguistics]] relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
The formal study of language is often considered to have started in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. However, [[Sumer]]ian scribes already studied the differences between [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century AD, the French [[Port-Royal Grammar]]ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by British [[philologist]] and expert on ancient India [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1914|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.&lt;ref name="Saussure"/&gt;

By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|Langue-parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue''), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clarke|1990|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary linguistics===
In the 1960s, [[Noam Chomsky]] formulated the [[Generative linguistics|generative theory of language]]. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]]; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, [[Functional theories of grammar|functional theories of language]] propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. [[Formal grammar|Formal theories of grammar]] seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation"; {{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of [[cognitive linguistics]] interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|Cruse|2004|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech==
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=11–14, 105–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[genetics|genetic]] bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is [[FOXP2]], which may cause a kind of [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|congenital language disorder]] if affected by [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fisher|Lai|Monaco|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
{{main|Neurolinguistics|Language processing in the brain}}
[[File:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green, and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]] The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref name="Lesser205"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lesser|1989|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is [[Wernicke's area]], which is in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop [[receptive aphasia]], a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax|sentence structure]]. The second area is [[Broca's area]], in the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop [[expressive aphasia]], meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, [[word repetition]], and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|p=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[electrophysiology]] to study language processing in individuals without impairments.&lt;ref name="Lesser205"/&gt;

Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce [[sound]], which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the [[ear drum]]. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box ([[larynx]]), and the upper vocal tract&amp;nbsp;– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental and suprasegmental]] elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[phonation]] type, voice [[timbre]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], all of which may have effects across multiple segments.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consonant]]s and [[vowel]] segments combine to form [[syllable]]s, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. [[Acoustics|Acoustically]], these different segments are characterized by different [[formant]] structures, that are visible in a [[spectrogram]] of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; Vowels are called ''[[Close vowel|close]]'' when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel {{ipa|[i]}} (English "ee"), or ''[[open vowel|open]]'' when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel {{ipa|[a]}} (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as {{ipa|[u]}} (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are [[Roundedness|rounded]] as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between {{ipa|[i]}} (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and {{ipa|[y]}} ([[rounded front vowel]] such as German "ü").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, [[alveolar ridge]], [[palate]], [[Soft palate|velum]], [[uvula]], or [[glottis]]. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by [[manner of articulation]], or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called ''[[occlusive]]'' or ''[[stop consonant|stop]]'', or different degrees of aperture creating ''[[fricative]]s'' and ''[[approximant consonant|approximants]]''. Consonants can also be either ''[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced or unvoiced]]'', depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English {{ipa|[s]}} in ''bus'' ([[sibilant|unvoiced sibilant]]) from {{ipa|[z]}} in ''buzz'' ([[Voiced alveolar sibilant#Voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced sibilant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called ''[[Nasal consonant|nasals]]'' or ''[[Nasalization|nasalized]]'' sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called ''[[Lateral consonant|laterals]]'', because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called ''[[rhotics]]'') that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
When described as a system of [[symbolic communication]], language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]], and a [[code (semiotics)|code]] connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of [[semiosis]], how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [[semiotics]]. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at [[Thanjavur]]]]
Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"/&gt;

The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called [[syntax]] or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=218–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
{{main|Semantics|Semiotics|Meaning (linguistics)}}
Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

Thus, languages must have a [[vocabulary]] of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species ''[[Canis familiaris]]''. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the [[lexicon]], and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a [[lexeme]]. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages contain the semantic structure of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]]: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign [[truth value]]s to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"/&gt;

===Sounds and symbols===

Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Goldsmith|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"/&gt;

Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called [[minimal pair]]. In English, for example, the words ''bat'' {{ipa|[bæt]}} and ''pat'' {{ipa|[pʰæt]}} form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated and non-aspirated]] pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Hindi]] do: the unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''spin'' {{ipa|[spɪn]}} and the aspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''pin'' {{ipa|[pʰɪn]}} are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called [[allophones]]), whereas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words {{ipa|[pʰá]}} 'crouch' and {{ipa|[pá]}} 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).&lt;ref name="Trask214"/&gt;

All [[oral language|spoken languages]] have phonemes of at least two different categories, [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], that can be combined to form [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[Vowel length|duration]], and [[tonal language|tone]] to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called [[suprasegmental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Pirahã language]] with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like [[Taa language#Phonology|Taa]] may have as many as 141 phonemes.&lt;ref name="Trask214"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s, [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|the equivalent to phonemes]] (formerly called [[chereme]]s) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C. (1960). ''Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf,'' Studies in linguistics: Occasional papers (No. 8). Buffalo: Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University of Buffalo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg (1965). ''A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles.'' Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|pp=539–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writing system]]s represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The [[Latin alphabet]] (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the [[Inuktitut]] syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In [[logographic]] scripts, each sign represents an entire word,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.

Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the [[Arabic script]]), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coulmas|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
{{main|Grammar}}
Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called ''[[morpheme]]s'' within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be ''free'' or ''bound''. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called ''[[word]]s'', and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called [[affix]]es. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called ''syntax''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grammatical categories====
{{main|Grammatical category}}
Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Allerton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically [[morphosyntactic alignment|distinguishing between their relations]] to a predicate, the encoding of [[Grammatical tense|temporal]] and [[Preposition and postposition|spatial]] relations on predicates, and a system of [[grammatical person]] governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Word classes====
Languages organize their [[parts of speech]] into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called [[noun]]s. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called [[verb]]s. Another common category is the [[adjective]]: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], while nouns are used as [[argument]]s of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called [[transitivity (grammar)|''intransitive'']], while a predicate that can take two arguments is called [[transitive verb|''transitive'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] like "and" that serve to join two sentences, [[article (grammar)|articles]] that introduce a noun, [[interjections]] such as "wow!", or [[ideophones]] like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the general noun classifier for humans is ''nin'' (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Senft|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''san-nin no gakusei'' (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student"&amp;nbsp;— three students
For trees, it would be:
:''san-bon no ki'' (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree"&amp;nbsp;— three trees

====Morphology====
In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several [[morpheme]]s. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aronoff|Fudeman|2011|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or [[affix]]es can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: ''[[prefix]]es'' precede the root, [[suffix]]es follow the root, and [[infix]]es are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ''[[ablaut]]''. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of [[inflection]], which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bauer|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Haspelmath|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called [[Isolating language|isolating]], or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word ''bonus'', or "good", consists of the root ''bon-'', meaning "good", and the suffix -''us'', which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and [[nominative]] case. These languages are called ''[[fusional languages]]'', because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are [[agglutinative languages]] which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], where for example, the word ''evlerinizden'', or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ''ev-ler-iniz-den'' with the meanings ''house-plural-your-from''. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called [[polysynthetic languages]]. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in [[Persian language|Persian]] the single word ''nafahmidamesh'' means ''I didn't understand it'' consisting of morphemes ''na-fahm-id-am-esh'' with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq'', which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]''. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective ''bonus'', or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''ikusi nauzu'', or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb ''n-au-zu'' (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the ''n''- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the – ''zu'' suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntax====
{{main|Syntax}}
[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the phrase, "on the mat" is a [[locative (case)|locative]] phrase, and "sat" is the core of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].]]

Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The prefixed asterisk * conventionally indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical, i.e. syntactically incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baker|2001|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in [[Latin language|Latin]], both ''Dominus servos vituperabat'' and ''Servos vituperabat dominus'' mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because ''servos'', or "slaves", is in the [[accusative case]], showing that they are the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] of the sentence, and ''dominus'', or "master", is in the [[nominative case]], showing that he is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of [[Wh-movement|inverse word order in questions]], which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing [[focus (linguistics)|special emphasis]] on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called [[phrase]]s, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.{{sfn|Baker|2001|pp=269–70}} To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=218–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"/&gt; There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;

===Typology and universals===
{{Main|Linguistic typology|Linguistic universal}}

Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1992}};{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic [[word order]], the relative order of the [[verb]], and its constituents in a normal indicative [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In English, the basic order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] would be ''d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy'' (snake man bit), [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name="CroftErg"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of [[prepositions]] or [[postpositions]]. Such correlations are called [[Linguistic universals|implicational universals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]] type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009|p=45}}; {{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the [[Nominative–absolutive language|nominative-accusative]] word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun ''I''. Some languages, called [[Ergativity|ergative]], Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.&lt;ref name="CroftErg"/&gt; In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the [[Tripartite language|tripartite type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;

==Social contexts of use and transmission==
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|The [[Wall of Love]] in [[Paris]], where the phrase "I love you" is featured in 250 languages of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.travelfranceonline.com/wall-of-love-mur-des-je-taime-montmartre/|title=Wall of Love&amp;nbsp;– Mur des Je t'aime&amp;nbsp;– Montmartre|publisher=Travel France Online|accessdate = 30 November 2014|date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on [[speech community|communities of speakers]] in which children [[language acquisition|learn language]] from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to [[communicate]] and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.&lt;ref name="Myths"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Evans|Levinson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to [[language contact]]. The process is similar to the process of [[evolution]], where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of [[diffusion]], as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their [[first language]] or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming [[endangered language|endangered]] as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage and meaning===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called [[deixis]], which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=54–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called [[speech act]]s, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=226–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called [[conversational implicature]]s. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring [[communicative competence]] in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=100–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
{{main|Language acquisition|Second-language acquisition|Second language|Language education}}
All healthy, [[Human development (biology)|normally developing]] human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring [[sign language|sign]] or [[oral language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bonvillian |first1=John D. |author2=Michael D. Orlansky |author3=Leslie Lazin Novack |title=Developmental milestones: Sign language acquisition and motor development |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=December 1983 |pages=1435–45 |doi=10.2307/1129806|pmid=6661942 |jstor=1129806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt;

First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. Around six months of age, a child will begin [[babbling]], producing the speech sounds or [[handshape]]s of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average [[vocabulary]] of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 [[word]]s. A child's first [[utterance]]s are [[Holophrasis|holophrases]] (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce [[telegraphic speech]], or short sentences that are less [[Grammar|grammatically]] complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.&lt;ref name="OGrady-Cho"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Grady |first1=William |last2=Cho |first2=Sook Whan |chapter=First language acquisition |title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=fourth |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennison"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kennison|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn [[fetus]]es are capable of language acquisition to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;"First Impressions: We start to pick up words, food preferences and hand-eye coordination long before being born", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 1 (July 2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Skwarecki, "Babies Learn to Recognize Words in the Womb", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 26 August 2013 [http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/08/babies-learn-recognize-words-womb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Macaro|editor-first1=Ernesto| year=2010 | title=Continuum companion to second language acquisition|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9922-5|pages=137–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
{{see also|Culture#Language_and_culture|l1=Culture|Speech community}}
[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (c. 1935)]]
Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]], and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists use the term "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Agha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between [[social class]]es, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dixon|1972|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social [[deixis]]", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=311–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt;

===Writing, literacy and technology===
{{main|Writing|Literacy}}
[[File:Winnipeg Forks - Plains Cree Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An inscription of [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], an [[abugida]] developed by Christian missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages]]
Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called [[writing systems]].

The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and [[formal education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Olson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]]. A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"/&gt;

===Change===
{{main|Language change|Grammaticalization}}
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first page of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', written in [[Old English]] in the early medieval period (800–1100 AD). Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.]]
All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire [[Phonological change|phonological system]]. [[Sound change]] can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''conditioned'' in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be ''sporadic'', affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a [[chain shift]] in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the [[Germanic languages]] when the sound change known as [[Grimm's law]] affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *{{PIE|bʰ}} became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *{{PIE|b}} in turn became /p/, and the previous *{{PIE|p}} became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why [[Italic languages]] such as Latin have ''p'' in words like '''''p'''ater'' and '''''p'''isces'', whereas Germanic languages, like English, have '''''f'''ather'' and '''''f'''ish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clackson|2007|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin ''mea domina'' to eventually become the [[French language|French]] ''madame'' and American English ''ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as [[idiom]]s or particular constructions become [[grammaticalized]]. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]] the final /s/ has eroded away. Since [[Standard Spanish]] uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the [[grammatical person|second person]] subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun ''tú''. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ''¿como te llamas?'' {{ipa|[ˈkomo te ˈjamas]}} in Standard Spanish, but {{ipa|[ˈkomo ˈtu te ˈjama]}} in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zentella|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. ''I'm gonna'').

Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] towards more common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with [[Language ideology|ideologies]], and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact===
{{main|language contact}}
One important source of language change is contact and resulting [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] interact on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] is likely to have been the norm throughout [[human history]] and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the [[Nation state|ethno-national state]], monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Romaine|2001|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of [[Sprachbund|language areas]] in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the [[Balkan language area]], the [[Mesoamerican language area]], and the [[Ethiopian language area]]. Also, larger areas such as [[South Asia]], Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including [[language convergence]], [[loanword|borrowing]], and [[relexification]] (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new [[mixed language]]s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called [[pidgins]] occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a [[creole language]]. An example of such mixed languages is [[Tok Pisin]], the official language of [[Papua New-Guinea]], which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and [[Austronesian languages]]; others are [[Haitian Creole|Kreyòl ayisyen]], the French-based creole language spoken in [[Haiti]], and [[Michif language|Michif]], a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Matras|Bakker|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[SIL Ethnologue]]'' defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and [[dialects]]. As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' cataloged 7,097 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ethnologue'' establishes linguistic groups based on studies of [[mutual intelligibility]], and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the [[Danish language]] that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]]) by the ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

According to the ''Ethnologue'', 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the ''Ethnologue'' (2009 figures).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages and dialects===
{{main|Dialect#Dialect or language}}
[[File:Novi Sad mayor office.jpg|thumb|[[Multilingualism|Multi-lingual]] sign outside the [[mayor]]'s office in [[Novi Sad]], written in the four official languages of the city: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]]]
There is no [[Language or dialect|clear distinction]] between a language and a [[dialect]], notwithstanding a famous [[aphorism]] attributed to linguist [[Max Weinreich]] that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]".&lt;ref name="5 minute linguist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickerson |first=E.M. |title=What's the difference between dialect and language? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |work=The Five Minute Linguist |publisher=College of Charleston |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219070627/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Before the [[Yugoslav civil war]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was considered a single language with two dialects, but now [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive [[writing system]]s, or degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language families of the world===
{{Main|Language family|Dialectology|Historical linguistics|List of language families}}
[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see ''[[:Template:Distribution of languages in the world|Distribution of languages in the world]]''.]]
The world's languages can be grouped into [[Language family|language families]] consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of [[language isolate]]s: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are [[Basque language|Basque]], spoken in Europe, [[Zuni language|Zuni]] of [[New Mexico]], [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] of Mexico, [[Ainu language|Ainu]] of Japan, [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] of [[Pakistan]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Katzner"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Katzner|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the [[Indo-European languages]], spoken by 46% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}, "[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]"&lt;/ref&gt; This family includes major world languages like [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the [[Eurasia]]n [[Migration Period]] (c. 400–800 AD),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and subsequently through the [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]], which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the [[Americas]] and much of [[Africa]]. The [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] are spoken by 20%&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], and hundreds of smaller languages.&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Brown|Ogilvie|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language family]], which includes such languages as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; A similar number of people speak the [[Afroasiatic languages]], which include the populous [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language]], and the languages of the [[Sahara]] region, such as the [[Berber languages]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]].&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from [[Madagascar]] to [[maritime Southeast Asia]] all the way to [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; It includes such languages as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Maori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and many of the indigenous languages of [[Indonesia]] and [[Formosan languages|Taiwan]]. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[South Asia]] (among them [[Kannada language|Kannada]] [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (among them [[Khmer language|Khmer]]), and [[Tai–Kadai languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]] (including [[Thai language|Thai]]).&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[West Africa]], and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the [[Quechumaran languages|Quechumaran]], [[Arawak languages|Arawak]], and [[Tupi-Guarani languages|Tupi-Guarani]] families of South America, the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], and [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] of [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language families of [[North America]]. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan family]], whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name="Katzner"/&gt;

===Language endangerment===
{{main|Endangered language|Language loss|Language shift|Language death|}}
[[File:Linguistic diversity.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Together, the eight countries in red contain more than 50% of the world's languages. The areas in blue are the most linguistically diverse in the world, and the locations of most of the world's endangered languages.]]
[[endangered language|Language endangerment]] occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or [[language shift|shift]] to speaking another language. [[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a ''[[dead language]]''. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an ''[[extinct language]]''. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of [[globalization]] and [[neo-colonialism]], where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Moseley|2010}}: "[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php Statistics]"&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|top 20 languages]], those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often [[Speaker types|semi-speakers]]). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common ''[[lingua franca]]'', such as English or [[Esperanto]], there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the [[tower of Babel]] in the [[Old Testament]], that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Haugen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav]] and [[American Civil War]], or the genocide of [[Rwanda]], whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted [[Language policy|specific legislation]] to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]]. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6644">A '''language code''' is a [[code]] that assigns letters or numbers as identifiers or classifiers for [[language]]s.  These codes may be used to organize library collections or presentations of data, to choose the correct localizations and translations in computing, and as a shorthand designation for longer forms of language-name.

== Difficulties of classification ==
Language code schemes attempt to classify the complex world of human languages, dialects, and variants. Most schemes make some compromises between being general and being complete enough to support specific dialects.

For example, most people in Central America and South America speak Spanish.  Spanish spoken in Mexico will be slightly different from Spanish spoken in Peru.  Different regions of Mexico will have slightly different dialects and accents of Spanish.  A language code scheme might group these all as "Spanish" for choosing a keyboard layout, most as "Spanish" for general usage, or separate each dialect to allow region-specific idioms.

== Common schemes ==

Some common language code schemes include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11094">Many countries have a '''language policy''' designed to favor or discourage the use of a particular [[language]] or set of languages. Although nations historically have used language policies most often to promote one [[official language]] at the expense of others, many countries now have policies designed to protect and promote 
regional and ethnic languages whose viability is threatened. Indeed, whilst the existence of [[Minority language|linguistic minorities]] within their jurisdiction has often been considered to be a potential threat to internal cohesion, States also understand that providing language rights to minorities may be more in their long term interest, as a means of gaining citizens' trust in the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Arzoz, X., 'The Nature of Language Rights'. Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe (2007): 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language policy is what a government does either officially through [[legislation]], court decisions or policy to determine how languages are used, cultivate language skills needed to meet national priorities or to establish the rights of individuals or groups to use and maintain languages. The scope of language policy varies in practice from State to State. This may be explained by the fact that language policy is often based on contingent historical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at page 23&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, States also differ as to the degree of explicitness with which they implement a given language policy. The French [[Toubon Law|Toubon]] law is a good example of explicit language policy. The same may be said for the [[Charter of the French Language|Charter]] of the French Language in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Jeught, S., EU Language Law (2015), Europa Law Publishing: Groningen, 15 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The preservation of [[cultural diversity|cultural]] and [[linguistic diversity]] in today's world is a major concern to many scientists, artists, writers, politicians, leaders of linguistic communities, and defenders of [[linguistic human rights]]. More than half of the 6000 languages currently spoken in the world are estimated to be in danger of disappearing during the 21st century. Many factors affect the existence and usage of any given human language, including the size of the native speaking population, its use in formal communication, and the geographical dispersion and the socio-economic weight of its speakers. National language policies can either mitigate or exacerbate the effects of some of these factors.

For example, according to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], "Native tongue title and language rights should be promoted. The government ought to define Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander vernaculars as official languages of Australia. We must change the linguistic landscape of Whyalla and elsewhere. Signs should be in both English and the local indigenous language. We ought to acknowledge intellectual property of indigenous knowledge including language, music and dance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/opinion/stop-revive-and-survive/story-e6frgcko-1226385194433 "Stop, revive and survive"], ''The Australian Higher Education'', June 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways in which language policies can be categorized. It was elaborated by [[Université Laval]] [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] [[Jacques Leclerc (linguist)|Jacques Leclerc]] for the French-language Web site ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'' put on line by the [[CIRAL]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;(French) Leclerc, Jacques. [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/axl/monde/index_politique-lng.htm "Index par politiques linguistiques"] in ''L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde'', Québec, TLFQ, [[Université Laval]], December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting, translating and classifying of language policies started in 1988 and culminated in the publishing of ''Recueil des législations linguistiques dans le monde'' (vol.

A '''language survey''' is conducted around the world for a variety of reasons.

*measuring people's ability to speak and understand another language (usually community based, not school based) ([[multilingualism]])
*studying people's attitudes about different languages (Rensch 1993)
*evaluating the differences and similarities in speech of communities that speak related speech forms, noting comprehension or collecting details of linguistic form ([[dialectology]]) (Labov 1982, Backstrom 1992,  Egland 1978)
*assessing the vitality of languages that may be disappearing ([[language death]]) (Statistic Canada 1993, Ferreira and Holbrook 2002)
*doing initial descriptions of languages in areas that are linguistically undescribed (King and King 1984)

== Methods ==
Methods used in language surveys depend on the questions that the survey is trying to answer.  Methods used include collecting word lists (Bender 1971), playing recorded texts to assess comprehension (Casad 1974), sentence repetition tests (Radloff 1991), questionnaires (Hochstetler and Tillinghast 1996), group and individual interviews, retelling of stories (McKinnies and Priestly 2004), direct observation (Cooper and Carpenter 1976),  and even internet surveys (tafesilafai.org).

As with any form of [[research]], the methods used depend on the questions that the researchers are trying to answer.  Also, the reliability of the results varies according to the method and the rigor with which it is applied, proper sampling technique, etc.

== Applications ==
The results of language surveys are use for a variety of purposes.  One of the most common is in making decisions for implementing educational programs.  The results have also been used for making decision for language development work (Holbrook, 2001).  And of course, academics are always interested in the results of any language survey.

== Agencies ==
Surveys have also been conducted by ethnic associations (Saskatchewan 1991), government agencies (Statistics Canada 1993),  NGO's (Toba, et al. 2002), foundations ([[Pew Hispanic Center]] 2004), etc.  Often such groups work together (Clifton 2002).  Some large and notable surveys include the Language Survey of India which was begun by [[George Abraham Grierson]]  late in the 19th century ([[Sociolinguistics research in India]]) and the Survey of Language Use and Language Teaching in East Africa, sponsored by the [[Ford Foundation]] from the 1960s.  Both resulted in a number of volumes describing locations of languages, patterns of multilingualism, language classification, and also included descriptions of languages, such as ''Language in Ethiopia'' ([[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Bender]], Bowen, Cooper, and [[Charles A. Ferguson|Ferguson]] 1976). The single agency conducting the most language surveys around the world is [[SIL International]] (Summer Institute of Linguistics).  The results of many of their surveys are posted on the web: http://www.sil.org/silesr.

== Sign languages ==
Surveys have usually been conducted among spoken languages.  However, surveys have also been done among users of [[sign language]]s (Vasishta, Woodward, and Wilson 1978,  Woodward 1991, 1993, 1996, Parkhurst &amp; Parkhurst 1998, Al-Fityani &amp; Padden 2008). As with surveys among spoken languages, surveys among sign languages have studied multilingualism, attitudes about various languages both spoken and signed (Ciupek-Reed 2012), differences and similarities between signed varieties (Aldersson and McEntee-Atalianis 2007, Bickford 1991, 2005, Parks 2011), and assessing the vitality of signed languages, and initial descriptions of undocumented sign languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="976">There are two official '''languages of [[Norfolk Island]]''', English and [[Norfuk language|Norfuk]].  English, due to the influence of [[Great Britain]] and [[Australia]], the two [[colonialism|colonial powers]] who administered Norfolk Island, is the dominant language of the pair.  Norfuk, a creole language based on English and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] and brought to the island by the descendants of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Bounty mutineers]] from [[Pitcairn Island]] was spoken by 580 persons according to the 1989 census. It is closely related to [[Pitkern]] spoken on Pitcairn Island.

[[File:Holst-planets-inscription.jpg|thumb|Handwritten inscription by [[Gustav Holst]] on [[Adrian Boult]]'s copy of the score of ''[[The Planets]]'' (from liner note to EMI CD 5 66934 2)]]

'''Liner notes''' (also '''sleeve notes''' or '''album notes''') are the writings found on the sleeves of [[LP record]] albums and in booklets which come inserted into the [[compact disc]] [[jewel case]] or the equivalent packaging for vinyl records and cassettes.

==Origin==
Liner notes are descended from the notes of text that were printed on the inner sleeve used to protect a traditional 12-inch vinyl record, i.e., [[long playing]] or [[gramophone record]] [[album]]. The term descends from the name "record liner" or "[[album liner]]". Album liner notes survived format changes from vinyl LP to cassette to CD.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Biron, Writing and Music: Album Liner Notes, ''Portal: International Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies'' (Vol 8, No 1), 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

===Common material===
Such notes often contained a mix of factual and anecdotal material, and occasionally a [[discography]] for the artist or the issuing [[record label]]. Liner notes were also an occasion for thoughtful signed essays on the artist by another party, often a sympathetic [[music journalist]], a custom that has largely died out. However, the liner note ''essay'' has survived in retrospective compilations, particularly in box sets. It is also a tradition in Japan especially for foreign artist releases in Japan. Many CD liner notes include complete song lyrics for the album.

===Biographies===
Liner notes now usually include [[information]] about the [[musician]], [[lyrics]], a personnel list, and other [[credit (creative arts)|credits]] to people the musicians want to thank and people or [[record label|companies]] involved in the [[Record producer|production]] of the [[music]]. They also can give details on the extent of each musical piece, and sometimes place them in historical or social context.  Liner notes for [[European Classical Music|classical music]] recordings often provide information in several languages; if the piece includes vocal parts, they will often include a [[libretto]], possibly also translated into several languages.

===Metadata===
Liner notes sometimes provide [[metadata]] that can help when cataloguing private or public collections of sound recordings. However, the information provided on liner notes varies considerably depending on the studio or label which produced the record.

==Digital liner notes==
Increasingly and due to the rise of digital downloads, a [[digital booklet]] is being introduced to compensate for the lack of a physical booklet. [[Apple Inc.]] also introduced [[iTunes LP]] which features interactive menus instead of simple pages.

==Awards==
A [[Grammy Award for Best Album Notes]] has been given annually since 1964.

'''Linguistic Intelligence''' is a part of [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[Theory of multiple intelligences|multiple intelligence theory]] that deals with individuals' ability to understand both [[Spoken language|spoken]] and [[written language]], as well as their ability to speak and write themselves.  In a practical sense, linguistic intelligence is the extent to which an individual can use [[language]], both written and verbal, to achieve goals.&lt;ref name="FM 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez-Martinez|first=Fernando|author2=Kseniya Zablotskaya |author3=Wolfgang Minker |title=Text categorization methods for automatic estimation of verbal intelligence|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|date=Aug 2012|volume=39|issue=10|pages=9807–9820|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2012.02.173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, high linguistic intelligence has been linked to improved [[problem solving]], as well as to increased [[Abstraction|abstract reasoning]].&lt;ref name="Luwel 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luwel|first=Koen|author2=Ageliki Foustana |author3=Patrick Onghena |author4=Lieven Verschaffel |title=The role of verbal and performance intelligence in children's strategy selection and execution|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|date=Apr 2013|volume=24|pages=134–138|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2013.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, only the verbal aspects are taken into consideration. This is usually referred to as verbal intelligence or verbal fluency, and is commonly a reflection of an individual's overall linguistic intelligence.

==Physiologic and functional overview==
In order to understand linguistic intelligence, it is important to understand the [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that control speech and language. These mechanisms can be broken down into four major groups: [[speech|speech generation]] (talking), [[Hearing|speech comprehension]] (hearing), [[Writing|writing generation]] (writing), and [[Reading (process)|writing comprehension]] (reading).

===Spoken language===

====Generation====
{{Main|Speech}}
[[File:Inferior frontal gyrus.png|thumb|left|[[Inferior frontal gyrus]]; a major part of the [[inferior frontal cortex]]]]
Speech production is process by which a thought in the brain is converted into an understandable auditory form.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohland|first=Jason|author2=Daniel Bullock |author3=Frank Guenther |title=Neural Representations and Mechanisms for the Performance of Simple Speech Sequences|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=Jul 2010|volume=22|issue=7|pages=1504–1529|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21306|pmid=19583476|pmc=2937837}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dan 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dan|first=Haruka |author2=Sano, Kyutoku |author3=Oguro, Yokota |author4=Tsuzuki, Watanabe|title=Language-specific cortical activation patterns for verbal fluency tasks in Japanese as assessed by multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy|journal=Brain and Language|date=Aug 2013|volume=126|issue=2|pages=208–216|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2013.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodd|first=J.M. |author2=M.H. Davis |author3=I.S. Johnsrude|title=The neural mechanisms of speech comprehension: fMRI studies of semantic ambiguity|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=Aug 2005|volume=15|issue=8|pages=1261–1269|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhi009|pmid=15635062}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a multistage mechanism that involves many different areas of the brain. The first stage is planning, where the brain constructs words and sentences that turn the thought into an understandable form.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010" /&gt; This occurs primarily in the [[inferior frontal cortex]], specifically in an area known as [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref name="Dan 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konrad 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Konrad|first=Andreas|author2=Goran Vucurevic |author3=Francesco Musso |author4=Georg Winterer |title=VBM-DTI Correlates of Verbal Intelligence: A Potential Link to Broca's area|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=Apr 2012|volume=24|issue=4|pages=888–895|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00187 |pmid=22220724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the brain must plan how to physically create the sounds necessary for speech by linking the planned speech with known sounds, or [[phonemes]]. While the location of these associations is not known, it is known that the [[supplementary motor area]] plays a key role in this step.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Penfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Penfield|first=Wilder|title=Speech and Brain-Mechanism|year=1959|publisher=Atheneum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the brain must signal for the words to actually be spoken. This is carried out by the [[premotor cortex]] and the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

[[File:Human motor cortex topography.png|thumb|right|[[Motor cortex]] with muscle [[localization of function|localization]] shown]]
In most cases, speech production is controlled by the left hemisphere. In a series of studies, [[Wilder Penfield]], among others, probed the brains of both right-handed (generally [[Lateralization of brain function|left-hemisphere dominant]]) and left-handed (generally [[Lateralization of brain function|right-hemisphere dominant]]) patients. They discovered that, regardless of [[handedness]], the left hemisphere was almost always the speech controlling side. However, it has been discovered that in cases of neural [[Stress (biology)|stress]] ([[hemorrhage]], [[stroke]], etc.) the right hemisphere has the ability to take control of speech functions.&lt;ref name=Doidge&gt;{{cite book|last=Doidge|first=Norman|title=The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science|year=2007|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comprehension ===
{{Main|Hearing}}
Verbal Comprehension is a fairly complex process, and it is not fully understood. From various studies and experiments, it has been found that the [[superior temporal sulcus]] activates when hearing human speech, and that speech processing seems to occur within [[Wernicke's area]].&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

====Auditory feedback and feedforward====
Hearing plays an important part in both speech generation and comprehension. When speaking, the person can hear their speech, and the brain uses what it hears as a [[feedback]] mechanism to fix [[speech error]]s.&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkell|first=Joseph|title=Movement goals and feedback and feed forward control mechanisms in speech production|journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics|date=Sep 2012|volume=25|issue=5|pages=382–407|doi=10.1016/j.jneuroling.2010.02.011|pmc=3361736}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a single [[feedback]] correction occurs multiple times, the brain will begin to incorporate the correction to all future speech, making it a [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012" /&gt; This is apparent in some deaf people. [[Deafness]], as well as other, smaller deficiencies in hearing, can greatly affect one's ability to comprehend spoken language, as well as to speak it.&lt;ref name="Tourville 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tourville|first=Jason|author2=Kevin Reilly |author3=Frank Guenther |title=Neural mechanisms underlying auditory feedback control of speech|journal=NeuroImage|date=1 February 2008|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1429–1443|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.054}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the person loses hearing ability later in life, most can still maintain a normal level of verbal intelligence. This is thought to be because of the brain's [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] mechanism still helping to fix [[speech error]]s, even in the absence of [[auditory feedback]].&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012" /&gt;

===Written language===

====Generation====
{{Main|Writing}}
Generation of written language is thought to be closely related to speech generation, relying on [[Broca's area]] for early processing and on the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] for semantic processing.&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; However, writing differs in two major ways. First, instead of relating the thought to sounds, the brain must relate the thought to symbols or letters, and second, the [[motor cortex]] activates a different set of muscles to write, than when speaking.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

====Comprehension====
{{Main|Reading (process)|l1=Reading}}
Written comprehension, similar to spoken comprehension, seems to occur primarily in [[Wernicke's area]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; However, instead of using the auditory system to gain language input, written comprehension relies on the visual system.

==Genetic links==
[[File:Protein NRXN1 PDB 1c4r.png|thumb|right|Protein NRXN1, which is created from the NRXN1 gene]]
While the capabilities of the physical structures used are large factors in determining linguistic intelligence, there have been several [[genes]] that have been linked to individual linguistic ability.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Adam|author2=Katalin Csiszar |title=Genetic insights into the functional elements of language|journal=Human Genetics|date=September 2013|volume=132|issue=9|pages=959–986|doi=10.1007/s00439-013-1317-0|pmid=23749164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NRXN1]] gene has been linked to general language ability, and [[mutation]]s of this gene has been shown to cause major issues to overall linguistic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; The [[CNTNAP2]] gene is believed to affect [[language development]] and performance, and [[mutation]]s in this gene is thought to be involved in [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[PCDH11]] has been linked to language capacity, and it is believed to be one of the factors that accounts for the variation in linguistic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

==Measurement and testing==
In general, it is difficult to test for linguistic intelligence as a whole, therefore verbal intelligence is often measured instead. This is done using various types of [[verbal fluency test]]s.&lt;ref name="Dan 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konrad 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CC 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casals-Coll|first=M. |author2=Sanchez-Benavides |author3=Quintana |author4=Manero |author5=Rognoni |author6=Calvo |author7=Palomo |author8=Aranciva |author9=Tamayo |author10=Pena-Casanova |title=Spanish normative studies in young adults (NEURONORMA young adults project): Normative data: norms for verbal fluency tests|journal=Neurologia|date=Jan–Feb 2013|volume=28|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.nrleng.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal fluency tests===
*[[Semantics|Semantic]] Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to produce words in groups, such as animals, kitchen tools, fruits, etc. This type of test focuses on the subject's ability to generate words that have meaning to them. This test has been found to be sensitive to age.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*Formal Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to produce words given specific letter-based rules. This test has been found to be sensitive to education level.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
**Initial Letter Fluency Test - A type of formal fluency test where the subject is asked to list words starting with a specific letter.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
**Excluded Letter Fluency Test - A type of formal fluency test where the subject is asked to list words that do not contain a certain letter.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*[[Verb]] Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to list verbs. Subjects are then tested on their ability to use listed verbs.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*Verbal Reproduction Test - Subjects are asked to listen to a [[monologue]]. They are then asked to repeat the monologue, and the subject is scored based on the number of words and [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]] used from the original monologue.&lt;ref name="FM 2012" /&gt;

===Verbal fluency in children===
In one series of tests, it was shown that when children were given verbal fluency tests, a larger portion of their [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] activated compared to adults, as well as activation of both the left and right hemispheres. This is most likely due to the high [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of newly developing brains.&lt;ref name="Gaillard 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaillard|first=W.D. |author2=Hertz-Pannier |author3=Mott |author4=Barnett |author5=LeBihan |author6=Theodore |title=Functional anatomy of cognitive development - fMRI of verbal fluency in children and adults|journal=Neurology|date=Jan 2000|volume=54|issue=1|pages=180–185|doi=10.1212/wnl.54.1.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible conflict===
Recently, a study was done showing that verbal fluency test results can differ depending on the mental focus of the subject. In this study, mental focus on physical [[speech production]] mechanisms caused speech production times to suffer, whereas mental focus on [[auditory feedback]] improved these times.&lt;ref name="Lisman 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lisman|first=Amanda|author2=Neeraja, Sadagopan |title=Focus of attention and speech motor performance|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=May–Jun 2013|volume=46|issue=3|pages=281–293|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2013.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders affecting linguistic intelligence==
{{Main|Speech-language pathology}}
Since linguistic intelligence is based on several complex skills, there are many disorders and injuries that can affect an individual's linguistic intelligence.

===Injuries===
Damage and injury in the brain can severely lower one's ability to communicate, and therefore lower one's linguistic intelligence. Common forms of major damage are [[strokes]], [[concussions]], [[brain tumor]]s, [[Virus|viral]]/[[bacteria]]l damage, and [[drug]]-related damage. The three major [[Language disorder|linguistic disorders]] that result from these injuries are [[aphasia]], [[alexia (condition)|alexia]], and [[agraphia]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; [[Aphasia]] is the inability to speak, and can be caused by damage to [[Broca's area]] or the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; Alexia is the inability to read, which can arise from damage to [[Wernicke's area]], among other places.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; [[Agraphia]] is the inability to write which can also arise from damage to [[Broca's area]] or the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; In addition, damage to large areas of the brain can result in any combinations of these disorders, as well as a loss of other abilities.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

===Pure language disorders===
There are several disorders that primarily affect only language skills. Three major pure language disorders are [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]], [[specific language impairment]], and [[stuttering]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]] (DVD) is a disorder where children have errors in consonant and vowel production.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Specific language impairment]] (SLI) is a disorder where the patient has a lack of [[language acquisition]] skills, despite a seemingly normal [[intelligence]] level in other areas.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Stuttering]] is a fairly common disorder where speech flow is interrupted by involuntary repetitions of [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

===Other disorders affecting language===
Some disorders cause a wide array of effects, and language impairment is merely one of many possible [[symptom]]s. The two major disorders of this type are  [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]] and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Autism]] and other [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) are disorders in which the patient suffers from decreased [[social skills]] and lowered [[Cognitive flexibility|mental flexibility]]. As a result, many patients suffering from ASDs also have language problems, arising from both the lack of social interaction and lowered mental flexibility.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Epilepsy]] is a disorder where electrical malfunctions or mis-communications in the brain cause [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], leading to muscle [[spasm]]s and activation of other organs and systems of the body. Over time, epilepsy can lead to cognitive and behavioral decay. This mental decay can eventually lead to a loss of language and communication skills.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

'''Linguistic philosophy''' is the view that philosophical problems are problems which may be solved (or dissolved) either by reforming language, or by understanding more about the language we presently use.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty 1967, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The former position is that of ideal language philosophy, the latter the position of [[ordinary language philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Rorty 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linguistics''' is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Language and Linguistics |first=Michael A.K. |last=Halliday |authorlink=Michael Halliday |author2=Jonathan Webster | publisher= Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=0-8264-8824-2 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it involves an analysis of language [[Theoretical linguistics|form]], language [[Semantics|meaning]], and language in [[context (language use)|context]].&lt;ref name="Martinet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elements of General Linguistics |last=Martinet |first=André |authorlink=André Martinet |translator=Elisabeth Palmer Rubbert |series=Studies in General Linguistics, vol. i. |location=London |publisher=Faber |year=1960 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest activities in the [[language documentation|documentation]] and [[descriptive linguistics|description of language]] have been attributed to the 6th century BC [[India]]n grammarian [[Pāṇini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New History of the Humanities: The Search for Principles and Patterns from Antiquity to the Present|author=Rens Bod|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199665214|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KaOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter =Chapter VI: Sanskrit Literature|title = The Imperial Gazetteer of India|volume = 2 |date=1908|page = 263|url =https://archive.org/details/imperialgazette02hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote a formal description of the [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit language]] in his ''{{IAST|Aṣṭādhyāyī}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini (2 Vols.) |author=S.C.

Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between [[phonetics|sound]] and [[semantics|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six Lectures on Sound and Meaning |first=Roman |last=Jakobson |publisher=MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1937 |isbn=0262600102 |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ru/jakobson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phonetics]] is the study of speech and non-speech sounds, and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties. The study of language [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], on the other hand, deals with how languages encode relations between entities, properties, and other aspects of the world to convey, process, and assign meaning, as well as manage and resolve [[ambiguity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vakyapadiya: Sphota, Jati, and Dravya |author=Sharada Narayanan |year=2010 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/power-of-the-word/article3779772.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the study of [[semantics]] typically concerns itself with [[truth condition]]s, [[pragmatics]] deals with how situational context influences the production of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Meaning and Grammar: An Introduction to Semantics |year=2000 |author1=Chierchia, Gennaro |author2=Sally McConnell-Ginet |lastauthoramp=yes|publisher= MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= 9780262531641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grammar]] is a system of rules which governs the production and use of [[utterances]] in a given language. These rules apply to sound&lt;ref&gt;All references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in [[sign language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to [[phonology]] (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the formation and composition of words), and [[syntax]] (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistics|year=2010|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn =0-262-51370-6|url= https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12240 |edition= 6th |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A. Demers |author3=Ann K. Farmer |author4=Robert M. Harnish |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories that deal with the principles of grammar are largely based within [[Noam Chomsky]]'s framework of [[generative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'' (Second Edition), 2013. Andrew Carnie. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] distinguished between the notions of [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] in his formulation of [[structural linguistics]]. According to him, [[speech|''parole'']] is the specific utterance of speech, whereas [[language|langue]] refers to an abstract phenomenon that theoretically defines the principles and system of rules that govern a language.&lt;ref&gt;de Saussure, F. (1986). ''Course in general linguistics'' (3rd ed.). (R. Harris, Trans.). Chicago: Open Court Publishing Company. (Original work published 1972). p. 9-10, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction resembles the one made by [[Noam Chomsky]] between [[linguistic competence|competence]] and [[Linguistic performance|performance]] in his theory of [[generative grammar|transformative]] or [[universal grammar|generative grammar]]. According to Chomsky, competence is an individual's innate capacity and potential for language (like in Saussure's ''langue''), while performance is the specific way in which it is used by individuals, groups, and communities (i.e., ''parole'', in Saussurean terms).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. (1965). ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax''. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ''parole'' (which manifests through cultural [[discourse (linguistics)|discourses]] and [[dialects]]) is the domain of [[sociolinguistics]], the sub-discipline that comprises the study of a complex system of linguistic facets within a certain [[speech community]] (governed by its own set of grammatical rules and laws). [[Discourse analysis]] further examines the structure of texts and [[conversations]] emerging out of a speech community's usage of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociolinguistic Discontinuity in Minority Language Communities |pages=40–55 |year=1998 |publisher=Linguistic Society of America |author1=Raymond Mougeon |author2=Terry Nadasdi |lastauthoramp=yes|jstor=417564}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through the collection of linguistic data, or through the formal discipline of [[corpus linguistics]], which takes naturally occurring [[Text (disambiguation)|texts]] and studies the variation of grammatical and other features based on such corpora (or corpus data).

[[stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken [[discourse]] through varying speech communities, [[genres]], and editorial or [[narrative]] formats in the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |title="Stylistics" by Joybrato Mukherjee.

Antonsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like [[psycholinguistics]], which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; [[neurolinguistics]], which studies language processing in the brain; [[biolinguistics]], which studies the biology and evolution of language; and [[language acquisition]], which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages.

Linguistics also deals with the social, cultural, historical and political factors that influence language, through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/jlp/main Journal of Language and Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; Research on language through the sub-branches of [[historical linguistics|historical]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]] also focus on how languages change and grow, particularly over an extended [[diachronic linguistics|period of time]].

[[Language documentation]] combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. [[Lexicography]] involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a [[dictionary]]. [[Computational linguistics]] is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of [[translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], as well as in [[language education]] – the teaching of a second or [[foreign language]]. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.

Related areas of study also includes the disciplines of [[semiotics]] (the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols), [[literary criticism]] (the historical and ideological analysis of literature, cinema, art, or published material), [[translation]] (the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another), and [[speech-language pathology]] (a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]] level).

==Nomenclature==
Before the 20th century, the term ''[[philology]]'', first attested in 1716,&lt;ref name="Etymonline Definition of Philology"&gt;{{OEtymD|philology|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus.&lt;ref name="Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture by Stephen G. Nichols (Vol. 65, No. 1 (Jan 1990), pp. 1-10. Published by Medieval Academy of America."&gt;{{cite journal |title=Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture |first=Stephen G. |last=Nichols |journal=Speculum |volume=65 |number=1 |year=1990 |pages=1–10 |jstor=2864468 |doi=10.2307/2864468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMahon |first=A. M. S. |year=1994 |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=19 |isbn=0-521-44665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s insistence on the importance of [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic analysis]], however, this focus has shifted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMahon |first=A. M. S. |year=1994 |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=9 |isbn=0-521-44665-1 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''philology'' is now generally used for the "study of a language's grammar, history, and literary tradition", especially in the United States&lt;ref&gt;A. Morpurgo Davies Hist. Linguistics (1998) 4 I. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; (where philology has never been very popularly considered as the "science of language").&lt;ref name="Etymonline Definition of Philology"/&gt;

Although the term "linguist" in the sense of "a student of language" dates from 1641,&lt;ref name="etymonline linguist"/&gt; the term "linguistics" is first attested in 1847.&lt;ref name="etymonline linguist"&gt;{{OEtymD|linguist|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the usual term in English for the scientific study of language,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} though ''linguistic science'' is sometimes used.

Linguistics is a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] field of research that combines tools from natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nc6nRRbMSQC&amp;pg=PA13|title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics|last=Spolsky|first=Bernard|last2=Hult|first2=Francis M.|date=February 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781444331042|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUMqGSbeEXAC&amp;pg=PA23|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|last=Berns|first=Margie|date=2010-03-20|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780080965031|location=|pages=23–25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/science-linguistics|title=The Science of Linguistics|last=|first=|date=|website=Linguistic Society of America|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17|quote=Modern linguists approach their work with a scientific perspective, although they use methods that used to be thought of as solely an academic discipline of the humanities.

== Variation and universality ==
While some theories on linguistics focus on the different varieties that language produces, among different sections of society, others focus on the [[universal grammar|universal]] properties that are common to all human languages. The theory of variation therefore would elaborate on the different usages of popular languages like [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] across the globe, as well as its smaller [[dialects]] and regional permutations within their national boundaries. The theory of variation looks at the cultural stages that a particular language undergoes, and these include the following.

===Pidgin===

The pidgin stage in a language is a stage when communication occurs through a grammatically simplified means, developing between two or more groups that do not have a language in common. Typically, it is a mixture of languages at the stage when there occurs a [[mixed language|mixing]] between a primary language with other language elements.

===Creole===

A creole stage in language occurs when there is a stable natural language developed from a mixture of different languages. It is a stage that occurs after a language undergoes its pidgin stage. At the creole stage, a language is a complete language, used in a community and acquired by children as their native language.

===Dialect===
A dialect is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[language]] that is characteristic of a particular group among the language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&amp;queryword=dialect&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&amp;hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt; The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or a [[discourse]], where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages too) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]" is attributed as a definition formulated by [[Max Weinreich]].

[[Universal grammar]] takes into account general formal structures and features that are common to all dialects and languages, and the template of which pre-exists in the mind of an infant child. This idea is based on the theory of generative grammar and the formal school of linguistics, whose proponents include [[Chomsky|Noam Chomsky]] and those who follow his theory and work.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong&amp;nbsp;– they are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races, religions and sexes."&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. ''Ebooks Online'' Routledge. Florence, KY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Discourse===
Discourse is language as social practice (Baynham, 1995) and is a multilayered concept.  As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies.   Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level. Grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ariel|first=Mira|year=2009|title=Discourse, grammar, discourse|jstor=24049745|journal=Discourse Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=5–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be certain [[lexicon|lexical]] additions (new words) that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization. Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of [[vocabulary]], and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the "medical discourse", and so on.

===Standard language===

When a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a standard variety, one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of speech community participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties.

The study of a language's universal properties, on the other hand, include some of the following concepts.

===Lexicon===
The [[lexicon]] is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of [[words]] and [[bound morphemes]], which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like [[affixes]]. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. [[Lexicography]], closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an [[encyclopedia]] or a [[dictionary]]. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Ghil'ad Zuckermann |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1403917232 |pages=2ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new words are called [[neologism]]s.

It is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with [[linguistic competence|competence]], rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences.

===Relativity===
As constructed popularly through the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her [[world view]]. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], it was Sapir's student [[Harry Hoijer]] who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of [[cognitive linguistics]] in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like [[George Lakoff]] have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writings have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, especially through [[deconstructivism|deconstruction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing and Difference |author=Jacques Derrida |translator=Alan Bass |year=1978 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226143293}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was even heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death for his theory of relativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/18/philosophy |title=Relative Thinking |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Lea |date=18 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==
Linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form.  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[linguistic sign|sign]].  For instance, the meaning "cat" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in [[sign language]]s), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the knowledge engineering field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.

Linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously).  All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis.  For instance, consider the structure of the word "tenth" on two different levels of analysis.  On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word "tenth" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality.  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker "th" follows the number "ten."  On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the "n" sound in "tenth" is made differently from the "n" sound in "ten" spoken alone.  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of "tenth", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure.  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.

Linguistics has many sub-fields concerned with particular aspects of linguistic structure. The theory that elucidates on these, as propounded by Noam Chomsky, is known as [[generative linguistics|generative theory]] or [[universal grammar]]. These sub-fields range from those focused primarily on form to those focused primarily on meaning. They also run the gamut of level of analysis of language, from individual sounds, to words, to phrases, up to cultural discourse.

===Grammar===

Sub-fields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following.

* '''[[Phonetics]]''', the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception
* '''[[Phonology]]''', the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning ([[phonemes]])
* '''[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]]''', the study of [[morphemes]], or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified
* '''[[Syntax]]''', the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]
* '''[[Semantics]]''', the study of the meaning of words ([[lexical semantics]]) and fixed word combinations ([[phraseology]]), and how these combine to form the [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] of sentences
* '''[[Pragmatics]]''', the study of how [[utterance]]s are used in [[speech acts|communicative acts]], and the role played by context and non-linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning
* '''[[Discourse analysis]]''', the analysis of language use in [[Text (literary theory)|texts]] (spoken, written, or signed)
* '''[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]]''', the study of linguistic factors (rhetoric, diction, stress) that place a discourse in context
* '''[[Semiotics]]''', the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication

===Style===
[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] is the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style. Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] used by speech communities. Stylistic features include [[rhetoric]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Rhetoric |author=IA Richards |year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press (New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; diction, stress, [[satire]], [[irony]], dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text.

==Approaches==

===Theoretical===
One major debate in linguistics concerns the very nature of language and how it should be understood. Some linguists hypothesize that there is a [[language module|module]] in the [[human brain]] that allows people to undertake linguistic behaviour, which is part of the [[formal grammar|formalist]] approach. This "[[universal grammar]]" is considered to guide children when they learn language and to constrain what sentences are considered grammatical in any human language. Proponents of this view, which is predominant in those schools of linguistics that are based on the [[generative linguistics|generative]] theory of [[Noam Chomsky]], do not necessarily consider that language evolved for communication in particular. They consider instead that it has more to do with the process of structuring human thought (see also [[formal grammar]]).

===Functional===
Another group of linguists, by contrast, use the term "language" to refer to a communication system that developed to support [[cooperation|cooperative activity]] and extend cooperative networks. Such [[functional theories of grammar|theories of grammar]], called "functional", view language as a tool that emerged and is adapted to the communicative needs of its users, and the role of [[cultural evolution]]ary processes are often emphasized over that of [[biological evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Daniela | last=Isac |author2=Charles Reiss  | title= I-language: An Introduction to Linguistics as Cognitive Science, 2nd edition |url= http://linguistics.concordia.ca/i-language/ | year=2013 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0199660179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Linguistics is primarily [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive]].&lt;ref name="Martinet" /&gt; Linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether a particular feature or usage is "good" or "bad". This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a [[zoologist]] studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is "better" or "worse" than another.

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescription]], on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or "[[acrolect]]". This may have the aim of establishing a [[Standard language|linguistic standard]], which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see [[Linguistic imperialism]]). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among [[censorship|censors]], who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in the [[teaching of language]], like in [[English language teaching|ELT]], where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical terms need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the language.

===Anthropology===
The objective of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of [[anthropology|anthropological]] methods of investigation on linguistic sources leads to the discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in [[language documentation]], with an endeavour to curate [[endangered languages]]. However, now, linguistic inquiry uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language.

===Sources===
Most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that [[spoken language|spoken data]] and [[Sign language|signed data]] are more fundamental than [[written language|written data]]. This is because
* Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many [[culture]]s and speech communities that lack written communication;
* Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including [[phonological rule]]s, [[sound change]]s, and [[speech error]]s;
* All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with [[pictographic]] scripts like [[Dongba]] writing [[Naxi language|Naxi]] [[homophone]]s with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for [[List of languages by writing system|two languages]] changing to fit the spoken language being recorded;
* Speech evolved before human beings invented writing;
* People learnt to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they did with [[writing]].

Nonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on [[corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of [[computer-mediated communication]] as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.

The study of [[writing systems]] themselves, [[graphemics]], is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics.

===Analysis===
Before the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a [[diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more [[synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.

At another level, the [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article "the" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the [[paradigms]] or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.

==History==
{{main|History of linguistics}}

===Early grammarians===
{{main|Philology|History of English grammars}}

The formal study of language began in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 6th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Pāṇini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, and word classes, such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the [[Middle East]], [[Sibawayh]], a non-Arab, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in his monumental work, ''Al-kitab fi al-nahw'' ({{lang|ar|الكتاب في النحو}}, ''The Book on Grammar''), the first known author to distinguish between [[phonetics|sounds]] and [[phonology|phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system)]].  Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=307}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by [[Plato]] in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialogue]], where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word [[etymology]] to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors founded a university (see [[Musaeum]]) in [[Alexandria]], where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught [[Greek language|Greek]] to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word "[[grammar]]" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as "[[Art of Grammar|téchnē grammatikḗ]]" ({{script|Grek|Τέχνη Γραμματική}}), the "art of writing", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by [[Dionysius Thrax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A. M.  |year=1998|title=Western linguistics: An historical introduction|publisher=Wiley-blackwell|isbn=0-631-20891-7|pages=2–24|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology, the study of ancient languages and texts, practised by such educators as [[Roger Ascham]], [[Wolfgang Ratke]], and [[John Amos Comenius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative philology===
In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomfield attributes "the first great scientific linguistic work of the world" to [[Jacob Grimm]], who wrote ''Deutsche Grammatik''.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of Europe. The study of language was broadened from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], of whom Bloomfield asserts:&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled ''Über die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluß auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Structuralism===
{{main|Structuralism (linguistics)}}
Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them. By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still foundational in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|langue- parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue'') from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sources of Semiotic: Readings with Commentary from Antiquity to the Present |first=David S. |last=Clarke |year=1990|location=Carbondale|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|pages=143–144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vZDmu_4_CUC&amp;pg=PA143 |isbn=9780809316144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial additional contributions following Saussure's definition of a structural approach to language came from [[Prague school (linguistics)|The Prague school]], [[Leonard Bloomfield]], [[Charles F. Hockett]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], [[Émile Benveniste]] and [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref name="Holquist81"&gt;{{harvnb|Holquist|1981|pp=xvii–xviii}}.{{citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Course in General Linguistics |first=Ferdinand |last=de Saussure |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-8022-1493-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generativism===
{{main|Generative linguistics}}
During the last half of the 20th century, following the work of [[Noam Chomsky]], linguistics was dominated by the [[Generative grammar|generativist school]]. While formulated by Chomsky in part as a way to explain how human beings [[language acquisition|acquire language]] and the biological constraints on this acquisition, in practice it has largely been concerned with giving formal accounts of specific phenomena in natural languages. Generative theory is [[Language module|modularist]] and formalist in character. Chomsky built on earlier work of [[Zellig Harris]] to formulate the generative theory of language. According to this theory the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules universal for all humans and underlying the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]], and for Chomsky describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. For this reason the grammars of individual languages are of importance to linguistics only in so far as they allow us to discern the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.

In the classic formalization of generative grammars first proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Chomsky1956"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Chomsky, Noam | title = Three Models for the Description of Language | journal = [[IRE Transactions on Information Theory]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 113 123 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chomsky1957"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Chomsky, Noam | title = Syntactic Structures | publisher = [[Mouton de Gruyter|Mouton]] | location = The Hague | year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grammar ''G'' consists of the following components:

* A finite set ''N'' of ''[[nonterminal symbol]]s'', none of which appear in strings formed from ''G''.
* A finite set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''[[terminal symbol]]s'' that is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] from ''N''.
* A finite set ''P'' of ''production rules'', that map from one string of symbols to another.
A formal description of language attempts to replicate a speaker's knowledge of the rules of their language, and the aim is to produce a set of rules that is minimally sufficient to successfully model valid linguistic forms.

===Functionalism===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analysed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional theories of grammar differ from [[Formal grammar|formal theories of grammar]], in that the latter seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former defines the functions performed by language and then relates these functions to the linguistic elements that carry them out. This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used, and not just to the formal relations between linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Functional Theories of Grammar|author=Nichols, Johanna|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=13|year=1984|quote=[Functional grammar] analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyses the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approach is not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formulae and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation.|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.13.100184.000525|pages=97–117|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional theories describe language in term of the functions existing at all levels of language.
*Phonological function: the function of the [[phoneme]] is to distinguish between different lexical material.
*Semantic function: ([[Agent (linguistics)|Agent]], [[Patient (linguistics)|Patient]], Recipient, etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed.
*Syntactic functions: (e.g. [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|Object]]), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression
*Pragmatic functions: ([[Topic–comment|Theme and Rheme]], [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]], [[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction. Functional descriptions of grammar strive to explain how linguistic functions are performed in communication through the use of linguistic forms.

===Cognitive linguistics===
{{main|Cognitive linguistics}}
Cognitive linguistics emerged as a reaction to generativist theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Led by theorists like [[Ronald Langacker]] and [[George Lakoff]], cognitive linguists propose that language is an [[emergentism|emergent]] property of basic, general-purpose cognitive processes. In contrast to the generativist school of linguistics, cognitive linguistics is non-modularist and functionalist in character. Important developments in cognitive linguistics include [[cognitive grammar]], [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]], and [[conceptual metaphor]], all of which are based on the idea that form–function correspondences based on representations derived from [[embodied cognition|embodied experience]] constitute the basic units of language.

Cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of concepts (sometimes universal, sometimes specific to a particular tongue) that underlie its form. It is thus closely associated with [[semantics]] but is distinct from [[psycholinguistics]], which draws upon empirical findings from cognitive psychology in order to explain the mental processes that underlie the acquisition, storage, production and understanding of speech and writing.  Unlike generative theory, [[cognitive linguistics]] denies that there is an ''autonomous linguistic faculty'' in the mind; it understands grammar in terms of ''conceptualization''; and claims that knowledge of language arises out of ''language use''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Linguistics|author1=Croft, William  |author2=D. Alan Cruse |lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2004|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its conviction that knowledge of language is learned through use, cognitive linguistics is sometimes considered to be a functional approach, but it differs from other functional approaches in that it is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language, and not with the use of language as a tool of communication.

==Areas of research==

===Historical linguistics===
[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] study the history of specific languages as well as general characteristics of language change. The study of language change is also referred to as "diachronic linguistics" (the study of how one particular language has changed over time), which can be distinguished from  "synchronic linguistics" (the comparative study of more than one language at a given moment in time without regard to previous stages). Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century. However, there was a shift to the synchronic approach in the early twentieth century with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], and became more predominant in western linguistics with the work of [[Noam Chomsky]].

===Ecolinguistics===
[[Ecolinguistics]] explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ |title=Ecolinguistics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociolinguistics===
[[Sociolinguistics]] is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and ideolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research on both style and discourse in language, and also study the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.

===Developmental linguistics===
[[Developmental linguistics]] is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is.

===Neurolinguistics===
[[Neurolinguistics]] is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mariën|first=Peter|last2=Manto|first2=Mario|date=2017-10-25|title=Cerebellum as a Master-Piece for Linguistic Predictability|journal=Cerebellum (London, England)|volume=17|issue=2|pages=101–103|doi=10.1007/s12311-017-0894-1|issn=1473-4230|pmid=29071518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied linguistics==
{{Main|Applied linguistics}}
Linguists are largely concerned with finding and [[descriptive linguistics|describing]] the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. [[Applied linguistics]] takes the results of those findings and "applies" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as [[language education]], [[lexicography]], [[translation]], [[language planning]], which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and [[natural language processing]]. "Applied linguistics" has been argued to be something of a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controversies in Applied Linguistics (pp. 288) |author=Barbara Seidlhofer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0194374440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally "applying" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)

Today, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. [[Speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]] use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interfaces to computers. Applications of [[computational linguistics]] in [[machine translation]], [[computer-assisted translation]], and [[natural language processing]] are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.

Linguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed [[nationality]] of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Applied Linguistics and Language Analysis in Asylum Seeker Cases | last=Eades | first=Diana | journal=Applied Linguistics | year=2005 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=503–526 | doi=10.1093/applin/ami021 | url=http://songchau.googlepages.com/503.pdf | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes the form of an [[interview]] by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's [[native language]] through an [[language interpretation|interpreter]] or in an international ''[[lingua franca]]'' like English.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt; Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt; Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt;

==Interdisciplinary fields==
Within the broad discipline of linguistics, various emerging sub-disciplines focus on a more detailed description and analysis of language, and are often organized on the basis of the school of thought and theoretical approach that they pre-suppose, or the external factors that influence them.

===Semiotics===
[[Semiotics]] is the study of sign processes (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of "sign" to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are [[literary studies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[text linguistics]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, is the study of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ferdinand De Saussure]]'s structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Michel Foucault]], and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Classical Roots of Post-Structuralism: Lacan, Derrida and Foucault |journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition  |first= Paul Allen |last=Miller |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |jstor=30222818|ref=harv|volume=5 |issue=2  |pages=204–225 |doi=10.1007/bf02688423}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.

===Language documentation===
Since the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously [[language documentation|undocumented languages]]. Starting with [[Franz Boas]] in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly [[language death|disappearing]] languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[linguistic anthropology]], which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.

The emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelman, Nikolaus "Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann &amp; Ulrike Mosel. (2006) ''Essentials of Language documentation''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
The sub-field of [[translation]] includes the translation of written and spoken texts across mediums, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations, such as travel agencies as well as governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within [[computational linguistics]] setups like [[Google Translate]] for example, which is an automated, programmed facility to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic Translators, specialize and semi specialize on various other disciplines such as; Technology, Science, Law, Economics etc.

===Biolinguistics===
[[Biolinguistics]] is the study of the biology and evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of the faculty of language are understood.

===Clinical linguistics===
Clinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the fields of [[Speech-Language Pathology]]. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to cure [[communication disorders]] and swallowing disorders

Chaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders, like rhyming inappropriately, have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient, shown a colour chip and then asked to identify it, responded "looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day." The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.'

However, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.&lt;ref&gt;Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational linguistics===
[[Computational linguistics]] is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is "computationally responsible", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development.

===Evolutionary linguistics===
[[Evolutionary linguistics]] is the interdisciplinary study of the emergence of the language faculty through [[human evolution]], and also the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219–234  | publisher = Annual Reviews | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic linguistics===
[[Forensic linguistics]] is the application of linguistic analysis to [[forensics]]. Forensic analysis investigates on the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law. Forensic linguists have also contributed expertise in criminal cases.

'''Literacy''' is traditionally defined as the ability to [[reading (process)|read]] and [[writing|write]].&lt;ref&gt;"Literate." Merriam-Webster.com. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 19 August 2014. &lt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/literate&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern world, this is one way of interpreting literacy. A more broad interpretation is literacy as knowledge and competence in a specific area.&lt;ref&gt;"Sitwe Benson Mkandwire." Literacy versus Language: Exploring their Similarities and Differences, 2018. The University of Zambia. ISSN: 2517-9306 &lt;http://dspace.unza.zm:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/5305/Literacy%20Versus%20Language%20Sitwe%20Article.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of literacy has evolved in meaning. The [[Modern history|modern]] term's meaning has been expanded to include the ability to use language, numbers, images, computers, and other basic means to understand, communicate, gain useful knowledge, solve mathematical problems and use the dominant symbol systems of a culture.&lt;ref name="Ed for All, UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNESCO|title=Education for All: A Global Monitoring Report|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/GMR2006/full/chapt6_eng.pdf|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of literacy is expanding across [[OECD]] countries to include skills to access knowledge through technology and ability to assess complex contexts.&lt;ref name="Ed for All, UNESCO"/&gt; A person who travels and resides in a foreign country but is unable to read or write in the language of the host country would also be regarded by the locals as illiterate.

The key to literacy is [[reading (process)|reading]] development, a progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words, and culminates in the deep understanding of text. Reading development involves a range of complex language underpinnings including awareness of speech sounds ([[phonology]]), spelling patterns ([[orthography]]), word meaning ([[semantics]]), grammar ([[syntax]]) and patterns of word formation ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), all of which provide a necessary platform for reading [[fluency]] and comprehension.

Once these skills are acquired, the reader can attain full language literacy, which includes the abilities to apply to printed material critical analysis, inference and synthesis; to write with accuracy and coherence; and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought.&lt;ref&gt;Margie Gillis, Ed.D., President, Literacy How, Inc., and Research Affiliate, Haskins Laboratories at Yale University; Sally Grimes, Ed.M., Executive Director, Literate Nation and Founder, Grimes Reading Institute; Cinthia Haan, Author and Chair, The Haan Foundation for Children and President, Power4Kids Reading Initiative; Peggy McCardle, Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief, Child Development and Behavior Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Louisa Moats, Ed.D., President, Moats Associates Consulting, Inc.; Anthony Pedriana, Author and retired urban schoolteacher and principal; Susan Smartt, Ph.D., Senior Research Associate, National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality, Vanderbilt University; Catherine Snow,  Ph.D., Author, Researcher and Professor of Education,  Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard University; Cheryl Ward, M.S.M., C.A.L.P., Co-founder of Wisconsin Reading Coalition and academic language practitioner; Maryanne Wolf, Ed.D., Author and Director, Center for Reading and Language Research, Tufts University.&lt;/ref&gt;  The inability to do so is called illiteracy or analphabetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/analphabetism|title=analphabetism {{!}} Definition of analphabetism in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) defines literacy as the "ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute, using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts. Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their community and wider society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001362/136246e.pdf|title=The Plurality of Literacy and its implications for Policies and Programs|journal=UNESCO Education Sector Position Paper|year=2004|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistoric literacy===

====Origins of literacy====
Literacy is  emerged with the development of [[numeracy]]  and computational devices as early as 8,000 BCE. Script developed independently at least five times in human history [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], the [[Indus civilization]], lowland [[Mesoamerica]], and [[China]].&lt;ref name=camb&gt;Chrisomalis, Stephen (2009), "The Origins and Coevolution of Literacy and Numeracy", in Olsen, D. &amp; Torrance, N. (Eds.), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Literacy'' (pp. 59-74). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Writing Systems |url=http://hkotek.com/teaching/intro2015/week5-writing-systems.pdf |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bill of sale Louvre AO3765.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Bill of sale of a male slave and a building in Shuruppak, [[Sumer]]ian tablet, circa 2600 BC]]
The earliest forms of [[Writing|written communication]] originated in [[Serbia]] ([[Vinča culture]]), followed by [[Sumer]], located in southern Mesopotamia about 3500-3000 BCE. During this era, literacy was "a largely functional matter, propelled by the need to manage the new quantities of information and the new type of governance created by trade and large scale production".&lt;ref&gt;Easton, P. (in press). "History and spread of literacy", Excerpted from ''Sustaining Literacy in Africa: Developing a Literate Environment'', Paris: UNESCO Press pp. 46-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing systems in Mesopotamia first emerged from a recording system in which people used impressed token markings to manage trade and agricultural production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmandt-Besserat | first1 = D | year = 1978 | title = The earliest precursor of writing | url = | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 238 | issue = 6| pages = 38–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The token system served as a precursor to early [[cuneiform]] writing once people began recording information on clay tablets. [[Cuneiform script|Proto-cuneiform]] texts exhibit not only numerical signs, but also [[ideograms]] depicting objects being counted.&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;

[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] emerged from 3300-3100 BCE and depicted royal iconography that emphasized power amongst other elites. The Egyptian hieroglyphic writing system was the first notation system to have [[phonetic]] values.

Writing in lowland Mesoamerica was first put into practice by the [[Olmec]] and [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] civilizations in 900-400 BCE. These civilizations used [[glyph]]ic writing and bar-and-dot numerical notation systems for purposes related to royal iconography and calendar systems.

The earliest written notations in China date back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] in 1200 BCE. These systematic notations were found inscribed on bones and recorded sacrifices made, tributes received, and animals hunted, which were activities of the elite. These oracle-bone inscriptions were the early ancestors of modern Chinese script and contained [[logosyllabic]] script and numerals.

[[Indus script]] is largely pictorial and has not been deciphered yet. It may or may not include abstract signs. It is thought that they wrote from right to left and that the script is thought to be [[logographic]]. Because it has not been deciphered, linguists disagree on whether it is a complete and independent writing system; however, it is genuinely thought to be an independent writing system that emerged in the [[Harappa]] culture.

These examples indicate that early acts of literacy were closely tied to power and chiefly used for management practices, and probably less than 1% of the population was literate, as it was confined to a very small ruling elite.

====Origins of the alphabet====
According to [[social anthropologist]] [[Jack Goody]], there are two interpretations that regard the origin of the alphabet. Many classical scholars, such as historian [[Ignace Gelb]], credit the Ancient Greeks for creating the first alphabetic system (c. 750 BCE) that used distinctive signs for consonants and vowels. But Goody contests, "The importance of Greek culture of the subsequent history of Western Europe has led to an over-emphasis, by [[Classics|classicists]] and others, on the addition of specific [[vowel]] signs to the set of [[consonant]]al ones that had been developed earlier in Western Asia".&lt;ref&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 40-41. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, many scholars argue that the [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] of northern [[Canaan]] (modern-day [[Syria]]) invented the [[Abjad|consonantal alphabet]] as early as 1500 BCE. Much of this theory's development is credited to English archeologist [[Flinders Petrie]], who, in 1905, came across a series of Canaanite inscriptions located in the turquoise mines of [[Serabit el-Khadem]]. Ten years later, English Egyptologist [[Alan Gardiner]] reasoned that these letters contain an alphabet, as well as references to the Canaanite goddess [[Asherah]]. In 1948, [[William F. Albright]] deciphered the text using additional evidence that had been discovered subsequent to Goody's findings. This included a series of inscriptions from [[Ugarit]], discovered in 1929 by French archaeologist [[Claude F. A. Schaeffer]]. Some of these inscriptions were mythological texts (written in an early Canaanite dialect) that consisted of a 32-letter [[cuneiform]] consonantal alphabet.

Another significant discovery was made in 1953 when three arrowheads were uncovered, each containing identical Canaanite inscriptions from twelfth century BCE. According to [[Frank Moore Cross]], these inscriptions consisted of alphabetic signs that originated during the transitional development from pictographic script to a linear alphabet. Moreover, he asserts, "These inscriptions also provided clues to extend the decipherment of earlier and later alphabetic texts".&lt;ref name="Cross, Frank Moore 1980 p. 1-20"&gt;Cross, Frank Moore, "Newly Found Inscriptions in Old Canaanite and Early Phoenician Scripts", ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'', No. 238 (Spring, 1980) p. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consonantal system of the Canaanite script inspired alphabetical developments in subsequent systems. During the Late [[Bronze Age]], successor alphabets appeared throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region and were employed for [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]].

According to Goody, these cuneiform scripts may have influenced the development of the Greek alphabet several centuries later. Historically, the Greeks contended that their writing system was modeled after the Phoenicians. However, many Semitic scholars now believe that [[Ancient Greek]] is more consistent with an early form Canaanite that was used c. 1100 BCE. While the earliest Greek inscriptions are dated c. eighth century BCE, [[Epigraphy|epigraphical]] comparisons to [[Proto-Canaanite]] suggest that the Greeks may have adopted the consonantal alphabet as early as 1100 BCE, and later "added in five characters to represent vowels".&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 p. 40-49"&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 40-49. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenician, which is considered to contain the first [[list of writing systems|"linear alphabet"]], rapidly spread to the Mediterranean port cities in northern [[Canaan]].&lt;ref name="Cross, Frank Moore 1980 p. 1-20"/&gt; Some archeologists believe that Phoenician scripture had some influence on the developments of the Hebrew and Aramaic alphabets based on the fact that these languages evolved during the same time period, share similar features, and are commonly categorized into the same language group.&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, P. Kyle. "The Early Diffusion of the Alphabet", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' 37, No. 3 (Sep. 1974): 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Israelites migrated to Canaan between 1200 and 1001 BCE, they also adopted a variation of the Canaanite alphabet. [[Baruch ben Neriah]], Jeremiah's scribe, used this alphabet to create the later scripts of the [[Old Testament]]. The Early Hebrew alphabet was prominent in the Mediterranean region until [[Neo-Babylonian|Chaldean Babylonian]] rulers exiled the Jews to [[Babylon]] in the sixth century BCE. It was then that the new script ("Square Hebrew") emerged and the older one rapidly died out.&lt;ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 p. 40-49"/&gt;

The [[Aramaic alphabet]] also emerged sometime between 1200 and 1001 BCE. As the [[Bronze Age collapse]]d, the [[Aramaeans]] moved into Canaan and Phoenician territories and adopted their scripts. Although early evidence of this writing is scarce, archeologists have uncovered a wide range of later Aramaic texts, written as early as the seventh century BCE. Due to its longevity and prevalence in the region, Achaemenid rulers would come to adopt it as a "diplomatic language".&lt;ref&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 50. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Aramaic alphabet rapidly spread east to the Kingdom of Nabataea, then to [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], eventually making its way to [[Africa]]. Aramaic merchants carried older variations of the language as far as [[India]], where it later influenced the development of [[Brahmi]] scripture. It also led to the developments of [[Arabic]], [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (an Iranian adaptation), "as well as for a range of alphabets used by early Turkish and Mongol tribes in [[Siberia]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Turkestan]]".&lt;ref&gt;Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 49-51. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Literacy at this period spread with the merchant classes and may have grown to number 15-20% of the total population.

The Aramaic language would die out with the spread of [[Islam]] and with it, its influence of Arabic.

===Ancient and post-classical literacy===
{{Further information|Latin alphabet}}
Until recently it was thought that the majority of people were illiterate in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: {{Cite book |title=Ancient literacy |last=Harris |first=William V. |date=1991 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674033818 |edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk. |location=Cambridge, MA |oclc=436359723}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent work challenges this perception.&lt;ref&gt;See Brian J. Wright, "Ancient Literacy in New Testament Research: Incorporating a Few More Lines of Enquiry," TrinJ 36 (2015): 161-189. https://www.academia.edu/13211795/_Ancient_Literacy_in_New_Testament_Research_Incorporating_a_Few_More_Lines_of_Enquiry_TrinJ_36_2015_161-189&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony DiRenzo asserts that [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman society]] was "a civilization based on the book and the register", and "no one, either free or slave, could afford to be illiterate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Di Renzo | first1 = Anthony | year = 2000 | title = His master's voice: Tiro and the rise of the roman secretarial class | url = http://faculty.ithaca.edu/direnzo/docs/scholarship/mastersvoice.pdf| journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 | doi=10.2190/b4yd-5fp7-1w8d-v3uc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Dupont points out, "The written word was all around them, in both public and private life: laws, calendars, regulations at shrines, and funeral epitaphs were engraved in stone or bronze. The Republic amassed huge archives of reports on every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Dupont, Florence. (1989) ''Daily Life in Ancient Rome'' Tr. Christopher Woodall. Oxford: Blackwell; p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial civilian administration produced masses of documentation used in judicial, fiscal and administrative matters as did the municipalities. The army kept extensive records relating to supply and duty rosters and submitted reports. Merchants, shippers, and landowners (and their personal staffs) especially of the larger enterprises must have been literate.    

In the late fourth century the [[Desert Father]] [[Pachomius]] would expect literacy of a candidate for admission to his monasteries:
&lt;blockquote&gt;they shall give him twenty Psalms or two of the Apostles' epistles or some other part of Scripture. And if he is illiterate he shall go at the first, third and sixth hours to someone who can teach and has been appointed for him. He shall stand before him and learn very studiously and with all gratitude. The fundamentals of a syllable, the verbs and nouns shall all be written for him and even if he does not want to he shall be compelled to read.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pachomius]], Rule 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the course of the 4th and 5th century the Churches made efforts to ensure a better clergy in particular among the bishops who were expected to have a classical education, which was the hallmark of an socially acceptable person in higher society (and possession of which allayed the fears of the pagan elite that their cultural inheritance would be destroyed). Even after the remnants of the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in the 470s literacy continued to be a distinguishing mark of the elite as communications skills were still important in political and Church life (bishops were largely drawn from the senatorial class) in a new cultural synthesis that made "Christianity the Roman religion," &lt;ref&gt;Jas Elsner, Imperial Rome and Christian Triumph, 1998, p. 141, {{ISBN|0-19-284201-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, these skills were less in needed than previously in the absence of the large imperial administrative apparatus whose middle and top echelons the elite had dominated as if by right. Even so, in pre-modern times it is unlikely that literacy was found in more than about 30-40% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;This connection is pursued in [[Alan K. Bowman]] and [[Greg Woolf]], eds., ''Literacy and Power in the Ancient World'', (Cambridge) 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest percentage of literacy during the Dark Ages was among the clergy and monks who supplied much of the staff needed to administer the states of western Europe. 

Post-Antiquity illiteracy was made much worse due to a lack of suitable writing medium. When the Western Roman Empire collapsed, the import of [[papyrus]] to Europe ceased. Since papyrus perishes easily and does not last well in the wetter or damper European climate, the alternative was [[parchment]] which was expensive and accessible only by the Church and upper layers of the society. Once [[paper]] was introduced into Europe in the 11th century in Spain. Its use spread north slowly over the next four centuries. Increased literacy saw a resurgence because of its use. By the 15th century paper had largely replaced parchment except for many luxury manuscripts (some of which used paper). 

The [[Reformation]] stressed the importance of literacy and being able to read the Bible. The Protestant countries were the first to attain full literacy; [[Scandinavia]]n countries were fully literate in the early 17th century. The Church{{which|date=October 2018}} demanded literacy as the pre-requisite for [[marriage]] in [[Sweden]]{{when|date=October 2018}}, this further propagating full literacy.

==Modern literacy==

=== Spread of literacy since the mid-twentieth century ===
[[File:Figure 1 Adult literacy rates have increased Reading the past writing the futureUPDATED.svg|thumb|Adult literacy rates have increased at a constant pace since 1950.]]
Literacy data published by [[UNESCO]] displays that since 1950, the adult literacy rate at the world level has increased by 5 percentage points every decade on average, from 55.7 per cent in 1950 to 86.2 per cent in 2015. However, for four decades, the population growth was so rapid that the number of illiterate adults kept increasing, rising from 700 million in 1950 to 878 million in 1990. Since then, the number has fallen markedly to 745 million in 2015, although it remains higher than in 1950 despite decades of universal education policies, literacy interventions and the spread of print material and information and communications technology (ICT). However, these trends have been far from uniform across regions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Regional disparities ===
Available global data indicates significant variations in literacy rates between world regions. [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[West Asia]], and [[Central Asia]] have achieved almost full adult literacy (individuals at or over the age of 15) for both men and women. Most countries in [[East Asia and the Pacific]], as well as [[Latin America and the Caribbean]], are above a 90% literacy rate for adults.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|date=September 2015|title=Adult and Youth Literacy|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/literacy/Documents/fs32-2015-literacy.pdf|journal=UIS Fact Sheet|volume=No. 32|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy persists to a greater extent in other regions: 2013 [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]] (UIS) data indicates adult literacy rates of only, 67.55% in [[South Asia]] and [[North Africa]], 59.76% in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?queryid=166#)|title=Education : Literacy rate|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org|access-date=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Figure 5 Literacy has rapidly spread Reading the past writing the future.svg|left|thumb|Literacy has rapidly spread in several regions over the last twenty-five years.]]
In much of the world, high youth literacy rates suggest that illiteracy will become less and less common as younger generations with higher educational attainment levels replace older ones.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee.

Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO. p. 105. {{ISBN|978-1-4408-3223-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where the vast majority of the world's illiterate youth live, lower school enrollment implies that illiteracy will persist to a greater degree.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee. (2016).

That being said, literacy has rapidly spread in several regions in the last twenty-five years (see image).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Gender disparities ===
[[File:Figure 4 Progress towards gender parity Reading the past writing the future.svg|thumb|Gender parity indices in youth literacy rates by region, 1990–2015. Progress towards gender parity in literacy started after 1990.]]
On a worldwide scale, illiteracy disproportionately impacts women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oyitso|first=Mabel|last2=Olomukoro|first2=C.

This disparity was even starker in previous decades: from 1970 to 2000, the global gender gap in literacy would decrease by roughly 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dorius|first=Shawn F.|last2=Firebaugh|first2=Glenn|date=1 July 2010|title=Trends in Global Gender Inequality|url=http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/5/1941|journal=Social Forces|language=en|volume=88|issue=5|pages=1941–1968|doi=10.1353/sof.2010.0040|issn=0037-7732|pmc=3107548|pmid=21643494}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, this progress has stagnated, with the remaining gender gap holding almost constant over the last two decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In general, the gender gap in literacy is not as pronounced as the regional gap; that is, differences between countries in overall literacy are often larger than gender differences within countries.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. (2012). "[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2012/Resources/7778105-1299699968583/7786210-1315936222006/chapter-3.pdf Education and Health: Where do Gender Differences Really Matter]?" in Gender Equality and Development: World Development Report 2012. Washington, D.C: The World Bank: 114.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the gap between men and women would narrow from 1990 onwards, after the increase of male adult literacy rates at 80 per cent (see image).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247563e.pdf|title=Reading the past, writing the future: Fifty years of promoting literacy|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100214-4|location=|pages=21–23, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the region with the lowest overall literacy rates, also features the widest gender gap: just 52% of adult females are literate, and 68% among adult men. Similar gender disparity persists in two other regions, [[North Africa]] (86% adult male literacy, 70% adult female literacy) and South Asia (77% adult male literacy, 58% adult female literacy).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1990 World Conference on [[Education For All|Education for All]], held in Jomtien, Thailand, would bring attention to the literacy gender gap and prompt many developing countries to prioritize women's literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWz6mAEACAAJ|title=Gender, Literacy, and Empowerment in Morocco|last=Agnaou|first=Fatima|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415947657|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past decade, global development agendas would increasingly address the issue of female literacy. For example, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] would center his 2010 [[International Literacy Day]] speech around the theme "Empowering Women Through Literacy Empowers Us All," emphasizing the broad societal progress that higher female literacy rates could promote.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In many contexts, female illiteracy co-exists with other aspects of gender inequality. [[Martha Nussbaum]], for example, make illiterate women more vulnerable to becoming trapped in an abusive marriage, given that illiteracy limits their employment opportunities and worsens their [[intra-household bargaining]] position. Moreover, Nussbaum links literacy to the potential for women to effectively communicate and collaborate with one another in order "to participate in a larger movement for political change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|date=1 January 2004|title=Women's Education: A Global Challenge|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=29|issue=2|pages=332–333|doi=10.1086/378571|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Challenges of increasing female literacy ====

Social barriers prevent expanding literacy skills among women and girls. Making literacy classes available can be ineffective when it conflicts with the use of the valuable limited time of women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=M. Anne|last2=King|first2=Elizabeth|date=1 July 1995|title=Women's education and economic well-being|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=1|issue=2|pages=21–46|doi=10.1080/714042230|issn=1354-5701}}&lt;/ref&gt; School age girls, in many contexts, face stronger expectations than their male counterparts to perform household work and care after younger siblings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Generational dynamics can also perpetuate these disparities: illiterate parents may not readily appreciate the value of literacy for their daughters, particularly in traditional, rural societies with expectations that girls will remain at home.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Mekhlafy, Tawfiq A. (2008). "[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099080014368/DID_Girls_edu.pdf Strategies for Gender Equality in Basic and Secondary Education: A Comprehensive and Integrated Approach in the Republic of Yemen]."

A 2015 [[World Bank]] and the [[International Center for Research on Women]] review of academic literature would conclude that [[child marriage]], which predominantly impacts girls, tends to reduce literacy levels.&lt;ref&gt;Wodon, Quentin, et al.

==== Gender gap for boys in developed countries ====

While women and girls comprise the majority of the global illiterate population, in many developed countries a literacy gender gap exists in the opposite direction. Data from the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) has consistently indicated the literacy underachievement of boys within member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Anne|last2=Kehler|first2=Michael|last3=Martino|first3=Wayne|date=1 February 2010|title=The Problem of Boys' Literacy Underachievement: Raising Some Questions|journal=Journal of Adolescent &amp; Adult Literacy|language=en|volume=53|issue=5|pages=356–361|doi=10.1598/JAAL.53.5.1|issn=1936-2706}}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of such findings, many education specialists have recommended changes in classroom practices to better accommodate boys' learning styles, and to remove any gender stereotypes that may create a perception of reading and writing as feminine activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Senn|first=Nicole|date=1 November 2012|title=Effective Approaches to Motivate and Engage Reluctant Boys in Literacy|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=66|issue=3|pages=211–220|doi=10.1002/TRTR.01107|issn=1936-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZHAAAAACAAJ|title=Me Read?

===Socioeconomic impact===
Many policy analysts consider literacy rates as a crucial measure of the value of a region's [[human capital]]. For example, literate people can be more easily trained than illiterate people, and generally have a higher socioeconomic status;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thephonicspage.org/On%20Phonics/profitable.html|title = Phonics. It's Profitable|website=The Phonics Page |accessdate = 11 December 2007|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus they enjoy better health and employment prospects. The international community has come to consider literacy as a key facilitator and goal of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Vasudeva|last2=S|first2=B.|last3=Gupta|first3=P. Viswanadha|title=Low Female Literacy: Factors and Strategies|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ797610|journal=Australian Journal of Adult Learning|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=84–95|issn=1443-1394|date=2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] adopted by the UN in 2015, the [[UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning]] h&lt;nowiki/&gt;as declared the "central role of literacy in responding to sustainable development challenges such as health, social equality, economic empowerment and environmental sustainability."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED564012|title=Transforming Our World: Literacy for Sustainable Development|last=Hanemann|first=Ulrike|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning|isbn=9789282012000|page=7|language=en|date=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health impacts ===
Illiterate people are generally less knowledgeable about hygiene and nutritional practices, an unawareness which can exacerbate a wide range of health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puchner|first=Laurel D.|date=1 July 1995|title=Literacy links: Issues in the relationship between early childhood development, health, women, families, and literacy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/073805939400041M|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=15|issue=3|pages=307–319|doi=10.1016/0738-0593(94)00041-M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within developing countries in particular, literacy rates also have implications for [[child mortality]]; in these contexts, children of literate mothers are 50% more likely to live past age 5 than children of illiterate mothers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldliteracyfoundation.org//wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WLF-FINAL-ECONOMIC-REPORT.pdf|title=The Economic and Social Cost of Illiteracy: A Snapshot of Illiteracy in a Global Context|date=24 August 2015|website=|publisher=World Literacy Foundation|access-date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public health research has thus increasingly concerned itself with the potential for literacy skills to allow women to more successfully access health care systems, and thereby facilitate gains in child health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeVine|first=Robert A.|last2=Rowe|first2=Meredith L.|title=Maternal Literacy and Child Health in Less-Developed Countries: Evidence, Processes, and Limitations|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00004703-200908000-00012|journal=Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=340–349|doi=10.1097/dbp.0b013e3181b0eeff|pmid=19672161|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a 2014 descriptive research survey project correlates literacy levels with the socioeconomic status of women in Oyo State, Nigeria. The study claims that developing literacy in this area will bring "economic empowerment and will encourage rural women to practice hygiene, which will in turn lead to the reduction of birth and death rates."&lt;ref&gt;OKOJI, O. F., &amp; LADEJI, O. O. (2014). Influence of Adult Literacy Education on Socio-Economic Empowerment of Rural Women in Oyo State, Nigeria. Gender &amp; Behaviour, 12(3), 6016-6026.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic impacts ===
Literacy can increase job opportunities and access to [[higher education]]. In 2009, the National Adult Literacy agency (NALA) in [[Ireland]] commissioned a cost benefit analysis of adult literacy training. This concluded that there were economic gains for the individuals, the companies they worked for, and the Exchequer, as well as the economy and the country as a whole—for example, increased [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nala.ie/sites/default/files/press_release_image-2010-March/files/Policy%20Brief%20on%20Adult%20Literacy%20Strategy%202009.pdf |title=nala.ie |format=PDF |accessdate=23 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723224750/http://www.nala.ie/sites/default/files/press_release_image-2010-March/files/Policy%20Brief%20on%20Adult%20Literacy%20Strategy%202009.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] and coauthors have revealed a rather significant correlation between the level of literacy in the early 19th century and successful modernization and economic breakthroughs in the late 20th century, as "literate people could be characterized by a greater innovative-activity level, which provides opportunities for modernization, development, and economic growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Korotayev | first1 = Andrey | last2 = Zinkina | first2 = Julia | last3 = Bogevolnov | first3 = Justislav | last4 = Malkov | first4 = Artemy | title = Global Unconditional Convergence among Larger Economies after 1998? | url = http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140671/| journal = Journal of Globalization Studies | volume = 2 | issue = 2| year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literacy promotion efforts ===
While informal learning within the home can play an important role in literacy development, gains in childhood literacy often occur in primary school settings. Continuing the global expansion of public education is thus a frequent focus of literacy advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee. (2016).

&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of broad improvements in education often require centralized efforts undertaken by national governments; alternatively, local literacy projects implemented by NGOs can play an important role, particularly in rural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckman|first=Paula J.|last2=Gallo|first2=Jessica|date=October 2015|title=Rural Education in a Global Context|url=http://ger.mercy.edu/index.php/ger/article/view/238|journal=Global Education Review|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|page=7|issn=2325-663X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for both youth and adult literacy programs often comes from large international development organizations. [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], for example, steered donors like the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] and the [[Global Partnership for Education]] toward the issue of childhood literacy by developing the [https://www.eddataglobal.org/reading/ Early Grade Reading Assessment].&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Lesley and Julia Frazier (2015). "Literacy and Development." In ''Routledge Handbook of International Education and Development''. Edited by Simon McGrath and Qing Gu. {{ISBN|1317752236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy groups like the [[NIACE|National Institute of Adult Continuing Education]] have frequently called upon international organizations such as UNESCO, the [[International Labour Organization]], the [[World Health Organization]], and the [[World Bank]] to prioritize support for adult women's literacy.&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (2012). ''[http://www.learningandwork.org.uk/sites/niace_en/files/document-downloads/womensrighttoliteracy_web.pdf Women's Right to Literacy: Advocating Women's Right to Access Learning Literacy through International Development].'' Leicester: NIACE.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to increase adult literacy often encompass other development priorities as well; for example, initiatives in [[Ethiopia]], [[Morocco]], and [[India]] have combined adult literacy programs with vocational skills trainings in order to encourage enrollment and address the complex needs of women and other marginalized groups who lack economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning (2013).

In 2013, the [[UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning]] published a set of case studies&lt;ref&gt;{{URL|http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002225/222588e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; on programs that successfully improved female literacy rates. The report features countries from a variety of regions and of differing income levels, reflecting the general global consensus on "the need to empower women through the acquisition of literacy skills."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning (2013). "[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002225/222588e.pdf Literacy Programmes with a Focus on Women to Reduce Gender Disparities]." Hamburg: UIL. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the impetus for UNESCO's focus on literacy is a broader effort to respond to globalization and "the shift towards knowledge-based societies" that it has produced.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2006). "[http://www.unesco.org/education/GMR2006/full/chapt7_eng.pdf Mapping the Global Literacy Challenge]." In ''Education for All Global Monitoring Report''. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; While globalization presents emerging challenges, it also provides new opportunities: many education and development specialists are hopeful that new information and communications technologies (ICTs) will have the potential to expand literacy learning opportunities for children and adults, even those in countries that have historically struggled to improve literacy rates through more conventional means.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee.

=== Literacy as a development indicator ===
The [[Human Development Index]], produced by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), uses education as one of its three indicators; originally, adult literacy represented two-thirds of this education index weight. In 2010, however, the UNDP replaced the adult literacy measure with mean years of schooling. A 2011 UNDP research paper framed this change as a way to "ensure current relevance," arguing that gains in global literacy already achieved between 1970 and 2010 meant that literacy would be "unlikely to be as informative of the future."&lt;ref&gt;Klugman, Jeni, Francisco Rodriguez, and Hyung-Jin Choi. (April 2011). "[http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdrp_2011_01.pdf The HDI 2010: New Controversies, Old Critiques]." ''United Nations Development Programme''. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, however, have since warned against overlooking the importance of literacy as an indicator and a goal for development, particularly for marginalized groups such as women and rural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stromquist|first=Nelly|title=Adult Literacy and Women: A Present Account|url=http://journals.uncc.edu/index.php/DSJ/article/view/506|journal=Dialogues in Social Justice: An Adult Education Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literacy as a human right ===
Unlike medieval times, when reading and writing skills were restricted to a few elites and the clergy, these literacy skills are now expected from every member of a society. &lt;ref&gt;"Sitwe Benson Mkandwire."

As supported by the 1996 Report of the International Commission on Education for the Twenty-First Century, and the 1997 Hamburg Declaration: ‘Literacy, broadly conceived as the basic knowledge and skills needed by all in a rapidly changing world, is a fundamental human right. (...) There are millions, the majority of whom are women, who lack opportunities to learn or who have insufficient skills to be able to assert this right. The challenge is to enable them to do so. This will often imply the creation of preconditions for learning through awareness raising and empowerment. Literacy is also a catalyst for participation in social, cultural, political and economic activities, and for learning throughout life’.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO 1997.

== U.S. public library efforts to promote literacy ==
The [[public library]] has long been a force promoting literacy in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Public Librarianship |author=McCook, Kathleen de la Peña |year=2011 |location=New York |publisher=Neal-Schuman |pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. context, the [[American Library Association]] promotes literacy through the work of the Office for Literacy and Outreach Services.

===30 April: Dia! Diversity in Action===

Dia! Which stand for Diversity in Action and is also known as "El Dia de los Ninos/El dia de los libros (Children's Day/Book Day)" is a program which celebrates the importance of reading to children from all cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Dia! is celebrated every year on 30 April in schools, libraries, and homes and this website provides tools and programs to encourage reading in children. Parents, caregivers, and educators can even start a book club.&lt;ref&gt;Mora, P. (1 January 2013). Dia! Diversity in Action Dia de los ninos, dia de los libros | Dia!

===READ/Orange County===

This community literacy program was initiated in 1992 by the [[Orange County Public Libraries|Orange County Public Library]] in [[California]].  The mission of READ/Orange County is to "create a more literate community by providing diversified services of the highest quality to all who seek them." Potential tutors train during an extensive 23-hour tutor training workshop in which they learn the philosophy, techniques and tools they will need to work with adult learns.&lt;ref name="Selnick, S." /&gt; After the training, the tutors invest at least 50 hours a year to tutoring their student.The organization builds on people's experience as well as education rather than trying to make up for what has not been learned. The program seeks to equip students with skills to continue learning in the future.&lt;ref name="Selnick, S." /&gt; The guiding philosophy is that an adult who learns to read creates a [[ripple effect]] in the community.  The person becomes an example to children and grandchildren and can better serve the community.

===BoulderReads!===

Located in [[Boulder, Colorado]], the program recognized the difficulty that students had in obtaining child care while attending tutoring sessions, and joined with the University of Colorado to provide reading buddies to the children of students. Reading Buddies matches children of adult literacy students with college students who meet with them once a week throughout the semester for an hour and a half. The college students receive course credit to try to enhance the quality and reliability of their time.&lt;ref name="Sherry, D."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherry | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = ["Providing reading buddies for the children of adult literacy students: One way to provide onsite child care while also addressing intergenerational illiteracy"] | url = | journal = Colorado Libraries | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 40–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Reading Buddies session focuses primarily on the [[college student]] reading aloud with the child. The goal is to help the child gain interest in books and feel comfortable reading aloud. Time is also spent on word games, writing letters, or searching for books in the library. Throughout the semester the pair work on writing and illustrating a book together. The college student's grade is partly dependent on the completion of the book. Although Reading Buddies began primarily as an answer to the lack of child care for literacy students, it has evolved into another aspect of the program.&lt;ref name="Sherry, D." /&gt; Participating children show marked improvement in their reading and writing skills throughout the semester.

===Hillsborough Literacy Council (HLC)===

Approximately 120,000 adults in Hillsborough County are illiterate or read below the fourth-grade level. Working since 1986, the HLC is "committed to improving literacy by empowering adults through education".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hillsboroughliteracy.org Hillsborough Literacy Council], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsored by the statewide Florida Literacy Coalition, HLC strives to improve the literacy ability of adults in [[Hillsborough County, Florida]]. The HLC provides tutoring for [[English as a second or foreign language|English for speakers of other languages]] (ESOL). Through one-on-one tutoring, the organization works to help adult students reach at least the fifth-grade level.

==Broader and complementary definitions==
Traditionally, literacy is the ability to use written language actively and passively; one definition of literacy is the ability to "read, write, spell, listen, and speak".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Moats, Louisa |title=Speech to print: language essentials for teachers |publisher=Paul H.

Some have argued that the definition of literacy should be expanded. For example, in the [[United States]], the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] and the [[International Reading Association]] have added "visually representing"{{clarify|date=July 2012}} to the traditional list of competencies. Similarly, in [[Scotland]], literacy has been defined as: "The ability to read, write and use numeracy, to handle information, to express ideas and opinions, to make decisions and solve problems, as family members, workers, citizens and lifelong learners".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/158952/0043191.pdf Adult Literacy and Numeracy in Scotland]" (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued that literacy includes the cultural, political, and historical contexts of the community in which communication takes place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michele Knobel]] (1999). ''Everyday Literacies: Students, Discourse, and Social Practice'', New York: Lang&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gee, J.&amp;nbsp;P. (1996). ''Social Linguistics and Literacies: Ideologies in Discourses'' Philadelphia: Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt;

A basic literacy standard in many places is the ability to read the newspaper. Increasingly, communication in commerce and in general requires the ability to use computers and other digital technologies. Since the 1990s, when the [[Internet]] came into wide use in the United States, some have asserted that the definition of literacy should include the ability to use tools such as [[web browser]]s, [[word processing]] programs, and [[text message]]s. Similar expanded skill sets have been called [[multimedia literacy]], [[computer literacy]], [[information literacy]], and [[technological literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Kress, Gunther R. |title=Literacy in the new media age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-415-25356-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/reviews/charlton/Kress.htm |title=Literacy in the New Media Age |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars propose the idea multiliteracies which includes Functional Literacy, [[Critical literacy|Critical Literacy]], and Rhetorical Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Stuart Selber |title=Multiliteracies for a Digital Age |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8093-2551-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Arts literacy" programs exist in some places in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=McKenna, Michael C. |author2=Richards, Janet C. |title=Integrating multiple literacies in K-8 classrooms: cases, commentaries, and practical applications |publisher=L.&amp;nbsp;Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, NJ |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8058-3945-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Visual literacy]] also includes the ability to understand visual forms of communication such as [[body language]], pictures, maps, and video.&lt;ref&gt;An inability to "read" body language is one of the features of [[autism]].&lt;/ref&gt; Evolving definitions of literacy often include all the symbol systems relevant to a particular community.

Other genres under study by academia include [[critical literacy]], [[media literacy]], [[ecological literacy]] and [[health literacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Zarcadoolas, C., Pleasant, A., &amp; Greer, D. (2006). ''Advancing health literacy: A framework for understanding and action''. Jossey-Bass: San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing emphasis on evidence-based decision making, and the use of statistical graphics and information, [[statistical literacy]] is becoming a very important aspect of literacy in general. The International Statistical Literacy Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~iase/islp/|title=ISLP — Home|website=www.stat.auckland.ac.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; is dedicated to the promotion of statistical literacy among all members of society.

Given that a large part of the benefits of literacy can be obtained by having access to a literate person in the household, some recent literature in economics, starting with the work of Kaushik Basu and James Foster, distinguishes between a "proximate illiterate" and an "isolated illiterate". The former refers to an illiterate person who lives in a household with literates and the latter to an illiterate who lives in a household of all illiterates. What is of concern is that many people in poor nations are not just illiterates but isolated illiterates.

==Teaching literacy==
{{main article|Learning to read}}
{{globalize|section|date=April 2011}}
Teaching English literacy in the [[United States]] is dominated by a focus on a set of discrete decoding skills. From this perspective, literacy—or, rather, reading—comprises a number of subskills that can be taught to students. These skill sets include [[phonological awareness]], [[phonics|phonics (decoding)]], [[fluency]], [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]], and [[vocabulary]]. Mastering each of these subskills is necessary for students to become proficient readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|title = Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and its Implications for Reading Instruction: Reports of the Subgroups|publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office|year = 2000|ref = harv|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this same perspective, readers of [[alphabetic language]]s must understand the [[alphabetic principle]] to master basic reading skills. For this purpose a writing system is "alphabetic" if it uses symbols to represent [[phoneme|individual language sounds]],&lt;ref name="sedl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Reading Terms - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |publisher=Sedl.org |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the degree of correspondence between letters and sounds varies between alphabetic languages. [[Syllabary|Syllabic writing systems]] (such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]]) use a symbol to represent a single syllable, and [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] (such as [[Written Chinese|Chinese]]) use a symbol to represent a [[morpheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Halsall |url=http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/chinlng4.html |title=Chinese Cultural Studies: Chinese Logographic Writing |publisher=Acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are any number of approaches to teaching literacy&lt;ref&gt;Carter, V. Elaine. (November 2000). [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001257/125767eb.pdf “New approaches to literacy learning: A guide for teacher educators.”] UNESCO. www.un.org/ga/president/62/ThematicDebates/adn/crimeimpedimentsd.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;; each is shaped by its informing assumptions about what literacy is and how it is best learned by students. [[Phonics]] instruction, for example, focuses on reading at the level of the word. It teaches readers to observe and interpret the letters or groups of letters that make up words. A common method of teaching phonics is [[synthetic phonics]], in which a novice reader pronounces each individual sound and "blends" them to pronounce the whole word. Another approach is embedded phonics instruction, used more often in [[whole language]] reading instruction, in which novice readers learn about the individual letters in words on a just-in-time, just-in-place basis that is tailored to meet each student's reading and writing learning needs.&lt;ref name="sedl" /&gt; That is, teachers provide phonics instruction opportunistically, within the context of stories or student writing that feature many instances of a particular letter or group of letters. Embedded instruction combines letter-sound knowledge with the use of meaningful context to read new and difficult words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/glossary#E |title=Glossary |publisher=LD OnLine |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques such as [[directed listening and thinking activity|directed listening and thinking activities]] can be used to aid children in learning how to read and [[reading comprehension]].

In a 2012 proposal, it has been claimed that reading can be acquired naturally if print is constantly available at an early age in the same manner as spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Massaro | first1 = D. W. | year = 2012 | title = Acquiring Literacy Naturally: Behavioral science and technology could empower preschool children to learn to read naturally without instruction | url = http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2012/4/acquiring-literacy-naturally| journal = American Scientist | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 324–333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If an appropriate form of written text is made available before formal schooling begins, reading should be learned inductively, emerge naturally, and with no significant negative consequences. This proposal challenges the commonly held belief that written language requires formal instruction and schooling. Its success would change current views of literacy and schooling. Using developments in behavioral science and technology, an interactive system (Technology Assisted Reading Acquisition, TARA) would enable young pre-literate children to accurately perceive and learn properties of written language by simple exposure to the written form.

In Australia a number of State governments have introduced Reading Challenges to improve literacy. The Premier's Reading Challenge in South Australia, launched by Premier Mike Rann has one of the highest participation rates in the world for reading challenges. It has been embraced by more than 95% of public, private and religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;Center for National Policy, Washington DC, What States Can Do, 2 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-conflict settings===

Programs have been implemented in regions that have an ongoing conflict or in a post-conflict stage. The Norwegian Refugee Council Pack program has been used in 13 post-conflict countries since 2003. The program organizers believe that daily routines and other wise predictable activities help the transition from war to peace.  Learners can select one area in vocational training for a year-long period.  They complete required courses in agriculture, life skills, literacy and numeracy.  Results have shown that active participation and management of the members of the program are important to the success of the program. These programs share the use of integrated basic education, e.g. literacy, numeracy, scientific knowledge, local history and culture, native and mainstream language skills, and apprenticeships.&lt;ref name=Bernhardt/&gt;

===Teaching non-native users===
Although there is considerable awareness that language deficiencies (lacking proficiency) are disadvantageous to immigrants settling in a new country, there appears to be a lack of pedagogical approaches that address the instruction of literacy to migrant English language learners (ELLs). Harvard scholar Catherine Snow (2001) called for a gap to be addresses: "The TESOL field needs a concerted research effort to inform literacy instruction for such children ... to determine when to start literacy instruction and how to adapt it to the LS reader's needs".&lt;ref&gt;Snow, C. (2001). Learning to Read in an L2.TESOL Quarterly: 35:4 599-601&lt;/ref&gt; The scenario becomes more complex when there is no choice in such decisions as in the case of the current migration trends with citizens from the Middle East and Africa being relocated to English majority nations due to various political or social reasons. Recent developments to address the gap in teaching literacy to second or foreign language learners has been ongoing and promising results have been shown by Pearson and Pellerine (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Pearson and Pellerine (2010) Teaching for Understanding in Higher Education: A Framework for Developing Literacy within a TESOL Context. http://marifa.hct.ac.ae/2010/100&lt;/ref&gt; which integrates Teaching for Understanding, a curricular framework from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. A series of pilot projects had been carried out in the Middle East and Africa (see Patil, 2016).&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canadian-teacher-literacy-visual-arts-1.3635661|title=How an educator from Nova Scotia uses cameras to teach English in Ethiopia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work significant interest from the learners perspective have been noticed through the integration of visual arts as springboards for literacy oriented instruction. In one case migrant women had been provided with cameras and a walking tour of their local village was provided to the instructor as the women photographed their tour focusing on places and activities that would later be used for writings about their daily life. In essence a narrative of life. Other primers for writing activities include: painting, sketching, and other craft projects (e.g. gluing activities).

[[File:Sample_sketch_of_milestone.jpg|thumb|right|Sample milestone sketch]]

A series of pilot studies were carried out to investigate alternatives to instructing literacy to migrant ELLs,&lt;ref name="stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com/altlit|title=altlit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting from simple trials aiming to test the teaching of photography to participants with no prior photography background, to isolating painting and sketching activities that could later be integrated into a larger pedagogical initiative. In efforts to develop alternative approaches for literacy instruction utilising visual arts, work was carried out with Afghan labourers, Bangladeshi tailors, Emirati media students, internal Ethiopian migrants (both labourers and university students), and a street child.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elgazette.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elgazette.com/item/296-why-every-picture-tells-a-story.html|title=Why every picture tells a story - EL Gazette|first=Andrea|last=Perez|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com"/&gt;

[[File:Migrant_Woman_Reviewing_Photography,_Making_Seletions_for_Writing.jpeg|thumb|left|Reviewing photos after photowalk]]
 
It should be pointed out that in such challenging contexts sometimes the teaching of literacy may have unforeseen barriers. The ''EL Gazette'' reported that in the trials carried out in Ethiopia, for example, it was found that all ten of the participants had problems with vision.&lt;ref name="elgazette.com"/&gt; In order to overcome this, or to avoid such challenges, preliminary health checks can help inform pre-teaching in order to better assist in the teaching/learning of literacy.

In a visual arts approach to literacy instruction a benefit can be the inclusion of both a traditional literacy approach (reading and writing) while at the same time addressing 21st Century digital literacy instruction through the inclusion of digital cameras and posting images onto the web. Many scholars&lt;ref&gt;https://calico.org/bookfiles/pdfs/DigitalLiteracies.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; feel that the inclusion of digital literacy is necessary to include under the traditional umbrella of literacy instruction specifically when engaging second language learners. (Also see: [[Digital literacy]].)&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison and
Woodward (2013). A Planning Cycle for Integrating Digital Technology Into Literacy Instruction. TOC. Volume 67, Issue 6 March 2014 Pages 455–464&lt;/ref&gt; {{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

Other ways in which visual arts have been integrated into literacy instruction for migrant populations include integrating aspects of visual art with the blending of core curricular goals.

&lt;!-- (I'm commenting this out because it is poorly written, refers to images which aren't currently part of the page, and is getting way off topic.)  In the following images a student can be seen photographing, sketching, and estimating the volume of an area (V = l * w * h). In the other image a street walk photographing elements from the periodic table can be seen, sketches based on microscopy introduce basic biology as well as provide implicit opportunities to develop language for sequencing, and in another the pupil paints a landscape to approach geography.  Also see: [[:File:Going_in_to_the_field_to_sketch.jpg]], and [[:File:Process_Painting.jpg]] --&gt;

===Teaching migrant/immigrant language users===

A more pressing challenge in education is the instruction of literacy to Migrant English Language Learners (MELLs), a term coined by Pellerine. It is not just limited to English. “Due to the growing share of immigrants in many Western societies, there has been increasing concern for the degree to which immigrants acquire language that is spoken in the destination country” (Tubergen 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Tubergen, F. (2006). Immigrant Integration: A Cross National Study. Scholarly Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering that teaching literacy to a native in their L1 can be challenging, and the challenge becomes more cognitively demanding when in a second language (L2), the task can become considerably more difficult when confronted with a migrant who has made a sudden change (migrated) and requires the second language upon arrival in the country of destination. In many instances a migrant will not have the opportunity, for many obvious reasons, to start school again at grade one and acquire the language naturally. In these situations alternative interventions need to take place.

In working with illiterate people (and individuals with low-proficiency in an L2) following the composition of some artifact like in taking a photo, sketching an event, or painting an image, a stage of orality has been seen as an effective way to understand the intention of the learner.

[[File:Including_Orality.jpg|thumb|centre|Including orality]]

In the accompanying image from left to right a) an image taken during a phototour of the participant's village. This image is of the individual at her shop, and this is one of her products that she sells, dung for cooking fuel. The image helps the interlocutor understand the realities of the participants daily life and most importantly it allows the participant the opportunity to select what they feel is important to them. b) This is an image of a student explaining and elaborating the series of milestones in her life to a group. In this image the student had a very basic ability and with some help was able to write brief captions under the images. While she speaks a recording of her story takes place to understand her story and to help develop it in the L2. The third image is of a painting that had been used with a composite in Photoshop. With further training participants can learn how to blend images they would like to therefore introducing elements of digital literacies, beneficial in many spheres of life in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer, Mark; Matuchniak, Tina (2010). "New Technology and Digital Worlds: Analyzing Evidence of Equity in Access, Use, and Outcomes". Review of Research in Education. 34: 179–225. doi:10.3102/0091732X09349791&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sample_of_alternative_process_writing_primed_with_visual_arts.jpg|thumb|right|Two sample scenarios]]

In the following image (see right) you can see two samples 1) One in Ethiopia from stencil to more developed composition based on a village tour, photography, and paintings. 2) In the Middle East at a tailor's shop focusing English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and in this example the writing has evolved from photography, sketching, and in situ exposure for the instructor (much like the village tour in sample one).

From the work based in Ethiopia, participants were asked to rate preference of activity, on a scale of 1-10. The survey prompt was: On a scale of 1 - 10 how would you rate photography as an activity that helped you get inspiration for your writing activities (think of enjoyment and usefulness). The following activities were rated, in order of preference - activities used as primers for writing:

* Photography 97%
* Oral presentations sharing your art 92%
* Process painting 84%
* Painting 82%
* Sketching 78% 
* Gluing activities 72%
* Stencil/tracing activities 60%

More research would need to be conducted to confirm such trends.

In bringing work together from students in culminating projects, authorship programs have been successful in bringing student work together in book format. Such artifacts can be used to both document learning, but more importantly reinforce language and content goals.

[[File:Covers_for_Authorship_Initiatives_to_Promote_Literacy_via_Visual_Art_with_ELLs.jpg|thumb|right|Sample covers of completed authorship created books]]

The culmination of such writings, into books can evoke both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Form feedback by students involved in such initiatives the responses have indicated that the healthy pressures of collective and collaborative work was beneficial.

===Importance===

Teaching people to read and write, in a traditional sense of the meaning (literacy) is a very complex task in a native language. To do this in a second language becomes increasingly more complex, and in the case of migrants relocating to another country there can be legal and policy driven boundaries that prohibit the naturalization and acquisition of citizen ship based on language proficiency. In Canada&lt;ref&gt;Pagtakhan (2016). Language requirement for citizenship unnecessary, Reis Pagtakhan writes: Immigrants must pass a language test to become Canadian citizens years after they arrive. CBC News, retrieved at: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/immigration-language-requirement-reis-pagtakhan-1.3568590 on 27 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; for example despite a debate, language tests are required years after settling into Canada.

The ''EL Gazette'' reviewed Pellerine's work with migrant English language learners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.elgazette.com/june-2017/the-art-of-teaching.html|title=The art of teaching - ELgazette|website=digital.elgazette.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented: "Handing English language learners a sponge and some paint and asking them to ‘paint what comes’ might not appear like a promising teaching method for a foreign language. But Canadian EL instructor and photographer Steve Pellerine has found that the technique, along with others based around the visual arts, has helped some of his most challenging groups to learn". Visual arts have been viewed as an effective way to approach literacy instruction - the art being primers for subsequent literacy tasks within a scaffolded curricular design, such at Teaching for Understanding (TfU) or Understanding by Design (UbD).

==Literacy by continent==
===Literacy in Europe===
====United Kingdom====
Nearly one in ten young adult women has poor reading and writing skills in the UK in the 21st century.  This seriously damages their employent prospects and many are trapped in poverty.  Lack of reading skill is a social stigma and women tend to hide their difficulty rather than seeking help.  Girls on average do better than boys at English in school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45435973 Kate Winslet warns of 'shame' of illiteracy#] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  A quarter of British adults would struggle to read a bus timetable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rt.com/uk/357676-literacy-britain-adults-oecd/ Illiterate Britain: 1 in 20 adults have reading age of a 5-year-old]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=====England===== 
Literacy is first documented in the area of modern England on 24 September 54 BCE, on which day [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Quintus Cicero]] wrote to [[Cicero]] "from the nearest shores of Britain".&lt;ref&gt;R.S.O. Tomlin. Writing and Communication. In Artefacts in Roman Britain, their purpose and use. Lindsay Allason-Jones ed. Cambridge University Press 2011. page 133. {{ISBN|978-0-521-86012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy was widespread under Roman rule, but became very rare, limited almost entirely to churchmen, after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. In 12th and 13th century [[England]], the ability to recite a particular passage from the Bible in [[Latin]] entitled a [[common law]] defendant to the so-called [[benefit of clergy]]—i.e., trial before an [[ecclesiastical court]], where sentences were more lenient, instead of a secular one, where hanging was a likely sentence. Thus literate lay defendants often claimed the right to benefit of clergy, while an illiterate person who had memorized the psalm used as the literacy test, [[Psalm 51]] ("O God, have mercy upon me..."), could also claim benefit of clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Baker, John R. |title=An Introduction to English Legal History |publisher=Butterworths LexisNexis |location=London |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=978-0-406-93053-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite lacking a system of free and compulsory primary schooling, England managed to reach near universal literacy in the nineteenth century as a result of shared, informal learning systems such as family members, fellow workers, and/or benevolent employers, to name a few. Even with near universal literacy rates, the gap between male and female literacy rates continued to persist until the early twentieth century. Many female readers in the West during the nineteenth century were able to read, but unable to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=98|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wales=====
Formal higher education in the arts and sciences in [[Wales]], from the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] to the 18th century, was the preserve of the wealthy and the [[clergy]]. As in England, Welsh history and archaeological finds dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] reveal not only reading and writing, but also [[alchemy]], [[botany]], advanced maths and science. Following the Roman occupation and the conquest by the English, education in Wales was at a very low ebb in the early modern period; in particular, formal education was only available in English while the majority of the population spoke only [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. The first modern grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as [[Ruthin]], [[Brecon]], and [[Cowbridge]]. One of the first modern national education methods to use the native Welsh language was started by [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]] in 1731.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see [[History of Wales#Early modern period]]&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was the rector of [[Llanddowror]] from 1716 and remained there for the rest of his life. He organized and introduced a Welsh medium circulating school system, which was attractive and effective for Welsh speakers, while also teaching them English, which gave them access to broader educational sources. The circulating schools may have taught half the country's population to read. Literacy rates in Wales by the mid-18th century were one of the highest.
[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Dutch schoolmaster and children, 1662]]

====Continental Europe====
The ability to read did not necessarily imply the ability to write. The [[Swedish Church Law 1686|1686 church law]] (''kyrkolagen'') of the Kingdom of [[Sweden]] (which at the time included all of modern Sweden, [[Finland]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]) enforced literacy on the people, and by 1800 the ability to read was close to 100%. This was directly dependent on the need to read religious texts in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran faith]] in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. As a result, literacy in these countries was inclined towards reading, specifically.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=97|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as late as the 19th century, many Swedes, especially women, could not write. The exception to this rule were the men and women of [[Iceland]] who achieved widespread literacy without formal schooling, libraries, or printed books via informal tuition by religious leaders and peasant teachers.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt; That said, the situation in England was far worse than in [[Scandinavia]], [[France]], and [[Prussia]]: as late as 1841, 33% of all Englishmen and 44% of Englishwomen signed marriage certificates with their [[Signature#Function and types of signatures|mark]] as they were unable to write (government-financed public education was not available in England until 1870 and, even then, on a limited basis){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

Historian [[Ernest Gellner]] argues that [[Continental Europe]]an countries were far more successful in implementing educational reform precisely because their governments were more willing to invest in the population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= Ernest Gellner |title=Nations and Nationalism |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-8014-9263-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government oversight allowed countries to standardize curriculum and secure funding through legislation thus enabling educational programs to have a broader reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Literacy in early modern Europe : culture and education, 1500-1800|last=Houston|first=Rab|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780582368101|edition=2nd |location=Oxfordshire, England|pages=|oclc=884586117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the present-day concepts of literacy have much to do with the 15th-century invention of the [[movable type]] [[printing press]], it was not until the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the mid-19th century that paper and books became affordable to all classes of industrialized society. Until then, only a small percentage of the population were literate as only wealthy individuals and institutions could afford the materials. Even {{As of|2008|alt=today}}, the cost of paper and books is a barrier to universal literacy in some less-industrialized nations.

On the other hand, historian [[Harvey Graff]] argues that the introduction of [[Compulsory education|mass schooling]] was in part an effort to control the type of literacy that the [[working class]] had access to. According to Graff, literacy learning was increasing outside of formal settings (such as schools) and this uncontrolled, potentially critical reading could lead to increased radicalization of the populace. In his view, mass schooling was meant to temper and control literacy, not spread it.&lt;ref name="Graff1991"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Graff|first=Harvey J. |title=The literacy myth: cultural integration and social structure in the nineteenth century |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AAj9sM99qekC|year=1991|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-88738-884-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AAj9sM99qekC&amp;pg=PR26 xxvi]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graff also points out, using the example of Sweden, that mass literacy can be achieved without formal schooling or instruction in writing.

===Literacy in North America===

====Canada====
=====Colonialism (1600s–1762)=====

Research on the literacy rates of Canadians in the colonial days rested largely on examinations of the proportion of signatures to marks on parish acts (birth, baptismal, and marriage registrations).  Although some researchers have concluded that signature counts drawn from marriage registers in nineteenth century [[France]] corresponded closely with literacy tests given to military conscripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furet|first=François|title=Lire et écrire: l'alphabétisation des Français de Calvin à Jules Ferry|year=1977|publisher=Editions de Minuit|location=Paris|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; others regard this methodology as a "relatively unimaginative treatment of the complex practices and events that might be described as literacy" (Curtis, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;1-2).&lt;ref name="curtis1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Bruce|title=Beyond Signature Literacy: New Research Directions|journal=Historical Studies in Education / Revue d'Histoire de l'Éducation|year=2007|issue=Fall Special Issue|pages=1–12|url=http://historicalstudiesineducation.ca/index.php/edu_hse-rhe/article/view/533/734|accessdate=23 October 2012|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But censuses (dating back to 1666) and official records of [[New France]] offer few clues of their own on the population's levels of literacy, therefore leaving few options in terms of materials from which to draw literary rate estimates.

In his research of literacy rates of males and females in New France, Trudel found that in 1663, of 1,224 persons in New France who were of marriageable age, 59% of grooms and 46% of brides wrote their name; however, of the 3,000-plus colony inhabitants, less than 40% were native born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magnuson|first=Roger|title=Two myths in New France education|journal=McGill Journal of Education|year=1985|volume=20|issue=3|url=http://mje.mcgill.ca/index.php/MJE/article/viewArticle/7636|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signature rates were therefore likely more reflective of rates of literacy among French immigrants. Magnuson's (1985) research revealed a trend: signature rates for the period of 1680–1699 were 42% for males, 30% for females; in 1657-1715, they were 45% for males and 43% for females; in 1745-1754, they were higher for females than for males. He believed that this upward trend in rates of females’ ability to sign documents was largely attributed to the larger number of female religious orders, and to the proportionately more active role of women in health and education, while the roles of male religious orders were largely to serve as parish priests, [[Missionary|missionaries]], military chaplains and explorers. 1752 marked the date that Canada's first newspaper—the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]''—began publication.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Newspapers|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/newspapers|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====From the British Conquest (1763) to Confederation (1867)=====

The end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763 allowed two [[Philadelphia]] printers to come to [[Quebec City|Québec City]] and to begin printing a bilingual ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph|Quebec Gazette]]'' in 1764, while in 1785 [[Fleury Mesplet]] started publication of the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'', which is now the oldest continuing newspaper in the country.&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia1"/&gt;

In the 19th century, everything about print changed, and literature in its many forms became much more available.&lt;ref name=Aliaga-Buchenau&gt;{{cite book|last=Aliaga-Buchenau|first=Ana-Isabel|title=Dangerous Potential of Reading: Readers and the Negotiation of Power in Selected Nineteenth-Century Narratives|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-96833-1|page=202|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/oculbrock/docDetail.action?docID=10098857}}&lt;/ref&gt; But educating the Canadian population in reading and writing was nevertheless a huge challenge. Concerned about the strong [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] presence in the colony, the British authorities repeatedly tried to help establish schools that were outside the control of religious authorities, but these efforts were largely undermined by the [[Catholic Church]] and later the Anglican clergy.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Education|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/history-of-education|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 1820s in [[Lower Canada]], classical college curriculum, which was monopolized by the Church, was also subject to growing liberal and lay criticism, arguing it was fit first and foremost to produce priests, when Lower Canadians needed to be able to compete effectively with foreign industry and commerce and with the immigrants who were monopolizing trade (Curtis, 1985).&lt;ref name="curtis1"/&gt;  Liberal and lay attempts to promote parish schools generated a reaction from the Catholic and later the Anglican clergy in which the dangers of popular literacy figured centrally.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE" /&gt;  Both churches shared an opposition to any educational plan that encouraged lay reading of the Bible, and spokesmen for both warned of the evil and demoralizing tendencies of unregulated reading in general. Granted the power to organize parish schooling through the Vestry School Act of 1824, the Catholic clergy did nothing effective.&lt;ref name="curtis1"/&gt;

Despite this, the invention of the printing press had laid the foundation for the modern era and universal social literacy, and so it is that with time, "technologically, literacy had passed from the hands of an elite to the populace at large. Historical factors and sociopolitical conditions, however, have determined the extent to which universal social literacy has come to pass".&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Audrey M. Thomas, "[http://www.nald.ca/library/research/athomas/aduill/cover.htm Adult Illiteracy in Canada—A Challenge]" (Ottawa: Canadian Commission for UNESCO, Occasional Paper 42, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====1868–1986=====
In 1871 only about half of French Canadian men in [[Canada]] self-reported that they were literate, whereas 90 percent of other Canadian men said they could read and write, but information from the Canadian Families Project sample of the 1901 [[Census in Canada|Census of Canada]] indicated that literacy rates for French Canadians and other Canadians increased, as measured by the ability of men between the ages of 16 and 65 to answer literacy questions.&lt;ref name="Green, A."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=A|author2=MacKinnon, M. |author3=Minns, C. |title=Conspicuous by their absence: French Canadians and the settlement of the Canadian West|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=2005|volume=65|issue=3|pages=822–849|jstor=3875019|doi=10.1017/S0022050705000306|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/staff/minnsc/research/jeh_galley_proofs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory attendance in schools was legislated in the late 19th century in all provinces but [[Quebec]], but by then, a change in parental attitudes towards educating the new generation meant that many children were already attending regularly.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"/&gt;  Unlike the emphasis of school promoters on character formation, the shaping of values, the inculcation of political and social attitudes, and proper behaviour, many parents supported schooling because they wanted their children to learn to read, write, and do [[arithmetic]].&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"/&gt; Efforts were made to exert power and religious, moral, economic/professional, and social/cultural influence over children who were learning to read by dictating the contents of their school readers accordingly. But educators broke from these spheres of influence and also taught literature from a more child-centred perspective: for the pleasure of it.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Sharon|title=Regaining Pleasure in the Teaching of Reading|journal=Language Arts|year=2012|volume=89|issue=5|pages=318–328|url=http://www.ncte.org/journals/la/issues/v89-5|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational change in Québec began as a result of a major commission of inquiry at the start of what came to be called the "[[Quiet Revolution]]" in the early 1960s.  In response to the resulting recommendations, the Québec government revamped the school system in an attempt to enhance the francophone population's general educational level and to produce a better-qualified labour force. Catholic Church leadership was rejected in favour of government administration and vastly increased budgets were given to school boards across the province.&lt;ref name="History of Education TCE"/&gt;

With time, and with continuing inquiry into the literacy achievement levels of Canadians, the definition of literacy moved from a [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] one (either a person could, or couldn’t write his or her name, or was literate or illiterate), to ones that considered its multidimensionality, along with the qualitative and quantitative aspects of literacy. In the 1970s, organizations like the Canadian Association for Adult Education (CAAE) believed that one had to complete the 8th grade to achieve functional literacy.  Examination of 1976 census data, for example, found that 4,376,655, or 28.4% of Canadians 15 years of age and over reported a level of schooling of less than grade 9 and were thus deemed not functionally literate.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; But in 1991, UNESCO formally acknowledged Canada's findings that assessment of educational attainment as proxy measure of literacy was not as reliable as was direct assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=Functional Literacy in Eastern and Western Europe|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000906/090661eo.pdf |publisher=UNESCO Institute for Education|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dissatisfaction manifested itself in the development of actual proficiency tests that measure reading literacy more directly.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=OECD, Statistics Canada|title=Literacy for Life: Further Results from the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey|publisher=OECD Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Direct systematic measures of literacy in Canada, 1987 to present=====

Canada conducted its first literacy survey in 1987 which discovered that there were more than five million [[Functional illiteracy|functionally illiterate]] adults in Canada, or 24 per cent of the adult population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Statistics Canada]] then conducted three national and international literacy surveys of the adult population — the first one in 1989 commissioned by the [[Employment and Social Development Canada|Human Resources and Skills Development Canada]] (HRSDC) department.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

This first survey was called the "Literacy Skills Used in Daily Activities" (LSUDA) survey, and was modeled on the 1985 U.S. survey of young adults (YALS).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=OECD, Statistics Canada (2011)|title=Literacy for Life: Further Results from the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey|publisher=OECD Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It represented a first attempt in Canada to produce skill measures deemed comparable across languages. Literacy, for the first time, was measured on a continuum of skills.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  The survey found that 16% of Canadians had literacy skills too limited to deal with most of the printed material encountered in daily life whereas 22% were considered "narrow" readers.

In 1994-95, Canada participated in the first multi-country, multi-language assessment of adult literacy, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). A stratified multi-stage probability sample design was used to select the sample from the Census Frame. The sample was designed to yield separate samples for the two Canadian official languages, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], and participants were measured on the dimensions of prose literacy, document literacy and quantitative literacy.  The survey found that 42.2%, 43% and 42.2% of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 65 scored at the lowest two levels of Prose Literacy, Document Literacy and Quantitative Literacy, respectively.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  The survey presented many important correlations, among which was a strong plausible link between literacy and a country's economic potential.

In 2003, Canada participated in the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (ALL). This survey contained identical measures for assessing the prose and document literacy proficiencies, allowing for comparisons between survey results on these two measures and found that 41.9% and 42.6% of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 65 scored at the lowest two levels of Prose Literacy and document literacy respectively.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Further, Canadians’ mean scores also improved on both the prose and the document literacy scales. Energy production:36%, transportation: 24%, homes and businesses: 12%, industry: 11%, agriculture: 10%, and waste: 7%.

The [[OECD]]'s [[Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies]] (PIAAC) is expected to produce new comparative skill profiles in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=4406&amp;lang=en&amp;db=imdb&amp;adm=8&amp;dis=2 |title=Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) |publisher=3.statcan.gc.ca |date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
In the last 40 years, the rate of illiteracy in [[Mexico]] has been steadily decreasing.  In the 1960s, because the majority of the residents of the federal capital were illiterate, the planners of the [[Mexico City Metro]] designed a system of unique icons to identify each station in the system in addition to its formal name. However, The INEGI´s census data of 1970 showed a national average illiteracy rate of 25.8%; the last census data puts the national average at 6.9%. Mexico still has a gender educational bias. The illiteracy rate for women in the last census was 8.1% compared with 5.6% for men. Rates differ across regions and states. [[Chiapas]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Oaxaca]], the states with the highest [[Poverty|poverty rate]], had greater than 15% illiteracy in 2010(17.8%, 16.7% and 16.3 respectively). In contrast, the illiteracy rates in the Federal District (D.F. / Mexico City) and in some northern states like [[Nuevo León]], [[Baja California]], and [[Coahuila]] were below 3% in the 2010 census (2.1%, 2.2%, 2.6% and 2.6% respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/poblacion/analfabeta.aspx?tema=P|title=Analfabetismo.

[[File:FSA school in Alabama.gif|thumb|One-room school in [[Alabama]] c.&amp;nbsp;1935]]
Before the 20th century white illiteracy was not uncommon and many of the slave states made it illegal to teach slaves to read.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/experience/education/docs1.html ''Acts against the education of slaves South Carolina, 1740 and Virginia, 1819''] Slavery Experience, PBS&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 the situation had improved somewhat, but 44% of black people remained illiterate. There were significant improvements for African American and other races in the early 20th century as the descendants of former slaves, who had had no educational opportunities, grew up in the post Civil War period and often had some chance to obtain a basic education. The gap in illiteracy between white and black adults continued to narrow through the 20th century, and in 1979 the rates were about the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp |title=National Assessment of Adult Literacy |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cultural and westernized literacy for Native Americans in the United States =====

[[File:Carlisle pupils.jpg|upright=1.7|right|thumb|Native youth in front of [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in Pennsylvania c.&amp;nbsp;1900]]

Before colonization, oral storytelling and communication composed most if not all [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] literacy. Native people communicated and retained their histories verbally—it was not until the beginning of [[American Indian boarding schools]] that reading and writing forms of literacy were forced onto Native Americans. While literacy rates of English increased, [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|forced assimilation]] exposed Native children to [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]], unsanitary living conditions, and even death.{{clarify|date=December 2014}} Many students ran away in an attempt to hold on to their [[cultural identity]] and literary traditions that were relevant to their community. While these formalized forms of literacy prepared Native youth to exist in the changing society, they destroyed all traces of their cultural literacy. Native children would return to their families unable to communicate with them due to the loss of their [[indigenous language]]. In the 20th and 21st century, there is still a struggle to learn and maintain cultural language. But education initiatives and programs have increased overall—according to the 2010 census, 86 percent of the overall population of Native Americans and Alaska Natives have high school diplomas, and 28 percent have a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month: November 2011 |publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]] | url= https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/cb11-ff22.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy in Africa===
The literacy rates in Africa vary significantly between countries. The highest registered literacy rate in the region is in [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Libya]] (both 94.2%), while the lowest literacy rate is in [[South Sudan]] (27%).&lt;ref name="Cwfbl"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html#xx|title=World |work=[[CIA Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poorer youth in sub-Saharan Africa have fewer educational opportunities to become literate compared with wealthier families.  They often must leave school because of being needed at home to farm or care for siblings.&lt;ref name="Bernhardt"/&gt;

[[File:Figure 2 Most illiterate persons in South Asia and Subsaharan Africa Reading the past writing the future.svg|thumb|Most illiterate persons now live in Southern Asia or sub-Saharan Africa.]]
In sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of literacy has not improved enough to compensate for the effects of demographic growth. As a result, the number of illiterate adults has risen by 27% over the last 20 years, reaching 169 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Information bulletin: School and teaching resources in sub-Saharan Africa, 2012, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/ib9-regional-education-africa-2012-en-v5.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, out of the 775 million illiterate adults in the world in 2010, more than one fifth were in sub- Saharan Africa – in other words, 20% of the adult population. The countries with the lowest levels of literacy in the world are also concentrated in this region. These include Niger (28.7%), Burkina Faso (28.7%), Mali (33.4%), Chad (35.4%) and Ethiopia (39%), where adult literacy rates are well below 50%. There are, however, certain exceptions, like Equatorial Guinea, with a literacy rate of 94%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf|title=Digital Services for Education in Africa|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Algeria====
The literacy rate of Algeria is around 70%: education is compulsory and free in [[Algeria]] up to age of 17.

====Botswana====
[[Botswana]] has among the highest literacy rates in the [[Developing country|developing world]] with around 85% of its population being literate.

[[Burkina Faso]] has a very low literacy rate of 28.7%. The government defines literacy as anyone at least 15 years of age and up who can read and write.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; To improve the literacy rate, the government has received at least 80 volunteer teachers.

====Kenya====
The literacy rate in [[Kenya]] among people below 20 years of age is over 70%, as the first 8 years of primary school are provided tuition-free by the government. In January 2008, the government began offering a restricted program of free secondary education. Literacy is much higher among the young than the old population, with the total being about 53% for the country. Most of this literacy, however, is elementary—not secondary or advanced.

====Mali====
[[Mali]] has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, at 33.4%, with males having a 43.1% literacy rate and females having a 24.6% literacy rate. The government defines literacy as anyone who is at least 15 and over who can read or write.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; The government of Mali and international organizations in recent years has taken steps to improve the literacy rate. The government recognized the slow progress in literacy rates and began created ministries for basic education and literacy for their national languages in 2007. To also improve literacy the government planned to increase its education budget by 3%, when this was purposed it was at 35% in 2007. The lack of literate adults causes the programs to be slowed. The programs need qualified female trainers is a major problem because most men refuse to send female family members to be trained under male teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mali: Still a long way to go to meet adult literacy targets|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/77803/mali-still-a-long-way-to-go-to-meet--liteadultracy-targets|accessdate=3 October 2014|work=IRIN|date=17 April 2008|ref=IRIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mauritius====
Free education in [[Mauritius]] didn't proceed beyond the primary level until 1976, so many women now in their 50s or older left school at age 12. The younger generation (below 50) are however extremely well educated with very high educational expectations placed upon pupils. Education is today free from pre-primary to tertiary (only admission fees remain at University level). Most professional people have at least a bachelor's degree. Mauritian students consistently rank top in the world each year for the Cambridge International [[GCE Ordinary Level|O Level]], International A and AS level examinations. Most Mauritian children, even at primary level, attend tuition after school and at weekends to cope with the highly competitive public school system where admission to prestigious public colleges (secondary) and most sought after university courses depend on merit based academic performance.

The adult [[literacy rate]] was estimated at 89.8% in 2011.&lt;ref name="census 2011"/&gt; Male literacy was 92.3% and Female literacy 87.3%.&lt;ref name="census 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.govmu.org/portal/goc/cso/ei977/pop2011.pdf|publisher=[[Statistics Mauritius]], [[Government Portal of Mauritius]]|title=2011 POPULATION CENSUS&amp;nbsp;— MAIN RESULTS|year=2011|accessdate=22 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223170840/http://www.govmu.org/portal/goc/cso/ei977/pop2011.pdf|archivedate=23 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Niger====
[[Niger]] has an extremely low literacy rate at 28.7%. However, the gender gap between males and females is a major problem for the country, men have a literacy rate of 42.9% and women a literacy rate of 15.1%. The [[Government of Niger|Nigerien government]] defines literacy as anyone who can read or write over the age of 15.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; The Niass Tijaniyya, a predominate group of the [[Sufism|Sufi brotherhoods]], has started anti-poverty, empowerment, and literacy campaigns. The women in [[Kiota]] had not attempted to improve their education, or economic standing. Saida Oumul Khadiri Niass, known as Maman, through talking to men and women throughout the community changed the community's beliefs on appropriate behavior for women because the community recognized she was married to a leader of the Niass Tijaniyya. Maman's efforts has allowed women in Kiota to own small businesses, sell in the market place, attend literacy classes, and organize small associations that can give micro loans. Maman personally teaches children in and around Kiota, with special attention to girls. Maman has her students require instructor permission to allow the girls' parents to marry their daughters early. This increases the amount of education these girls receive, as well as delaying [[marriage]], [[pregnancy]], and having [[children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnes|first1=Shailly|title=RELIGION SOCIAL CAPITAL AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SAHEL: THE NIASS TIJANIYYA IN NIGER|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=2009|volume=62|issue=2|pages=209–221|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=1beab10b-5f42-4908-b98f-d353e358de2b%40sessionmgr4005&amp;hid=4105&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=39764466|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senegal====
[[Senegal]] has a literacy rate of 49.7%; the government defines literacy as anyone who is at least 15 years of age and over who can read and write.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt; However, many students do not attend school long enough to be considered literate. The government did not begin actively attempting to improve the literacy rate until 1971 when it gave the responsibility to Department for Vocational Training at the Secretariat for Youth and Sports. This department and subsequent following departments had no clear policy on literacy until the Department of Literacy and Basic Education was formed in 1986. The government of Senegal relies heavily on funding from the [[World Bank]] to fund its school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordtveit|first1=Bjorn|title=Producing Literacy and Civil Society: The Case of Senegal.|journal=Comparative Education Review|date=May 2008|volume=52|issue=2|doi=10.1086/528761|pages=175–198|url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=cie_faculty_pubs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somalia====
There is no reliable data on the nationwide literacy rate in [[Somalia]]. A 2013 FSNAU survey indicates considerable differences per region, with the autonomous northeastern [[Puntland]] region having the highest registered literacy rate at 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Ties: Remittances and Livelihoods Support in Puntland and Somaliland|url=http://www.fsnau.org/downloads/Remittances-and-Livelihoods-Support-in-Puntland-and-Somaliland.pdf|publisher=FSNAU|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sierra Leone====
The [[Sierra Leone]] government defines literacy as anyone over the age of 15 who can read and write in [[English language|English]], [[Mende language|Mende]], [[Temne language|Temne]], or [[Arabic]]. Official statics put the literacy rate at 43.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|website=CIA|accessdate=3 October 2014|ref=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sierra Leone was the second country to use the Literacy, Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding project. However, due to fighting near the city where the project was centered causing the project to be delayed until an arms amnesty was in place.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Uganda====
[[Uganda]] has a literacy rate of 66.8%.&lt;ref name="Cwfbl" /&gt;

====Zimbabwe====
[[Zimbabwe]] has a high literacy rate of 86.5% (2016 est.).&lt;ref name="Cwfbl"/&gt;

====Afghanistan====
[[File:Schoolgirls in Bamozai.JPG|thumb|Young school girls in [[Paktia Province]] of Afghanistan]] [[Afghanistan]] has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world at 28.1% with males having a literacy rate of 43.1% and females with a literacy rate of 12.6%.

====China====
{{main article|Education in the People's Republic of China}}
The [[China|PRC]] conducts standardized testing to assess proficiency in [[Standard Chinese]], known as "putonghua," but it is primarily for foreigners or those needing to demonstrate professional proficiency{{who|date=June 2014|reason=Does this refer to native speakers of putonghua or native speakers of other Sinitic languages or who?}} in the [[Beijing]] dialect. Literacy in languages like Chinese can be assessed by reading comprehension tests, just as in other languages, but historically has often been graded on the number of Chinese characters introduced during the speaker's schooling, with a few thousand considered the minimum for practical literacy. Social science surveys in China have repeatedly found that just more than half the population of China is conversant in spoken putonghua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More than half of Chinese can speak mandarin |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |newspaper=China View |date=7 March 2007 |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm}} {{cite news |title=Beijing says 400 million Chinese cannot speak Mandarin |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |newspaper=BBC News |date=6 September 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-23975037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
{{Expand section|date=February 2014}}
{{main article|Literacy in India}}

Literacy is defined by the [[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]], as "[the ability of] a person aged 7 years and above [to]... both write and read with understanding in any language."&lt;ref name="India 2011"&gt;2011 Census of India: Chapter 6: "State of Literacy of Rural Urban Population". Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Office of the Registrar and Census Commissioner, India, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Census of India, 2011|2011 census]], 74.04 percent.&lt;ref name="India 2011" /&gt;

====Laos====
[[File:Lao schoolgirls reading books.jpg|thumb|right|Three [[Lao people|Laotian]] girls sit outside their school, each absorbed in reading a book they received at a rural school book party.]]

[[Laos]] has the lowest level of adult literacy in all of [[Southeast Asia]] other than [[East Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/6.html hdrstats.undp.org], accessed 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Obstacles to literacy vary by country and culture as writing systems, quality of education, availability of written material, competition from other sources (television, video games, cell phones, and family work obligations), and culture all influence literacy levels. In Laos, which has a [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic]] alphabet, reading is relatively easy to learn—especially compared to [[English language|English]], where spelling and pronunciation rules are filled with exceptions, and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], with thousands of symbols to be memorized. But a lack of books and other written materials has hindered functional literacy in Laos, where many children and adults read so haltingly that the skill is hardly beneficial.

A literacy project in Laos addresses this by using what it calls "books that make literacy fun!" The project, [[Big Brother Mouse]], publishes colorful, easy-to-read books, then delivers them by holding book parties at rural schools. Some of the books are modeled on successful western books by authors such as [[Dr. Seuss]]; the most popular, however, are traditional Lao fairy tales. Two popular collections of folktales were written by Siphone Vouthisakdee, who comes from a village where only five children finished primary school.&lt;ref name="tibor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Krausz|first=Tibor|title=Publishing Children's Books – And Delivering Them by Elephant| url= http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/2011/0221/Publishing-children-s-books-and-delivering-them-by-elephant| accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Brother Mouse has also created village reading rooms, and published books for adult readers about subjects such as Buddhism, health, and baby care.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Bonnie. "Picturing Laos". Amherst Bulletin, 27 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====
In [[Pakistan]], the [[National Commission for Human Development]] (NCHD) aims to bring literacy to adults, especially women.
ISLAMABAD - UNESCO Islamabad Director Kozue Kay Nagata has said, "Illiteracy in Pakistan has fallen over two decades, thanks to the government and people of Pakistan for their efforts working toward meeting the [[Millennium Development Goals]]". "Today, 70 percent of Pakistani youths can read and write. In 20 years, illiterate population has been reduced significantly", she said while speaking at a function held in connection with [[International Literacy Day]].

However, she also emphasised on the need to do more to improve literacy in the country and said, "The proportion of population in Pakistan lacking basic reading and writing is too high. This is a serious obstacle for individual fulfillment, to the development of societies, and to mutual understanding between peoples." Referring to the recent national survey carried out by the Ministry of Education, Trainings and Standards in Higher Education with support of UNESCO, [[UNICEF]], and provincial and areas departments of education, Nagata pointed out that, in Pakistan, although primary school survival rate is 70 percent, gender gap still exists with only 68 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to 71 percent for boys. Specifically in the case of Punjab, she said, primary school survival rate today is better with 76 percent, but not without a gender gap of 8 percent points with 72 percent girls’ survival rate compared to 80 percent for boys. She also pointed out that average per student spending in primary level (age 5-9) was better in Punjab: Rs 6,998, compared to the national average. In [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], although almost the same amount (Rs 6,985) as in Punjab is spent per child, the primary school survival rate is only 53 percent. Girls’ survival rate is slightly better with 54 percent than that of boys which is 52 percent. Literate Pakistan Foundation, a non-profit organization, which was established in 2003, is a case study, which brings to light the solutions for removing this menace from its roots. It works to improve rate of literacy in Pakistan.

The data of the survey shows that in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], primary school survival rate is 67 percent which is lower than the national average of 70 percent. Furthermore, gender gap also exists with only 65 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to that of boys which is 68 percent. Per-student education expenditure in primary level (age 5-9) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is Rs 8,638. In [[Sindh]], primary school survival rate is 63percent, with a gender gap of only 67 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to 60 percent for boys. Per student education expenditure in primary level (age 5-9) in Sindh is Rs 5,019. Nagata made reference to the survey report and mentioned that the most common reason in Pakistan for children (both boys and girls) of age 10 to 18 years leaving school before completing primary grade is "the child not willing to go to school", which may be related to quality and learning outcome. She said, however, and sadly, for the girls living in rural communities the second highest reason for dropout is "parents did not allow" which might be related to prejudice and cultural norm against girls.

====Philippines====

[[File:Laguna Copperplate Inscription.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.85|Laguna Copperplate Inscription (c. 900), a thin copperplate document measuring less than 8x12 inches in size, shows heavy Hindu-Malayan cultural influences present in the Philippines during the 10th Century.]]
Early Filipinos devised and used their own system of writings from 300 BC, which derived from the [[Brahmic family of scripts]] of [[History of India|Ancient India]]. [[Baybayin]] became the most widespread of these derived scripts by the 11th century.

Early chroniclers, who came during the first Spanish expeditions to the islands, noted the proficiency of some of the natives, especially the chieftain and local kings, in [[Sanskrit]], [[Old Javanese]], [[Old Malay]], and several other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/lci/lci.htm |title=The Laguna Copperplate Inscription |publisher=A Philippine Leaf |last=Santos |first=Hector |date=26 October 1996 |accessdate=23 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121194304/http://bibingka.com/dahon/lci/lci.htm |archivedate=21 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergreen|first=Laurence|title=Over The Edge of The World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe|location=New York|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Spanish colonization of the islands, reading materials were destroyed to a far much less extent compared to the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Education and literacy was introduced only to the [[Peninsulars|Peninsulares]] and remained a privilege until the Americans came.

The Americans introduced the public schools system to the country which drove literacy rates up. English became the [[lingua franca]] in the Philippines. It was only during a brief period in the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] that the Japanese were able to teach their [[Japanese language|language]] in the Philippines and teach the children their written language.

After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], the Philippines had the highest literacy rates in Asia. It nearly achieved universal literacy once again in the 1980s and 1990s. Ever since then, the literacy rate has plummeted only to start regaining a few percentage years back.{{when|date=March 2017}}

The [[Department of Education (Philippines)|DepEd]], [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|CHED]], and other academic institutions encourage children to improve literacy skills and knowledge. The government has a program of literacy teaching starting in kindergarten. New reforms are being brought in shifting to a K-12 system which will teach children their regional languages before English, as opposed to the ten-year basic education program which teaches English and Filipino, the country's two official languages, from Grade 1.

====Australia====

Approximately 56% of Australians aged 15 to 74 achieve Level 3 literacy or above [http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4228.0Main+Features202011-12 Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011-2012] and 83% of five-year-olds are on track to develop good language and cognitive skills [http://www.aedc.gov.au/resources/detail/aedc-2012-summary-report Australian Early Development Census 2012 summary report]. In 2012-2013, Australia had 1515 public library service points, lending almost 174 million items to 10 million members of Australian public library services, at an average per capita cost of just under AU$45 [http://www.nsla.org.au/sites/www.nsla.org.au/files/publications/NSLA.Aust_Pub_Lib_Stats_2012-13.pdf Australian Public Library Statistics 2012-2013].

A '''meaningless statement''' posits nothing of substance with which one could agree or disagree. In the context of [[logical argument]]s, the inclusion of a meaningless statement in the premises will undermine the validity of the argument since that premise can neither be true nor false.

There are many classes of meaningless statement:

* A statement may be considered meaningless if it asserts that two categories are disjoint without proposing a criterion to distinguish between them. For example, the claim, "I wouldn't know how [[pornography]] differs from [[erotica]]" is a [[distinction without a difference]].
* A statement may be meaningless if its terms are undefined, or if it contains unbound variables. For instance, the sentence "All ''X'' have ''Y''" is meaningless unless the terms ''X'' and ''Y'' are defined (or bound).
* A grammatically correct sentence may be meaningless if it ascribes properties to particulars which admit of no such properties. For example, the famous sentence "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" cannot be taken literally.
* An ungrammatical sentence admits of no meaning. For instance, the string of words "deities Olympus Greek reside The. upon" offers no information regarding the Greek deities, or their whereabouts.
* [[Lewis Carrol]]'s poem [[Jabberwocky]] is a famous example of the [[nonsense verse|nonsensical as literature]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6724">The '''Modistae''' ([[Latin]] for "'''Modists'''"), also known as the '''speculative grammarians''', were the members of a school of [[grammar]]ian philosophy known as '''Modism''' or '''speculative grammar''', active in northern [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], and [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. Their influence was felt much less in the southern part of Europe, where the somewhat opposing tradition of the so-called "pedagogical grammar" never lost its preponderance.

==History&lt;!--'Ralph of Beauvais', 'Speculative grammarians', and 'Thomas of Erfurt' redirect here--&gt;==
[[William of Conches]], [[Peter Helias]], and '''Ralph of Beauvais'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, also referred to as '''speculative grammarians'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; predate the Modist movement proper.

The Modist philosophy was first developed by [[Martin of Dacia]] (died 1304)  and his colleagues in the mid-13th century, though it would rise to prominence only after its systematization by '''Thomas of Erfurt'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; decades later, in his treatise ''De modis significandi seu grammatica speculativa'', probably written in the first decade of the 14th century. Until the early twentieth-century this work was assumed to have been authored by [[John Duns Scotus]]. Widely reproduced and commented upon in the [[Middle Ages]], it remains the most complete textbook of Modist speculative grammar. The mistaken authorship arose out of the natural affinity of Erfurt's speculative grammar with Scotus's metaphysics.

==Theory of modes==
The philosophy of the Modistae, as indicated by their name, was based on a theory of 'modes' of meaning in language which was tripartite: modes of being (''modi essendi''), modes of understanding (''modi intelligendi''), and modes of signifying (''modi significandi''). To the Modistae, the various [[parts of speech]] were viewed as representing [[reality]] in terms of these modes. The ''modi essendi'' are objectively existent qualities in an object of understanding, the ''modi intelligendi'' the understanding's means of representing the ''modi essendi'', and the ''modi significandi'' grammar's means of representing the ''modi intelligendi'' in language. This corresponds to Aristotle's tripartite semantic theory of ''words'' representing ''concepts'' which represent ''objects''.

Opposing [[nominalism]], they assumed  that the analysis of the [[grammar]] of ordinary language was the key to [[metaphysics]]. For the Modistae, grammatical forms, the ''modi significandi'' of  verbs, nouns, and adjectives, comprise the deep [[ontological]] structure of language, which objectively reflects reality. Their work predicted the concept of [[universal grammar]], suggesting that universal grammatical rules may be extracted from all living languages. [[Roger Bacon]] may have given the movement inspiration with his observation that all languages are built upon a common grammar, a shared foundation of ontologically anchored linguistic structures. He argued grammar is substantially the same in all languages, even though it may undergo accidental variations between languages.

==Influences==
There are parallels between speculative grammar and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], a fact that was picked up early on by [[Martin Heidegger]], who wrote his first book, ''Die Kategorien-und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus'', on Thomas of Erfurt's treatise (at that time still mistakenly attributed to Duns Scotus).

The '''Monguor language''' ({{zh|s=土族语|p=Tǔzúyǔ}}; also written '''Mongour''' and '''Mongor''') is a [[Mongolic language]] of its Shirongolic branch and is part of the Gansu–Qinghai [[sprachbund]]. There are several dialects, mostly spoken by the [[Monguor]] people. A written script was devised for Huzhu Monguor (Mongghul) in the late 20th century, but has been little used. A division into two languages, namely Mongghul in [[Huzhu Tu Autonomous County]] and Mangghuer in [[Minhe Hui and Tu Autonomous County]], is considered necessary by some linguists. While Mongghul was under strong influence from [[Amdo Tibetan|Tibetan]], the same holds for Mangghuer and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and local dialects of Chinese such as [[Gangou dialect|Gangou]] were in turn influenced by Monguor.

== Phonology ==
Monguor has five vowels: /a, e, i, o, u/.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lotpublications.nl/Documents/289_fulltext.pdf|title=Mongolic Phonology and the Qinghai-Gansu Languages|last=Hans|first=Nugteren|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
Assessment for online speech therapy consists of an informal oral exam by a licensed trained professional through video conferencing or a web application. Patients are initially screened for communication disorders with diagnosis and consultation for provision counseling including cognitive aspects of communication, syntax, [[hypophonia]] and upper aerodigestive functions. The [[therapist]] and patient communicate via telecommunication technology where they can interact in real time. Therapy may cover speech sound production, fluency, language, cognition and written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Professional-Issues/Telepractice/ | title=Telepractice Overview | publisher=asha.org | accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The therapists create an assessment document or report that is updated after every session. The document is reported to the parents or the referral source in compliance with [[HIPAA]] and [[FERPA]]. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act also known as HIPAA is a federal law that protects patient medical records. HIPAA specifically protects “individually identifiable health information.” The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act known as FERPA is a federal law that protects student education records. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children’s education records until they turn 18 or transfer to a school higher than the high school level, thus making them “eligible students.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.asha.org/2014/04/15/beyond-skype-for-online-therapy-protecting-student-privacy/#_ga=1.131523532.2146824548.1428276224|title=Beyond Skype for Online Therapy: Protecting Student Privacy - Leader Live — Happening now in the speech-language-hearing world|date=15 April 2014|website=asha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical departments in Universities also offer speech and language therapy services where they keep recorded video of sessions between clinicians and patients secured through password security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sphs.osu.edu/clinic/speech-language-services/telepractice | title=Telepractice, Department of Speech &amp; Hearing Science | publisher=The Ohio State University | accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course==
Online speech therapy courses are offered by professional associations, Universities and cyber schools for treatment of communication disorders. The minimum eligibility for an online speech therapy course is a bachelor's degree for Master's entry-level field and master's degree for CScD offered by professional associations and Universities in the United States. The speech therapist course is not available for Bachelors or under graduate degree level in the United States. The pathologists are required to attain a minimum of 400 clinical hours to complete the course. In Asian countries, the course is open for Bachelors level degree program offered by Universities.

Speech Pathologist are also required to complete 400 hours clinical hours and pass the KASA exams in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">In [[analytic philosophy]], the '''paradigm case argument''' is an argument which is applied as a rebuttal to the claim that certain concepts, such as [[free will]] or [[knowledge]], are meaningless. The paradigm case argument is that if a term, such as "knowledge", is regularly applied to some cases and not to others, then that term (and the concept it refers to) cannot truly be undefined, as it clearly has some kind of definition in practice.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lacey |first=Alan |editor-first=Ted |editor-last=Honderich |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |title=paradigm case argument |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198661320 |pages=642}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is so named because it often takes the form of pointing out a ''paradigm case''—a case which unambiguously falls under the common definition of the term, and so can be taken as a definite instance of the supposedly non-existent concept.&lt;ref name=Borchert&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Donnellan |first=Keith |editor-first=Donald |editor-last=Borchert |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Paradigm-Case Argument |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3446801492.html |accessdate=10 November 2014 |year=2006 |publisher=Thomson Gale |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was commonly applied during the flourishing of [[linguistic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=oxford /&gt;

'''Poverty of the stimulus''' ('''POS''') is the argument from [[linguistics]] that children are not exposed to rich enough data within their linguistic environments to acquire every feature of their language. This is considered evidence contrary to the [[Empiricism|empiricist]] idea that language is learned solely through experience. The claim is that the sentences children hear while learning a language do not contain the information needed to home&lt;!-- do note revert to the former "hone in", which amounts to a confounding between 2 effective  types of repetitive methods of [[iterative approximation]]:  1. [[homing in]], the making of progressively smaller changes in direction, as greater proximity improves the accuracy of estimates of the ideal direction, and 2. [[honing down]] (or away), the removal of progressively smaller amounts of material, as approaching the desired shape and size forces progressively more precise grinding, cutting, or otherwise reshaping --&gt; in on the grammar of the language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky, N.]] (1980) On Cognitive Structures and their Development: A reply to Piaget. In M. Piattelli-Palmarini, ed. Language and Learning: The debate between Jean Piaget and Noam Chomsky. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The POS is often used as evidence for [[universal grammar]]. This is the idea that all languages conform to the same structural principles, which define the space of possible languages.

Both poverty of the stimulus and universal grammar are terms that can be credited to [[Noam Chomsky]]. Chomsky coined the term "poverty of the stimulus" in 1980, however he had argued for the idea since his [[Verbal Behavior#Chomsky's review|1959 review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior]]. The POS is also related to [[Nelson Goodman]]'s [[new riddle of induction]].

==The form of the argument==
An argument from the poverty of the stimulus generally takes the following structure:&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J.A. (1966) How to learn to talk: Some simple ways. in F. Smith and G.A. Miller (eds) The Genesis of Language, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blackwell Handbook of Language Development|last=Gathercole|first=Virginia C. Mueller|last2=Hoff|first2=Erika|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 6. Input and the Acquisition of Language: Three Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The speech that children are exposed to is consistent with numerous possible grammars.
# It is possible to define data, D, that would distinguish the target grammar from all other grammars that are consistent with the input.
# D is missing from speech to children.
# Children nonetheless acquire the target grammar.
# Therefore, the right grammatical structure arises due to some (possibly linguistic) property of the child.

==Background and history==
Chomsky coined the term "poverty of the stimulus" in 1980. This idea is closely related to what Chomsky calls "[[Plato's Problem]]". He outlined this [[philosophical]] approach in the first chapter of the ''Knowledge of Language'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I6CZ6wpNKeEC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=plato's+problem#v=onepage&amp;q=plato's%20problem&amp;f=true|title=The Cambridge Companion to Chomsky|author=James McGilvray|date=2005-02-24|page=42|accessdate=2016-01-21|via=Books.google.com|isbn=9780521784313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Problem traces back to ''[[Meno]]'', a [[Socratic dialogue]]. In Meno, Socrates unearths knowledge of geometry concepts from a servant who was never explicitly taught them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/rgrizzard/M316L_SP12/meno.pdf|title=Plato's ''Meno''|author1=J. Holbo|author2=B. Waring|date=2002|publisher=Idiom.ucsd.edu&lt;!--WTF?--&gt;|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024063724/http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/rgrizzard/M316L_SP12/meno.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-24|accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Problem directly parallels the idea of the innateness of language, universal grammar, and more specifically the poverty of the stimulus argument because it reveals that people's knowledge is richer than what they are exposed to. Chomsky illustrates that humans are not exposed to all structures of their language, yet they fully achieve knowledge of these structures.

Linguistic nativism is the theory that humans are born with some knowledge of language. One acquires a language not entirely through experience. According to Noam Chomsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=N|title=Language and the problems of knowledge|date=1988|publisher=MIT Press|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The speed and precision of vocabulary acquisition leaves no real alternative to the conclusion that the child somehow has the concepts available before experience with language and is basically learning labels for concepts that are already a part of his or her conceptual apparatus." Chomsky's view that the humans possess an innate faculty of language is shared by [[Steven Pinker]]. One of the most significant arguments generative grammarians have for linguistic nativism is the poverty of the stimulus argument.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09515080802412321|title=Language Learning in Infancy: Does the Empirical Evidence Support a Domain Specific Language Acquisition Device?|journal=Philosophical Psychology|volume=21|issue=5|pages=641–671|year=2008|last1=Behme|first1=Christina|last2=Deacon|first2=S.

Pullum and Scholz frame the poverty of the stimulus argument by examining all of the ways that the input is insufficient for language acquisition.&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pullum |first1=Geoffrey K. |last2=Scholz |first2=Barbara C. |title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |journal=Linguistic Review |date=2002 |volume=19 |issue=1/2 | pages = 9–50 | url = http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/bcscholz/Assessment.pdf  | doi = 10.1515/tlir.19.1-2.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, children are exposed only to positive evidence. They do not receive [[Negative evidence in language acquisition|explicit correction or instruction about what is not possible in the language]].&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Longa|first1=Víctor M|title=What about a (really) minimalist theory of language acquisition?|journal=Linguistics|date=2008|volume=46|issue=3|pages=541–570|doi=10.1515/ling.2008.018|citeseerx=10.1.1.610.5289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the input that children receive is degenerate in terms of scope and quality.&lt;ref name="Oh Jeffrey Boy"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Lasnik| first1 = Howard| first2 = Jeffrey L.| last2 = Lidz| contribution = The Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus| editor-last = Roberts| editor-first = Ian| title = The Oxford Handbook of Universal Grammar| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2016| contribution-url = http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199573776-e-10| doi = 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199573776-e-10| doi-broken-date = 2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degeneracy of scope means that the input does not contain information about the full extent of any grammatical rules. Degeneracy of quality means that children are exposed to speech errors, utterances by nonnative speakers, and false starts, potentially obscuring the grammatical structure of the language. Furthermore, the linguistic data each child is exposed to is different and so the basis for learning is idiosyncratic. However, despite these insufficiencies, children eventually acquire the grammar of the language they are exposed to.  Further, other organisms in the same environment do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Poverty of Stimulus: Unfinished Business|journal=Studies in Chinese Linguistics|date=2012|volume=33|issue=1|pages=3–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the nativists' point of view, the insufficiency of the input leads to the conclusion that humans are hard-wired with a UG and thus support the [[innateness hypothesis]].

However, the argument that the poverty of stimulus supports the innateness hypothesis remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laurence|first1=Stephen|title=The Poverty of the Stimulus Argument|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|date=2001|volume=52|issue=2|pages=217–276|doi=10.1093/bjps/52.2.217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Fiona Cowie claims that the Poverty of Stimulus argument fails "on both empirical and conceptual grounds to support nativism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowie|first1=Fiona|title=What's Within? Nativism Reconsidered|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
An overarching theme in examples provided as evidence for the poverty of the stimulus is that children acquire grammatical rules based on evidence that is consistent with multiple generalizations. And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner.

===Syntax===
====Binding theory – Principle C====
# While he was dancing, the Ninja Turtle ate pizza.
# He ate pizza while the Ninja Turtle was dancing.
In general, pronouns can refer to any prominent individual in the discourse context. However, a pronoun cannot find its antecedent in certain structural positions, as defined by the [[Binding (linguistics)|Binding Theory]]. For example, the pronoun "he" can refer to the Ninja Turtle in (1) but not (2), above. Given that speech to children does not indicate what interpretations are impossible, the input is equally consistent with a grammar that allows coreference between "he" and "the Ninja Turtle" in (2) and one that does not. But, since all speakers of English recognize that (2) does not allow this coreference, this aspect of the grammar must come from some property internal to the learner.&lt;ref name="Oh Jeffrey Boy" /&gt;

====Passives====
# I believe the dog to be hungry
# The dog is believed to be hungry
# I believe the dog's owner to be hungry.
# The dog's owner is believed to be hungry.
# * The dog is believed's owner to be hungry.
The sentences in (1) and (2) illustrate the [[English passive voice|active-passive alternation in English]]. The Noun Phrase after the verb in the active (1) is the subject in the passive (2). Data like (2) would be compatible with a passive rule stated in terms of linear order (move the 1st NP after the verb) or syntactic structure (move the highest NP after the verb). The data in (3-5) illustrate that the actual rule is formulated in terms of structure. If it were stated in terms of linear order, then (4) would be ungrammatical and (5) would be grammatical. But the opposite is true. However, children may not be exposed to sentences like (3-5) as evidence in favor of the correct grammar. Thus, the fact that all adult speakers agree that (4) is grammatical and (5) is not suggests that the linear rule was never even considered and that children are predisposed to a structure based grammatical system.&lt;ref name="Oh Jeffrey Boy" /&gt;

====Anaphoric "one"====
The English word "one" can refer back to a previously mentioned property in the discourse. For example in (1), "one" can mean "ball". 
# I like this ball and you like that one. 
# I like this red ball and you like that one. 
In (2), one is interpreted as "red ball." However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which "one" simply meant "ball". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'.&lt;ref name="Infants"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=J.|last2=Freedman|first2=J.|last3=Waxman|first3=S.|date=October 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027703001161?via%3Dihub|journal=Cognition|volume=89|pages=295–303|number=3|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00116-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which "one" refers back to Nouns and one in which "one" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations.

====Island effects====
In Wh-questions, the Wh-word at the beginning of the sentence (the filler) is related to a position later in the sentence (the gap). This relation can hold over an unbounded distance, as in (1). However, there are restrictions on the gap positions that a filler can be related to. These restrictions are called [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|syntactic islands]] (2). Because questions with islands are ungrammatical, they are not included in the speech that children hear—but neither are grammatical Wh-questions that span multiple clauses. Because the speech children are exposed to is consistent with grammars which have island constraints and grammars which don't, something internal to the child must contribute this knowledge.
#What did you claim that Jack bought _ ?
#&lt;nowiki&gt;*What did you make the claim that Jack bought _ ? (Complex Noun Phrase Island)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Phonology ===
==== Learning stress systems ====
Bergelson &amp; Idsardi (2009) presented adults with words drawn from an artificial language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Bergelson E|author2=Idsardi WJ|date=2009|title=Structural biases in phonology: infant and adult evidence from artificial language learning.|url=http://174.143.211.73/~idsardi/papers/2009bucld.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd BUCLD|volume=33|pages=85–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words contained 3 CV syllables. If the last vowel was long, then it bore [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the [[Statistical language acquisition#Headturn Preference Procedure|Headturn Preference Procedure]]) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are "hardwired" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus.

==== English plural marker ====

Halle (1978)&lt;ref name="Halle" /&gt; argues that the morphophonological rule governing the [[English plurals|English plural]] produces forms that are consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows one of the sounds [p, t, k, f, 𝝷]; otherwise it is pronounced as [z]. In the other grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows a voiceless consonant. These rules are exactly equal in their coverage of English since the set of consonants that triggers the [s] pronunciation is identical in the two cases. However, Halle also observes that English speakers consistently pluralize the German name ''Bach'' (pronounced ''/bax/'') as ''/baxs/'', despite not having any experience with the ''/x/'' sound, which is nonexistent in English. Since there is "no indication" that speakers could have acquired this knowledge, Halle argues that the tendency to build rules in terms of natural classes comes from a factor internal to the child and not from their experience.&lt;ref name="Halle"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262580434_sch_0009.pdf|title=From Memory to Speech and Back: Papers on Phonetics and Phonology|last=Halle|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=294–303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semantics ===

==== Word learning ====

The poverty of the stimulus also applies in the domain of word learning. When learning a new word, children are exposed to examples of the word's referent, but not to the full extent of the category. For example, in learning the word "dog", a child might see a German Shepherd, a Great Dane and a Poodle. How do they know to extend this category to include Dachshunds and Bulldogs? The situations in which the word is used cannot provide the relevant information. Thus, something internal to learners must shape the way that they generalize. This problem is closely related to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s [[Indeterminacy of translation|gavagai]] problem.

==== Attitude verbs ====
In other cases, words refer to aspects of the world that cannot be observed directly. For example [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]] poses a POS argument with respect to verbs that label mental states. She observes that a learner cannot see inside another person's mind, and so an utterance of "Kim thinks that it is raining" is likely to occur in the same kinds of contexts as "Kim wonders if it is raining" or even "Kim wants it to rain". If no aspect of the context can determine whether a mental state verb refers to thinkings, wanting or wonderings, then some aspect of children's minds must direct their attention to other cues. Thus, our ability to learn these word meanings must be shaped by factors internal to the child and not simply from the conditions of their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23–64|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative viewpoints==
Some researchers argue that the poverty of the stimulus argument, which supports nativist theorizing, does not disprove the hypothesis that language is learned entirely from external sources.&lt;ref name="PullumScholz2002"/&gt;{{rp|10–50}} Some argue that nativist views reflect a failure to imagine how the input could support specific grammatical conclusions in the absence of innate structure.&lt;ref name="Gahl"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gahl, Regier|first1=Susanne, Terry|date=2003|title=Learning the Unlearnable: the role of missing evidence|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027704000587|journal=Cognition|volume=93|issue=2|pages=147–155|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.12.003|pmid=15147936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of criticism range from discussions about whether the poverty of the stimulus can be solved not through innate linguistic knowledge, but from other capacities like social cognition or statistical learning.

The empiricist views suggest that language can be learned with mental processes originally meant for other modes of cognition, and that there need not be a concept of innateness in order to account for the difference between the input a child receives versus the language they develop. Natural languages display statistical cues that children are able to learn from. Some argue that the ability to learn by [[Statistical learning in language acquisition|statistical pattern matching]] can solve problems that nativists argue require innate knowledge.

Some researchers also argue that the POS problem can be overcome through [[Negative evidence in language acquisition#Implicit direct negative evidence|implicit negative evidence]] or [[Negative evidence in language acquisition#Indirect negative evidence in language acquisition|indirect negative evidence]].

'''Processability theory''' is a [[Scientific theory|theory]] and a model of [[second language acquisition]] developed by Manfred Pienemann that touches the linguistic structures that surface in the learning of a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hw.ac.uk/langWWW/eurosla/abstracts/gpallotti.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514164451/http://www.hw.ac.uk/langWWW/eurosla/abstracts/gpallotti.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been used as a framework by several scientists from Europe and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.processability.net/cms/images/files/References/pt_references.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724020842/http://www.processability.net/cms/images/files/References/pt_references.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processability theory is part of the cognitive approach to second language acquisition that attempts to increase understanding of the ways L2 learners restructure their [[interlanguage]] knowledge systems to be in greater conformity to L2 structures. Processability theory states that learners restructure their L2 knowledge systems in an order of which they are capable at their stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Pienemann |first = Manfred |year = 1998 |title = Language Processing and Second Language Development: Processability Theory |publisher = John Benjamins |location = Amsterdam |isbn = 978-1-55619-549-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in order to acquire the correct morphological and syntactic forms for English questions, learners must transform declarative English sentences. They do so by a series of stages, consistent across learners. Clahsen proposed that certain processing principles determine this order of restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref = harv |last = Clahsen |first = Harald |editor1-last = Andersen |editor1-first = Roger |year = 1984 |title = Second languages: a cross-linguistic perspective |pages = 219–242 |chapter       = The acquisition of German word order: a test case for cognitive approaches to second language acquisition |publisher = Newbury House |location = Rowley, MA |isbn = 978-0-88377-440-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he stated that learners first, maintain declarative word order while changing other aspects of the utterances, second, move words to the beginning and end of sentences, and third, move elements within main clauses before subordinate clauses.

== Commentary ==
Processability Theory is now a mature theory of grammatical development of learners' interlanguage. It is cognitively founded (hence applicable to any language), formal and explicit (hence empirically testable), and extended, having not only formulated and tested hypotheses about morphology, syntax and discourse-pragmatics, but having also paved the way for further developments at the interface between grammar and the lexicon and other important modules in SLA.

Among the most important SLA theories recently discussed in Van Patten (2007), no other can accommodate such a variety of phenomena or seems able to offer the basis for so many new directions. Ten years have gone by since Pienemann’s first book-length publication on PT in 1998; and before that, it took almost two decades to mould into PT the initial intuition by the ZISA team that the staged development of German word order could be explained by psycholinguistic constraints universally applicable to all languages (Pienemann 1981; Clahsen, Meisel &amp; Pienemann 1983). In these three decades, the whole field of SLA has grown exponentially. PT has paralleled this growth, and widened its scope in several directions. First, ZISA’s intuitions have been applied to English (Pienemann &amp; Johnston 1984; Pienemann, Johnston &amp; Brindley 1988, Pienemann 1989), then PT has expanded its typological validation from German and English to different languages, such as Swedish and other Scandinavian languages (Håkansson 1997, Glahn et al. 2001), Arabic (e.g., Mansouri 1995; 2005), Italian (e.g. Di Biase &amp; Kawaguchi 2002; Di Biase 2007; Bettoni, Di Biase &amp; Nuzzo 2009), French (Ågren 2009), Chinese (e.g. Zhang 2004, 2005), and Japanese (e.g. Di Biase &amp; Kawaguchi 2002, 2005).

Secondly, PT’s framework has been substantially widened by including Bresnan’s (2001) Lexical Mapping Theory, and thus adding a discourse pragmatically motivated syntactic component (Pienemann, Di Biase &amp; Kawaguchi 2005) to its first syntactically motivated morphological module. Thirdly, developmentally-moderated transfer from L1 (e.g., Pienemann, Di Biase, Kawaguchi &amp; Håkansson 2005a; Pienemann, Di Biase, Kawaguchi &amp; Håkansson 2005b). Fourthly, PT’s plausibility has been tested in language situations other than L2 ones, such as monolingual and bilingual language acquisition (e.g., Håkansson 2001, 2005; ItaniAdams 2006), among children with Specific Language Impairment (e.g., Håkansson 2001; 2005), and in the origins of creole languages (Plag 2008a, 2008b).

Finally, the range of the original applications of PT to language testing and language teaching has also expanded over the years, involving several new ways of testing and teaching situations (e.g., Iwasaki 2004, 2008, ask Bruno; Pienemann &amp; Keßler 2007), and new languages (e.g. Di Biase 2008; Yamaguchi 2009). Ensuing publications in all these PT strands during such a long period of growth have had their own agendas and purposes. Furthermore, not only PT itself but also its feeder disciplines have developed in new directions, crucially among them [[psycholinguistics]] for language production and [[theoretical linguistics]] for language knowlwedge. As a consequence, it is not surprising that readers unfamiliar with PT's history may at times be confused by differences in the presentation of the theory, its use of terminology, and reliance on its theoretical bases.

'''Speech-language pathology,''' also known as ''communication sciences and disorders'' in the United States, is a fast-growing profession that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, offers about 120,000 jobs in the United States alone.  The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) has 166,000 members, who are audiologists, speech-language pathologists, speech, language, and hearing scientists, and speech language pathology assistants.  To begin practice in most areas of the [[United States]], a prospective therapist must have an undergraduate degree (preferably in some area of communications) and a graduate degree (with two externships; usually about 2 to 2 1/2 years) in speech pathology.  A 9-month, supervised clinical fellowship year is then completed, after which the Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) in speech pathology from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) is granted.  In order to be certified clinically competent the Praxis exam must be passed.  In some areas the master's degree is not required.  In some areas additional requirements must be met: an additional certification from ASHA in school speech pathology and audiology, certification in special education instruction, and/or and must have passed any other federal or state examinations for licensure and certification.  To retain the ASHA license a minimum amount of continuing education must be completed.  A doctorate is not currently required (as of June 2011), but that may change, as it has for many other areas of therapy.  Speech-language pathology overlaps with many educational disciplines, such as communication sciences, linguistics, special education, and health care.  This article will explore some of the fundamental elements of speech-language pathology, looking at the career in an educational setting.

==Speech and language pathology==
{{main|Speech and language pathology}}
Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP) are professionals who assess and diagnose individuals with speech, language, cognitive, and swallowing disorders. SLPs are informally referred to as ''speech therapist''s. SLPs may also  conduct research in the field, run a private practice, or work with large companies to improve employee-customer communication ([[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]]).  This article will focus on the aspects of speech-language pathology as practiced with young children in a school setting.

For most people, the terms ''speech'', ''language'', and ''communication'' have nearly the same definition.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  However, in the realm of speech-language pathology, there are important distinctions to be made.

'''Speech''' is the spoken production of language and the process through which sounds are produced.  Several parts of the body work together to produce sound waves, and this motor production of speech is called articulation.  The parts of the vocal tract involved with speech include the lips, tongue, teeth, throat, vocal folds, and lungs.  Speech disorders affect the physical mechanisms of communication and cause problems with articulation or phonology.  Examples of speech disorders include [[stuttering]], [[lisp]]ing, and voice disorders.

'''Language''' is a system used to represent thoughts and ideas.  Language is made up of several rules that explain what words mean, how to make new words, and how to put words together to form sentences.  A community must share the same language in order to attach meaning to utterances. The method of delivery of language may be visual (e.g., [[American Sign Language]]), auditory (e.g., English), and/or written. Humans are the only creatures innately capable of using language to discuss an endless number of topics.  Language disorders can be developmental or acquired (e.g., [[specific language impairment]] and [[aphasia]], respectively).

'''Communication''' is the exchange of information and ideas through the use of speech and language.  The transfer of information is often spoken, but may also be implied through body language or contextual cues such as intonation or hesitation.  Usually, communication is a four-step process:

# Encoding: the speaker creates the message in his mind
# Transmittal: the speaker sends the message
# Reception: the listener receives the message
# Decoding: the listener breaks down the message in his mind

If a problem occurs at any step of the process, the message might not be communicated.  Without the ability to communicate through speech and language, we would not be able to tell a doctor that we have a stomach ache, choose food from a menu, or say “I love you” to our children.  Communication is a most basic component of human nature and it develops before we are even conscious of it.

'''PHAGIA &amp; SWALLOWING'''
The process of grasping, biting, sucking, mucose making, swallowing and routine eating ability. Dysphagia can effect in many aspect of life. Dysphagia accurs in developments disorder and acquired brain and buccofacial anomalies or disease.

==Speech and Language Pathology Jobs==
{{main|Speech and language pathology}}
Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) have several options when seeking employment. One of the most popular is to secure a school-based position through an agency that specializes in this area. One of the largest and most respected agencies is [http://www.txsource.com Therapy Source], a nationwide organization founded in 2001, and based out of Plymouth Meeting, PA.

==Development of speech and language==

Every child develops at a different rate, but most go through the same stages.  Listed below are the average ages of some important language and comprehension milestones as developed by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]].  Please note that like with any developmental timeline, these stages may be quite varied and perhaps met in a different order.  A child who accomplishes these milestones differently may not necessarily have a developmental delay or speech disorder (and a child who hits these stages early is not necessarily a prodigy!).

* birth to 3 months
** startles to loud sounds
** smiles when spoken to
** responds to pleasure with 'cooing' noises
* 4 months to 6 months
** notices and pays attention to sounds and music
** shifts eyes in direction of sounds
** makes babbling noises that resemble speech
* 7 months to 1 year
** recognizes basic familiar words such as ''cup'' or ''ball''
** imitates different speech sounds
** produces first words such as ''bye-bye'' or ''mama''
* 1 year to 2 years
** listens to simple stories
** identifies pictures by name when directed (''point to the cow'', e.g.)
** speaks two-word sentences such as ''more juice'' or ''where daddy?''
* 2 years to 3 years
** understands differences in meaning for basic words (''up-down'' or ''in-out'')
** produces three-word sentences
** can name most objects
* 3 years to 4 years
** understands questions
** talks about events
** speech is understood by most people
* 4 years to 5 years
** pays attention and responds to stories and questions
** speaks clearly
** tells detailed, ordered stories

Problems can arise at any stage of development, as well as much later in life.  They can be the result of a congenital defect, a developmental disorder, or an injury.  If a problem is suspected, an assessment should be made by an SLP who can diagnose and treat communication disorders.

==Diagnosis of communication disorders==

In a school setting, children are often screened when they start kindergarten.  This process involves a rapid assessment to determine which children need further testing, diagnosis, or treatment.  Often, a screening is a sort of informal interview between an SLP and a child or group of children.  The child may be asked to give their name, count, pronounce the names of pictured objects, and answer open-ended questions.  The purpose of these tasks is to elicit a brief language sample from the child which the SLP will use to evaluate articulation, fluency, and other aspects of speech.  Screenings usually last about five minutes (Oyer 10).

After a screening is done, an individual diagnosis must be made.  This involves a one-on-one evaluation which may last two hours or more.  If an individual has been referred for testing, either by a doctor, teacher, or other professional, the screening process is skipped and testing starts here.  This session allows the SLP to gather information that will help in the diagnosis of a speech or language problem, as well as provide insight to possible causes, goals and objectives for therapy, and which techniques will work best for that individual.  Individual evaluations often include the following components:

* A visual examination of the oral cavity and throat (typically with a flashlight and tongue depressor) to determine whether the physical structures appear to be capable of speech production
* Tests of articulation of speech sounds in words and sentences as well as alone
* A measure of the ability to hear the difference between correct speech sounds and sounds actually produced
* Tests of expressive language and spontaneous speech
* Evaluations of fluency and voice
* A hearing test
* A case history

After this evaluation, the SLP will review the results and information gathered and determine whether the individual would benefit from speech therapy.  Goals and objectives of therapy are outlined and a specific treatment plan is created, drawing on the strengths and weaknesses and unique situation of that individual (Oyer 11).

==Common communication and language disorders==

Disorders that affect children may affect adults differently, or even not at all.  As the body grows and develops, the types of disorders that affect an individual change.  Children typically exhibit developmental language disorders, but may also experience problems due to illness or injury.

In developing children, language disorders are often related to congenital disabilities or neurological or physiological results of childhood illness.  These seemingly unrelated problems can seriously affect speech and language development.  Children that have cognitive impairments are often delayed in development of communication skills.  Different genetic syndromes that often cause cognitive impairment, such as [[Down syndrome]] or [[Williams syndrome]], often affect different areas of speech.  Children with autism tend to have difficulty communicating and expressing their emotions or desires.  Sometimes this is due to specific problems with articulation or semantics, but often it is an issue of neurological development directly related to autism.  Brain injuries, tumors, or seizures in children can also cause loss of language skills.  Children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) commonly have learning difficulties which also affect their language development.  Emotional disturbances early in childhood can also affect the growth of basic communicative skills.  Perhaps more obvious are the developmental and communicative consequences of childhood hearing loss (Boone 200-05).

Some disorders commonly diagnosed in children:

===Specific language impairment/ Developmental Language Disorder (#DevLangDis)===
Some children have language development deficits that cannot be linked to neurological, intellectual, social, or motor causes.  The child’s language skills grow much more slowly than those of typically developing children.  While other children are speaking in complete sentences, using conjugated verb forms, the SLI child’s speech sounds telegraphic- lacking grammatical and functional morphemes (e.g., ''He go store''. rather than ''He goes to the store''.)  Their vocabulary remains relatively small while other children are adding new words every day.  The SLI child often produces short sentences in order to avoid embarrassment and may have problems understanding complex or figurative structures (such as metaphors or multi-clausal sentences).  Problems due to SLI can also lead to learning disabilities as the child fails to understand information being presented in science, language arts, or math classes.  Studies suggest that the cause of SLI is a biological difference in brain anatomy and development (Boone 204).  Treatment objectives generally focus on vocabulary development, verb morphology, memory and recall, and narrative skills (Goffman 154).

===Articulation disorders===
An [[Articulatory phonetics|articulation]] disorder may be diagnosed when a child has difficulty producing [[phoneme]]s, or speech sounds, correctly. When classifying a sound, speech pathologists refer to the [[manner of articulation]], the [[place of articulation]], and voicing. A speech sound disorder may include one or more errors of place, manner, or voicing of the phoneme.

Different types of articulation disorders include:

; omissions : certain sounds are deleted, often at the ends of words; entire syllables or classes of sounds may be deleted; e.g., ''fi''' for ''fish''
; substitutions : one sound is substituted for another, often with similar places or manners or articulation; e.g., ''{{sic|hide=y|fi|th}}'' for ''fish''
; distortions : sounds are changed slightly by what may seem like the addition of noise, or a change in voicing; e.g., ''filsh'' for ''fish''
; additions : an extra sound is added to one already produced correctly; often occurs at the ends of words; may include changes in voicing; e.g., ''fisha'' for ''fish'' (Boone 256-58)

The phonemes that present the greatest challenge for children include /l/ as in ''pull'', /r/ as in ''mirror'', /ʃ/ ("sh") as in ''shut'', /tʃ/ ("ch") as in ''church'', /dʒ/ ("j") as in ''fu'''dg'''e'', /z/ as in ''zoo'', /ʒ/ ("zh") as in ''mea'''s'''ure'', /θ/ ("th") as in ''math'' and /ð/ ("th") as in ''this'' (Boone 112).

Articulation disorders may be attributed to a variety of causes.  A child with hearing loss may not be able to hear certain phonemes pronounced at certain frequencies, or hear the error in their own production of sounds.  Oral-motor problems may also be at fault, such as ''[[developmental verbal dyspraxia]]'' (a problem with coordination of speech muscles) or ''[[dysarthria]]'' (abnormal facial muscle tone, often due to [[neurology|neurological]] problems such as [[cerebral palsy]]).  Abnormalities in the structure of the mouth and other speech muscles can cause problems with articulation; [[cleft palate]], tongue thrust, and dental-orthodontia abnormalities are some common examples.  Finally, it is difficult for children to hear and produce all of the different phonemes of a given language.  Development is slow, and may take up to seven years.  Sometimes, as children grow, articulation problems fade and disappear without treatment.  Often, however, therapy is necessary.  Treatment therapies may target semantic differences related to phonemic differences (e.g., teaching a child the difference between ''toe'' and ''toad'', underlining the importance of the final consonant), physical-motor differences (e.g., using a mirror to show a child the correct tongue placement for a particular sound), or behavior-modification techniques (e.g., repetitive production through prompts and fun learning games).  Support and reinforcement of therapy practices, both in the classroom and at home, are crucial to the success of articulation disorder treatment (Boone 122-24, 259-62, 274-76).

It is necessary to note the difference between articulation disorders and dialectical variations.  There are several dialects of English spoken in the United States, influenced by socioeconomic status, geographic isolation, and other languages either brought to the U.S. by settlers or indigenous languages of the Native Americans.  These social dialects are rule-governed and are not to be considered lesser than, but simply different from standard English.  Examples of dialectical features that may be mistaken for articulation disorders include the 'r-lessness' of New York City speech in words like floor, here, and paper as well as the reduction of consonant clusters in [[African American Vernacular English|African-American Vernacular English]] (AAVE).  If a word ends with two or more consonants such as in ''cold'', and is followed by another word that begins with a consonant such as ''cuts'', ''cold'' is shortened to ''col'', producing ''col cuts''.  These features alone should not be treated as articulation disorders to be 'cured' by speech therapy.  However, it is possible for a child with a dialectal variation to also have a [[communication disorder]].  It is important for a [[Speech-language pathology|speech pathologist]] to be able to tell the difference (Oyer 170).

===Voice disorders===
Children may experience problems with their voice due to misuse or abnormalities in the vocal mechanisms.  There are two types of voice disorders: those of phonation, and those of resonance.  Both types can be the result of either abuse or physical structure.  Voice disorders are among the most successfully treated speech and language problems because they can be solved with surgery or reconditioning of the voice (Boone 286).

A '''phonation disorder''' is a problem with pitch, loudness, or intensity that originates in the vocal folds of the larynx.  Phonation disorders may be ''functional'', caused by continuous yelling or throat clearing, excessive smoking, or speaking at an abnormally low frequency or pitch.  The results may be an increased size or thickening of the vocal folds, lesions or polyps on the vocal folds, or problems with elasticity of the larynx.  In these cases, the treatment involves resting the voice and learning to speak at optimal pitches and volumes, as well as eliminating external causes such as smoking.  Phonation disorders may also be ''organic'', due to viral growths, cancer, paralysis of laryngeal nerves, surgical intubation, or external traumas such as being hit in the throat with a baseball.  These problems may require surgical removal of growths or reconstruction of the larynx, accompanied by voice therapy (Boone 287-96).

A '''resonance disorder''' occurs when any part of the vocal tract is altered or dysfunctional.

In the case of an ''oral'' resonance disorder, the tongue sits too high in the front or back of the mouth.  When the tongue is too far forward in the mouth, a type of ‘baby voice’ occurs, and a lisp may also result.  Treatment involves practicing back vowels such as /a/ in ''father'', /o/ in ''boat'', and /u/ in ''spoon'', accompanied by back consonants like /k/ in ''broke'' and /g/ in ''bog''.  When the tongue sits toward the back of the mouth, the voice sounds dull, and problems with articulation at the front of the mouth may also occur.  Treatment focuses on front consonants such as /w/ in ''where'' or ''work'', /p/ in ''pink'', /b/ in ''ball'', /f/ in ''laugh'', /v/ in ''leave'', /l/ in ''mail'', and /th/ in ''with'' or ''bath'' coupled with high-front vowels like /i/ in ''wheat'', /I/ in ''fit'', /e/ in ''pay'', /E/ in ''bet'', and /ae/ in ''slat''.  This type of resonance disorder is commonly seen in children with severe hearing impairment.

''Nasal'' resonance disorders occur when the space between the oral and nasal cavities remains open or closed, producing a ''hypernasal'' or ''denasal'' resonance.  Causes of hypernasality include paralysis of the velum, a short velum, or a cleft palate which allows air to escape to the nasal cavity.  The speech of actor James Stewart is a recognizable example of hypernasality (although in this case, there was no structural problem; rather, he employed the highly nasal voice as part of his character).  Denasality is often caused by a structural blockage which doesn’t allow air to pass between the oral and nasal cavities.  A child experiencing denasality may sound like they have a bad cold.  If a structural problem is to blame, surgery is the most common treatment.  After surgery, or if there is no structural cause, voice therapy is often given, involving massive amounts of practice (Boone 305-12).

===Fluency disorders===
As a child’s language and [[vocabulary]] grows, they may struggle to locate a particular word or sound. Normal dysfluency occurs in developing children as a repetition of whole words or phrases while the child searches for a particular thought or word.  Around age three-and-a-half, children may compulsively repeat words or phrases.  This tends to fade by the time the child is five.  [[Stuttering]], in contrast, results in repeated or prolonged speech sounds or syllables.  Often, involuntary blocks in fluency will be accompanied by muscle tension due to frustration.  The mouth may tighten up or the eyes may blink rapidly.  A child may become so embarrassed by stuttering that they talk as little as possible to avoid the struggle. This may have serious academic and social implications.  The cause of stuttering is unknown, yet widely debated.  Most theories suggest emotional, psychological, or neurological origins.  Psychological treatment aims at improving the self-image of the child and the child’s attitude toward the problem, while other therapies attempt to increase fluency by modifying the rhythm and rate of speech (Boone 316-29, 335-38).

==How many people are affected by communication disorders?==

According to the National Institutes of Health,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} it is estimated that, in the United States,

* between 8 and 10 percent of people have a communication disorder
* 7.5 million people have voice disorders
* cleft palate affects 1 in 700 live births
* 5 percent of children have noticeable communication disorders
* stuttering affects more than 3 million people, mostly children age 2 through 6

According to the United States Department of Education,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} speech, language, and hearing impairments account for 20.1 percent of all Special Education students in the United States.

==Benefits of speech therapy==

Communication skills play an important part in life’s experiences.  In elementary school, children are developing language and learning to read and write.  In order for a child to learn, he has to communicate and interact with his peers and adults.  Spoken language is the basis for written language.  As a child grows and develops, the two types of language interact and build upon each other to improve literacy and language.  This process continues throughout a person’s life.  If a child has a communication disorder, they are often delayed in other areas, such as reading and math.  The child may be very bright but unable to express themselves correctly, and the learning process can be affected negatively.

Speech therapy can help children learn to communicate effectively with others and learn to solve problems and make decisions independently.  Communication with peers and educators is an essential part of a fulfilling educational experience.
Also, children who are able to overcome communication disorders feel a great sense of pride and confidence.  Children who stutter may be withdrawn socially, but with the help of therapy and improved confidence, they can enjoy a fully active social life (''ASHA'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44115">'''Statistical learning''' is the ability for humans and other animals to extract statistical regularities from the world around them to learn about the environment. Although statistical learning is now thought to be a generalized learning mechanism, the phenomenon was first identified in human infant [[language acquisition]].

The earliest evidence for these [[statistical|statistics]] [[learning]] abilities comes from a study by [[Jenny Saffran]], [[Richard N. Aslin|Richard Aslin]], and [[Elissa L. Newport|Elissa Newport]], in which 8-month-old infants were presented with nonsense streams of monotone [[speech]]. Each stream was composed of four three-[[syllable]] “[[pseudoword]]s” that were repeated randomly. After exposure to the speech streams for two minutes, infants reacted differently to hearing “pseudowords” as opposed to “nonwords” from the speech stream, where nonwords were composed of the same syllables that the infants had been exposed to, but in a different order. This suggests that infants are able to learn statistical relationships between syllables even with very limited exposure to a language. That is, infants learn which syllables are always paired together and which ones only occur together relatively rarely, suggesting that they are parts of two different units. This method of learning is thought to be one way that children learn which groups of syllables form individual words.

Since the initial discovery of the role of statistical learning in lexical acquisition, the same mechanism has been proposed for elements of [[phonology|phonological]] acquisition,  and [[syntax|syntactical]] acquisition, as well as in non-linguistic domains. Further research has also indicated that statistical learning is likely a domain-general and even species-general learning mechanism, occurring for visual as well as auditory information, and in both [[primates]] and non-primates.

==Lexical Acquisition==
The role of statistical learning in language acquisition has been particularly well documented in the area of [[lexicon|lexical]] acquisition.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R.|title=Statistical language learning: mechanisms and constraints|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=110–114|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01243}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important contribution to infants' understanding of segmenting words from a continuous stream of speech is their ability to recognize statistical regularities of the speech heard in their environments.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt; Although many factors play an important role, this specific mechanism is powerful and can operate over a short time scale.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;

===Original Findings===
[[File:Spectrogram-19thC.png|right|thumbnail|A [[spectrogram]] of a male speaker saying the phrase "nineteenth century." There is no clear demarcation where one word ends and the next begins.]]

It is a well-established finding that, unlike [[written language]], [[spoken language]] does not have any clear boundaries between words; spoken language is a continuous stream of sound rather than individual words with silences between them.&lt;ref name="Brent &amp; Cartwright, 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brent|first=Michael R.|author2=Cartwright, Timothy A. |title=Distributional regularity and phonotactic constraints are useful for segmentation|journal=Cognition|year=1996|volume=61|issue=1–2|pages=93–125|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(96)00719-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of segmentation between linguistic units presents a problem for young children learning language, who must be able to pick out individual units from the continuous speech streams that they hear.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=J. R.|author2=Aslin, R. N. |author3=Newport, E. L. |title=Statistical Learning by 8-Month-Old Infants|journal=Science|year=1996|volume=274|issue=5294|pages=1926–1928|doi=10.1126/science.274.5294.1926|pmid=8943209}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed method of how children are able to solve this problem is that they are attentive to the statistical regularities of the world around them.&lt;ref name="Brent &amp; Cartwright, 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt; For example, in the phrase "pretty baby," children are more likely to hear the sounds ''pre'' and ''ty'' heard together during the entirety of the lexical input around them than they are to hear the sounds ''ty'' and ''ba'' together.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt; In an [[artificial grammar learning]] study with adult participants, Saffran, Newport, and Aslin found that participants were able to locate word boundaries based only on transitional probabilities, suggesting that adults are capable of using statistical regularities in a language-learning task.&lt;ref name="Saffran, Newport, et al. (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R.|author2=Newport, Elissa L. |author3=Aslin, Richard N. |title=Word Segmentation: The Role of Distributional Cues|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|year=1996|volume=35|issue=4|pages=606–621|doi=10.1006/jmla.1996.0032}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a robust finding that has been widely replicated.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;

To determine if young children have these same abilities Saffran Aslin and Newport exposed 8-month-old infants to an artificial grammar.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt; The grammar was composed of four words, each composed of three nonsense syllables. During the experiment, infants heard a continuous speech stream of these words . Importantly, the speech was presented in a monotone with no cues (such as pauses, intonation, etc.) to word boundaries other than the statistical probabilities. Within a word, the transitional [[probability]] of two syllable pairs was 1.0: in the word ''bidaku'', for example, the probability of hearing the syllable ''da'' immediately after the syllable ''bi'' was 100%. Between words, however, the transitional probability of hearing a syllable pair was much lower: After any given word (e.g., ''bidaku'') was presented, one of three words could follow (in this case, ''padoti'', ''golabu'', or ''tupiro''), so the likelihood of hearing any given syllable after ''ku'' was only 33%.

To determine if infants were picking up on the statistical information, each infant was presented with multiple presentations of either a word from the artificial grammar or a nonword made up of the same syllables but presented in a random order. Infants who were presented with nonwords during the test phase listened significantly longer to these words than infants who were presented with words from the artificial grammar, showing a novelty preference for these new nonwords. However, the implementation of the test could also be due to infants learning serial-order information and not to actually learning transitional probabilities between words. That is, at test, infants heard strings such as ''dapiku'' and ''tilado'' that were never presented during learning; they could simply have learned that the syllable ''ku'' never followed the syllable ''pi''.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt;

To look more closely at this issue, Saffran Aslin and Newport conducted another study in which infants underwent the same training with the artificial grammar but then were presented with either words or part-words rather than words or nonwords.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt; The part-words were syllable sequences composed of the last syllable from one word and the first two syllables from another (such as ''kupado''). Because the part-words had been heard during the time when children were listening to the artificial grammar, preferential listening to these part-words would indicate that children were learning not only serial-order information, but also the statistical likelihood of hearing particular syllable sequences. Again, infants showed greater listening times to the novel (part-) words, indicating that 8-month-old infants were able to extract these statistical regularities from a continuous speech stream.

===Further Research===
This result has been the impetus for much more research on the role of statistical learning in lexical acquisition and other areas (see &lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)"/&gt;). In a follow-up to the original report,&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt; [[Richard N. Aslin|Aslin]], Saffran, and [[Elissa L. Newport|Newport]] found that even when words and part words occurred equally often in the speech stream, but with different transitional probabilities between syllables of words and part words, infants were still able to detect the statistical regularities and still preferred to listen to the novel part-words over the familiarized words.&lt;ref name="Aslin, Saffran, Newport, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aslin|first=R. N.|author2=Saffran, J. R. |author3=Newport, E. L. |title=Computation of Conditional Probability Statistics by 8-Month-Old Infants|journal=Psychological Science|year=1998|volume=9|issue=4|pages=321–324|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00063}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding provides stronger evidence that infants are able to pick up transitional probabilities from the speech they hear, rather than just being aware of frequencies of individual syllable sequences.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;

Another follow-up study examined the extent to which the statistical information learned during this type of artificial grammar learning feeds into knowledge that infants may already have about their [[First language|native language]].&lt;ref name="Saffran, 2001a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R|title=Words in a sea of sounds: the output of infant statistical learning|journal=Cognition|year=2001a|volume=81|issue=2|pages=149–169|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(01)00132-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants preferred to listen to words over part-words, whereas there was no significant difference in the nonsense frame condition. This finding suggests that even pre-linguistic infants are able to integrate the statistical cues they learn in a laboratory into their previously-acquired knowledge of a language.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saffran, 2001a" /&gt; In other words, once infants have acquired some linguistic knowledge, they incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning.

A related finding indicates that slightly older infants can acquire both lexical and grammatical regularities from a single set of input,&lt;ref name="Saffran &amp; Wilson, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R.|author2=Wilson, Diana P. |title=From Syllables to Syntax: Multilevel Statistical Learning by 12-Month-Old Infants|journal=Infancy|year=2003|volume=4|issue=2|pages=273–284|doi=10.1207/S15327078IN0402_07}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that they are able to use outputs of one type of statistical learning (cues that lead to the discovery of word boundaries) as input to a second type (cues that lead to the discovery of syntactical regularities.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saffran &amp; Wilson, 2003" /&gt; At test, 12-month-olds preferred to listen to sentences that had the same grammatical structure as the artificial language they had been tested on rather than sentences that had a different (ungrammatical) structure. Because learning grammatical regularities requires infants to be able to determine boundaries between individual words, this indicates that infants who are still quite young are able to acquire multiple levels of language knowledge (both lexical and syntactical) simultaneously, indicating that statistical learning is a powerful mechanism at play in language learning.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saffran &amp; Wilson, 2003" /&gt;

Despite the large role that statistical learning appears to play in lexical acquisition, it is likely not the only mechanism by which infants learn to segment words. Statistical learning studies are generally conducted with artificial grammars that have no cues to word boundary information other than transitional probabilities between words.  Real speech, though, has many different types of cues to word boundaries, including [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] and [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] information.&lt;ref name="Mattys et al., 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mattys|first=Sven L.|author2=Jusczyk, Peter W. |author3=Luce, Paul A. |author4= Morgan, James L. |title=Phonotactic and Prosodic Effects on Word Segmentation in Infants|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1999|volume=38|issue=4|pages=465–494|doi=10.1006/cogp.1999.0721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the findings from these studies of statistical learning in language acquisition indicate that statistical properties of the language are a strong cue in helping infants learn their first language.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;

==Phonological Acquisition==
There is much evidence that statistical learning is an important component of both discovering which phonemes are important for a given language and which contrasts within phonemes are important.&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gómez|first=Rebecca L.|author2=Gerken, LouAnn |title=Infant artificial language learning and language acquisition|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2000|volume=4|issue=5|pages=178–186|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01467-4|pmid=10782103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werker et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Werker|first=J. F.|author2=Yeung, H. H. |author3=Yoshida, K. A. |title=How Do Infants Become Experts at Native-Speech Perception?|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2012|volume=21|issue=4|pages=221–226|doi=10.1177/0963721412449459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhl, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=Patricia K.|title=Early language acquisition: cracking the speech code|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|year=2004|volume=5|issue=11|pages=831–843|doi=10.1038/nrn1533|pmid=15496861}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having this knowledge is important for aspects of both [[speech perception]] and [[speech production]].

===Distributional Learning===
Since the discovery of infants’ statistical learning abilities in word learning, the same general mechanism has also been studied in other facets of language learning. For example, it is well-established that infants can discriminate between [[phoneme]]s of many different languages but eventually become unable to discriminate between phonemes that do not appear in their native language;&lt;ref name="Maye et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maye|first=Jessica|author2=Werker, Janet F |author3=Gerken, LouAnn |title=Infant sensitivity to distributional information can affect phonetic discrimination|journal=Cognition|year=2002|volume=82|issue=3|pages=B101–B111|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(01)00157-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not clear how this decrease in discriminatory ability came about. Maye et al. suggested that the mechanism responsible might be a statistical learning mechanism in which infants track the distributional regularities of the sounds in their native language.&lt;ref name="Maye et al. 2002" /&gt; To test this idea, Maye et al. exposed 6- and 8-month-old infants to a continuum of speech sounds that varied on the degree to which they were [[voice onset time|voiced]]. The distribution that the infants heard was either [[bimodal distribution|bimodal]], with sounds from both ends of the voicing continuum heard most often, or [[unimodality|unimodal]], with sounds from the middle of the distribution heard most often. The results indicated that infants from both age groups were sensitive to the distribution of phonemes. At test, infants heard either non-alternating (repeated exemplars of tokens 3 or 6 from an 8-token continuum) or alternating (exemplars of tokens 1 and 8) exposures to specific phonemes on the continuum. Infants exposed to the bimodal distribution listened longer to the alternating trials than the non-alternating trials while there was no difference in listening times for infants exposed to the unimodal distribution. This finding indicates that infants exposed the bimodal distribution were better able to discriminate sounds from the two ends of the distribution than were infants in the unimodal condition, regardless of age. This type of statistical learning differs from that used in lexical acquisition, as it requires infants to track frequencies rather than transitional probabilities, and has been named “distributional learning.”&lt;ref name="Werker et al. (2012)"/&gt;

Distributional learning has also been found to help infants contrast two phonemes that they initially have difficulty in discriminating between. Maye, Weiss, and Aslin found that infants who were exposed to a bimodal distribution of a non-native contrast that was initially difficult to discriminate were better able to discriminate the contrast than infants exposed to a unimodal distribution of the same contrast.&lt;ref name="Maye et al. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maye|first=Jessica|author2=Weiss, Daniel J. |author3=Aslin, Richard N. |title=Statistical phonetic learning in infants: facilitation and feature generalization|journal=Developmental Science|year=2008|volume=11|issue=1|pages=122–134|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00653.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maye et al. also found that infants were able to abstract features of a contrast (i.e., voicing onset time) and generalize that feature to the same type of contrast at a different place of articulation, a finding that has not been found in adults.

In a review of the role of distributional learning on phonological acquisition, Werker et al. note that distributional learning cannot be the only mechanism by which phonetic categories are acquired.&lt;ref name="Werker et al. (2012)" /&gt; However, it does seem clear that this type of statistical learning mechanism can play a role in this skill, although research is ongoing.&lt;ref name="Werker et al. (2012)" /&gt;

===Perceptual Magnet Effect===
A related finding regarding statistical cues to phonological acquisition is a phenomenon known as the perceptual magnet effect.&lt;ref name=Kuhl,1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=Patricia K.|title=Human adults and human infants show a "perceptual magnet effect" for the prototypes of speech categories, monkeys do not|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|year=1991|volume=50|issue=2|pages=93–107|doi=10.3758/BF03212211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhl, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=P. K.|title=A new view of language acquisition|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2000|volume=97|issue=22|pages=11850–11857|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.22.11850|pmc=34178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhl et al. 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=P.|author2=Williams, K. |author3=Lacerda, F |author4=Stevens, K. |author5= Lindblom, B |title=Linguistic experience alters phonetic perception in infants by 6 months of age|journal=Science|year=1992|volume=255|issue=5044|pages=606–608|doi=10.1126/science.1736364|pmid=1736364}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this effect, a prototypical phoneme of a person’s native language acts as a “magnet” for similar phonemes, which are perceived as belonging to the same category as the prototypical phoneme. In the original test of this effect, adult participants were asked to indicate if a given exemplar of a particular phoneme differed from a referent phoneme.&lt;ref name=Kuhl,1991 /&gt; If the referent phoneme is a non-prototypical phoneme for that language, both adults and 6-month-old infants show less generalization to other sounds than they do for prototypical phonemes, even if the subjective distance between the sounds is the same.&lt;ref name=Kuhl,1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhl et al. 1992" /&gt; That is, adults and infants are both more likely to notice that a particular phoneme differs from the referent phoneme if that referent phoneme is a non-prototypical exemplar than if it is a prototypical exemplar. The prototypes themselves are apparently discovered through a distributional learning process, in which infants are sensitive to the frequencies with which certain sounds occur and treat those that occur most often as the prototypical phonemes of their language.&lt;ref name="Kuhl, 2004"/&gt;

==Syntactical Acquisition==
A statistical learning device has also been proposed as a component of syntactical acquisition for young children.&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidenberg (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seidenberg|first=M. S.|title=Language Acquisition and Use: Learning and Applying Probabilistic Constraints|journal=Science|year=1997|volume=275|issue=5306|pages=1599–1603|doi=10.1126/science.275.5306.1599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence for this mechanism came largely from studies of computer modeling or analyses of natural language corpora.&lt;ref name="Cartwright &amp; Brent, 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Timothy A.|author2=Brent, Michael R. |title=Syntactic categorization in early language acquisition: formalizing the role of distributional analysis|journal=Cognition|year=1997|volume=63|issue=2|pages=121–170|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(96)00793-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Redington et al., 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redington|first=M|title=Distributional information: A powerful cue for acquiring syntactic categories|journal=Cognitive Science|year=1998|volume=22|issue=4|pages=425–469|doi=10.1016/S0364-0213(99)80046-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early studies focused largely on distributional information specifically rather than statistical learning mechanisms generally. Specifically, in these early papers it was proposed that children created templates of possible sentence structures involving unnamed categories of word types (i.e., nouns or verbs, although children would not put these labels on their categories). Children were thought to learn which words belonged to the same categories by tracking the similar contexts in which words of the same category appeared.

Later studies expanded these results by looking at the actual behavior of children or adults who had been exposed to artificial grammars.&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)" /&gt; These later studies also considered the role of statistical learning more broadly than the earlier studies, placing their results in the context of the statistical learning mechanisms thought to be involved with other aspects of language learning, such as lexical acquisition.

===Experimental Results===
Evidence from a series of four experiments conducted by Gomez and [[LouAnn Gerken|Gerken]] suggests that children are able to generalize [[grammar|grammatical]] structures with less than two minutes of exposure to an artificial grammar.&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gomez|first=Rebecca L|author2=Gerken, LouAnn |title=Artificial grammar learning by 1-year-olds leads to specific and abstract knowledge|journal=Cognition|year=1999|volume=70|issue=2|pages=109–135|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(99)00003-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first experiment, 11-12 month-old infants were trained on an artificial grammar composed of nonsense words with a set grammatical structure. At test, infants heard both novel grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Infants oriented longer towards the grammatical sentences, in line with previous research that suggests that infants generally orient for a longer amount of time to natural instances of language rather than altered instances of language e.g.,.&lt;ref name="Hirsh-Pasek et al., 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirsh-Pasek|first1=Kathy|last2=Kemler Nelson|first2=Deborah G.|last3=Jusczyk|first3=Peter W.|last4=Cassidy|first4=Kimberly Wright|last5=Druss|first5=Benjamin|last6=Kennedy|first6=Lori|title=Clauses are perceptual units for young infants|journal=Cognition|volume=26|issue=3|year=1987|pages=269–286|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(87)80002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This familiarity preference differs from the novelty preference generally found in word-learning studies, due to the differences between lexical acquisition and syntactical acquisition.) This finding indicates that young children are sensitive to the grammatical structure of language even after minimal exposure. Gomez and Gerken also found that this sensitivity is evident when ungrammatical transitions are located in the middle of the sentence (unlike in the first experiment, in which all the errors occurred at the beginning and end of the sentences), that the results could not be due to an innate preference for the grammatical sentences caused by something other than grammar, and that children are able to generalize the grammatical rules to new vocabulary.

Together these studies suggest that infants are able to extract a substantial amount of syntactic knowledge even from limited exposure to a language.&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken, 1999"/&gt; Children apparently detected grammatical anomalies whether the grammatical violation in the test sentences occurred at the end or in the middle of the sentence. Additionally, even when the individual words of the grammar were changed, infants were still able to discriminate between grammatical and ungrammatical strings during the test phase. This generalization indicates that infants were not learning vocabulary-specific grammatical structures, but abstracting the general rules of that grammar and applying those rules to novel vocabulary. Furthermore, in all four experiments, the test of grammatical structures occurred five minutes after the initial exposure to the artificial grammar had ended, suggesting that the infants were able to maintain the grammatical abstractions they had learned even after a short delay.

In a similar study, Saffran found that adults and older children ([[first grade|first]] and [[second grade]] children) were also sensitive to syntactical information after exposure to an artificial language which had no cues to phrase structure other than the statistical regularities that were present.&lt;ref name="Saffran 2001b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R.|title=The Use of Predictive Dependencies in Language Learning|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|year=2001b|volume=44|issue=4|pages=493–515|doi=10.1006/jmla.2000.2759}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both adults and children were able to pick out sentences that were ungrammatical at a rate greater than chance, even under an “incidental” exposure condition in which participants’ primary goal was to complete a different task while hearing the language.

Although the number of studies dealing with statistical learning of syntactical information is limited, the available evidence does indicate that the statistical learning mechanisms are likely a contributing factor to children’s ability to learn their language.&lt;ref name="Gomez &amp; Gerken (2000)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidenberg (1997)"/&gt;

==Statistical Learning in Bilingualism==
Much of the early work using statistical learning paradigms focused on the ability for children or adults to learn a single language,&lt;ref name="Saffran (2003)" /&gt; consistent with the process of language acquisition for [[monolingualism|monolingual]] speakers or learners. However, it is estimated that approximately 60-75% of people in the world are [[multilingualism|bilingual]].&lt;ref name="Schneider &amp; Hopp, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Harry D.|author2=Hopp, Jenna P. |title=The use of the Bilingual Aphasia Test for assessment and transcranial direct current stimulation to modulate language acquisition in minimally verbal children with autism|journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics|year=2011|volume=25|issue=6–7|pages=640–654|doi=10.3109/02699206.2011.570852}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, researchers have begun looking at the role of statistical learning for those who speak more than one language. Although there are no reviews on this topic yet, Weiss, Gerfen, and Mitchel examined how hearing input from multiple artificial languages simultaneously can affect the ability to learn either or both languages.&lt;ref name="Weiss et al., 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Daniel J.|author2=Gerfen, Chip |author3=Mitchel, Aaron D. |title=Speech Segmentation in a Simulated Bilingual Environment: A Challenge for Statistical Learning?|journal=Language Learning and Development|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1080/15475440802340101|pmc=3981102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over four experiments, Weiss et al. found that, after exposure to two artificial languages, adult learners are capable of determining word boundaries in both languages when each language is spoken by a different speaker. However, when the two languages were spoken by the same speaker, participants were able learn both languages only when they were “congruent”—when the word boundaries of one language matched the word boundaries of the other. When the languages were incongruent—a syllable that appeared in the middle of a word in one language appeared at the end of the word in the other language—and spoken by a single speaker, participants were able to learn, at best, one of the two languages. A final experiment showed that the inability to learn incongruent languages spoken in the same voice was not due to syllable overlap between the languages but due to differing word boundaries.

Similar work replicates the finding that learners are able to learn two sets of statistical representations when an additional cue is present (two different male voices in this case).&lt;ref name="Franco et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franco|first=Ana|author2=Cleeremans, Axel |author3=Destrebecqz, Arnaud |title=Statistical Learning of Two Artificial Languages Presented Successively: How Conscious?|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|year=2011|volume=2|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their paradigm, the two languages were presented consecutively, rather than interleaved as in Weiss et al.’s paradigm,&lt;ref name="Weiss et al., 2009" /&gt; and participants did learn the first artificial language to which they had been exposed better than the second, although participants’ performance was above chance for both languages.

While statistical learning improves and strengthens multilingualism, it appears that the inverse is not true. In a study by Yim and Rudoy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yim|first=Dongsum|author2=Rudoy, John |title=Implicit Statistical Learning and Language Skills in Bilingual Children|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|date=August 2012|volume=56|pages=310–322|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2012/11-0243)}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that both monolingual and bilingual children perform statistical learning tasks equally well.

Antovich and Graf Estes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Antovich|first=Dylan M.|author2=Graf Estes, Katharine |title=Learning across languages: bilingual experience supports dual language statistical word segmentation|journal= Developmental Science|date=January 2017|doi=10.1111/desc.12548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 14 month old bilingual children are better than monolinguals at segmenting two different artificial languages using transitional probability cues. They suggest that a bilingual environment in early childhood trains children to rely on statistical regularities to segment the speech flow and access two lexical systems.

==Limitations on Statistical Learning==

===Word-Referent Mapping===
A statistical learning mechanism has also been proposed for learning the meaning of words. Specifically, Yu and [[Linda B. Smith|Smith]] conducted a pair of studies in which adults were exposed to pictures of objects and heard nonsense words.&lt;ref name="Yu &amp; Smith, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=C.|author2=Smith, L. B. |title=Rapid Word Learning Under Uncertainty via Cross-Situational Statistics|journal=Psychological Science|year=2007|volume=18|issue=5|pages=414–420|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01915.x|pmid=17576281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nonsense word was paired with a particular object. There were 18 total word-referent pairs, and each participant was presented with either 2, 3, or 4 objects at a time, depending on the condition, and heard the nonsense word associated with one of those objects. Each word-referent pair was presented 6 times over the course of the training trials; after the completion of the training trials, participants completed a forced-alternative test in which they were asked to choose the correct referent that matched a nonsense word they were given. Participants were able to choose the correct item more often than would happen by chance, indicating, according to the authors, that they were using statistical learning mechanisms to track co-occurrence probabilities across training trials.

An alternative hypothesis is that learners in this type of task may be using a “propose-but-verify” mechanism rather than a statistical learning mechanism.&lt;ref name="Medina et al., 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medina|first=T. N.|author2=Snedeker, J. |author3=Trueswell, J. C. |author4= Gleitman, L. R. |title=How words can and cannot be learned by observation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2011|volume=108|issue=22|pages=9014–9019|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105040108 |pmid=21576483 |pmc=3107260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trueswell et al., 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trueswell|first=John C.|author2=Medina, Tamara Nicol |author3=Hafri, Alon |author4= Gleitman, Lila R. |title=Propose but verify: Fast mapping meets cross-situational word learning|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=2013|volume=66|issue=1|pages=126–156|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2012.10.001 |pmid=23142693 |pmc=3529979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medina et al. and Trueswell et al. argue that, because Yu and Smith only tracked knowledge at the end of the training, rather than tracking knowledge on a trial-by-trial basis, it is impossible to know if participants were truly updating statistical probabilities of co-occurrence (and therefore maintaining multiple hypotheses simultaneously), or if, instead, they were forming a single [[hypothesis]] and checking it on the next trial.&lt;ref name="Yu &amp; Smith, 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Medina et al., 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trueswell et al., 2013" /&gt; For example, if a participant is presented with a picture of a dog and a picture of a shoe, and hears the nonsense word ''vash'' she might hypothesize that ''vash'' refers to the dog. On a future trial, she may see a picture of a shoe and a picture of a door and again hear the word ''vash''. If statistical learning is the mechanism by which word-referent mappings are learned, then the participant would be more likely to select the picture of the shoe than the door, as shoe would have appeared in conjunction with the word ''vash'' 100% of the time. However, if participants are simply forming a single hypothesis, they may fail to remember the context of the previous presentation of ''vash'' (especially if, as in the experimental conditions, there are multiple trials with other words in between the two presentations of ''vash'') and therefore be at chance in this second trial. According to this proposed mechanism of word learning, if the participant had correctly guessed that ''vash'' referred to the shoe in the first trial, her hypothesis would be confirmed in the subsequent trial.

To distinguish between these two possibilities, Trueswell et al. conducted a series of experiments similar to those conducted by Yu and Smith except that participants were asked to indicate their choice of the word-referent mapping on each trial, and only a single object name was presented on each trial (with varying numbers of objects).&lt;ref name="Yu &amp; Smith, 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trueswell et al., 2013" /&gt; Participants would therefore have been at chance when they are forced to make a choice in their first trial. The results from the subsequent trials indicate that participants were not using a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, but instead were using a propose-and-verify mechanism, holding only one potential hypothesis in mind at a time. Specifically, if participants had chosen an incorrect word-referent mapping in an initial presentation of a nonsense word (from a display of five possible choices), their likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping in the next trial of that word was still at chance, or 20%. If, though, the participant had chosen the correct word-referent mapping on an initial presentation of a nonsense word, the likelihood of choosing the correct word-referent mapping on the subsequent presentation of that word was approximately 50%. These results were also replicated in a condition where participants were choosing between only two alternatives. These results suggest that participants did not remember the surrounding context of individual presentations and were therefore not using statistical cues to determine the word-referent mappings. Instead, participants make a hypothesis regarding a word-referent mapping and, on the next presentation of that word, either confirm or reject the hypothesis accordingly.

Overall, these results, along with similar results from Medina et al., indicate that word meanings may not be learned through a statistical learning mechanism in these experiments, which ask participants to hypothesize a mapping even on the first occurrence (i.e., not cross-situationally).&lt;ref name="Medina et al., 2011" /&gt; However, when the propose-but-verify mechanism has been compared to a statistical learning mechanism, the former was unable to reproduce individual learning trajectories nor fit as well as the latter.&lt;ref name="Kachergis et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kachergis|first=G. N.|author2=Yu, C. |author3=Shiffrin, R. M. |title=Cross-situational word learning is better modeled by associations than hypotheses.|journal=IEEE Conference on Development and Learning / EpiRob 2012|year=2012|doi=10.1109/DevLrn.2012.6400861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Need for Social Interaction===
Additionally, statistical learning by itself cannot account even for those aspects of language acquisition for which it has been shown to play a large role. For example, [[Patricia K. Kuhl|Kuhl]], Tsao, and Liu found that young English-learning infants who spent time in a laboratory session with a native [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] speaker were able to distinguish between phonemes that occur in Mandarin but not in English, unlike infants who were in a control condition.&lt;ref name="Kuhl et al., 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=P. K.|title=Foreign-language experience in infancy: Effects of short-term exposure and social interaction on phonetic learning|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2003|volume=100|issue=15|pages=9096–9101|doi=10.1073/pnas.1532872100|pmid=12861072|pmc=166444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants in this control condition came to the lab as often as infants in the experimental condition, but were exposed only to English; when tested at a later date, they were unable to distinguish the Mandarin phonemes. In a second experiment, the authors presented infants with audio or audiovisual recordings of Mandarin speakers and tested the infants’ ability to distinguish between the Mandarin phonemes. In this condition, infants failed to distinguish the foreign language phonemes. This finding indicates that social interaction is a necessary component of language learning and that, even if infants are presented with the raw data of hearing a language, they are unable to take advantage of the statistical cues present in that data if they are not also experiencing the social interaction.&lt;ref name="Kuhl, 2004" /&gt;

==Domain Generality==
Although the phenomenon of statistical learning was first discovered in the context of language acquisition and there is much evidence of its role in that purpose, work since the original discovery has suggested that statistical learning may be a domain general skill and is likely not unique to humans.&lt;ref name="Saffran et al. (1996)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turk-Browne et al., 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turk-Browne|first=Nicholas B.|author2=Jungé, Justin A. |author3=Scholl, Brian J. |title=The Automaticity of Visual Statistical Learning.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=1 January 2005|volume=134|issue=4|pages=552–564|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.134.4.552}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, and Newport found that both adults and infants were able to learn statistical probabilities of “words” created by playing different musical tones (i.e., participants heard the musical notes D, E, and F presented together during training and were able to recognize those notes as a unit at test as compared to three notes that had not been presented together).&lt;ref name="Saffran, Johnson, et al., 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saffran|first=Jenny R|author2=Johnson, Elizabeth K |author3=Aslin, Richard N |author4= Newport, Elissa L |title=Statistical learning of tone sequences by human infants and adults|journal=Cognition|year=1999|volume=70|issue=1|pages=27–52|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(98)00075-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In non-auditory domains, there is evidence that humans are able to learn statistical visual information whether that information is presented across space, e.g.,&lt;ref name="Fiser &amp; Aslin, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiser|first=J.|author2=Aslin, R. N. |title=Unsupervised Statistical Learning of Higher-Order Spatial Structures from Visual Scenes|journal=Psychological Science|year=2001|volume=12|issue=6|pages=499–504|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00392}}&lt;/ref&gt; or time, e.g.,.&lt;ref name="Fiser &amp; Aslin, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiser|first=József|author2=Aslin, Richard N. |title=Statistical learning of higher-order temporal structure from visual shape sequences.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|year=2002|volume=28|issue=3|pages=458–467|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.28.3.458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of statistical learning has also been found in other [[primate]]s, e.g.,&lt;ref name="Newport et al., 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newport|first=Elissa L.|author2=Hauser, Marc D. |author3=Spaepen, Geertrui |author4= Aslin, Richard N. |title=Learning at a distance II. Statistical learning of non-adjacent dependencies in a non-human primate|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=49|issue=2|pages=85–117|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2003.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some limited statistical learning abilities have been found even in non-primates like [[laboratory rat|rats]].&lt;ref name="Toro &amp; Trobalon, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toro|first=Juan M.|author2=Trobalón, Josep B.|title=Statistical computations over a speech stream in a rodent|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|year=2005|volume=67|issue=5|pages=867–875|doi=10.3758/BF03193539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these findings suggest that statistical learning may be a generalized learning mechanism that happens to be utilized in language acquisition, rather than a mechanism that is unique to the human infant’s ability to learn his or her language(s).

Further evidence for domain general statistical learning was suggested in a study run through the University of Cornell Department of Psychology concerning visual statistical learning in infancy.  Researchers in this study questioned whether domain generality of statistical learning in infancy would be seen using visual information. After first viewing images in statistically predictable patterns, infants were then exposed to the same familiar patterns in addition to novel sequences of the same identical stimulus components. Interest in the visuals was measured by the amount of time the child looked at the stimuli in which the researchers named “looking time.” All ages of infant participants showed more interest in the novel sequence relative to the familiar sequence. In demonstrating a preference for the novel sequences (which violated the transitional probability that defined the grouping of the original stimuli) the results of the study support the likelihood of domain general statistical learning in infancy.&lt;ref name="KirkhamSlemmer2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirkham|first1=Natasha Z|last2=Slemmer|first2=Jonathan A|last3=Johnson|first3=Scott P|title=Visual statistical learning in infancy: evidence for a domain general learning mechanism|journal=Cognition|volume=83|issue=2|year=2002|pages=B35–B42|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(02)00004-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33940">'''Syntactic bootstrapping''' is a theory in developmental psycholinguistics and language acquistion which proposes that children learn word meanings by recognizing syntactic categories (such as nouns, adjectives, etc.) and the structure of their language. It is proposed that children have innate knowledge of the links between syntactic and [[Semantics|semantic]] categories and can use these observations to make inferences about word meaning. Learning words in one's native language can be challenging because the extralinguistic context of use does not give specific enough information about word meanings.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23–64|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in addition to extralinguistic cues, conclusions about syntactic categories are made &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|year=1990|title=The Structural Sources of Verb Meaning.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED335884|journal=Language Acquisition|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–55|via=|doi=10.1207/s15327817la0101_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then lead to inferences about a word's meaning. This theory aims to explain the acquisition of lexical categories such as verbs, nouns, etc. and functional categories such as case markers, determiners, etc.

==History==

One of the earliest demonstrations of the existence of syntactic bootstrapping is an experiment done by [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Roger W.|title=Linguistic determinism and the part of speech.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/h0041199|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1037/h0041199|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his research, Brown demonstrated that preschool-aged children could use their knowledge of different parts of speech to distinguish the meaning of nonsense words in English. The results of Brown’s experiment provided the first evidence showing that children could use syntax to infer meaning for newly encountered words and that they acquired grammar and semantics simultaneously. Brown's experiment was the beginning of the framework needed in order for the theory to thrive.

This led developmental psycholinguists like [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]], who coined the term syntactic bootstrapping in 1990,&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; to argue that syntax was pivotal for language learning, as it also gives a learner clues about [[semantics]]. According to Gleitman's hypothesis, verbs are learned with a delay compared to other parts of speech because the linguistic information that supports their acquisition is not available during the early stages of language acquisition.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The acquisition of verb meaning in children is pivotal to their language development. Syntactic bootstrapping seeks to explain how children acquire these words.

== Logic and evidence ==
The syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis is based on the idea that there are universal/innate links between syntactic categories and semantic categories. Learners can therefore use their observations about the syntactic categories of novel words to make inferences about their meanings. This hypothesis is intended to solve the problem that the extralinguistic context is uninformative by itself to make conclusions about a novel word's meaning.

For example, a child hears the sentence, “The cat meeped the bird.” If the child is familiar with the way arguments of verbs interact with the verb, he will infer that "the cat" is the agent and that "the bird" is the patient. Then, he can use these syntactic observations to infer that "meep" is a behaviour that the cat is doing to the bird.

Children's ability to identify syntactic categories may be supported by [[Prosodic bootstrapping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gervain|first=J.|last2=Nespor|first2=M.|last3=Mazuka|first3=R.|last4=Horie|first4=R.|last5=Mehler|first5=J.|year=2008|title=Bootstrapping word order in prelexical infants: A Japanese-Italian cross-linguistic study.|url=https://www.sissa.it/cns/Articles/Gervainetal08.pdf|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=57|pages=56–74|via=|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosodic bootstrapping is the hypothesis that children use prosodic cues, such as intonation and stress, to identify word boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707263897|title=Introduction to psycholinguistics : understanding language science|last=J.|first=Traxler, Matthew|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=|isbn=9781405198622|edition=1st ed|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=335|oclc=707263897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensitivity to syntactic categories ===

Landau and Gleitman (1985) found when studying the acquisition of the verbs ''look'' and ''see'' by blind children that contextual clues appeared to be insufficient to explain their ability to differentiate these verbs &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and Experience: Evidence from the Blind Child|last=Landau|first=Barbara|last2=Gleitman|first2=Lila|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-674-51025-9|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=120–156|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''  They considered the possibility that perceptual verbs might be used more by the blind child's mother when talking about nearby objects, since the child had to touch objects to perceive them. An analysis of the mother's utterances however, found this not to be the case.

The solution investigated by Gleitman et al. was that syntactic categories (referred to as 'Sentence Frames' by Gleitman), narrow down the contexts in which verbs are present, allowing children to learn their specific meanings in isolation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Acquisition of Syntactic Structure|last=Becker|first=Misha|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-00784-0|location=New York|pages=186-187}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This narrowing provided evidence for their original hypothesis. When utterances that selected for ''perception verbs only'' were analyzed, the mother's use of the verbs ''look'' and ''see'' for nearby objects increased significantly. Gleitman concluded that a narrowing of contexts, ''then'' contextual support were required for the blind children to learn verbs (in which they had no direct experience). By proxy, since there are many verbs that sighted children do not have direct experience with, they must use the same mechanism as well.

Waxman and Booth (2001) found that children who heard nouns focused on the object categories and children who focused on adjectives focused on an object's properties and categories. This shows that children are sensitive to different syntactic categories and can use their observations of syntax to infer word meaning.

=== Sensitivity to syntactic framing ===
In Roger Brown’s 1957 experiment, children between the ages of three and five were shown various pictures depicting nonsense words that represented either singular nouns, [[mass nounc|mass nouns]], [[count noun]]s or verbs. When the novel words were positioned in a question format, the children were able to use the placement of the novel word in the sentence to draw conclusions focus on different aspects of the image shown and adjusted their answer. For example, when Brown wanted the child to identify a mass noun, he would ask the children "do you see any sib", and the child would point at the pictured mass noun or noun indicating quantity. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Mass noun environment|| ''Do you see any '''sib'''?''
|-
| Verb environment|| ''What is '''sib'''bing?''
|-
| Singular noun environment || ''Do you see a '''sib'''?''

When children made guesses, they were correct more than half of the time.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Roger W.|title=Linguistic determinism and the part of speech.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0041199|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1037/h0041199|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that children are sensitive to the syntactic position of words, and can correctly associate a novel word with its syntactic category.

Harrigan, Hacquard, and Lidz (2016) &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrigan|first=Kaitlyn|last2=Hacquard|first2=V.|last3=Lidz|first3=J.|year=2016|title=Syntactic Bootstrapping in the Acquisition of Attitude Verbs: think, want and hope|journal=In Proceedings of WCCFL|volume=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Found that children's interpretation of a new attitude verb depended on the [[Subcategorization|syntactic frame]] in which it was introduced. In the experiment, children who heard the word 'hope' presented in the same syntactic frame as 'want' (i.e. followed by an infinitival verb) connected the new verb 'hope' with a meaning of desire. On the other hand, those that heard 'hope' presented in the same frame as 'think' (i.e. followed by a finite verb) made no such association between desire and the new verb, instead of associating the novel verb with belief. This provides evidence that children use syntax to some extent in learning the meaning behind these sorts of abstract verbs.

At the end of the tape, they would hear a sentence describing the scene but the sentence's verb was replaced with a novel word. Children were asked to respond with what they thought the word meant. Their responses were categorized 4 ways: Action, Belief, Desire, and Other. They found that action words were easily interpreted by children. However, false belief scenes with the complementizer phrase caused for children to respond with belief words more often. Results showed that participants in the experiment identified the verb most accurately when they could use both the video and sentence contexts. When it comes to attitude verbs, children are sensitive to the syntactic framing of the verb in question.

Wellwood, Gagliardi, and Lidz (2016) &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wellwood|first=Alexis|last2=Gagliardi|first2=Annie|last3=Lidz|first3=Jeffrey|date=2016-07-02|title=Syntactic and Lexical Inference in the Acquisition of Novel Superlatives|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15475441.2015.1052878|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=12|issue=3|pages=262–279|doi=10.1080/15475441.2015.1052878|issn=1547-5441}}&lt;/ref&gt;— showed that four-year-olds can understand the difference between a quantitative or qualitative word, based on its syntactic position within a sentence. In “Gleebest of the cows are by the barn,” the novel word “gleebest” is in a determiner position, and is inferred to mean “most” or “many.” In “the gleebest cows are by the barn,” “gleebest” is in an adjective position, and children infer it to mean “spotty” or another quality. These results are significant because they show children using syntax to understand word meanings.

In the Gillette et al. (1999) study&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillette|first=J.|last2=Gleitman|first2=H.|last3=Gleitman|first3=L.|last4=Lederer|first4=A.|date=1999-12-07|title=Human simulations of vocabulary learning|journal=Cognition|volume=73|issue=2|pages=135–176|issn=0010-0277|pmid=10580161|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(99)00036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;—, the researchers tested adults to see what difficulties they would face when asked to identify a word from a muted, videotaped scene. They found that adults had trouble identifying the word, especially verbs, when they could only refer to the scene.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Their performance increased once they were given the syntactic context for the mystery word. These results indicate that word learning is aided by the presence of syntactic context.

==Acquiring lexical categories==

=== Acquiring verbs ===
Gillette et al. (1999) performed experiments which found that participants who were provided both environmental and syntactic contexts were better able to infer what muted word was uttered at a particular point in a video than when only the environmental context was provided.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; In the experiment, participants were shown muted videos of a mother and infant playing. At a particular point in the video, a beep would sound and participants had to guess what word the beep stood for. It was always a verb or noun. Experimental results showed that participants were correct on identifying nouns more often than verbs. This shows that certain contexts are conducive to learning certain categories of words, like nouns, while the same context is not conducive to learning other categories, like verbs. However, when the scene was paired with a sentence containing all novel words, but the same syntactic structure as the original sentence, adults were better able to guess the verb. This shows that syntactic context is useful in the acquisition of verbs.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

An early demonstration by Naigles (1990) of syntactic bootstrapping involved showing 2-year-olds a video of a duck using its left hand to push a rabbit down into a [[squatting position]] while both the animals wave their right arms in circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naigles|first1=L.|title=Children Use Syntax to Learn Verb Meaning|journal=Journal of Child Language|date=1990|volume=17|pages=357–374|doi=10.1017/S0305000900013817}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

 '''Initial video''': Duck uses left hand to push rabbit into squatting position while both animals wave their right arms in circles

During the video, children are presented with one of the following two descriptions:

 (6) '''Utterance A''': ''The duck is '''kradding''' the rabbit.''
     (describes a situation where the duck does something to the rabbit)
 (7) '''Utterance B''': ''The rabbit and duck are '''kradding'''.''
     (describes a situation where the duck and the rabbit perform the same action)

Children were then presented two distinct follow-up videos.

 '''Follow-up video 1''': the duck pushing the rabbit
 '''Follow-up video 2''': the duck and the rabbit are both waving their arms in the air.

When instructed to "find kradding", children looked to the video that illustrated the utterance they heard during the initial video. Children who heard utterance A interpreted ''kradding'' to mean the act of the duck pushing on the rabbit, while children who heard utterance B assumed ''kradding'' was the action of arm waving. This indicates that children arrive at interpretations of a novel verb based on the utterance context and the syntactic structure in which it was embedded.

In 1990, Lila Gleitman took this idea further by examining the acquisition of verbs in more detail.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Gleitman, Lila. "The Structural Source of Verb Meanings", 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In her study, she found that children could differentiate between verbs that take one or more arguments and that this knowledge was used to help them narrow down the potential meanings for the verb in question. This discovery explains how children can learn the meaning of verbs that cannot be observed, like ‘think’.

In later studies, this was exemplified by Fisher as she proposed that children can use the number of noun phrases in a sentence as evidence about a verb's meaning.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Cynthia|year=1996|title=Structural Limits on Verb Mapping: The Role of Analogy in Children’s Interpretations of Sentences|url=|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=31|issue=12|pages=41–81|via=|doi=10.1006/cogp.1996.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that children expect the noun phrases in a sentence to map one-to-one with participant roles in the event described by that sentence. For example, if a toddler hears a sentence that contains two noun phrases, she can infer that that sentence describes an event with two participants. This constrains the meaning that the verb in that sentence can have. Fisher presented 3 and 5 year old children a video in which one participant caused a second participant to move. Children who heard that scene described by a transitive clause containing a novel verb, associated the subject of the verb with the agent. Children who heard the scene described by an intransitive clause associated the subject with either the agent or the patient.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This shows that children make different inferences about meaning depending on the transitivity of the sentence.

==== Acquiring attitude verbs ====
Acquiring the meaning of attitude verbs, which refer to an individual’s mental state, provides a challenge for word learners since these verbs do not correlate with any physical aspects of the environment. Words such as 'think' and 'want' do not have physically observable qualities. Thus, there must be something deeper going on that enables children to learn these verbs referring to abstract mental concepts, such as syntactic frames as described in a study above by Harrigan, Hacquard, and Lidz.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; Because children have no initial idea about the meaning or usage of the words, syntactic bootstrapping aids them in figuring out when verbs refer to mental concepts. If a child hears the statement, "Matt thinks his grandmother is under the covers," three- to four-year-old children will understand that the sentence is about Matt's belief.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papafragou|first=Anna|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Gleitman|first3=Lila R.|date=2007|year=|title=When we think about thinking: The acquisition of belief verbs|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=105|pages=|via=|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.09.008|pmc=2768311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children will understand from the syntactic frame in which it was uttered that the verb for mental state, ''thinks'', refers to Matt's beliefs and not to his grandmother's. In addition, Gillette et al. (1999)&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; show that mental state verbs cannot easily be identified when only visual context is available and that these verbs showed the greatest improvement when syntactic context was provided.

=== Acquiring nouns ===
The acquisition of nouns is related to the acquisition of the [[#The acquisition of the count/mass contrast|mass/count contrast]]. In 1969, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. "Ontological Relativity and Other Essays", 1969&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that children cannot learn new nouns unless they have already acquired this semantic distinction. Otherwise, the word “apples” might refer to the individual objects in a pile or the pile itself, and the child would have no way to know without already understanding the difference between a mass and a count noun. Nancy N. Soja&lt;ref&gt;Soja, N "Inferences about the meanings of nouns: the relationship between perception and syntax", 1992&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Quine is mistaken, and that children can learn new nouns without fully understanding the mass/count distinction. She found in her study that 2-year old children were able to learn new nouns (some mass, some count nouns) from inferring meaning from the syntactic structure of the sentence the words were introduced in.

=== Acquiring adjectives ===
In a 2010 study, Syrett and Lidz&lt;ref&gt;Syrett, Kristen &amp; Jeffrey Lidz."30-Month-Olds Use the Distribution and Meaning of Adverbs to Interpret Novel Adjectives", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; show that children learn the meaning of novel gradable adjectives on the basis of the adverbs that modify them. Gradable adjectives have a scale associated with them: for example, the adjective “large” places the noun that it modifies on a size scale, while the adjective “expensive” places the noun that is modifiers on a price scale. In addition, gradable adjectives (GA's) subdivide into two classes: relative and maximal GA’s.

Relative GA’s are words like “big” in (5), and require a reference point: a big mouse is not the same size as a big elephant. As shown in (6) and (7), while relative GAs can be modified by the adverb ''very'' they cannot be modified by the adverb ''completely''.

 relative gradable adjectives
 (5) a.  ''a '''big''' mouse''
     b.  ''a '''big''' elephant''
 (6) a.  ''a very '''big''' mouse''
     b.  ''a very '''big''' elephant''
 (7) a. *''a completely '''big''' mouse''
     b. *''a completely '''big''' elephant''

Maximal GA’s are words like, “full” in (8); they operate on a close-ended scale. As shown in (9) and (10), while relative GAs cannot be modified by the adverb ''very'' they can be modified by the adverb ''completely''.

 maximal gradable adjectives
 (8)  a.    ''a '''full''' pool''
      b.    ''a '''full''' tank''
 (9)  a. ?? ''a very '''full''' pool''
      b. ?? ''a very '''full''' tank''
 (10) a.    ''a completely '''full''' pool''
      b.    ''a completely '''full''' tank''

In the 2010 study, Syrett and Lidz showed children pictures of objects that could be described in terms of both relative and maximal GA’s. For example, a picture of a container that could be described as both ''tall'' (a relative GA) and ''clear'' (a maximal GA).

When showing these objects to the children, the novel adjective used to describe them was prefaced with either adverb ''very'' (which usually modifies relative GA’s) or the adverb ''completely'' (which modifies maximal GA’s). As a control, in some contexts, no adverb was present. When the novel adjective was presented with the adverb ''very'', the children assigned a relative GA meaning to it, and when it was presented with adverb ''completely'', a maximal GA. When no adverb was present, the children were unable to assign a meaning to the adjective. This shows that, in order for children to learn the meaning of a new adjective, they depend on grammatical information provide by adverbs about the semantic class of the novel adjective.

An experiment by Wellwood, Gagliardi, and Lidz (2016) showed that four-year-olds associate unknown words with a quality meaning when they are presented with adjective syntax, and with a quantitative meaning when they are presented with determiner syntax. For example, in "Gleebest of the cows are by the barn," "gleebest" would be interpreted as "many" or "four," a quantity. Yet children associate the same unknown word with a quality interpretation when the word is presented in an adjective position. In the sentence "The gleebest cows are by the barn," "gleebest" would be interpreted as "striped" or "purple," a quality.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; This shows that children use syntax to identify whether a word is an adjective or a determiner, and use that category information to infer aspects of the word's meaning.

== Acquiring functional categories ==
There is a basic contrast between lexical categories (which include open-class items such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives), and [[functional item|functional categories]] (which include closed-class items such [[auxiliary verb]]s, case markers, [[complementizer]]s, [[coordination (linguistics)|conjunctions]] and [[determiner]]s. The acquisition functional categories has been studied significantly less than the lexical class, so much remains unknown. A 1998 study led by Rushen Shi&lt;ref&gt;Shi, Rushen, James L. Morgan, Paul Allopena. (1998). Phonological and acoustic bases for earliest grammatical category assignment; a cross-linguistic perspective&lt;/ref&gt; shows that, at a very young age, Mandarin and Turkish learners use [[phonology|phonological]], acoustic and distributional cues to distinguish between words that are lexical categories from words that are functional categories. 11 to 20-month old children were observed speaking with their mothers to evaluate whether speech directed at the children contained clues that they could then use to categorize words as "lexical" or "function". Compared to as lexical category words, functional category words were found to have the following properties:

* simpler syllable structures
* simpler vowels ([[monophthong|monopthongs]] as opposed to [[diphthong]]s)
* shorter duration
* lower amplitude
* occur much more frequently in speech

== Challenges to the theory ==
[[Steven Pinker]] presents his theory of [[semantic bootstrapping]], which hypothesizes that children use the meaning of words to start to learn the syntax of their language.  Gleitman (1990) counters Pinker’s ideas by asserting that context is insufficient to supply word meaning, as a single context can allow for multiple interpretations of an uttered sentence. She explains that simply observing objects and events in the world does not provide sufficient information to infer the meanings of words and sentences.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Pinker, however, argues that semantic bootstrapping and syntactic bootstrapping aren't conflicting ideas, and that semantic bootstrapping makes no claims about learning word meanings. He argues that since semantic bootstrapping is a hypothesis about how children acquire syntax, while syntactic bootstrapping is a hypothesis about how children acquire word meanings, the opposition between the two theories does not necessarily exist.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinker|first=Steven|year=1994|title=How could a child use verb syntax to learn verb semantics?|url=|journal=Lingua|volume=94|pages=337–410|via=|doi=10.1016/0024-3841(94)90347-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker agrees that syntactic categories are in fact used by children to learn semantics and accepts syntactic bootstrapping, but argues that Gleitman applies the hypothesis too broadly, and that is insufficient evidence to account for all of Gleitman's claims. Pinker argues that while children can use syntax to learn certain semantic properties within a single frame, like the number of arguments a verb takes or the types of arguments such as agent and patient, there are serious problems with the argument that children pick up on these semantic properties from the syntax when a verb is found in a wide range of syntactic frames. Pinker uses the verb "sew" as an example:
{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="4" |Frames of "sew" (Pinker 1994)
|-
| rowspan="4" |(You) sew
| colspan="2" |
|Activity

| rowspan="3" |the shirt
|
|Activity done to an object.
|-
|for me
|Creating an object for a beneficiary.
|-
|out of rags
|Creating one object out of another.
|}
Pinker argues that the syntax provides information about possible verb frames, but does not help a learner "zoom in" on a verb's meaning after hearing it in multiple frames. According to Pinker, the frames presented above for "sew" can do nothing for learners other than clue them into the fact that "sewing" is some sort of activity. Furthermore, Pinker disagrees with Gleitman's claim that the ambiguities in the situations where a word is used could only be solved by using information about how the word behaves syntactically.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications cross-linguistically ==
With all of the studies above supporting or challenging syntactic bootstrapping, how does the theory hold up cross linguistically?

Two studies focusing on French and German were determining the use of syntactic contexts to classify novel words as nouns or verbs. The German study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höhle, B., Weissenborn, J., Kiefer, D., Schulz, A., &amp; Schmitz, M.|title=Functional elements in infants' speech processing: The role of determiners in the syntactic categorization of lexical elements.|journal=Infancy|date=2004|volume=5 | issue = 3 |pages=341–353|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0503_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children between 14 and 16 months could use [[determiner]]s to classify a novel word as a noun, however, they could not show the same ability mapping pronoun environments to verbs. Overall, this exemplifies their ability to determine the categories of function words and shows a sensitivity to syntactic framing. Following this conclusion, Christophe et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christophe, A., Millotte, S., Bernal, S., &amp; Lidz, J.|title=Bootstrapping lexical and syntactic acquisition|journal=Language and Speech|date=2008|volume=51(1-2)|pages=61–75|doi=10.1177/00238309080510010501}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children can use this ability along with [[Prosodic bootstrapping]] to infer the syntactic category of the neighboring content words; as at 23 months they can classify novel nouns as well as verbs based on their surrounding syntactic envionrment. These studies follow the Syntactic Bootstrapping model of language acquisition, however, the determiner/noun and pronoun/verb environments are also found in English, som, how well does this theory apply to a Language structurally different from English?

Lee and Naigles (2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joanne N.|last2=Naigles|first2=Letitia R.|year=2005|title=The Input to Verb Learning in Mandarin Chinese: A Role for syntactic bootstrapping|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=529–540|via=|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.3.529}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked into how Mandarin children use the transitive versus intransitive environments to infer meaning in a language that allows the [[noun phrase]] (subject or object) argument to go unpronounced. Following Fisher’s studies where children use the number of NP’s to make conclusions about the causation in the sentence; 1 NP is an intransitive sentence and involves only the agent while 2 NP’s is a transitive environment and involves an action being taken upon something or someone. 
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! colspan = "2"|Intransitive environment !!colspan="3" | Transitive environment
|-
| &lt;Agent&gt; || &lt;Non-causative verb&gt; || &lt;Agent&gt; || &lt;Causative verb&gt; || &lt;Theme&gt;
|-
| ''The dog'' || ''comes'' || ''The dog'' || ''brings'' || ''the lion''
|}
The environment above was presented in the study and then altered to test the change of interpretation the Mandarin children might have. Due to the pervasive [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] in Mandarin, the number of NP’s in a phrase is a weaker clue in mapping causation or non-causation of a verb. Presented with an elided transitive environment ''The dog brings,'' the children determined the sentence to be intransitive, meaning they changed their interpretation of the verb based on the number of noun phrases presented. This was shown as the children used toys to act out the scenario they heard; if their interpretation were to be independent of the number of NP's they would have shown the dog bringing the lion, however, they showed the dog going on its own, showing their interpretation of the verb to be non-causative. This follows the syntactic bootstrapping theory as their mapping of verb meaning relied on the syntactic frame and content in the sentence. However, it poses another question about how Mandarin children can go on to map transitive or intransitive environments properly during their development.

A few studies have begun to look at how children learning languages with different word orders represent syntactic structures which are required for children to map word meanings or categories using syntactic bootstrapping. For example, the research on the acquisition of verbs presents English children as using information about the subject and objects to determine if the verb is causative or non-causative, however, will this ability change in a language which has the object occurring before the verb. One could assume this to be a difficult task if both an English child and child leaning an [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] language have the same mental representation of syntactic structure. To address this, a Gervain, et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervain, J., Nespor, M., Mazuka, R., Horie, R., &amp; Mehler, J.|title=Bootstrapping word order in prelexical infants: A Japanese–Italian cross-linguistic study|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=2008|volume=57 | issue = 1 |pages=56–74|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at an infant’s mental representation of Japanese, which is a [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] – [[Head (linguistics)|head]] language with an object-verb (OV) word order, and Italian, which like English, is head-complement and therefore has a verb-object (VO) word order. They found that 8-month-olds have a general knowledge of word order specific to their language preceding their acquisition of lexical items or syntactic categories. Their attuning of structural relations of syntactic categories (verbs, nouns, etc.) within their language allows them to then apply this knowledge later in their development, possibly allowing for language-specific syntactic bootstrapping.

{{linguistics}}

In [[linguistics]], '''syntax''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|t|æ|k|s}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}) is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in a given [[Natural language|language]], usually including [[word order]]. The term ''syntax'' is also used  to refer to the study of such principles and processes.&lt;ref name="Chomsky def"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2002 |origyear=1957 |title= Syntactic Structures |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SNeHkMXHcd8C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22syntax+is%22 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the [[Universal grammar|syntactic rules]] common to all languages.

In mathematics, ''syntax'' refers to the rules governing the notation of mathematical systems, such as [[formal language]]s used in [[logic]]. (See [[Syntax (logic)|logical syntax]].)

== Etymology ==
The word ''syntax'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]]: {{wikt-lang|grc|σύνταξις}} "coordination", which consists of {{lang|grc|σύν}} ''syn'', "together", and {{lang|grc|τάξις}} ''táxis'', "an ordering".

==Sequencing of subject, verb, and object==

A basic feature of a language's syntax is the sequence in which the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (S), [[verb]] (V), and [[object (grammar)|object]] (O) usually appear in sentences. Over 85% of languages usually place the subject first, either in the sequence [[subject-verb-object|SVO]] or the sequence [[subject-object-verb|SOV]]. The other possible sequences are [[verb-subject-object|VSO]], [[verb-object-subject|VOS]], [[object-verb-subject|OVS]], and [[object-subject-verb|OSV]], the last three of which are rare.

== Early history ==
Works on [[grammar]] were written long before modern syntax came about; in [[Ancient India|Ancient]] [[India]], the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' of [[Pāṇini]] (c. 4th century BC) is often cited as an example of a premodern work that approaches the sophistication of a modern syntactic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortson IV |first=Benjamin W. |title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1405188968 |page=186 |quote=[The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī''] is a highly precise and thorough description of the structure of Sanskrit somewhat resembling modern generative grammar...[it] remained the most advanced linguistic analysis of any kind until the twentieth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, the school of thought that came to be known as "traditional grammar" began with the work of [[Dionysius Thrax]].

For centuries, work in syntax was dominated by a framework known as {{lang|fr|grammaire générale}}, first expounded in 1660 by [[Antoine Arnauld]] in a book of the same title. This system took as its basic premise the assumption that language is a direct reflection of thought processes and therefore there is a single, most natural way to express a thought.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, in the 19th century, with the development of [[historical-comparative linguistics]], linguists began to realize the sheer diversity of human language and to question fundamental assumptions about the relationship between language and logic. It became apparent that there was no such thing as the most natural way to express a thought, and therefore [[logic]] could no longer be relied upon as a basis for studying the structure of language.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal grammar]] modeled the study of syntax upon that of logic. (Indeed, large parts of the [[Port-Royal Logic]] were copied or adapted from the ''Grammaire générale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnauld |first=Antoine |title=La logique |year=1683 |edition=5th |location=Paris |publisher=G. Desprez |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&amp;O=NUMM-57444 |quote={{lang|fr|Nous avons emprunté...ce que nous avons dit...d'un petit Livre...sous le titre de Grammaire générale.}} |pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Syntactic categories were identified with logical ones, and all sentences were analyzed in terms of "subject – copula – predicate". Initially, this view was adopted even by the early comparative linguists such as [[Franz Bopp]].

The central role of syntax within [[theoretical linguistics]] became clear only in the 20th century, which could reasonably be called the "century of syntactic theory" as far as linguistics is concerned. (For a detailed and critical survey of the history of syntax in the last two centuries, see the monumental work by Giorgio Graffi (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Giorgio |first=Graffi |year= 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/200_Years_of_Syntax.html?id=mydolrE-PPkC |title= 200 Years of Syntax: A Critical Survey |format=googlebook preview |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=9789027284570  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.)

== Theories ==
There are a number of theoretical approaches to the discipline of syntax. One school of thought, founded in the works of [[Derek Bickerton]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title=Language and Species |author=Bickerton, Derek |year=1990 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-04610-9}} and, for more recent advances, {{cite book |title=Biological foundations and origin of syntax |editor1=Derek Bickerton |editor2=Eörs Szathmáry |year=2009 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-01356-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; sees syntax as a branch of biology, since it conceives of syntax as the study of linguistic knowledge as embodied in the human [[mind]]. Other linguists (e.g., [[Gerald Gazdar]]) take a more [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|Platonistic]] view, since they regard syntax to be the study of an abstract [[formal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Briscoe, 2 May 2001, [http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html#SECTION00040000000000000000 Interview with Gerald Gazdar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122163306/http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html |date=2005-11-22 }}. Retrieved 2008-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others (e.g., [[Joseph Greenberg]]) consider syntax a taxonomical device to reach broad generalizations across languages.

=== Generative grammar ===
{{Main|Generative grammar}}
The hypothesis of generative grammar is that language is a structure of the human mind. The goal of generative grammar is to make a complete model of this inner language (known as ''[[i-language]]''). This model could be used to describe all human language and to predict the [[grammaticality]] of any given utterance (that is, to predict whether the utterance would sound correct to native speakers of the language). This approach to language was pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]]. Most generative theories (although not all of them) assume that syntax is based upon the constituent structure of sentences. Generative grammars are among the theories that focus primarily on the form of a sentence, rather than its communicative function.

Among the many generative theories of linguistics, the Chomskyan theories are:
* [[Transformational grammar]] (TG) (Original theory of generative syntax laid out by Chomsky in ''Syntactic Structures'' in 1957)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures''. The Hague/Paris: Mouton, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Government and binding theory]] (GB) (revised theory in the tradition of TG developed mainly by Chomsky in the 1970s and 1980s)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1981/1993). Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minimalist program]] (MP) (a reworking of the theory out of the GB framework published by Chomsky in 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1995). The Minimalist Program. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories that find their origin in the generative paradigm are:
* [[Arc pair grammar]]
* [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG; now largely out of date)
* [[Generative semantics]] (superseded by Semantic Syntax &lt;ref&gt;Seuren, P. A. M. 2018. ''Semantic Syntax''. Revised edition. Leiden: Brill&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG)
* [[Lexical functional grammar]] (LFG)
* [[Nanosyntax]]&lt;!--Commenting out until explained: the link seems to be about something unrelated. HPSG and LFG also fall into the category of [[unification]] grammars.--&gt;
* [[Relational grammar]] (RG) (now largely out of date)

=== Dependency grammar ===
{{Main|Dependency grammar}}
[[Dependency grammar]] is an approach to sentence structure where syntactic units are arranged according to the dependency relation, as opposed to the constituency relation of [[phrase structure grammar]]s. Dependencies are directed links between words. The (finite) verb is seen as the root of all clause structure and all the other words in the clause are either directly or indirectly dependent on this root. Some prominent dependency-based theories of syntax are:

* [[Recursive categorical syntax]], or Algebraic syntax
* [[Functional generative description]]
* [[Meaning–text theory]]
* [[Operator grammar]]
* [[Word grammar]]

[[Lucien Tesnière]] (1893–1954) is widely seen as the father of modern dependency-based theories of syntax and grammar. He argued vehemently against the binary division of the clause into [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] that is associated with the grammars of his day (S → NP VP) and which remains at the core of most phrase structure grammars. In the place of this division, he positioned the verb as the root of all clause structure.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Tesnière's rejection of the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate and in favor of the verb as the root of all structure, see Tesnière (1969:103–105).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Categorial grammar ===
{{Main|Categorial grammar}}
[[Categorial grammar]] is an approach that attributes the syntactic structure not to rules of grammar, but to the properties of the [[syntactic categories]] themselves. For example, rather than asserting that sentences are constructed by a rule that combines a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP) (e.g., the [[phrase structure rule]] S → NP VP), in categorial grammar, such principles are embedded in the category of the [[head (linguistics)|head]] word itself. So the syntactic category for an [[intransitive]] verb is a complex formula representing the fact that the verb acts as a [[function word]] requiring an NP as an input and produces a sentence level structure as an output. This complex category is notated as (NP\S) instead of V. NP\S is read as "a category that searches to the left (indicated by \) for an NP (the element on the left) and outputs a sentence (the element on the right)." The category of [[transitive verb]] is defined as an element that requires two NPs (its subject and its direct object) to form a sentence. This is notated as (NP/(NP\S)) which means "a category that searches to the right (indicated by /) for an NP (the object), and generates a function (equivalent to the VP) which is (NP\S), which in turn represents a function that searches to the left for an NP and produces a sentence."

[[Tree-adjoining grammar]] is a categorial grammar that adds in partial [[tree structure]]s to the categories.

=== Stochastic/probabilistic grammars/network theories ===
Theoretical approaches to syntax that are based upon [[probability theory]] are known as [[stochastic grammar]]s. One common implementation of such an approach makes use of a [[neural network]] or [[connectionism]].

=== Functionalist grammars ===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functionalist theories, although focused upon form, are driven by explanation based upon the function of a sentence (i.e., its communicative function). Some typical functionalist theories include:
* [[Cognitive grammar]]
* [[Construction grammar]] (CxG)
* [[Emergent grammar]]
* [[Functional discourse grammar]] (Dik)
* [[Prague linguistic circle]]
* [[Role and reference grammar]] (RRG)
* [[Systemic functional grammar]]

The '''Text Services Framework (TSF)''' is a [[Component Object Model|COM]] [[Software framework|framework]] and [[API]] in [[Windows XP]] and later [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating systems]] that supports advanced text input and text processing. The Text Services Framework is designed to offer advanced language and [[word processing]] features to applications. It supports features such as multilingual support, keyboard drivers, [[handwriting recognition]], [[speech recognition]], as well as [[Spell checker|spell checking]] and other text and [[natural language processing]] functions. It is also downloadable for older Windows operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com:80/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11759|title=Download: Platform SDK Redistributable: Microsoft Windows Text Services Framework Redist files|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713081945/http://www.microsoft.com:80/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11759|archive-date=June 13, 2012|dead-url=|access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Language Bar''' is the core [[user interface]] for Text Services Framework. The language bar enables text services to add UI elements to the toolbar and enables these elements when an application has focus. From the Language Bar, users can select the input language, and control keyboard input, handwriting recognition and speech recognition.

The language bar also provides a direct means to switch between installed languages, even when a non-TSF-enabled application has focus.

Starting with [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] 2005 and [[Windows Vista]], the [[RichEdit]] control  supports the Text Services Framework. [[Windows Speech Recognition]] in Windows Vista is also implemented using the Text Services Framework.

== Features of TSF ==

*TSF is extensible. [[Independent Software Vendor|ISVs]] can write their own text processing feature for TSF.
*TSF-enabled applications can receive text input from any text service that supports TSF without having to be aware of any details of the text source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/TSF/what-is-text-services-framework|title=What is Text Services Framework?|last=|first=|date=May 31, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services built using TSF are globally available to any application.
*TSF enables a text service to store [[metadata]] with a document, a piece of text, or an object within the document. For example, a speech input text service can store sound information associated with a block of text.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/TSF/why-use-text-services-framework|title=Why Use Text Services Framework?|last=|first=|date=May 31, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*TSF enables text services to provide accurate and complete text conversion, with continuous access to the document buffer. Text services using TSF can avoid separating their functionality into modes for input and modes for editing. This input architecture enables the buffered and accumulating text stream to change dynamically, thereby enabling more efficient keyboard input and text editing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*TSF is [[Device Independence|device-independent]] and enables text services for multiple input devices including [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], [[electronic pen]] or stylus, and [[microphone]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Textual criticism''' is a branch of [[textual scholarship]], [[philology]], and [[literary criticism]] that is concerned with the identification  of textual variants in either [[manuscripts]] or printed books. [[Scribes]] can make alterations when copying manuscripts by hand.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman 2005, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic might seek to reconstruct the original text ([[Urtext (Biblical studies)|urtext]], [[archetype]] or autograph) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate versions, or [[recension]]s, of a document's transcription history.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent. ''A History of the Textual Criticism of the New Testament'' &lt;br /&gt;"... that process which it sought to determine the original text of a document or a collection of documents, and to exhibit, freed from all the errors, corruptions, and variations which may have been accumulated in the course of its transcription by successive copying."&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the textual critic's work is a better understanding of the creation and historical transmission of texts. This understanding may lead to the production of a "critical edition" containing a scholarly curated text.

There are many approaches to textual criticism, notably  [[#Eclecticism|eclecticism]], [[#Stemmatics|stemmatics]], and [[#Copy-text editing|copy-text editing]]. Quantitative techniques are also used to determine the relationships between witnesses to a text, with methods from evolutionary biology ([[phylogenetics]]) appearing effective on a range of traditions.

In some domains (religious and classical text editing) the phrase "lower criticism" is used to describe the contrast between textual criticism and "[[higher criticism]]", which is the endeavor to establish the authorship, date, and place of composition of the original text.

== History ==
Textual criticism has been practiced for over two thousand years.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Early textual critics, especially the librarians of Hellenistic Alexandria in the last two centuries BC,  were concerned with preserving the works of [[ancient history|antiquity]], and this continued through the [[medieval]] period into [[early modern]] times and the invention of the [[printing press]]. Textual criticism was an important aspect of the work of many Renaissance Humanists, such as [[Desiderius Erasmus]], who edited the Greek New Testament, creating the ''[[Textus Receptus]]''. In Italy, scholars such as [[Petrarch]] and [[Poggio Bracciolini]] collected and edited many Latin manuscripts, while a new spirit of critical enquiry was boosted by the attention to textual states, for example in the work of [[Lorenzo Valla]] on the purported [[Donation of Constantine]].

Many ancient works, such as the [[Bible]] and the [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]], survive in hundreds of copies, and the relationship of each copy to the original may be unclear. Textual scholars have debated for centuries which sources are most closely derived from the original, hence which readings in those sources are correct.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Although biblical books that are letters, like Greek plays, presumably had one original, the question of whether some biblical books, like the [[Gospel]]s, ever had just one original has been discussed.&lt;ref name=tanselle&gt;Tanselle, (1989) ''A Rationale of Textual Criticism''&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in applying textual criticism to the [[Quran]] has also developed after the discovery of the [[Sana'a manuscripts]] in 1972, which possibly date back to the 7–8th centuries.

In the English language, the works of [[Shakespeare]] have been a particularly fertile ground for textual criticism—both because the texts, as transmitted, contain a considerable amount of variation, and because the effort and expense of producing superior editions of his works have always been widely viewed as worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis 1995, pp. 1–17&lt;/ref&gt;
The principles of textual criticism, although originally developed and refined for works of antiquity and the [[Bible]], and, for Anglo-American Copy-Text editing, Shakespeare,&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
have been applied to many works, from (near-)contemporary texts to the earliest known written documents. Ranging from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to the twentieth century, textual criticism covers a period of about five millennia.

== Basic notions and objectives ==
The basic problem, as described by [[Paul Maas (classical scholar)|Paul Maas]], is as follows:
{{quote|We have no [[autograph]] [handwritten by the original author] manuscripts of the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] classical writers and no copies which have been [[collated]] with the originals; the manuscripts we possess derive from the originals through an unknown number of intermediate copies, and are consequently of questionable trustworthiness. The business of textual criticism is to produce a text as close as possible to the original (''constitutio textus'').&lt;ref&gt;Maas P. 1958. ''Textual criticism''. Oxford. p1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Maas comments further that "A dictation revised by the author must be regarded as equivalent to an autograph manuscript". The lack of autograph manuscripts applies to many cultures other than Greek and Roman. In such a situation, a key objective becomes the identification of the first ''exemplar'' before any split in the tradition. That exemplar is known as the ''[[archetype]]''. "If we succeed in establishing the text of [the archetype], the ''constitutio'' (reconstruction of the original) is considerably advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Maas 1958, p2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The textual critic's ultimate objective is the production of a "critical edition".{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This contains the text that the author has determined most closely approximates the original, and is accompanied by an ''apparatus criticus'' or [[critical apparatus]].  The critical apparatus presents the author's work in three parts: first, a list or description of the evidence that the editor used (names of manuscripts, or abbreviations called [[sigla]]); second, the editor's analysis of that evidence (sometimes a simple likelihood rating),{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}; and third, a record of rejected variants of the text (often in order of preference).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;"The ''apparatus criticus'' is placed underneath the text simply on account of bookprinting conditions and in particular of the format of modern books. The practice in ancient and medieval manuscripts of using the outer margin for this purpose makes for far greater clarity." Maas 1958, pp. 22–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[Image:P46.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio from [[Papyrus 46]], containing [[2 Corinthians]] 11:33–12:9]]
Before mechanical printing, literature was copied by hand, and many variations were introduced by copyists. The age of printing made the scribal profession effectively redundant. Printed editions, while less susceptible to the proliferation of variations likely to arise during manual transmission, are nonetheless not immune to introducing variations from an author's autograph. Instead of a scribe miscopying his source, a compositor or a printing shop may read or typeset a work in a way that differs from the autograph.&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Since each scribe or printer commits different errors, reconstruction of the lost original is often aided by a selection of readings taken from many sources. An edited text that draws from multiple sources is said to be ''eclectic''. In contrast to this approach, some textual critics prefer to identify the single best surviving text, and not to combine readings from multiple sources.&lt;ref&gt;Greetham 1999, p. 40.&lt;br&gt;"Tanselle thus combines an Aristotelian ''praktike'', a rigorous account of the phenomenology of text, with a deep Platonic suspicion of this phenomenology, and of the concrete world of experience (see my ' Materiality' for further discussion). For him—and, I would contend, for the idealist, or 'eclectic' editing with which he and Greg-Bowers are often identified, whereby an idealist 'text that never was' is constructed out of the corrupt states of extant documents—ontology is only immanent, never assuredly present in historical, particularized text, for it can be achieved only at the unattainable level of nous rather than phenomenon. Thus, even the high aims of eclectic (or, as it is sometimes known, 'critical') editing can be called into question, because of the unsure phenomenological status of the documentary and historical."&lt;/ref&gt;

When comparing different documents, or "witnesses", of a single, original text, the observed differences are called ''variant readings'', or simply ''variants'' or ''readings''. It is not always apparent which single variant represents the author's original work. The process of textual criticism seeks to explain how each variant may have entered the text, either by accident (duplication or omission) or intention (harmonization or censorship), as scribes or supervisors transmitted the original author's text by copying it. The textual critic's task, therefore, is to sort through the variants, eliminating those most likely to be ''un''-original, hence establishing a "critical text", or critical edition, that is intended to best approximate the original. At the same time, the critical text should document variant readings, so the relation of extant witnesses to the reconstructed original is apparent to a reader of the critical edition. In establishing the critical text, the textual critic considers both "external" evidence (the age, provenance, and affiliation of each witness) and "internal" or "physical" considerations (what the author and scribes, or printers, were likely to have done).&lt;ref name=tanselle /&gt;

The collation of all known variants of a text is referred to as a [[variorum]], namely a work of textual criticism whereby all variations and emendations are set side by side so that a reader can track how textual decisions have been made in the preparation of a text for publication.&lt;ref&gt;McGann 1992, p. xviiii&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bible]] and the works of [[William Shakespeare]] have often been the subjects of variorum editions, although the same techniques have been applied with less frequency to many other works, such as [[Walt Whitman]]'s [[Leaves of Grass]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradley 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
and the prose writings of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentham, Gosse 1902&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eclecticism ==
[[Eclecticism]] refers to the practice of consulting a wide diversity of witnesses to a particular original. The practice is based on the principle that the more independent transmission histories there are, the less likely they will be to reproduce the same errors. What one omits, the others may retain; what one adds, the others are unlikely to add. Eclecticism allows inferences to be drawn regarding the original text, based on the evidence of contrasts between witnesses.

Eclectic readings also normally give an impression of the number of witnesses to each available reading. Although a reading supported by the majority of witnesses is frequently preferred, this does not follow automatically. For example, a second edition of a Shakespeare play may include an addition alluding to an event known to have happened between the two editions. Although nearly all subsequent manuscripts may have included the addition, textual critics may reconstruct the original without the addition.

The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. It is not a copy of any particular manuscript, and may deviate from the majority of existing manuscripts. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Comfort, Comfort 2005, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no ''a priori'' bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament (currently, the United Bible Society, 5th ed. and Nestle-Aland, 28th ed.). Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.&lt;ref name=ISBN9039001057&gt;Aland, B. 1994, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

=== External evidence ===
External evidence is evidence of each physical witness, its date, source, and relationship to other known witnesses. Critics will often prefer the readings supported by the oldest witnesses. Since errors tend to accumulate, older manuscripts should have fewer errors. Readings supported by a majority of witnesses are also usually preferred, since these are less likely to reflect accidents or individual biases. For the same reasons, the most geographically diverse witnesses are preferred. Some manuscripts show evidence that particular care was taken in their composition, for example, by including alternative readings in their margins, demonstrating that more than one prior copy (exemplar) was consulted in producing the current one. Other factors being equal, these are the ''best'' witnesses. The role of the textual critic is necessary when these basic criteria are in conflict.  For instance, there will typically be fewer early copies, and a larger number of later copies.  The textual critic will attempt to balance these criteria, to determine the original text.

There are many other more sophisticated considerations. For example, readings that depart from the known practice of a scribe or a given period may be deemed more reliable, since a scribe is unlikely on his own initiative to have departed from the usual practice.&lt;ref name=textandinterpretation&gt;Hartin, Petzer, Mannig 2001, pp. 47–53&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal evidence ===
Internal evidence is evidence that comes from the text itself, independent of the physical characteristics of the document. Various considerations can be used to decide which reading is the most likely to be original. Sometimes these considerations can be in conflict.&lt;ref name=textandinterpretation /&gt;

Two common considerations have the Latin names ''[[lectio brevior]]'' (shorter reading) and ''lectio difficilior'' (more difficult reading). The first is the general observation that scribes tended to add words, for clarification or out of habit, more often than they removed them. The second, ''[[lectio difficilior potior]]'' (the harder reading is stronger), recognizes the tendency for harmonization—resolving apparent inconsistencies in the text. Applying this principle leads to taking the more difficult (unharmonized) reading as being more likely to be the original. Such cases also include scribes simplifying and smoothing texts they did not fully understand.&lt;ref&gt;Aland K., Aland, B. 1987, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scribal tendency is called [[homoioteleuton]], meaning "same endings". Homoioteleuton occurs when two words/phrases/lines end with the same sequence of letters. The scribe, having finished copying the first, skips to the second, omitting all intervening words. ''Homeoarchy'' refers to eye-skip when the ''beginnings'' of two lines are similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~sreimer/ms-course/course/scbl-err.htm|title=Manuscript Studies: Textual analysis (Scribal error)|author=|date=|website=www.ualberta.ca|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404214516/http://www.ualberta.ca/~sreimer/ms-course/course/scbl-err.htm|archivedate=4 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic may also examine the other writings of the author to decide what words and grammatical constructions match his style. The evaluation of internal evidence also provides the critic with information that helps him evaluate the reliability of individual manuscripts. Thus, the consideration of internal and external evidence is related.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

After considering all relevant factors, the textual critic seeks the reading that best explains how the other readings would arise. That reading is then the most likely candidate to have been original.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

=== Canons of textual criticism ===
[[Image:Codex Sinaiticus-small.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 11:2 in [[Codex Sinaiticus]]]]
Various scholars have developed guidelines, or ''canons'' of textual criticism, to guide the exercise of the critic's judgment in determining the best readings of a text. One of the earliest was [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]] (1687–1752), who in 1734 produced an edition of the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]. In his commentary, he established the rule ''Proclivi scriptioni praestat ardua'', ("the harder reading is to be preferred").&lt;ref name=bengelrules&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Bengel|title=Critical Rules of Johann Albrecht Bengel|publisher=Bible-researcher.com|accessdate=2008-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213010108/http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Bengel|archivedate=2010-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Jakob Griesbach]] (1745–1812) published several editions of the New Testament. In his 1796 edition,&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Griesbach, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=BLk9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=novum+testamentum+graece&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=r8sem3b7JS&amp;sig=1unsVXlqNzwWrCXEi1oQW-s3m0I ''Novum Testamentum Graece'']&lt;/ref&gt; he established fifteen critical rules. Among them was a variant of Bengel's rule, ''Lectio difficilior potior'', "the harder reading is better." Another was ''Lectio brevior praeferenda'', "the shorter reading is better", based on the idea that scribes were more likely to add than to delete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Griesbach|title=Critical Rules of Johann Albrecht Bengel|publisher=Bible-researcher.com|accessdate=2008-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213010108/http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Griesbach|archivedate=2010-02-13|df=}}&lt;br /&gt; "Brevior lectio, nisi testium vetustorum et gravium auctoritate penitus destituatur, praeferenda est verbosiori. Librarii enim multo proniores ad addendum fuerunt, quam ad omittendum."&lt;/ref&gt; This rule cannot be applied uncritically, as scribes may omit material inadvertently.

[[Brooke Foss Westcott]] (1825–1901) and [[Fenton Hort]] (1828–1892) published an edition of the [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|New Testament in Greek in 1881]]. They proposed nine critical rules, including a version of Bengel's rule, "The reading is less likely to be original that shows a disposition to smooth away difficulties." They also argued that "Readings are approved or rejected by reason of the quality, and not the number, of their supporting witnesses", and that "The reading is to be preferred that most fitly explains the existence of the others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Hort|title=Theories of Westcott and Hort|publisher=Bible-researcher.com|accessdate=2008-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213010108/http://www.bible-researcher.com/rules.html#Hort|archivedate=2010-02-13|df=}}&lt;br /&gt;"The reading is to be preferred that makes the best sense, that is, that best conforms to the grammar and is most congruous with the purport of the rest of the sentence and of the larger context." (2.20)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these rules, although originally developed for biblical textual criticism, have wide applicability to any text susceptible to errors of transmission.

=== Limitations of eclecticism ===

Since the canons of criticism are highly susceptible to interpretation, and at times even contradict each other, they may be employed to justify a result that fits the textual critic's aesthetic or theological agenda. Starting in the 19th century, scholars sought more rigorous methods to guide editorial judgment. Stemmatics and copy-text editing&amp;nbsp;– while both eclectic, in that they permit the editor to select readings from multiple sources&amp;nbsp;– sought to reduce subjectivity by establishing one or a few witnesses presumably as being favored by "objective" criteria.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  The citing of sources used, and alternate readings, and the use of original text and images helps readers and other critics determine to an extent the depth of research of the critic, and to independently verify their work.

== Stemmatics ==

=== Overview ===
[[File:Howald-sigerist.png|thumb|right|250px|Scheme of descent of the manuscripts of [[Pseudo-Apuleius Herbarius]] by [[Henry E. Sigerist]] (1927)]]
'''Stemmatics''' or '''stemmatology''' is a rigorous approach to textual criticism. [[Karl Lachmann]] (1793–1851) greatly contributed to making this method famous, even though he did not invent it.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Timpanaro, ''The Genesis of Lachmann's Method'', ed. and trans. by Glenn W. Most (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005) [trans. from ''Genesi del metodo del Lachmann'' (Liviana Editrice, 1981)].&lt;/ref&gt; The method takes its name from the word ''stemma''. The [[Ancient Greek]] word στέμματα&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"&gt;Liddell, H.G. &amp; Scott, R. (1940). ''A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[loanword]] in [[classical Latin]] ''stemmata''&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis &amp; Short"&gt;Lewis, C.T. &amp; Short, C. (1879). ''A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saalfeld1884"&gt;Saalfeld, G.A.E.A. (1884). ''Tensaurus Italograecus. Ausführliches historisch-kritisches Wörterbuch der Griechischen Lehn- und Fremdwörter im Lateinischen.'' Wien: Druck und Verlag von Carl Gerold's Sohn, Buchhändler der Kaiserl. Akademie der Wissenschaften.&lt;/ref&gt; may refer to "[[family tree]]s". This specific meaning shows the relationships of the surviving witnesses (the first known example of such a stemma, albeit with the name, dates from 1827).&lt;ref&gt;Collín, H. S. and C. J. Schlyter (eds), ''Corpus iuris Sueo-Gotorum antiqui: Samling af Sweriges gamla lagar, på Kongl. Maj:ts. nådigste befallning'', 13 vols (Stockholm: Haeggström, 1827–77), vol. 1, table 3; the volume is available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=aZgyAAAAIAAJ&amp;] but the scan unfortunately omits the stemma. William Robins, `Editing and Evolution', ''Literature Compass'' 4 (2007): 89–120, at pp. 93–94, {{doi|10.1111/j.1741-4113.2006.00391.x.&lt;/ref&gt; The family tree is also referred to as a ''[[cladogram]]''.&lt;ref name="isbn90-272-2153-7"&gt;Mulken &amp; van Pieter 1996, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The method works from the principle that "community of error implies community of origin." That is, if two witnesses have a number of errors in common, it may be presumed that they were derived from a common intermediate source, called a ''hyparchetype''. Relations between the lost intermediates are determined by the same process, placing all extant manuscripts in a family tree or ''[[stemma codicum]]'' descended from a single ''archetype''. The process of constructing the stemma is called ''recension'', or the Latin ''recensio''.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-814371-0"&gt;Wilson and Reynolds 1974, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Having completed the stemma, the critic proceeds to the next step, called ''selection'' or ''selectio'', where the text of the archetype is determined by examining variants from the closest hyparchetypes to the archetype and selecting the best ones. If one reading occurs more often than another at the same level of the tree, then the dominant reading is selected. If two competing readings occur equally often, then the editor uses judgment to select the correct reading.&lt;ref name="isbn0-312-21713-7"&gt;Roseman 1999, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''selectio'', the text may still contain errors, since there may be passages where no source preserves the correct reading. The step of ''examination'', or ''examinatio'' is applied to find corruptions. Where the editor concludes that the text is corrupt, it is corrected by a process called "emendation", or ''emendatio'' (also sometimes called ''divinatio''). Emendations not supported by any known source are sometimes called [[conjecture (textual criticism)|''conjectural'' emendations]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8006-0471-7"&gt;McCarter 1986, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of ''selectio'' resembles eclectic textual criticism, but applied to a restricted set of hypothetical hyparchetypes. The steps of ''examinatio'' and ''emendatio'' resemble copy-text editing. In fact, the other techniques can be seen as special cases of stemmatics in which a rigorous family history of the text cannot be determined but only approximated. If it seems that one manuscript is by far the best text, then copy text editing is appropriate, and if it seems that a group of manuscripts are good, then eclecticism on that group would be proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/vol07/SWH2002/|title=The Greek Vorlage of the Syra Harclensis|author=|date=|website=rosetta.reltech.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205218/http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/vol07/SWH2002/|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hodges–Farstad edition of the Greek New Testament attempts to use stemmatics for some portions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/CriticalEds.html Critical Editions of the New Testament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414211207/http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/CriticalEds.html |date=2009-04-14 }} at the ''Encyclopaedia of Textual Criticism''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phylogenetics ===
[[Image:Canterbury Tales.png|thumb|200px|''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', Woodcut 1484]]
[[Phylogenetics]] is a technique borrowed from [[biology]], where it was originally named ''phylogenetic systematics'' by [[Willi Hennig]]. In biology, the technique is used to determine the [[evolution]]ary relationships between different [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuh 2000, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In its application in textual criticism, the text of a number of different witnesses may be entered into a computer, which records all the differences between them, or derived from an existing apparatus. The manuscripts are then grouped according to their shared characteristics. The difference between phylogenetics and more traditional forms of statistical analysis is that, rather than simply arranging the manuscripts into rough groupings according to their overall similarity, phylogenetics assumes that they are part of a branching family tree and uses that assumption to derive relationships between them. This makes it more like an automated approach to stemmatics. However, where there is a difference, the computer does not attempt to decide which reading is closer to the original text, and so does not indicate which branch of the tree is the "root"—which manuscript tradition is closest to the original. Other types of evidence must be used for that purpose.

Phylogenetics faces the same difficulty as textual criticism: the appearance of characteristics in descendants of an ancestor other than by direct copying (or miscopying) of the ancestor, for example where a scribe combines readings from two or more different manuscripts ("contamination"). The same phenomenon is widely present among living organisms, as instances of [[horizontal gene transfer]] (or lateral gene transfer) and [[genetic recombination]], particularly among bacteria. Further exploration of the applicability of the different methods for coping with these problems across both living organisms and textual traditions is a promising area of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221145935_Chi-Squares_and_the_Phenomenon_of_Change_of_Exemplar_in_the_Dyutaparvan |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816060750/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221145935_Chi-Squares_and_the_Phenomenon_of_Change_of_Exemplar_in_the_Dyutaparvan |archivedate=2017-08-16 |df= }} Wendy J.

Software developed for use in biology has been applied successfully to textual criticism; for example, it is being used by the Canterbury Tales Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textualcommunities.usask.ca/web/canterbury-tales/wiki/ Canterbury Tales Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030165945/http://www.textualcommunities.usask.ca/web/canterbury-tales/wiki |date=2016-10-30 }}, Official Website&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the relationship between the 84 surviving manuscripts and four early printed editions of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.

=== Limitations and criticism ===

The stemmatic method assumes that each witness is derived from one, and only one, predecessor. If a scribe refers to more than one source when creating his copy, then the new copy will not clearly fall into a single branch of the family tree. In the stemmatic method, a manuscript that is derived from more than one source is said to be ''contaminated''.

The method also assumes that scribes only make new errors—they do not attempt to correct the errors of their predecessors. When a text has been improved by the scribe, it is said to be ''sophisticated'', but "sophistication" impairs the method by obscuring a document's relationship to other witnesses, and making it more difficult to place the manuscript correctly in the stemma.

The stemmatic method requires the textual critic to group manuscripts by commonality of error. It is required, therefore, that the critic can distinguish erroneous readings from correct ones. This assumption has often come under attack. [[W. W. Greg]] noted, "That if a scribe makes a mistake he will inevitably produce nonsense is the tacit and wholly unwarranted assumption."&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franz Anton Knittel]] defended the traditional point of view in theology and was against the modern textual criticism. He defended an authenticity of the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|Pericopa Adulterae]] (John 7:53–8:11), [[Comma Johanneum]] (1 John 5:7), and [[Testimonium Flavianum]]. According to him [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] in his [[Novum Instrumentum omne]] did not incorporate the ''Comma'' from [[Codex Montfortianus]], because of grammar differences, but used [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglotta]]. According to him the ''Comma'' was known for [[Tertullian]].&lt;ref&gt;Knittel, ''Neue Kritiken über den berühmten Sprych: Drey sind, die da zeugen im Himmel, der Vater, das Wort, und der heilige Geist, und diese drei sind eins'' Braunschweig 1785&lt;/ref&gt;

The stemmatic method's final step is ''emendatio'', also sometimes referred to as "conjectural emendation". But in fact, the critic employs conjecture at every step of the process. Some of the method's rules that are designed to reduce the exercise of editorial judgment do not necessarily produce the correct result. For example, where there are more than two witnesses at the same level of the tree, normally the critic will select the dominant reading. However, it may be no more than fortuitous that more witnesses have survived that present a particular reading. A plausible reading that occurs less often may, nevertheless, be the correct one.&lt;ref&gt;Tov 2001, pp. 351–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the stemmatic method assumes that every extant witness is derived, however remotely, from a single source. It does not account for the possibility that the original author may have revised his work, and that the text could have existed at different times in more than one authoritative version.

==Best-text editing==

The critic [[Joseph Bédier]] (1864–1938), who had worked with stemmatics, launched an attack on that method in 1928. He surveyed editions of medieval French texts that were produced with the stemmatic method, and found that textual critics tended overwhelmingly to produce bifid trees, divided into just two branches. He concluded that this outcome was unlikely to have occurred by chance, and that therefore, the method was tending to produce bipartite stemmas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses. He suspected that editors tended to favor trees with two branches, as this would maximize the opportunities for editorial judgment (as there would be no third branch to "break the tie" whenever the witnesses disagreed). He also noted that, for many works, more than one reasonable stemma could be postulated, suggesting that the method was not as rigorous or as scientific as its proponents had claimed.

Bédier's doubts about the stemmatic method led him to consider whether it could be dropped altogether. As an alternative to stemmatics, Bédier proposed a Best-text editing method, in which a single textual witness, judged to be of a 'good' textual state by the editor, is emended as lightly as possible for manifest transmission mistakes, but left otherwise unchanged. This makes a Best-text edition essentially a documentary edition. For an example one may refer to Eugene Vinaver's edition of the Winchester Manuscript of Malory's [[Le Morte D'Arthur]]

== Copy-text editing ==

When copy-text editing, the scholar fixes errors in a base text, often with the help of other witnesses. Often, the base text is selected from the oldest manuscript of the text, but in the early days of printing, the copy text was often a manuscript that was at hand.

Using the copy-text method, the critic examines the base text and makes corrections (called emendations) in places where the base text appears wrong to the critic. This can be done by looking for places in the base text that do not make sense or by looking at the text of other witnesses for a superior reading. Close-call decisions are usually resolved in favor of the copy-text.

The first published, printed edition of the Greek [[New Testament]] was produced by this method. [[Erasmus]], the editor, selected a manuscript from the local Dominican monastery in Basle and corrected its obvious errors by consulting other local manuscripts. The [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]] text, which was the basis for the [[Revised Version]] of the English bible, also used the copy-text method, using the [[Codex Vaticanus]] as the base manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== McKerrow's concept of copy-text ===

The bibliographer [[Ronald B. McKerrow]] introduced the term ''copy-text'' in his 1904 edition of the works of [[Thomas Nashe]], defining it as "the text used in each particular case as the basis of mine." McKerrow was aware of the limitations of the stemmatic method, and believed it was more prudent to choose one particular text that was thought to be particularly reliable, and then to emend it only where the text was obviously corrupt. The French critic [[Joseph Bédier]] likewise became disenchanted with the stemmatic method, and concluded that the editor should choose the best available text, and emend it as little as possible.

In McKerrow's method as originally introduced, the copy-text was not necessarily the earliest text. In some cases, McKerrow would choose a later witness, noting that "if an editor has reason to suppose that a certain text embodies later corrections than any other, and at the same time has no ground for disbelieving that these corrections, or some of them at least, are the work of the author, he has no choice but to make that text the basis of his reprint."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Greg 1950, pp.  23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1939, in his ''Prolegomena for the Oxford Shakespeare'', McKerrow had changed his mind about this approach, as he feared that a later edition—even if it contained authorial corrections—would "deviate more widely than the earliest print from the author's original manuscript." He therefore concluded that the correct procedure would be "produced by using the earliest "good" print as copy-text and inserting into it, from the first edition which contains them, such corrections as appear to us to be derived from the author." But, fearing the arbitrary exercise of editorial judgment, McKerrow stated that, having concluded that a later edition had substantive revisions attributable to the author, "we must accept all the alterations of that edition, saving any which seem obvious blunders or misprints."&lt;ref&gt;McKerrow 1939. pp. 17–18, quoted in Greg 1950, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

=== W. W. Greg's rationale of copy-text ===

Anglo-American textual criticism in the last half of the 20th century came to be dominated by a landmark 1950 essay by [[Walter Wilson Greg|Sir Walter W. Greg]], "The Rationale of Copy-Text". Greg proposed:

{{quotation|[A] distinction between the significant, or as I shall call them 'substantive', readings of the text, those namely that affect the author's meaning or the essence of his expression, and others, such in general as spelling, punctuation, word-division, and the like, affecting mainly its formal presentation, which may be regarded as the accidents, or as I shall call them 'accidentals', of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Greg observed that compositors at printing shops tended to follow the "substantive" readings of their copy faithfully, except when they deviated unintentionally; but that "as regards accidentals they will normally follow their own habits or inclination, though they may, for various reasons and to varying degrees, be influenced by their copy."&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

He concluded:

{{quotation|The true theory is, I contend, that the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of accidentals, but that the choice between substantive readings belongs to the general theory of textual criticism and lies altogether beyond the narrow principle of the copy-text. Thus it may happen that in a critical edition the text rightly chosen as copy may not by any means be the one that supplies most substantive readings in cases of variation. The failure to make this distinction and to apply this principle has naturally led to too close and too general a reliance upon the text chosen as basis for an edition, and there has arisen what may be called the tyranny of the copy-text, a tyranny that has, in my opinion, vitiated much of the best editorial work of the past generation.&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Greg's view, in short, was that the "copy-text can be allowed no over-riding or even preponderant [[Authority (textual criticism)|authority]] so far as substantive readings are concerned." The choice between reasonable competing readings, he said:

{{quotation|[W]ill be determined partly by the opinion the editor may form respecting the nature of the copy from which each substantive edition was printed, which is a matter of external authority; partly by the intrinsic authority of the several texts as judged by the relative frequency of manifest errors therein; and partly by the editor's judgment of the intrinsic claims of individual readings to originality—in other words their intrinsic merit, so long as by 'merit' we mean the likelihood of their being what the author wrote rather than their appeal to the individual taste of the editor.&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Greg argued that an editor should be free to use his judgment to choose between competing substantive readings, he suggested that an editor should defer to the copy-text when "the claims of two readings&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;appear to be exactly balanced.&amp;nbsp;... In such a case, while there can be no logical reason for giving preference to the copy-text, in practice, if there is no reason for altering its reading, the obvious thing seems to be to let it stand."&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The "exactly balanced" variants are said to be ''indifferent''.

Editors who follow Greg's rationale produce ''eclectic'' editions, in that the authority for the "accidentals" is derived from one particular source (usually the earliest one) that the editor considers to be authoritative, but the authority for the "substantives" is determined in each individual case according to the editor's judgment. The resulting text, except for the accidentals, is constructed without relying predominantly on any one witness.

=== Greg–Bowers–Tanselle ===

W. W. Greg did not live long enough to apply his rationale of copy-text to any actual editions of works. His rationale was adopted and significantly expanded by [[Fredson Bowers]] (1905–1991). Starting in the 1970s, [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] vigorously took up the method's defense and added significant contributions of his own. Greg's rationale as practiced by Bowers and Tanselle has come to be known as the "Greg–Bowers" or the "Greg–Bowers–Tanselle" method.

==== Application to works of all periods ====
[[Image:A Midsummer Night's Dream.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' ([[First Folio]])]]
In his 1964 essay, "Some Principles for Scholarly Editions of Nineteenth-Century American Authors", Bowers said that "the theory of copy-text proposed by Sir Walter Greg rules supreme".&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1964, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Bowers's assertion of "supremacy" was in contrast to Greg's more modest claim that "My desire is rather to provoke discussion than to lay down the law".&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Greg had limited his illustrative examples to English Renaissance drama, where his expertise lay, Bowers argued that the rationale was "the most workable editorial principle yet contrived to produce a critical text that is authoritative in the maximum of its details whether the author be [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[John Dryden|Dryden]], [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], or [[Stephen Crane]]. The principle is sound without regard for the literary period."&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1973, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; For works where an author's manuscript survived—a case Greg had not considered—Bowers concluded that the manuscript should generally serve as copy-text. Citing the example of Nathaniel Hawthorne, he noted:

{{quotation|When an author's manuscript is preserved, this has paramount authority, of course. Yet the fallacy is still maintained that since the first edition was proofread by the author, it must represent his final intentions and hence should be chosen as copy-text. Practical experience shows the contrary. When one collates the manuscript of ''[[The House of the Seven Gables]]'' against the first printed edition, one finds an average of ten to fifteen differences per page between the manuscript and the print, many of them consistent alterations from the manuscript system of punctuation, capitalization, spelling, and word-division. It would be ridiculous to argue that Hawthorne made approximately three to four thousand small changes in proof, and then wrote the manuscript of ''[[The Blithedale Romance]]'' according to the same system as the manuscript of the ''Seven Gables'', a system that he had rejected in proof.&lt;ref name="Bowers 1964, p. 226"&gt;Bowers 1964, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following Greg, the editor would then replace any of the manuscript readings with substantives from printed editions that could be reliably attributed to the author: "Obviously, an editor cannot simply reprint the manuscript, and he must substitute for its readings any words that he believes Hawthorne changed in proof."&lt;ref name="Bowers 1964, p. 226"/&gt;

==== Uninfluenced final authorial intention ====

McKerrow had articulated textual criticism's goal in terms of "our ideal of an author's fair copy of his work in its final state".&lt;ref&gt;McKerrow 1939, pp. 17–8, quoted in Bowers 1974, p. 82, n. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Bowers asserted that editions founded on Greg's method would "represent the nearest approximation in every respect of the author's final intentions."&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1964, p.  227&lt;/ref&gt; Bowers stated similarly that the editor's task is to "approximate as nearly as possible an inferential authorial fair copy."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Tanselle 1976, p.  168&lt;/ref&gt; Tanselle notes that, "Textual criticism&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;has generally been undertaken with a view to reconstructing, as accurately as possible, the text finally intended by the author".&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1995, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowers and Tanselle argue for rejecting textual variants that an author inserted at the suggestion of others. Bowers said that his edition of [[Stephen Crane]]'s first novel, ''Maggie'', presented "the author's final and uninfluenced artistic intentions."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Zeller 1975, p.  247&lt;/ref&gt; In his writings, Tanselle refers to "unconstrained authorial intention" or "an author's uninfluenced intentions."&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1986, p.  19&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a departure from Greg, who had merely suggested that the editor inquire whether a later reading "is one that the author can reasonably be supposed to have substituted for the former",&lt;ref&gt;Greg 1950, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; not implying any further inquiry as to ''why'' the author had made the change.

Tanselle discusses the example of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Typee]]''. After the novel's initial publication, Melville's publisher asked him to soften the novel's criticisms of missionaries in the South Seas. Although Melville pronounced the changes an improvement, Tanselle rejected them in his edition, concluding that "there is no evidence, internal or external, to suggest that they are the kinds of changes Melville would have made without pressure from someone else."&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1976, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowers confronted a similar problem in his edition of ''Maggie''. Crane originally printed the novel privately in 1893. To secure commercial publication in 1896, Crane agreed to remove profanity, but he also made stylistic revisions. Bowers's approach was to preserve the stylistic and literary changes of 1896, but to revert to the 1893 readings where he believed that Crane was fulfilling the publisher's intention rather than his own. There were, however, intermediate cases that could reasonably have been attributed to either intention, and some of Bowers's choices came under fire—both as to his judgment, and as to the wisdom of conflating readings from the two different versions of ''Maggie''.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1977, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Zeller argued that it is impossible to tease apart the changes Crane made for literary reasons and those made at the publisher's insistence:

{{quotation|Firstly, in anticipation of the character of the expected censorship, Crane could be led to undertake alterations which also had literary value in the context of the new version. Secondly, because of the systematic character of the work, purely censorial alterations sparked off further alterations, determined at this stage by literary considerations. Again in consequence of the systemic character of the work, the contamination of the two historical versions in the edited text gives rise to a third version. Though the editor may indeed give a rational account of his decision at each point on the basis of the documents, nevertheless to aim to produce the ideal text which Crane would have produced in 1896 if the publisher had left him complete freedom is to my mind just as unhistorical as the question of how the first World War or the history of the United States would have developed if Germany had not caused the USA to enter the war in 1917 by unlimited submarine combat. The nonspecific form of censorship described above is one of the historical conditions under which Crane wrote the second version of ''Maggie'' and made it function. From the text which arose in this way it is not possible to subtract these forces and influences, in order to obtain a text of the author's own. Indeed I regard the "uninfluenced artistic intentions" of the author as something which exists only in terms of aesthetic abstraction. Between influences on the author and influences on the text are all manner of transitions.&lt;ref&gt;Zeller 1975, pp.  247–248&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

Bowers and Tanselle recognize that texts often exist in more than one authoritative version. Tanselle argues that:

{{quotation|[T]wo types of revision must be distinguished: that which aims at altering the purpose, direction, or character of a work, thus attempting to make a different sort of work out of it; and that which aims at intensifying, refining, or improving the work as then conceived (whether or not it succeeds in doing so), thus altering the work in degree but not in kind. If one may think of a work in terms of a spatial metaphor, the first might be labeled "vertical revision," because it moves the work to a different plane, and the second "horizontal revision," because it involves alterations within the same plane. Both produce local changes in active intention; but revisions of the first type appear to be in fulfillment of an altered programmatic intention or to reflect an altered active intention in the work as a whole, whereas those of the second do not.&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1976, p.  193&lt;/ref&gt; }}

He suggests that where a revision is "horizontal" (''i.e.'', aimed at improving the work as originally conceived), then the editor should adopt the author's later version. But where a revision is "vertical" (''i.e.'', fundamentally altering the work's intention as a whole), then the revision should be treated as a new work, and edited separately on its own terms.

==== Format for apparatus ====

Bowers was also influential in defining the form of [[critical apparatus]] that should accompany a scholarly edition. In addition to the ''content'' of the apparatus, Bowers led a movement to relegate editorial matter to appendices, leaving the critically established text "in the clear", that is, free of any signs of editorial intervention. Tanselle explained the rationale for this approach:

{{quotation|In the first place, an editor's primary responsibility is to establish a text; whether his goal is to reconstruct that form of the text which represents the author's final intention or some other form of the text, his essential task is to produce a reliable text according to some set of principles. Relegating all editorial matter to an appendix and allowing the text to stand by itself serves to emphasize the primacy of the text and permits the reader to confront the literary work without the distraction of editorial comment and to read the work with ease. A second advantage of a clear text is that it is easier to quote from or to reprint. Although no device can insure accuracy of quotation, the insertion of symbols (or even footnote numbers) into a text places additional difficulties in the way of the quoter. Furthermore, most quotations appear in contexts where symbols are inappropriate; thus when it is necessary to quote from a text which has not been kept clear of apparatus, the burden of producing a clear text of the passage is placed on the quoter. Even footnotes at the bottom of the text pages are open to the same objection, when the question of a photographic reprint arises.&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1972, pp. 45–6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some critics believe that a clear-text edition gives the edited text too great a prominence, relegating textual variants to appendices that are difficult to use, and suggesting a greater sense of certainty about the established text than it deserves. As Shillingsburg notes, "English scholarly editions have tended to use notes at the foot of the text page, indicating, tacitly, a greater modesty about the "established" text and drawing attention more forcibly to at least some of the alternative forms of the text".&lt;ref&gt;Shillingsburg 1989, p. 56, n. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The MLA's CEAA and CSE ====

In 1963, the [[Modern Language Association|Modern Language Association of America]] (MLA) established the Center for Editions of American Authors (CEAA). The CEAA's ''Statement of Editorial Principles and Procedures'', first published in 1967, adopted the Greg–Bowers rationale in full. A CEAA examiner would inspect each edition, and only those meeting the requirements would receive a seal denoting "An Approved Text."

Between 1966 and 1975, the Center allocated more than $1.5&amp;nbsp;million in funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities to various scholarly editing projects, which were required to follow the guidelines (including the structure of editorial apparatus) as Bowers had defined them.&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle 1975, pp. 167–8&lt;/ref&gt; According to Davis, the funds coordinated by the CEAA over the same period were more than $6&amp;nbsp;million, counting funding from universities, university presses, and other bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1977, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Scholarly Editions (CSE) replaced the CEAA in 1976. The change of name indicated the shift to a broader agenda than just American authors. The Center also ceased its role in the allocation of funds. The Center's latest guidelines (2003) no longer prescribe a particular editorial procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/cse.htm|title=Aims and Services of the Committee on Scholarly Editions|publisher=The Committee on Scholarly Editions, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis|accessdate=2008-05-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523101341/http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/cse.htm|archivedate=2008-05-23|df=}} &lt;br /&gt;"The editorial standards that form the criteria for the award of the CSE "Approved Edition" emblem can be stated here in only the most general terms, since the range of editorial work that comes within the committee's purview makes it impossible to set forth a detailed, step-by-step editorial procedure."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application to religious documents ==
All texts are subject to investigation and systematic criticism where the original verified first document is not available.  Believers in [[sacred text]]s and scriptures sometimes are reluctant to accept any form of challenge to what they believe to be divine [[revelation]].  Some opponents and [[polemicist]]s may look for any way to find fault with a particular religious text.  Legitimate textual criticism may be resisted by both believers and skeptics.

=== Book of Mormon ===
{{See also|Historicity of the Book of Mormon}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[LDS Church]]) includes the [[Book of Mormon]] as a foundational reference.  LDS members typically believe the book to be a literal historical record.

Although some earlier unpublished studies had been prepared, not until the early 1970s was true textual criticism applied to the Book of Mormon.  At that time BYU Professor Ellis Rasmussen and his associates were asked by the LDS Church to begin preparation for a new edition of the Holy Scriptures.  One aspect of that effort entailed digitizing the text and preparing appropriate footnotes, another aspect required establishing the most dependable text.  To that latter end, [[Stanley R. Larson]] (a Rasmussen graduate student) set about applying modern text critical standards to the manuscripts and early editions of the Book of Mormon as his thesis project—which he completed in 1974.  To that end, Larson carefully examined the Original Manuscript (the one dictated by [[Joseph Smith]] to his scribes) and the Printer's Manuscript (the copy [[Oliver Cowdery]] prepared for the Printer in 1829–1830), and compared them with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions of the Book of Mormon to determine what sort of changes had occurred over time and to make judgments as to which readings were the most original.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley R. Larson, “A Study of Some Textual Variations in the Book of Mormon, Comparing the Original and Printer's MSS., and Comparing the 1830, 1837, and 1840 Editions,” unpublished master's thesis (Provo: BYU, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  Larson proceeded to publish a useful set of well-argued articles on the phenomena which he had discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Larson, “Early Book of Mormon Texts: Textual Changes to the Book of Mormon in 1837 and 1840,” ''Sunstone'', 1/4 (Fall 1976), 44–55; Larson, “Textual Variants in the Book of Mormon Manuscripts,” ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', 10/4 (Autumn 1977), 8–30 [FARMS Reprint LAR-77]; Larson,  “Conjectural Emendation and the Text of the Book of Mormon,” ''BYU Studies'', 18 (Summer 1978), 563–569 [FARMS Reprint LAR-78].&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of his observations were included as improvements in the 1981 LDS edition of the Book of Mormon.

By 1979, with the establishment of the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] ([[FARMS]]) as a California non-profit research institution, an effort led by [[Robert F. Smith (historian)|Robert F. Smith]] began to take full account of Larson's work and to publish a Critical Text of the Book of Mormon.  Thus was born the FARMS Critical Text Project which published the first volume of the 3-volume Book of Mormon Critical Text in 1984.  The third volume of that first edition was published in 1987, but was already being superseded by a second, revised edition of the entire work,&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Smith, ed., ''Book of Mormon Critical Text'', 2nd ed., 3 vols. (Provo: FARMS, 1986–1987).&lt;/ref&gt; greatly aided through the advice and assistance of then Yale doctoral candidate [[Grant Hardy]], Dr. [[Gordon C. Thomasson]], Professor [[John W. Welch]] (the head of FARMS), Professor [[Royal Skousen]], and others too numerous to mention here.  However, these were merely preliminary steps to a far more exacting and all-encompassing project.

In 1988, with that preliminary phase of the project completed, Professor Skousen took over as editor and head of the FARMS Critical Text of the Book of Mormon Project and proceeded to gather still scattered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and to have advanced photographic techniques applied to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments.  He also closely examined the Printer's Manuscript (owned by the [[Community of Christ]]—RLDS Church in Independence, Missouri) for differences in types of ink or pencil, in order to determine when and by whom they were made.  He also collated the various editions of the Book of Mormon down to the present to see what sorts of changes have been made through time.

Thus far, Professor Skousen has published complete transcripts of the Original and Printer's Manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;''The Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon'' (Provo: FARMS, 2001); ''The Printer's Manuscript of the Book of Mormon'', 2 vols. (FARMS, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a six-volume analysis of textual variants.&lt;ref&gt;''Analysis of Textual Variants of the Book of Mormon'', 6 vols. (Provo: FARMS, 2004–2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Still in preparation are a history of the text, and a complete electronic collation of editions and manuscripts (volumes 3 and 5 of the Project, respectively).  Yale University has in the meantime published an edition of the Book of Mormon which incorporates all aspects of Skousen's research.&lt;ref&gt;Skousen, ed., ''The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text'' (Yale Univ. Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the New Testament, changes, corruptions, and erasures have been found, particularly in the Masoretic texts. This is ascribed to the fact that early ''soferim'' (scribes) did not treat copy errors in the same manner later on.&lt;ref&gt;Tov 2001, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three separate new editions of the Hebrew Bible currently in development: ''[[Biblia Hebraica Quinta]]'', the ''[[Hebrew University Bible Project|Hebrew University Bible]]'', and the ''[[Oxford Hebrew Bible]]''.  ''Biblia Hebraica Quinta'' is a [[diplomatics|diplomatic]] edition based on the [[Leningrad Codex]].  The ''Hebrew University Bible'' is also diplomatic, but based on the [[Aleppo Codex]].  The ''Oxford Hebrew Bible'' is an eclectic edition.&lt;ref&gt;Hendel, R., "The Oxford Hebrew Bible: Prologue to a New Critical Edition", ''Vetus Testamentum, vol. 58'', no. 3 (2008). pp.&amp;nbsp;325–326&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Testament ===
{{main|Textual criticism of the New Testament}}
Early [[New Testament]] texts include more than 5,800 [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages (including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Ethiopic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]).  The manuscripts contain approximately 300,000 textual variants, most of them involving changes of word order and other comparative trivialities.&lt;ref name=wallace_on_majority&gt;{{cite web|last= Wallace|first= Daniel|title= The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical?|url= https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical|accessdate= 23 November 2013|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000201/https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical|archivedate= 3 December 2013|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Westcott and Hort|title= The New Testament in The Original Greek: Introduction Appendix|url= https://books.google.com/?id=7ZxUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=The+New+Testament+in+the+Original+Greek#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate= 23 November 2013|year= 1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2017}}  Thus, for over 250 years, New Testament scholars have argued that no textual variant affects any doctrine.  Professor [[D. A. Carson]] states: "nothing we believe to be doctrinally true, and nothing we are commanded to do, is in any way jeopardized by the variants. This is true for any textual tradition. The interpretation of individual passages may well be called in question; but never is a doctrine affected."&lt;ref name=wallace_on_majority/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, chiefly in that it makes stemmatics in many cases impossible, because many writers used two or more different manuscripts as sources. Consequently, New Testament textual critics have adopted [[eclecticism]] after sorting the witnesses into three major groups, called text-types. {{As of | 2017}} the most common division distinguishes:

{| border="1"  style="margin:auto; width:100%;"
|- style="background:#cef2e0; text-align:center;"
! width="20%"|Text type !! width=" 10%" |Date!!Characteristics!! Bible version
|-
| The [[Alexandrian text-type]]&lt;br /&gt;(also called the "Neutral Text" tradition; less frequently, the "Minority Text")||2nd–4th centuries CE|| This family constitutes a group of early and well-regarded texts, including [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Most representatives of this tradition appear to come from around [[Alexandria, Egypt]] and from [[Coptic Church|the Alexandrian Church]]. It contains readings that are often terse, shorter, somewhat rough, less harmonised, and generally more difficult. The family was once{{when|date=August 2017}} thought{{by whom|date=August 2017}} to result from a very carefully edited 3rd-century [[recension]], but now is believed to be merely the result of a carefully controlled and supervised process of copying and transmission.

|-
|The [[Western text-type]]||3rd–9th centuries CE ||Also a very early tradition, which comes from a wide geographical area stretching from North Africa to Italy and from [[Gaul]] to Syria. It occurs in Greek manuscripts and in the Latin translations used by the [[Western church]]. It is much less controlled than the Alexandrian family and its witnesses are seen to be more prone to [[paraphrase]] and other corruptions.  It is sometimes called the [[Caesarean text-type]].  Some [[New Testament]] scholars would argue that the Caesarean constitutes a distinct text-type of its own.||[[Vetus Latina]]
|-
| The [[Byzantine text-type]]; also, [[Koine Greek|Koinē]] text-type &lt;br /&gt;(also called "Majority Text")||5th–16th centuries CE||This group comprises around 95% of all the manuscripts, the majority of which are comparatively very late in the tradition. It had become dominant at [[Constantinople]] from the 5th century on and was used throughout the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the Byzantine Empire. It contains the most harmonistic readings, paraphrasing and significant additions, most of which are believed{{by whom|date=August 2017}} to be secondary readings. It underlies the [[Textus Receptus]] used for most [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]-era translations of the New Testament.|| [[King James Version|KJV]], [[New King James Version|NKJV]], [[Tyndale Bible|Tyndale]], [[Coverdale Bible|Coverdale]], [[Geneva Bible|Geneva]], [[Bishops' Bible]], [[Orthodox Study Bible|OSB]]

=== Quran ===

Textual criticism of the Quran is a beginning area of study,&lt;ref&gt;Christian-Muslim relations: yesterday, today, tomorrow Munawar Ahmad Anees, Ziauddin Sardar, Syed Z. Abedin&amp;nbsp;– 1991 For instance, a Christian critic engaging in textual criticism of the Quran from a biblical perspective will surely miss the essence of the quranic message. Just one example would clarify this point.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Studies on Islam Merlin L. Swartz&amp;nbsp;– 1981 One will find a more complete bibliographical review of the recent studies of the textual criticism of the Quran in the valuable article by Jeffery, "The Present Status of Qur'anic Studies," Report on Current Research on the Middle East&lt;/ref&gt; as Muslims have historically disapproved of [[higher criticism]] being applied to the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Religions of the world Lewis M. Hopfe&amp;nbsp;– 1979 "Some Muslims have suggested and practiced textual criticism of the Quran in a manner similar to that practiced by Christians and Jews on their bibles. No one has yet suggested the [[higher criticism]] of the Quran."&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries textual criticism can be seen as apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;Egypt's culture wars: politics and practice&amp;nbsp;– Page 278 Samia Mehrez&amp;nbsp;– 2008 Middle East report: Issues 218–222; Issues 224–225 Middle East Research &amp; Information Project, JSTOR (Organization)&amp;nbsp;– 2001 Shahine filed to divorce Abu Zayd from his wife, on the grounds that Abu Zayd's textual criticism of the Quran made him an apostate, and hence unfit to marry a Muslim. Abu Zayd and his wife eventually relocated to the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims consider the original Arabic text to be the final revelation, revealed to Muhammad from AD 610 to his death in 632. In Islamic tradition, the Quran was memorised and written down by Muhammad's companions and copied as needed.

Recently, the oldest known Quranic fragments were found at the University of Birmingham. As quoted by the lead researcher Prof. Thomas:
"These portions must have been in a form that is very close to the form of the Koran read today, supporting the view that the text has undergone little or no alteration and that it can be dated to a point very close to the time it was believed to be revealed.".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-33436021&lt;/ref&gt; This academically supports the viewpoint that the Quran today has not been altered from the original revelation.

In the 1970s, 14,000 fragments of Quran were discovered in the [[Great Mosque of Sana'a|Great Mosque]] of [[Sana'a]], the Sana'a manuscripts. About 12,000 fragments belonged to 926 copies of the Quran, the other 2,000 were loose fragments. The oldest known copy of the Quran so far belongs to this collection: it dates to the end of the 7th–8th centuries.

The examination by Gerd R. Puin, who led the restoration project, revealed no textual change, but only minor variants in word spelling. To be precise and quoting from a text he wrote:
"...These Yemeni Qur'anic fragments do not differ from those found in museums and libraries elsewhere, with the exception of details that do not touch the Qur'an itself, but are rather differences in the way words are spelled. This phenomenon is well-known, even in the Qur'an published in Cairo in which is written:

Ibrhim next to Ibrhm
Quran next to Qrn
Simahum next to Simhum
In the oldest Yemeni Qur'anic fragments, for example, the phenomenon of not writing the vowel alif is rather common." &lt;ref name="individual.utoronto.ca"&gt;http://individual.utoronto.ca/fantastic/The_History_of_the_Quranic_Text_from_Revelation_to_Compilation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;His full letter appeared in the newspaper: Ath-Thawra issue 11.3.1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The other finding was that the ordering of the Surahs were different in one fragment. However, this is also a normative occurrence as the ordering of the Surah's can be changed without controversy. In fact, the original ordering was roughly based on Surah length. As well, it should be mentioned here that the oldest Quran copies discovered in this collection had no variations with present versions. Only fragments of parallel versions to these in time (i.e., both the Quran copies/fragments were dated to the same time or the deviant fragment copy was dated to a later time) had the above-mentioned variations-thus, this may be attributed to mistakes of Quranic students (something that is exemplified by the fact that some of these Quran copies were written on erased parchment layers containing older writing-as if a student was continuously erasing and rewriting the text). And so, there is no chronological dependence to these deviant fragment copies. Also, it is of scholarly consensus that&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto.ca"/&gt; particularly, in the fragment of reference, the ordering of the Surahs was different due it being a collection of some Surahs and not a complete Quran. This was wide spread practice as one complete Quranic Mushaf could be quite substantial in weight and volume and thus unpractical to carry on a person.&lt;ref name="individual.utoronto.ca"/&gt;

=== Talmud ===
Textual criticism of the Talmud has a long pre-history but has become a separate discipline from Talmudic study only recently.&lt;ref&gt;Economic analysis in Talmudic literature: rabbinic thought in the .Roman A. Ohrenstein, Barry Gordon.. Page 9 2009 "In fact, textual criticism of the Talmud is as old as the Talmud itself. In modern times, however, it became a separate scholarly concern, where scientific method is applied to correct corrupt and incomprehensible passages.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the research is in Hebrew and German language periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;The treatise Ta'anit of the Babylonian Talmud: [[Henry Malter]]&amp;nbsp;– 1978 It goes without saying that the writings of modern authors dealing with textual criticism of the Talmud, many of which are scattered in Hebrew and German periodicals, are likewise to be utilized for the purpose.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical texts ==
Textual criticism originated in the classical era and its development in modern times began with classics scholars, in an effort to determine the original content of texts like [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-23200-1"&gt;Habib 2005, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; There are far fewer witnesses to classical texts than to the Bible, so scholars can use stemmatics and, in some cases, copy text editing.  However, unlike the New Testament where the earliest witnesses are within 200&amp;nbsp;years of the original, the earliest existing manuscripts of most classical texts were written about a millennium after their composition.  All things being equal, textual scholars expect that a larger time gap between an original and a manuscript means more changes in the text.

== Legal protection ==
Scientific and critical editions can be protected by copyright as works of authorship if enough creativity/originality is provided. The mere addition of a word, or substitution of a term with another one believed to be more correct, usually does not achieve such level of originality/creativity. All the notes accounting for the analysis and why and how such changes have been made represent a different work autonomously copyrightable if the other requirements are satisfied. In the European Union critical and scientific editions may be protected also by the relevant neighboring right that protects critical and scientific publications of public domain works as made possible by art. 5 of the [[Copyright Term Directive]]. Not all EU member States have transposed art. 5 into national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Digital textual scholarship==
Digital textual criticism is a relatively new branch of textual criticism working with digital tools to establish a critical edition. The development of digital editing tools has allowed editors to transcribe, archive and process documents much faster than before. Some scholars claim digital editing has radically changed the nature of textual criticism; but others believe the editing process has remained fundamentally the same, and digital tools have simply made aspects of it more efficient.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== History ===
From its beginnings, digital scholarly editing involved developing a system for displaying both a newly "typeset" text and a history of variations in the text under review. Until about halfway through the first decade of the twenty-first century, digital archives relied almost entirely on manual transcriptions of texts. However, over the course of this decade, image files became much faster and cheaper, and storage space and upload times ceased to be significant issues. The next step in digital scholarly editing was the wholesale introduction of images of historical texts, particularly high-definition images of manuscripts, formally offered only in samples.&lt;ref name="ecommons.luc.edu"&gt;Shillingsburg, Peter, "Literary Documents, Texts, and Works Represented Digitally" (2013). Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities Publications. 3. {{cite web |url=http://ecommons.luc.edu/ctsdh_pubs/3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816064103/http://ecommons.luc.edu/ctsdh_pubs/3/ |archivedate=2017-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods ===
In view of the need to represent historical texts primarily through transcription, and because transcriptions required encoding for every aspect of text that could not be recorded by a single keystroke on the [[QWERTY]] keyboard, encoding was invented. [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) uses encoding for the same purpose, although its particulars were designed for scholarly uses in order to offer some hope that scholarly work on digital texts had a good chance of migrating from aging operating systems and/or digital platforms to new ones, and the hope that standardization would lead to easy interchange of data among different projects.&lt;ref name="ecommons.luc.edu"/&gt;

=== Software ===
Several computer programs and standards exist to support the work of the editors of critical editions.  These include
* The [[Text Encoding Initiative]]. The Guidelines of the TEI provide much detailed analysis of the procedures of critical editing, including recommendations about how to mark up a computer file containing a text with critical apparatus.  See especially the following chapters of the Guidelines: [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html 10. Manuscript Description], [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html 11. Representation of Primary Sources], and [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html 12. Critical Apparatus].
* [http://www.juxtasoftware.org/about/ Juxta] is an open-source tool for comparing and collating multiple witnesses to a single textual work. It was designed to aid scholars and editors examine the history of a text from manuscript to print versions.  Juxta provides collation for multiple versions of texts that are marked up in plain text or TEI/XML format.
* The [http://tug.org/edmac EDMAC] macro package for Plain [[TeX]] is a set of macros originally developed by John Lavagnino and Dominik Wujastyk for typesetting critical editions. "EDMAC" stands for "EDition" "MACros." EDMAC is in [[maintenance mode]].
* The [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ledmac ledmac] package is a development of EDMAC by Peter R. Wilson for typesetting critical editions with [[LaTeX]]. [[ledmac]] is in [[maintenance mode]].&lt;ref&gt;See further the useful guidelines offered by {{cite web|last=Dekker|first=D-J.|title=Typesetting Critical Editions with LaTeX: ledmac, ledpar and ledarab|url=http://www.djdekker.net/ledmac/|accessdate=14 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905044748/http://www.djdekker.net/ledmac/|archivedate=5 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eledmac eledmac] package is a further development of ledmac by Maïeul Rouquette that adds more sophisticated features and solves more advanced problems. [[eledmac]] was forked from ledmac when it became clear that it needed to develop in ways that would compromise [[backward-compatibility]]. [[eledmac]] is [[maintenance mode]].
* The [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/reledmac reledmac] package is a further development of eledmac by Maïeul Rouquette that rewrittes many part of the code in order to allow more robust developments in the future. In 2015, it is in active development.
* [http://www.webdesign-bu.de/uwe_lueck/critedltx.html ednotes], written by Christian Tapp and Uwe Lück is another package for typesetting critical editions using [[LaTeX]].
* [http://cte.oeaw.ac.at// Classical Text Editor] is a word-processor for critical editions, commentaries and parallel texts written by Stefan Hagel.  CTE is designed for use on the Windows operating system, but has been successfully run on Linux and OS/X using [[Wine (software)|Wine]].  CTE can export files in [[Text Encoding Initiative|TEI]] format.  CTE is currently (2014) in active development.
* [http://karas.ch/cet/cetinfo.htm Critical Edition Typesetter] by Bernt Karasch is a system for typesetting critical editions starting from input into a word-processor, and ending up with typesetting with [[TeX]] and [[EDMAC]].  Development opf CET seems to have stopped in 2004.

'''Transcription''' in the [[linguistics|linguistic]] sense is the systematic representation of [[language]] in written form. The source can either be [[utterance]]s (''speech'' or ''[[sign language]]'') or preexisting [[written language|text]] in another [[writing system]].

Transcription should not be confused with [[translation]], which means representing the meaning of a source language text in a target language (e.g. ''[[Los Angeles]]'' into ''City of Angels'') or with [[transliteration]] which means representing the spelling of a text from one script to another (e.g. ''Jalapeño'', which preserves the Ñ from Spanish despite the [[diacritic]] having no use in English).

In the academic discipline of [[linguistics]], transcription is an essential part of the methodologies of (among others) [[phonetics]], [[conversation analysis]], [[dialectology]] and [[sociolinguistics]]. It also plays an important role for several subfields of [[speech technology]]. Common examples for transcriptions outside academia are the proceedings of a [[court hearing]] such as a [[criminal trial]] (by a [[court reporter]]) or a [[physician]]'s recorded voice notes ([[medical transcription]]). This article focuses on transcription in linguistics.

==Phonetic vs. orthographic transcription==
Broadly speaking, there are two possible approaches to linguistic transcription. [[Phonetic transcription]] focuses on phonetic and phonological properties of spoken language. Systems for phonetic transcription thus furnish rules for mapping individual sounds or [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] to written symbols. Systems for [[orthographic transcription]], by contrast, consist of rules for mapping spoken words onto written forms as prescribed by the [[orthography]] of a given language. Phonetic transcription operates with specially defined character sets, usually the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].

Which type of transcription is chosen depends mostly on the research interests pursued. Since phonetic transcription strictly foregrounds the phonetic nature of language, it is most useful for phonetic or phonological analyses. Orthographic transcription, on the other hand, has a morphological and a lexical component alongside the phonetic component (which aspect is represented to which degree depends on the language and orthography in question). It is thus more convenient wherever meaning-related aspects of spoken language are investigated. Phonetic transcription is doubtlessly more systematic in a scientific sense, but it is also harder to learn, more time-consuming to carry out and less widely applicable than orthographic transcription.

==As theory==
Mapping spoken language onto written symbols is not as straightforward a process as may seem at first glance. Written language is an idealisation, made up of a limited set of clearly distinct and discrete symbols. Spoken language, on the other hand, is a continuous (as opposed to discrete) phenomenon, made up of a potentially unlimited number of components. There is no predetermined system for distinguishing and classifying these components and, consequently, no preset way of mapping these components onto written symbols.

Literature is relatively consistent in pointing out the nonneutrality of transcription practices. There is not and cannot be a neutral transcription system. Knowledge of social culture enters directly into the making of a transcript. They are captured in the texture of the transcript (Baker, 2005).

==Transcription systems==
Transcription systems are sets of rules which define how spoken language is to be represented in written symbols. Most phonetic transcription systems are based on the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] or, especially in speech technology, on its derivative [[SAMPA]].
Examples for orthographic transcription systems (all from the field of conversation analysis or related fields) are:

===CA (conversation analysis)===
Arguably the first system of its kind, originally sketched in (Sacks et al. 1978), later adapted for the use in computer readable corpora as ''CA-CHAT'' by (MacWhinney 2000). The field of Conversation Analysis itself includes a number of distinct approaches to transcription and sets of transcription conventions. These include, among others, Jefferson Notation. To analyze conversation, recorded data is typically transcribed into a written form that is agreeable to analysts. There are two common approaches. The first, called narrow transcription, captures the details of conversational interaction such as which particular words are stressed, which words are spoken with increased loudness, points at which the turns-at-talk overlap, how particular words are articulated, and so on. If such detail is less important, perhaps because the analyst is more concerned with the overall gross structure of the conversation or the relative distribution of turns-at-talk amongst the participants, then a second type of transcription known as broad transcription may be sufficient (Williamson, 2009).

====Jefferson Notation====
The Jefferson Notation System is a set of symbols, developed by [[Gail Jefferson]], which is used for transcribing talk. Having had some previous experience in transcribing when she was hired in 1963 as a clerk typist at the UCLA Department of Public Health to transcribe sensitivity-training sessions for prison guards, Jefferson began transcribing some of the recordings that served as the materials out of which Harvey Sacks’ earliest lectures were developed. Over four decades, for the majority of which she held no university position and was unsalaried, Jefferson's research into talk-in-interaction has set the standard for what became known as [[Conversation Analysis]] (CA). Her work has greatly influenced the sociological study of interaction, but also disciplines beyond, especially linguistics, communication, and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gail-jefferson.com/obituary.html Obituary – gail-jefferson.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This system is employed universally by those working from the CA perspective and is regarded as having become a near-globalized set of instructions for transcription.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, C. (2007). Independent writing in current approaches to writing instruction: What have we overlooked? English Teaching: Practice and Critique. Volume 6, Number 1.http://edlinked.soe.waikato.ac.nz/research/files/etpc/files/2007v6n1art1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===DT (discourse transcription)===
A system described in (DuBois et al. 1992), used for transcription of the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English (SBCSAE), later developed further into ''DT2''.

===GAT (Gesprächsanalytisches Transkriptionssystem – Conversation Analytic transcription system)===
: A system described in (Selting et al. 1998), later developed further into GAT2 (Selting et al. 2009), widely used in German speaking countries for [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodically]] oriented conversation analysis and interactional linguistics

===HIAT (Halbinterpretative Arbeitstranskriptionen – Semiinterpretative Working Transcriptions)===
: Arguably the first system of its kind, originally described in (Ehlich and Rehbein 1976) – see (Ehlich 1992) for an English reference - adapted for the use in computer readable corpora as (Rehbein et al. 2004), and widely used in functional [[pragmatics]].

==Software==
Transcription was originally a process carried out manually, i.e. with pencil and paper, using an analogue sound recording stored on, e.g., a Compact Cassette. Nowadays, most transcription is done on computers. Recordings are usually digital [[Audio file format|audio]] or [[Container format (digital)|video]] files, and transcriptions are [[electronic document]]s. Specialized computer software exists to assist the transcriber in efficiently creating a digital transcription from a digital recording. Among the most widely used transcription tools in linguistic research are:
; ANVIL (Annotation of Video and Language Data): A tool specialising in transcription of [[multimodal interaction]], see [http://www.anvil-software.de/ ANVIL-Website]
; Cielo24: A  tool to create captions, indexes and transcripts for searchable metadata, see [https://cielo24.com/solutions/].
; [[CLAN program|CLAN]] (Computerized Language Analysis): A tool mainly used for the transcription of child language acquisition data as in the [[CHILDES]] database, see [http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/ CLAN page of the CHILDES website].
; [[ELAN software|ELAN]] (EUDICO Linguistic Annotator): A tool widely used for the transcription of signed and spoken language data and the documentation of [[endangered language]]s, see [https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/ ELAN page on the Language Archiving Technology portal]
; [[EXMARaLDA]] (Extensible Markup Language for Discourse Annotation): A tool widely used in discourse analysis, dialectology and sociolinguistics, see [http://www.exmaralda.org/en_index.html EXMARaLDA website]
; f4transkript: A tool used in social science which includes a free guide on transcription methodology on its site, see [https://www.audiotranskription.de/english/f4.htm f4transkript website]

==Examples of usage==
  
The [[marketer]] Matt Bailey described it as "a desire to see something done, but not enough desire to make it happen".&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Matt Bailey, "Viral marketing", excerpt "Analytics 1.0 - A Case of Velleity," found at [http://www.sitelogicmarketing.com/blog/07-analytics-velleity Site Logic marketing website].  Accessed April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern writing===

Matt Bailey expressed an attempt "to bring it back, as it has more relevance now than ever."&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;  He writes that:
{{quote|Velleity is what keeps companies locked in this mindset of reporting useless numbers. Desiring, even expecting to someday have an epiphany of change, but not willing to change the mindset or the culture of locked-in reporting to achieve it. Nor are they willing to ask the hard questions in order to uncover what must be done.|Matt Bailey, marketing writer&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;}}

===In philosophy===

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] describes the velleity of an [[artist]] as a "desire to ''be'' 'what he is able to represent, conceive, and express'...."&lt;ref&gt;
Aaron Ridley, in "Nietzsche, philosophy and the arts," ed. by Salim Kemal, Ivan Gaskell, Daniel W. Conway, at pp. 128-131 (Cambridge University Press, 2002) {{ISBN|0-521-52272-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-52272-4}} (emphasis provided), found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=8GzFg3pH4SIC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Velleity+%2B+philosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MljPsygceA&amp;sig=SWt2zXpiLVhU9oBymK3jfNIAKQs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TrH4SfCODNOGmQeOj-GYDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA134,M1 Google Book search]. Accessed April 29, 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Nietzsche championed the [[will to power]], which can be encapsulated{{by whom?|date=November 2012}} as starting with velleity, in his [[free-will theorem]].

Keith David Wyma refers frequently to the "concept of velleity", citing [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a pioneer of introducing the idea into philosophy.&lt;ref name=Wyma&gt;

He distinguishes between the two types of velleity - "''to do'' something and one ''not to do'' something...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  Furthermore, he asserts, "The concept of velleity is also important because it enables us to understand the co-existence of conflicting values."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  A person could thus have "double velleity" or "a mix of velleity for something and a volition for its opposite: the latter dominates, of course, but that does not erase the fact of velleity."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;

Kathy Kolbe also lists velleity as a "key concept of [[conation]]."&lt;ref name=Kolbe&gt;See [http://www.kolbe.com/knol/keyConceptsOfConation.htm Kathy Kolbe's website page on Conation].  Accessed June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{InfoMaps}}
The '''visual language''' is a system of communication using visual elements. Speech as a means of communication cannot strictly be separated from the whole of human communicative activity which includes the visual&lt;ref&gt;Colin Cherry, On Human Communication, MIT, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and the term 'language' in relation to vision is an extension of its use to describe the perception, comprehension and production of visible signs.

== Overview ==
An image which dramatizes and communicates an idea presupposes the use of a visual [[language]]. Just as people can 'verbalize' their thinking, they can 'visualize' it. A [[diagram]], a [[map]], and a [[painting]] are all examples of uses of visual language. Its structural units include line, shape, colour, form, motion, texture, pattern, direction, orientation, scale, angle, space and proportion.

The elements in an image represent concepts in a spatial context, rather than the linear form used for words. Speech and visual communication are parallel and often interdependent means by which humans exchange information.

== Visual language ==
Visual units in the form of lines and marks are constructed into meaningful shapes and structures or signs. Different areas of the cortex respond to different elements such as colour and form. [[Semir Zeki]]&lt;ref&gt;Semir Zeki, Inner Vision: an Exploration of Art and the Brain, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; has shown the responses in the brain to the paintings of [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].

=== Imaging in the mind ===
What we have in our minds in a waking state and what we imagine in dreams is very much of the same nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hiller|first=Susan (ed.)|title=Dream Machines|year=2000|publisher=Hayward Gallery|location=London|isbn=1-85332-202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream images might be with or without spoken words, other sounds or colours. In the waking state there is usually, in the foreground, the buzz of immediate perception, feeling, mood and as well as fleeting memory images.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Gerald and Giulio Tononi, Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination, 2000,Allen Lane,London {{ISBN|0-14-028147-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a mental state between dreaming and being fully awake is a state known as 'day dreaming' or a meditative state, during which "the things we see in the sky when the clouds are drifting, the centaurs and stags, antelopes and wolves" are projected from the imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Ernst, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation, 1960, Phaidon Press, London&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf Arnheim]]&lt;ref&gt;in Kepes, Gyorgy,ed., Sign, Image and Symbol,1966, Studio Vista, London&lt;/ref&gt; has attempted to answer the question: what does a mental image look like? In Greek philosophy, the School of Leucippus and Democritus believed that a replica of an object enters the eye and remains in the soul as a memory as a complete image. Berkeley explained that parts, for example, a leg rather than the complete body, can be brought visually to the mind. Arnheim considers the psychologist, [[Edward B. Titchener]]'s account to be the breakthrough in understanding something of how the vague incomplete quality of the image is 'impressionistic' and carries meaning as well as form.

=== Meaning and expression ===
[[Abstract art]] has shown that the qualities of line and shape, proportion and colour convey meaning directly without the use of words or pictorial representation. [[Wassily Kandinsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Wassily Kandinsky, Point and Line to Plane : Contribution to the Analysis of the Pictorial Elements, 1947, trans, Howard Deastyne and Hilla Rebay, Solomon Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; showed how drawn lines and marks can be expressive without any association with a representational image. From the most ancient cultures and throughout history visual language has been used to encode meaning: "The Bronze Age Badger Stone on Ilkly Moor is covered in circles, lines, hollow cups,winged figures, a spread hand, an ancient swastika, an embryo, a shooting star? … It's a story-telling rock, a message from a world before (written) words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyatt|first=Derek|date=Autumn 1995|title=To Strengthen the Tribe|journal=Modern Painters|volume=8|issue=3|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Gregory]] suggests that, "Perhaps the ability to respond to absent imaginary situations," as our early ancestors did with paintings on rock, "represents an essential step towards the development of abstract thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=R. L.|authorlink=Richard Gregory|title=The Intelligent Eye|year=1970|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=0-297-00021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perception ===
The sense of sight operates selectively. [[Perception]] is not a passive recording of all that is in front of the eyes, but is a continuous judgement of scale and colour relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Itten|first=Johannes|authorlink=Johannes Itten|title=The Elements of Color: A Treatise on the '''Colour System''' of Johannes Itten Based on his Book "The Art of Colour"|year=1983|origyear=1970|others=trans. Ernst van Hagen|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|location=Wokingham|isbn=0-442-30581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes making categories of forms to classify images and shapes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnheim|first=Rudolf|authorlink=Rudolf Arnheim|title=Visual Thinking|year=1970|publisher=Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-09365-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children of six to twelve months are to be able through experience and learning to discriminate between circles, squares and triangles.The child from this age onwards learns to classify objects, abstracting essential qualities and comparing them to other similar objects. Before objects can be perceived and identified the child must be able to classify the different shapes and sizes that a single object may appear to have when it is seen in varying surroundings and from different aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, M D, The Psychology of Perception, Penguin, London, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innate structures in the brain===
The perception of a shape requires the grasping of the essential structural features, to produce a "whole" or ''[[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]]''. The theory of the ''gestalt'' was proposed by [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] in 1890. He pointed out that a melody is still recognisable when played in different keys and argued that the whole is not simply the sum of its parts but a total structure. [[Max Wertheimer]] researched von Ehrenfels' idea, and in his "Theory of Form" (1923) – nicknamed "the dot essay" because it was illustrated with abstract patterns of dots and lines – he concluded that the perceiving eye tends to bring together elements that look alike (similarity groupings) and will complete an incomplete form (object hypothesis). An array of random dots tends to form configurations (constellations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Roy R.|year=1998|title=Art, Design and Gestalt Theory|journal=Leonardo|volume=31|issue=4|pages=299–303|doi=10.2307/1576669|jstor=1576669|publisher=Leonardo, Vol. 31, No. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these innate abilities demonstrate how the eye and the mind are seeking pattern and simple whole shapes. When we look at more complex visual images such as paintings we can see that art has been a continuous attempt to "notate" visual information.

=== Visual thinking ===
{{main article|Visual thinking}}
Thought processes are diffused and interconnected and are cognitive at a sensory level. The mind thinks at its deepest level in sense material, and the two hemispheres of the brain deal with different kinds of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R Blakeslee, ''The right brain: a new understanding of the unconscious mind and its creative power'', Macmillan, London, 1980. {{ISBN|0-333-29090-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain is divided into two hemispheres and a [[Corpus callosum|thick bundle of nerve fibres]] enable these two halves to communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Roger W Sperry, Some effects of disconnecting the cerebral hemispheres, Nobel Lecture, Science 217, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gazzaniga, Tales from Both Sides of the Brain, Hopewell, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In most people the ability to organize and produce speech is predominantly located in the left side. Appreciating spatial perceptions depends more on the right hemisphere, although there is a left hemisphere contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solbaram.org/articles/humind.html|title=How the Human Brain Developed and How the Human Mind Works|last=Davidmann|first=Manfred|date=1998-04-20|work=Towards a Better Future: The Works of Manfred Davidmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to understand how designers solve problems, [[L. Bruce Archer]] proposed "that the way designers (and everybody else, for that matter) form images in their [[mind's eye]], manipulating and evaluating ideas before, during and after externalising them, constitutes a cognitive system comparable with but different from, the verbal language system. Indeed we believe that human beings have an innate capacity for cognitive modelling, and its expression through sketching, drawing, construction, acting out and so on, that is fundamental to human thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Archer|first=L. Bruce|authorlink=L. Bruce Archer|year=1979|title=Whatever Became of Design Methodology?|journal=Design Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–18|doi=10.1016/0142-694X(79)90023-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art in education===
The visual language begins to develop in babies as the eye and brain become able to focus, and be able to recognize patterns. Children's drawings show a process of increasing perceptual awareness and range of elements to express personal experience and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Edwards, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, Tarcher, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the visual aspect of language communication in education has been referred to as [[graphicacy]],&lt;ref&gt;Visual Education, Schools Council, York, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; as a parallel discipline to literacy and numeracy. The ability to think and communicate in visual terms is part of, and of equal importance in the learning process, with that of literacy and numeracy. The visual artist, as [[Michael Twyman]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Twyman, Graphic Images in Relation to Learning, Typography Unit, Reading University, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out, has developed the ability to handle the visual language to communicate ideas. This includes both the understanding and conception and the production of concepts in a visual form.

[[File:International Association for World Englishes.jpg|thumb|380px|alt=International Association for World Englishes|International Association for World Englishes]]

'''World Englishes''' is a term for emerging localized or [[Indigenous language|indigenized]] varieties of English, especially varieties that have developed in territories influenced by the United Kingdom or the United States. The study of World Englishes consists of identifying varieties of English used in diverse sociolinguistic contexts globally and analyzing how sociolinguistic histories, multicultural backgrounds and contexts of function influence the use of English in different regions of the world.

The issue of World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine concepts of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic factors such as appropriateness, comprehensibility and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra-national language. In 1988, at a [[TESOL Inc.|Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)]] conference in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of "World Englishes Today", at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois]], USA.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;International Association of World Englishes [http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214100854/http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php# |date=2010-12-14 }}, Retrieved on 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an academic journal devoted to the study of this topic, titled ''World Englishes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467971x|title=World Englishes - Wiley Online Library|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are approximately 75 territories where English is spoken either as a [[first language]] (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized [[second language]] (L2) in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish the total number of Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;Crystal, D. (2007). ''English as a Global Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==World English vs. World Englishes vs. Global Englishes==
The notions of [[International English|World English]] and World Englishes are far from similar, although the terms are often mistakenly {{Citation needed|reason=How does one know this isn't just some arbitrary distinction just on Wikipedia?|date=December 2014}} used interchangeably. ''World English'' refers to the English language as a [[lingua franca]] used in business, trade, diplomacy and other spheres of global activity, while ''World Englishes'' refers to the different varieties of English and [[English-based creole languages|English-based creoles]] developed in different regions of the world. Alternatively, the term ''Global Englishes'' has been used by scholars in the field to emphasise the more recent spread of English due to [[globalization]], which has resulted in increased usage of [[English as a lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, N. &amp; Rose, H. (2015). ''Introducing Global Englishes.'' Arbingdon, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradowski|first=Michał B.|title=Barbara Seidlhofer: Understanding English as a Lingua Franca: A Complete Introduction to the Theoretical Nature and Practical Implications of English used as a Lingua Franca (Review article)|url=https://www.academia.edu/3318842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===History of English===
{{Main|History of the English language}}

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic invaders]] into [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of England. Eventually, one of these dialects, [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|Late West Saxon]], came to dominate.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;Baugh, A. C. and Cable. T. (1993). ''A History of the English Language''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two further waves of invasion: the first by speakers of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian branch]] of the Germanic language family, who conquered and colonized parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second by the [[Norman conquest of England|Normans in the 11th century]], who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed a Norman variety called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. For two centuries after the Norman Conquest, [[French language|French]] became the language of everyday life among the upper classes in England. Although the language of the masses remained English, the [[bilingual]] character of England in this period was thus formed.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Middle English]] period, France and England experienced a process of separation. This period of conflicting interests and feelings of resentment was later termed the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By the beginning of the 14th century, English had regained universal use and become the principal tongue of all England, but not without having undergone significant change.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], patriotic feelings regarding English brought about the recognition of English as the national language of England. The language was advocated as acceptable for learned and literary use. With the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the language in this period matured to a standard and differed significantly from the [[Middle English]] period, becoming recognizably "[[Early Modern English|modern]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, R. (2002). "How much shifting actually occurred in the historical English vowel shift?", Minkova, Donka; Stockwell, Robert. ''Studies in the History of the English Language: A Millennial Perspective''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Modern English|18th century]], three main forces were driving the direction of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. This desire for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

By the 19th century, the expansion of the [[British Empire]], as well as global trade, had led to the spread of English around the world. The rising importance of some of England's larger colonies and former colonies, such as the rapidly developing United States, enhanced the value of the English varieties spoken in these regions, encouraging the belief, among the local populations, that their distinct varieties of English should be granted equal standing with the standard of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

===Global spread of English===
;The First dispersal: English is transported to the 'new world'
The first [[diaspora]] involved relatively large-scale [[Human migration|migrations]] of mother-tongue English speakers from [[England]], Scotland and Ireland predominantly to [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], Australia, [[South Africa]] and New Zealand. Over time, their own English dialects developed into modern American, Canadian, West Indian, South African, Australian, and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] Englishes. In contrast to the [[British English|English of Great Britain]], the varieties spoken in modern North America and Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand have been modified in response to the changed and changing sociolinguistic contexts of the migrants, for example being in contact with indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Khoisan]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] or [[Māori people|Maori]] populations in the colonies.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins"&gt;[[Jenkins, Jennifer]]. (2003). ''World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students.'' London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Second dispersal: English is transported to Asia and Africa
The second [[diaspora]] was the result of the colonization of Asia and Africa, which led to the development of '[[New Englishes]]', the second-language varieties of English. In [[colonial Africa]], the history of English is distinct between West and East Africa. English in [[West Africa]] began with trade. particularly the [[slave trade]]. English soon gained official status in what are today [[Gambia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and some of the [[pidgin]] and [[creole language|creoles]] which developed from English contact, including [[Krio language|Krio]] (Sierra Leone) and [[Cameroon Pidgin]], have large numbers of speakers now.

As for [[East Africa]], extensive British settlements were established in what are now [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where English became a crucial language of the government, education and the law. From the early 1960s, the six countries achieved independence in succession; but English remained the official language and had large numbers of second language speakers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi (along with [[Chewa language|Chewa]]).

English was formally introduced to the sub-continent of [[South Asia]] (India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]) during the second half of the eighteenth century. In India, English was given status through the implementation of Macaulay 'Minute' of 1835, which proposed the introduction of an English educational system in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the process of '[[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]]' led to the development of a distinctive national character of English in the Indian sub-continent.

British influence in [[South-East Asia]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] began in the late eighteenth century, involving primarily the territories now known as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. [[Papua New Guinea]], also a [[British protectorate]], exemplified the English-based [[pidgin]] - [[Tok Pisin]].

The Americans came late in [[South-East Asia]] but their influence spread like wildfire as their reforms on education in the [[Philippines]] progressed in their less than half a century colonization of the islands. English has been taught since the American period and is one of the official languages of the Philippines. Ever since English became the official language, a localized variety gradually emerged - [[Philippine English]]. Lately, linguist Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wilkinson_Daniel_Wong_Gonzales?ev=hdr_xprf&amp;_sg=mCNszti2YtJXBcgvTb_FFtSXL3-s4zdYcFDgMf1MYf5IPlslU5e-unjgtlDoLAPc|title=Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales {{!}} Master of Arts, English Language and Linguistics {{!}} National University of Singapore, Singapore {{!}} NUS {{!}} Department of English Language &amp; Literature {{!}} ResearchGate|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this variety has in itself more varieties, suggesting that we move towards [[Philippine Englishes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307896694|title=a to A��o Social Salesiana em rede... {{!}} Browse publications|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm to progress further in Schneider's dynamic model after gathering evidences of such happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Villanueva|first=Rey John Castro|title=The Features of Philippine English across Regions|date=2016|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=2750&amp;shelfbrowse_itemnumber=6284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, English is also learnt in other countries in neighbouring areas, most notably in [[Taiwan]], Japan and [[Korea]], with the latter two having begun to consider the possibility of making English their official second language.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

==Classification of Englishes==
The spread of English around the world is often discussed in terms of three distinct groups of users, where English is used respectively as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jennifer|title=World englishes : a resource book for studens|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-25806-7|pages=14–15|edition=1. edition, 3. reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# a [[native language]] (ENL); the [[primary language]] of the majority population of a country, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.
# a [[second language]] (ESL); an additional language for ''intra''national as well as ''inter''national communication in communities that are [[multilingual]], such as in India, [[Nigeria]], and [[Singapore]]. Most of these Englishes developed as a result of imperial expansion that brought the language to various parts of the world.
# a [[foreign language]] (EFL); used almost exclusively for international communication, such as in Japan.

===Kachru's Three Circles of English===
[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.jpg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English''.]] The most influential model of the spread of English is [[Braj Kachru]]'s model of World Englishes. In this model the diffusion of English is captured in terms of three Concentric Circles of the language: The Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). ''The Other Tongue: English across cultures''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Inner Circle''''' refers to English as it originally took shape and was spread across the world in the first [[diaspora]]. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and [[South Africa]], and some of the [[Caribbean]] territories. English is the [[native language]] or [[mother tongue]] of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.

The '''''Outer Circle''''' of English was produced by the second [[diaspora]] of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by [[Great Britain]] in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful [[lingua franca]] between [[ethnic]] and language groups. Higher education, the [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]], national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], non-Anglophone [[South Africa]], the [[Philippines]] (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, Y. (2006). ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. (Larry E. Smith Eds.) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see [[Languages of Singapore]]), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries where most people speak an [[English-based creole]] and retain standard English for official purposes, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], are also in the Outer Circle.

Finally, the '''''Expanding Circle''''' encompasses countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a medium of international communication. This includes much of the rest of the world's population not categorized above, including territories such as China, Russia, Japan, non-Anglophone [[Europe]] (especially the [[Netherlands]] and [[Nordic countries]]), [[South Korea]], [[Egypt]] and [[Indonesia]]. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimate, especially because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually in a business context. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion.

The inner circle (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; that means that English language [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly [[Commonwealth countries|New Commonwealth countries]]) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes much of the rest of the world) is 'norm-dependent', because it relies on the standards set by [[native speakers]] in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). World Englishes: approaches, issues and resources. ''Language Teaching'', 25: 1-14. Cambridge UP''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schneider's Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes===
{{Main|Schneider's Dynamic Model}}
Edgar Werner Schneider tries to avoid a purely geographical and historical approach evident in the 'circles' models and incorporates [[sociolinguistic|sociolinguistic concepts]] pertaining to acts of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="y2"&gt;Le Page, R. B. and Tabouret-Keller, A. (1985). ''Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
He outlines five characteristic stages in the spread of English:

'''''Phase 1 - Foundation''''': This is the initial stage of the introduction of English to a new territory over an extended period of time. Two linguistic processes are operative at this stage: (a) [[language contact]] between English and [[indigenous language]]s; (b) contact between different [[dialects of English]] of the settlers which eventually results in a new stable [[dialect]] (see [[Koiné language|koiné]]). At this stage, [[bilingualism]] is marginal. A few members of the local populace may play an important role as interpreters, translators and guides. Borrowings are limited to lexical items; with local place names and terms for local fauna and flora being adopted by the English.&lt;ref name="y5"&gt;Schneider, E. W. (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 2 - Exonormative stabilization''''': At this stage, the settler communities tend to stabilize politically under British rule. English increases in prominence and though the [[colloquial]] English is a colonial [[Koiné language|koiné]], the speakers look to England for their formal norms. Local vocabulary continues to be adopted. Bilingualism increases amongst the [[indigenous population]] through education and increased contacts with English settlers. Knowledge of English becomes an asset, and a new indigenous [[elite]] develops.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 3 - Nativisation''''': According to Schneider, this is the stage at which a transition occurs as the English settler population starts to accept a new [[identity (social science)|identity]] based on present and local realities, rather than sole allegiance to their 'mother country'. By this time, the indigenous strand has also stabilized an [[Second language|L2]] system that is a synthesis of substrate effects, interlanguage processes and features adopted from the settlers' [[Koiné language|koiné]] English. [[Neologisms]] stabilize as English is made to adapt to local sociopolitical and cultural practices.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization''''': This stage is characterized by the gradual acceptance of local [[Norms (sociology)|norms]], supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events have made it clear that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of [[nation]]hood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new [[identity (social science)|identity]]. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] (and not always for localized grammar). [[Literary genre|Literary creativity]] in local English begins to flourish.&lt;ref name="y1"&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend and Bhatt, Rakesh M. (2008). ''World Englishes: The Study of New Linguistic Varieties''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 5 - Differentiation''''': At this stage there is a change in the dynamics of [[identity (social science)|identity]] as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the [[British Empire|former colonial power]] as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting [[language change]] (with the aid of [[social differentiation]]) the new English [[Koiné language|koiné]] starts to show greater differentiation.&lt;ref name="y1" /&gt;

===Other models of classification===
====Strevens's world map of English====
The oldest map of the spread of English is Strevens's world map of English.  His world map, even predating that of Kachru's three circles, showed that since American English became a separate variety from British English, all subsequent Englishes have had affinities with either one or the other.&lt;ref name="y3"&gt;Strevens, P. (1980). ''Teaching English as an International Language''. Oxford: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====McArthur's circle of World English====
McArthur's "wheel model" has an idealized central variety called "World Standard English," which is best represented by "written international English." The next circle is made of regional standards or standards that are emerging. Finally, the outer layer consists of localized varieties which may have similarities with the regional standards or emerging standards.

Although the model is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three different types of English&amp;nbsp;— ENL, [[ESL]] and [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]], are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes [[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and [[Second language|L2]] Englishes. Most scholars would argue that [[Pidgin English|English pidgins]] and [[English creoles|creoles]] do not belong to one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, A. (1987). "The English Languages?" ''English Today'': 11:9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Görlach's circle model of English====
Manfred Görlach's and McArthur's models are reasonably similar. Both exclude English varieties in Europe. As Görlach does not include [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]]s at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties ([[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.&lt;ref&gt;Görlach, M. (1990).''Studies in the History of the English Language''. Heidelberg: Carl Winter.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modiano's model of English====
In Modiano's model of English, the center consists of users of English as an International Language, with a core set of features which are comprehensible to the majority of native and competent [[non-native speakers]] of English. The second circle consists of features which may become internationally common or may fall into obscurity. Finally, the outer area consists of five groups ([[American English]], [[British English]], other major varieties, local varieties, foreign varieties) each with features peculiar to their own speech community and which are unlikely to be understood by most members of the other four groups.&lt;ref&gt;Modiano, M. (1999). "Standard English(es) and educational practices for the world's lingua franca". ''English Today'': 15/4: 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and varieties==
 {{main|List of dialects of the English language}}

The World Englishes paradigm is not static, and neither are rapidly changing realities of language use worldwide. The use of English in the Outer and Expanding Circle societies (refer to '''Kachru's Three Circles of English''') continues its rapid spread, while at the same time new patterns of [[language contact]] and variety differentiation emerge. The different varieties range from English in the Inner circle societies such as the United States, Canada, [[South Africa]], Australia and New Zealand, to the Outer circle post-colonial societies of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].
The World Englishes initiative, in recognizing and describing the New Englishes of the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], [[African English|Africa]] and [[Asia]], has been partly motivated by a consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by a consideration of the wider [[cultural]] and [[political]] contexts of [[language acquisition]] and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. B., Kachru, Y. and Nelson, C. (2009). ''The Handbook of World Englishes''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[language]]'' and ''[[dialect]]'' are not easily defined concepts. It is often suggested that languages are [[Autonomous language|autonomous]], while dialects are [[Heteronomous language|heteronomous]]. It is also said that dialects, in contrast with languages, are mutually intelligible, though this is not always the case. Dialects are characteristically spoken, do not have a codified form and are used only in certain domains.&lt;ref name ="Melchers"&gt;Melchers, G. and Shaw, P. (2003) World Englishes. ''The English Language Series''. Department of English, Stockholm University, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid the difficult dialect-language distinction, linguists tend to prefer a more neutral term, ''variety'', which covers both concepts and is not clouded by popular usage. This term is generally used when discussing World Englishes.

==The future of World Englishes==
Two scenarios have been advanced about English's future status as the major [[world language]]: it  will ultimately fragment into a large number of [[mutually unintelligible]] varieties (in effect, [[languages]]), or it will converge so that differences across groups of speakers are largely eliminated.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

===English as the language of 'others'===
If English is, numerically speaking, the language of 'others', then the center of gravity of the language is almost certain to shift in the direction of the 'others'. In the words of [[Henry Widdowson|Widdowson]], there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread:&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H. G. (1997). "EIL, ESL, EFL: Global Issues and Local Interests". ''World Englishes'', 16: 135–146.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When we talk about the spread of English, then, it is not that the conventionally coded forms and meanings are transmitted into different environments and different surroundings, and taken up and used by different groups of people. It is not a matter of the actual language being distributed but of the virtual language being spread and in the process being variously actualized. The distribution of the actual language implies adoption and conformity. The spread of virtual language implies adaptation and nonconformity. The two processes are quite different.}}

In this new paradigm, English spreads and adapts according to the linguistic and cultural preferences of its users in the Outer and Expanding circles (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English). However, if English is genuinely to become the language of 'others', then the 'others' have to be accorded&amp;nbsp;– or perhaps more likely, accord themselves&amp;nbsp;– at least the same English language rights as those claimed by mother-tongue speakers.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, M.B. 2008, Apr. Winds of change in the English language&amp;nbsp;– Air of peril for native speakers? Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language) 2(1), 92–119. http://www.novitasroyal.org/paradowski.pdf However, it remains to be seen whether such a [[paradigm shift]] will take place.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A different world language===
The other potential shift in the linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its [[International English|international role]] altogether, or come to share it with a number of equals. Although this would not happen mainly as a result of native-speaker resistance to the spread of non-native speaker Englishes and the consequent abandoning of English by large numbers of non-native speakers, the latter could play a part.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

As evidence that English may eventually give way to another language (or languages) as the world's [[lingua franca]], [[David Crystal]] cites [[Internet]] data:&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2001) Language and the Internet. Cambridge UP.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When the internet started it was of course 100 percent English because of where it came from, but since the 1980s that status has started to fall away. By 1995, it was down to about 80 per cent present of English on the internet, and the current figures for 2001 are that it is hovering somewhere between 60 percent and 70 percent, with a significant drop likely over the next four or five years.}}
On the other hand, there are at least 1500 languages present on the internet now and that figure is likely to increase.  Nevertheless, Crystal predicts that English will retain its dominant presence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2232">A '''writing circle''' is a group of like-minded writers needing support for their work, either through [[writing]] [[peer critiques]], [[workshops]] or [[Class (education)|classes]], or just encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruiz|first=F|title=What Is a Writing Circle?|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-a-writing-circle.htm|publisher=Wisegeek.net|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many different types of writing circles or writing groups based on location, style of writing, or format.  Normally, the goal of a writing circle is to improve one's own craft by listening to the works and suggestions of others in the group.  It also builds a sense of community, and allows new writers to become accustomed to sharing their work.  Writing circles can be helpful inside and outside of the classroom.

==Function==
A writing circle brings writers from different walks of life together in one place to discuss their work in a workshop style setting.  Writers will be able to give feedback and hear suggestions from fellow writers.  It can build community in a classroom and help students gain public speaking cleans.  This workshop method could be used for any genre of writing (creative prose, poetry, etc.).

Writing circles can build a sense of community and help writers become more confident in their own work. They teach writers how give and receive constructive criticism enable them to learn from one another's mistakes and successes and appreciate different opinions and views. In some cases writing circles can be used a form of group therapy (Writing for healing).
