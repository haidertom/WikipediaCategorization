The '''Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics''' is the [[United States]]' largest organization of [[food]] and [[nutrition]] professionals, and represents over 100,000 credentialed practitioners — registered dietitian nutritionists, dietetic technicians, registered, and other dietetics professionals holding undergraduate and advanced degrees in nutrition and dietetics. After nearly 100 years as the '''American Dietetic Association''', the organization officially changed its name to the '''Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics''' in 2012.&lt;ref name="eatright"&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/ Eat Right]. ''Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics''.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's members are primarily [[Dietitian|registered dietitian nutritionists]] (RDNs)&lt;ref name="RDN"&gt;[http://www.eatrightpro.org/resources/about-us/what-is-an-rdn-and-dtr/what-is-a-registered-dietitian-nutritionist/ What is a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist?] ''Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics''.&lt;/ref&gt; and nutrition and dietetic technicians, registered (NDTR)&lt;ref name="NDTR"&gt;[http://www.eatrightpro.org/resources/about-us/what-is-an-rdn-and-dtr/what-is-a-dietetic-technician-registered/ What is a Nutrition and Dietetic Technician, Registered?] ''Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics''.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many researchers, educators, students, nurses, physicians, pharmacists, clinical and community dietetics professionals, consultants and food service managers.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.eatrightpro.org/resources/about-us About the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]. ''Eat Right''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has faced controversy regarding corporate influence related to its relationship with the food industry and funding from corporate groups such as [[McDonald's]], [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasdaq.com/article/cocacola-ends-financial-sponsorship-of-academy-of-nutrition-and-dietetics-20150928-01225|title = Coca-Cola Ends Financial Sponsorship of Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|date = 28 September 2015|accessdate = 13 October 2015|website = Nasdaq|publisher = Mike Esterl|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]], and others.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/report-questions-nutrition-groups-use-of-corporate-sponsors.html?_r=0 | title=Report Faults Food Group's Sponsor Ties | publisher=The New York Times | date=22 January 2013 | accessdate=4 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eat Drink Politics"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eatdrinkpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/AND_Corporate_Sponsorship_Report.pdf | title=Are America's Nutrition Professionals in the Pocket of Big Food? | publisher=Eat Drink Politics | date=January 2013 | accessdate=4 October 2015 | author=Simon, Michele}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics was founded in 1917 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], by a group of women led by [[Lenna F. Cooper]] and the Academy's first president, [[Lulu G. Graves]], who were dedicated to helping the government conserve food and improve [[public health]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=historyofadabook&gt;Barber, Mary I. ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_the_American_Dietetic_Associa.html?id=GIw_AAAAYAAJ History of the American Dietetic Association, 1917-1959]''. Lippincott: 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=pittsburghpostgazette&gt;Mayer, Jean and Dr. Johanna Dwyer. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L90NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M20DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4967,3418792&amp;dq=american+dietetic+association&amp;hl=en Careers in Dietetics]. ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''. February 27, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original mission of the Academy was in part to help make maximal use of America's food resources during wartime.&lt;ref name=cnnfoodindustry&gt;Foer, Jonathan Safran. [http://edition.cnn.com/2009/OPINION/10/30/eating.meat.jonathan.foer/index.html Food industry dictates nutrition policy]. ''CNN''. October 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, the Academy attracted 58 members.&lt;ref name=adamilestone&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/Media/content.aspx?id=1254 American Dietetic Association Reaches Membership Milestone, Surpassing 70,000 Members for the First Time]. ''Eat Right''. April 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It remained a small organization, remaining under the 1,000 member mark until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=adamilestone/&gt; As the group's scope expanded, so did its membership numbers. Between the 1930s and 1960s, membership skyrocketed to more than 60,000.&lt;ref name=adamilestone/&gt; Growth trajectory has since stabilized, and the Academy marked its 70,000th member when a female dietitian in Texas rejoined the Academy in May 2009.&lt;ref name=adamilestone/&gt; Since its founding in 1917, the Academy has gained members in every decade.&lt;ref name=adamilestone/&gt;

[[File:Academy-of-Nutrition-and-Dietetics-Seal.jpg|thumb|right|Current Seal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]]
An authorized seal for the organization was adopted by the Executive Board and presented to members on October 24, 1940.&lt;ref name=seal&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Timeline|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/history-timeline|website=eatrightPRO.org|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its center are symbols of the three main characteristics of the profession: a balance scale, representing science as the foundation and symbolizing equality; a caduceus, representing the close relationship between dietetics and medicine; and a cooking vessel, representing cookery and food preparation. Around the main design is a shaft of wheat, representing bread, the staff of life, and stylized acanthus leaves, representing growth and life. Over the design is a cornucopia, representing an abundant food supply. Beneath the design is the motto, Quam Plurimis Prodesse ("To benefit as many as possible"). Around the edge is the name of the organization and the date of its founding written in Roman numerals.

The seal is still in use on Registration Status Certificates for both registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, as well as on the gold Member Pin.

According to current Academy president Sylvia Escott Stump, the group changed their name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in 2012 to reflect the scientific and academic expertise of its members.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Jeannine. [http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/04/news/la-heb-american-dietetic-association-name-change-20120103 The American Dietetic Assn. gets a new name]. ''The Los Angeles Times''. January 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Nutrition Month ===
In 1973, the Academy created “National Nutrition Week.” The theme the first year was "Invest in Yourself...Buy Nutrition.”&lt;ref name=bryantimes&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iVgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WlIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5360,4029238&amp;dq=american+dietetic+association&amp;hl=en Diatetic Association tells of Nat'l Nutrition Week]. ''The Bryan Times''. March 2, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2010, the Academy proclaimed “Registered Dietitian's Day” to honor the “indispensable providers of food and nutrition services and to recognize RDs for their commitment to helping people enjoy healthy lives.”&lt;ref name="2015report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/about%20us/annual%20reports/annualreport2015.ashx |title=ADA Annual Reports |publisher=Eatright.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association also sponsors “National Nutrition Month” in March in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Grotto, Dave.

==Finances and Organization==
In 2015, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics had disclosed net assets of $48 million, the bulk of which was in cash and investments.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt; It took in $11.3M in annual membership dues, and an additional $7.4M in registration and examination fees. In 2015, it took in $35.2 million in revenue on expenses of $38.4M for an operating loss of $3.4M. After accounting for return on investments, the Academy posted a deficit of $544,722 for the 2015 fiscal year.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt; In the same year, they received $1.1 million in corporate sponsorships from companies like General Mills, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo via donations, joint initiatives, and programs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/about%20us/annual%20reports/annualreport2015.ashx#page=5 |title=2015 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Annual Reports |publisher=EatrightPRO.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-02}} p. 5: “CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP: To advance the Academy's mission of empowering members to be the food and nutrition leaders, the Academy's corporate sponsorship program allows for purposeful collaboration with food and nutrition organizations. ”&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has offices both in Chicago and Washington DC. In addition to the Academy, the organization maintains several other organizations and entities, including the Commission on Dietetic Registration, Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education, Dietetic Practice Groups, Academy Political Action Committee, and Academy Foundation. There are also several “member interest groups” which include more than 4,800 members with common interests or specialties including Fifty Plus in Nutrition and Dietetics; Filipino Americans in Dietetics and Nutrition; Muslims in Dietetics and Nutrition; and National Organization of Blacks in Dietetics and Nutrition.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt;

===Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation===
In 1966, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics established the Foundation as a [[501(c) organization|501(C)(3)]] public charity. According to its mission statement, the Foundation is the “only charitable organization devoted exclusively to promoting good nutrition.” Its mission is to advance public health and nutrition with focus on three initiatives: scholarships, Healthy Weight for Kids and food and nutrition research.&lt;ref name=charitynav&gt;[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=8467 American Dietetic Association Foundation]. ''Charity Navigator''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Foundation had charitable contributions and revenues of $4.23 million, of which $1.7 million went to program expenses, $540,000 went to administrative expenses, and $289,000 went to fund raising expenses. Its executive director, Mary Beth Whalen, is paid $215,000 per year. These figures earned the Foundation a 60.95/70 score by [[Charity Navigator|CharityNavigator.com]] (four stars for transparency, three stars for its financials).&lt;ref name=charitynav/&gt;

In 2011, the Foundation received corporate contributions totaling around $1.2 million from organizations such as [[Nestle]], [[Kelloggs]], [[Mars, Inc]] [[Coca-Cola]] and the [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]],&lt;ref name="eatright"/&gt; as well as a $500,000 donation industrial food giant [[General Mills]] to promote healthy eating for kids.&lt;ref name=thestreet&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10789235/1/general-mills-partners-with-american-dietetic-association-to-help-kids-adopt-healthy-eating-and-exercise-habits.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEFI General Mills Partners With American Dietetic Association To Help Kids Adopt Healthy Eating And Exercise Habits]. ''The Street''. June 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and positions==
Through its research journal, the Academy shapes and influences the public and legislative discussion about health, food safety and nutrition. Academy RD's are regularly quoted in world publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Wall Street Journal]], [[USA Today]], [[Los Angeles Times]] [[Men's Fitness]], [[O, The Oprah Magazine|O Magazine]], [[Consumer Reports]], [[Forbes]] and [[Huffington Post]]. In 2010, the organization received approximately 30 billion media impressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatright.org/Media/content.aspx?id=5202 |title=ADA Annual Reports |publisher=Eatright.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}} p. 2: “Coverage of ADA totaled more than 30 billion media impressions, including stories in ''The New York Times'', Wlal Street Journal, USA Today, Los Angeles Times and Chicago Sun-Times. Consumer magazine coverage of ADA appeared in Men's Fitness, O Magazine, Consumer Reports, US News &amp; World Report, Prevention, Self, Forbes, and Huffington Post, among others.”&lt;/ref&gt;

As an organization and research institute, the Academy holds a variety of influential health positions, including:
* The Academy "maintains that the only way to lose weight is through a healthy, well-balanced diet and exercise."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bLtNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Uf0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4799,6361178&amp;dq=american+dietetic+association&amp;hl=en The American Dietetic Association maintains that the only way to lose weight is through a healthy, well-balanced diet and exercise]. ''Lakeland Ledger''. October 20, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The Academy's stated position is that “there are no good or bad foods, only good and bad diets.” According to the Academy such labeling or “bumpers” confuse the public.&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rW8aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ei0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6759,219809&amp;dq=american+dietetic+association&amp;hl=en Group's Pursuit of Cash Draws Fire]. ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel''. December 6, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Academy states that "exclusive breastfeeding provides optimal nutrition and health protection for the first 6 months of life and breastfeeding with complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age is the ideal feeding pattern for infants."&lt;ref name=adabreastfeeding&gt;[http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/ps/bf/Resources/American%20Dietetic%20Assocation%20SupportingPromotingBreastfeeding%20TAB%202.pdf Position of the American Dietetic Association: Promoting and Supporting Breastfeeding]. ''American Dietetic Association''. November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Academy "believes that up to two servings of soy per day for adults could be part of a healthy diet."&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;Eng, Monica.

December 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Academy has stated that a "well planned vegan diet" (no meat, dairy or animal products) is appropriate and healthy for babies.&lt;ref&gt;"Are Vegan Diets Safe for Children?" by Lily Medina	http://www.livestrong.com/article/379466-are-vegan-diets-safe-for-children/&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Academy states that to combat the [[obesity epidemic]], adults and children need access to healthy foods, education on eating well, and preventative health services, including counseling by registered dietitian nutritionists.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Kaye. [http://www.cleveland.com/healthy-eating/index.ssf/2010/06/motivation_information_needed_to_combat_obesity_american_dietetic_association_says.html Motivation, information needed to combat obesity, American Dietetic Association says].

* The Academy opposed mandated labeling of "[[trans fats]]" on food packaging.&lt;ref name=washingtonpostfda&gt;Squires, Sally. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/46329006.html?dids=46329006:46329006&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+13%2C+1999&amp;author=Sally+Squires&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=FDA+Wants+Food+LabelsTo+List+Trans+Fatty+Acids&amp;pqatl=google FDA Wants Food LabelsTo List Trans Fatty Acids]. ''The Washington Post''. November 13, 1999. "This is one more thing on the food label," said Connie Diekman, a national spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, which opposes the regulation”&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Academy has given low ratings to the high-protein, low-carb diet known as the [[Atkins Diet]], insisting that the diet is "unhealthy and the weight loss is temporary."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YQVBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YKgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6607,3286289&amp;dq=american+dietetic+association&amp;hl=en Low-carb, high-protein diets popular, but not with adults]. ''Harlan Daily Enterprise''. November 3, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy maintains that carbohydrates are not responsible for weight gain any more than other forms of calories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/Public/content.aspx?id=10645 Question of the Day: Do Carbohydrates Cause Weight Gain?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508100718/http://www.eatright.org/Public/content.aspx?id=10645 |date=2013-05-08 }} ''Eat Right''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Academy states that children who eat breakfast have better concentration, problem-solving skills, and eye hand coordination. Children who do not eat breakfast are tired at school and eat more junk food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.inlandvalleynews.com/2012/08/15/start-your-day-with-greatness/ |title=Start Your Day with Greatness – Inland Valley News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828044103/http://www.inlandvalleynews.com/2012/08/15/start-your-day-with-greatness/ |archive-date=2012-08-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/food/2012/08/15/1-backtoschool-art-ga6io1o1-1.html Dietitians prime parents on nutrition before start of school | The Columbus Dispatch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research and Publications===
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics publishes position papers on public health regarding [[pediatric]] ([[children]]'s) health, [[food technology]], [[food safety]], [[geriatrics]] ([[elderly]]) health, [[Health care politics|health-care reform]], [[obesity]] and food and nutrition topics through the ''[[Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]]'' (''ANDJ'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Journal|url=http://www.andjrnl.org/aims|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has also published 3 editions of the ''American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duyff |first=Roberta Larson |year=2006 |title=American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide, Revised and Updated 3rd Edition |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470048425.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its publishing arm, the Academy has published such books and guides as ''Easy Gluten-Free'', ''ADA Pocket Guide to Eating Disorders'', ''ADA Pocket Guide to Lipid Disorders, Hypertension, Diabetes and Weight Management'', ''ADA Quick Guide to Drug-Supplement Interactions'' and ''Making Nutrition Your Business''.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt; It also maintains the site eatright.org.

In the 1980s, the Academy published the magazine Food/2 which had originally been created by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]. In response pressure from meat, egg, and dairy industries, the Department of Agriculture decided not publish it, after which the Academy negotiated with the government to publish it itself, omitting the controversial chapters on [[fat]] and [[cholesterol]].&lt;ref name=nytimesmagazine&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/19/garden/magazine-withheld-by-us-may-revive.html MAGAZINE WITHHELD BY U.S. MAY REVIVE]. ''The New York Times''. May 19, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was widely criticized, with participating dietitians stating "it is just incredible that they would publish it without the most important part."&lt;ref name=nytimesmagazine/&gt;

==Certification==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics certification process offers two career options: Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and Nutrition and Dietetics Technician, Registered (NDTR). Both are educated nutrition professionals qualified to work in hospitals, academia and private practice, and differ mostly in the hours of training and level of college degree required. A Registered Dietitian Nutritionist must complete a bachelor's degree or higher and more than 900 hours of training, while a Dietetic Technician is required to complete and associate level degree and 450 hours of training.&lt;ref name=llu&gt;[http://www.llu.edu/allied-health/nutrition/faqs.page Frequently Asked Questions]. “What is the difference between a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and a Nutrition Dietetic Technician, Registered (NDTR) and what career opportunities are available for each?” (Information is provided by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics FAQs web page)&lt;/ref&gt; About 72% of the Academy's members are Registered Dietitian Nutritionists, and 2% are Nutrition Dietetic Technicians, Registered.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; Members are granted these accredited titles by fulfilling the Academy's strenuous certification requirements in addition to any state or local regulations. Through its ADAF foundation, the Academy issued nearly $500,000 in certification scholarships in 2011, $100,000 of which went to doctoral students.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt;

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics's Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) is the organization's accrediting agency for education programs that prepare individuals for careers as dietetics professionals. Prior to 2011{{Disputed inline|Questions about updating/correcting content in article|for=happening in 2013?|date=March 2018}}, ACEND was known as the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education (CADE).&lt;ref name=acend&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/ACEND/ About ACEND]. ''Eat Right''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Accreditation Council is recognized by the Department of Education and is a member of the Association of Specialized and Professional Accreditors. The council's fees earn the Academy over $1 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/about%20us/annual%20reports/annualreport2015.ashx?page=11 |title=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics 2015 Annual Report |publisher=EatrightPRO.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-02}} “The Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics serves the public and the Academy's members by working with dietetics practitioners, educators and others to develop and implement standards for the educational preparation of nutrition and dietetics professionals and by accrediting dietetics education programs at colleges, universities and other organizations that meet its standards. As of May 31, 2015, there were 575 programs accredited in the United States and five international programs.”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN)===
According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist is a “food and nutrition expert” who has fulfilled the minimum requirements for the titled RD.&lt;ref name=llu/&gt;

Requirements include the following items:
* Earning a bachelor's degree with course work approved by the Academys's Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). Coursework typically includes food and nutrition sciences, foodservice systems management, business, economics, computer science, sociology, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology and chemistry.
* Completing an accredited, supervised practice program at a health-care facility, community agency or foodservice corporation.
* Passing a national examination administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration.
* Completing continuing professional educational requirements to maintain registration.
* In addition to the costs of the college coursework, the Academy charges a $200 application fee for registered dietitians.&lt;ref name=nutritionistworld&gt;[http://www.nutritionist-world.com/ADA_registered_dietitian_regs.html National Requirements to Become a Registered Dietitian from the American Dietetic Association's (ADA) Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR)]. ''Nutritionist World''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Students must complete a 1,200 hour internship to sit for the Registered Dietitian exam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-07/special/chi-adveducation-dietetics-20120807_1_dietetics-nutrition-world-degree-program Graduates cooking up new ways to utilize degrees in dietetics - Chicago Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 50% of RDs hold advanced degrees. Some RDNs also hold additional certifications in specialized areas of practice, such as pediatric or renal nutrition, nutrition support and diabetes education.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; In addition to any Academy requirements (and often with some overlap),  many states have laws for dietitians and nutrition practitioners.&lt;ref name=eatrightmedia&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/Media/content.aspx?id=6442467510 What Is the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics?]. ''Eat Right''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition Dietetic Technician, Registered (NDTR)===
According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, NDTRs are “a food and nutrition practitioner” who has fulfilled the minimum requirements for the title NDTR.&lt;ref name=llu/&gt;

These requirements, while similar to an RD, differ in that they require:
* A minimum of an [[Associate of Science|Associate's]] degree.
* At least 450 hours of supervised practice accredited by ACEND.
* Successful pass a national DTR examination administered by CDR.
* Complete continuing professional educational requirements to maintain registration.

NDTR's typically work closely with RD in numerous employment settings such as hospitals, health care facilities, private practice, day care centers, correctional facilities and weight loss centers.&lt;ref name=llu/&gt; The Academy application fee to become an NDTR is $120.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nutritionist-world.com/ADA_registered_dietitian_regs.html National Requirements to Become a Registered Dietitian from the American Dietetic Association's (ADA) Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR)]. ''Loma Linda University''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying efforts and competitive protections==
To help better communications with the US government, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has offices in [[Washington, DC]]. They also operate their own [[political action committee]], the Academy's Political Action Committee.&lt;ref name="2015report"/&gt; The Academy spent $5.8 million lobbying at the state and national level from 2000–2010.&lt;ref name=opensecrets&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000023948&amp;year=2010 American Dietetic Assn]. ''Open Secrets''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1985 report noted the Academy has supported licensing for dispensing nutritional advice.&lt;ref name=washingtonpostlicensing&gt;Sugarman, Carole. "Licensing Nutrition Advisers." ''[[The Washington Post]]'' via [http://www.lexisnexis.com LexisNexis]. May 5, 1985. "And they want to make it illegal for individuals to offer nutrition advice without proper credentials [...] According to Catherine Babington, director of government affairs of the American Dietetic Association, dietitians in 36 states are pursuing mandatory licensure, although details of the proposed laws vary from state to state. A bill awaits the governor's signature in Maryland, while dietetic associations in Virginia and the District of Columbia are in the beginning stages of drafting such bills. [...] Opponents such as the National Health Federation, chaired by Donsbach, and the National Nutritional Foods Association, which represents more than 3,500 health food stores, contend that highly restrictive bills could create a monopoly for one school of traditional nutrition thought, limiting the free market and consumer choice, and that their primary intent is not to protect the public, but to give clout and recognition to a single segment of dietitians, increasing their chances of obtaining reimbursement from insurance companies."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to supporting legislation regulating the professional nutrition field in states like [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Hawaii]], [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], the Academy has also applied for patents for its certification titles such as: “Certified Nutrition Coach,” “Certified Nutrition Professional,” “Registered Nutrition Professional,” and “Certified Nutrition Educator.”&lt;ref name=forbesellsberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=wyomingdetective&gt;[http://www.wyomingdieteticassociation.com/rd_licensure.asp RD Licensure]. ''Wyoming Dietetic Association''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy states that by regulating who can provide nutritional counseling, they can protect their registered members and the public from unregulated advice or possibly inaccurate advice from less qualified dietary practitioners such as [[chiropractors]], [[yoga|yoga instructors]], [[homeopaths]], and [[personal trainers]].&lt;ref name=forbesellsberg/&gt; The Academy's support of this legislation has generated strong opposition from [[alternative medicine|alternative health practitioners]] and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] groups, who state that "highly restrictive bills could create a monopoly for one school of traditional nutrition thought" and that the primary intent of the bill is "not to protect the public, but to give clout and recognition to a single segment of dietitians, increasing their chances of obtaining reimbursement from insurance companies."&lt;ref name=forbesellsberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=washingtonpostlicensing/&gt;

==Kids Eat Right==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the ADA Foundation launched their first joint initiative, Kids Eat Right, in November 2010. This member-driven campaign is dedicated to supporting the efforts of the White House to end the childhood obesity epidemic within a generation.&lt;ref name="eatrightobama"/&gt; Kids Eat Right is a two-tiered campaign aimed to mobilize Academy members to participate in community and school childhood obesity prevention efforts, and also to educate families, communities, and policy makers about the importance of quality nutrition.

Kids Eat Right has a website that gives families healthy eating tips, articles, videos, and recipes from registered dietitians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswise.com/articles/school-s-out-help-your-kids-eat-right-all-summer-long School's Out! Help Your Kids Eat Right All Summer Long]. ''NewsWire''. May 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Kids Eat Right also has scientifically-based health information centered around the theme "Shop-Cook-Eat" which has information about how to shop for healthy foods, how to cook foods with the most nutrient value, and gives the benefits of eating together at home and away from home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/kids/content.aspx?id=6442459728 Kids Eat Right - About Kids Eat Right&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has been criticized for its connections to the [[pharmaceutical industry]], including an inquiry from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chuck Grassley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=34350  Grassley renews call for voluntary disclosure by influential disease and medical advocacy groups] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721043801/http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=34350 |date=2012-07-21 }}.

December 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the organization faced mass resignations from members over a decision to support President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s cuts in [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] and [[school lunch program]]s.&lt;ref name="nytimesmagazine"/&gt; The decision was largely a political trade-off; the Reagan administration agreed to drop its proposal to deregulate nursing homes in exchange for the Academy's support of the school lunch and food stamp cuts.&lt;ref name=nytimesmagazine/&gt;

===Criticism of partnerships with food companies===
A 1995 report noted the Academy received funding from companies like [[McDonald's]], [[PepsiCo]], [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], [[Abbott Nutrition]], [[General Mills]], [[Kellogg's]], [[Mars Inc.|Mars]], [[McNeil Nutritionals]], [[Pharmavite|SOYJOY]], [[Truvia]], [[Unilever]], and The [[Sugar Association]] as corporate sponsorship.&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_spending&gt;https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/coke-spends-lavishly-on-pediatricians-and-dietitians/&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy also partners with [[ConAgra Foods]], which produces [[Orville Redenbacker]], [[Slim Jim (snack food)|Slim Jims]], [[Hunt's|Hunt's Ketchup]], [[Hunt's Snack Pack|SnackPacks]], and [[Hebrew National|Hebrew National hot dogs]], to maintain the American Dietetic Association/ConAgra Foods Home Food Safety...It's in Your Hands program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20051110005755/en/Timely-Turkey-Tips-Buying-Baking-American-Dietetic Timely Turkey Tips from Buying to Baking; American Dietetic Association/ConAgra Foods offer Home Food Safety Help for Thanksgiving Cooks]. ''Business Wire''. November 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Academy earns revenue from corporations by selling space at its booth during conventions, doing this for [[soft drinks]] and [[candy]] makers.&lt;ref name=milwaukeejournal/&gt;&lt;ref name=thedailygreen&gt;Nestle, Marion. [http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/blogs/healthy-food/marion-nestle-ADA-politics-44031808 The ADA and Corporate Sponsors: An Unhealthy Alliance?]. ''The Daily Green''. March 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, a dietitian working on a panel charged with setting policy on [[genetically modified foods]] for the academy contended she was removed for pointing out that two of its members had ties to [[Monsanto]], one of the biggest makers of [[genetically modified seeds]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/business/a-dismissal-raises-questions-about-objectivity-on-food-policy.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting controversy highlighted the fact that Ms. Smith Edge, chairwoman of the committee charged with developing the GMO policy, is a senior vice president at the [[International Food Information Council]], which is largely financed by food, beverage and agriculture businesses, including companies like [[DuPont]], [[Bayer CropScience]] and [[Cargill]], companies that were among the biggest financial opponents of a [[State of California GMO labeling initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/04/gmo-dieticians-monsanto-california&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy maintains that being at the "same table" with food companies is important in order to exert a positive influence over their products and message, although critics describe this as an “unhealthy alliance” between the Academy and [[junk food]] companies.&lt;ref name="thedailygreen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fooducate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fooducate.com/blog/2010/08/01/ada-response-to-accusations-on-partnership-with-hershey/ |title=ADA Response to Accusations on Partnership with Hershey |publisher=Fooducate |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation is that despite what good may come of such programs, it ultimately [[whitewash]]es (similar to the [[greenwashing]] efforts of environmentally irresponsible companies) the brand's role in the country's food ecosystem. Watchdogs note that the Academy rarely criticizes food companies, believing it to be out of fear of "biting the hand that feeds them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rampton |first1=Sheldon | author1link = Sheldon Rampton|last2=Stauber|first2=John | author2link =John Stauber|year=2001 |title=Trust Us, We're Experts!: How Industry Manipulates Science and Gambles With Your Future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_OEPBt16JscC&amp;pg=PT143&amp;lpg=PT143&amp;dq=%22never+criticize+the+food+industry%22++Joan+Gussow&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_5qA8Ppkcq&amp;sig=qISVPbsLwFuwTq_YsevqSng5BEU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UzSXT8SYDeGe2QXuyrDXDQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22never%20criticize%20the%20food%20industry%22%20%20Joan%20Gussow&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PR Watch"&gt;[http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/2000Q4/dairy.html Who Is the Dairy Coalition?

In March 2015, Academy had endorsed Kraft Singles cheese product with the 'Kids Eat Right' label. Due to negative publicity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.fooducate.com/2015/03/15/kraft-singles-fake-food-faulty-endorsement Kraft Singles – Fake Food, Faulty Endorsement]&lt;/ref&gt; they entered into negotiations with Kraft to cancel this endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/business/dietitians-group-negotiating-to-end-labeling-deal-with-kraft-singles.html Dietitians Group Negotiating to End Labeling Deal With Kraft Singles]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of [[pregnancy]], the [[fetus]] must take the journey of [[childbirth]] to leave the [[reproductive]] [[mother]]. Upon its entry to the air-breathing world, the [[newborn]] must begin to adjust to life outside the [[uterus]].

The outside environment is a drastic change for the neonate, therefore the neonate must be assessed frequently and thoroughly. The apgar scale is an assessment performed immediately following birth. It consists of the assessment of heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and generalized skin color. (insert table here)
Apgar scoring is performed one minute and five minutes after birth. Scoring ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating severe neonatal distress and 10 indicating a smooth transition to extrauterine life. &lt;ref name="Lowdermilk"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lowdermilk. D., Perry, S. E., Cashion, K., &amp; Alden, K.R. |title=Maternity &amp; Women’s Health Care |date=2016 |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newborns transitioning into extrauterine life will undergo periods of reactivity. These periods are divided into three stages. The first stage occurs in the first 30 minutes of life; during this stage the infant is alert and responsive with heart rate peaking at 160-180 beats per minute and then stabilizes to a baseline rate of 100-120 beats per minute. Crackles upon auscultation and irregular respirations are a normal finding. In the second stage, there is a decrease in responsiveness and motor activity which is often manifested as sleep. This period can last from 1-2 hours. The third stage marks the second period of reactivity. This period can occur anywhere in the first 2 to 8 hours after birth and lasts anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours. Tachycardia and tachypnea may be present during brief periods. Passing of meconium also occurs. &lt;ref name="Lowdermilk" /&gt;

==Cardiac==
Physiology: In utero, the placenta delivers oxygenated blood to the fetus through the umbilical vein. Upon delivery, the umbilical cord is cut. The cardiovascular system must now adapt.The detachment of the placenta causes an increase in systemic vascular resistance, which leads to an increase in pressure gradient from the left atrium.&lt;ref name="Morton"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morton |first1=Sarah U. |last2=Brodsky |first2=Dara |title=Fetal Physiology and the Transition to Extrauterine Life |journal=Clinics in Perinatology |date=September 2016 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=395–407 |doi=10.1016/j.clp.2016.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The left atrium now has higher pressure than the right atrium causing the ''[[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]]'' to close. Within the first 10 minutes of birth, blood begins to flow left-to-right through the ductus arteriosus. This causes a significant increase in output of the left ventricle and increase in stroke volume. Subsequently, calcium channel activity increases and potassium channel decreases furthering ductal constriction. Functional closure of the ductus arteriosus occurs within the first 24 hours, with permanent closure following  within 4 weeks. Lastly cardiac output increases to nearly double what is was in utero. 
All of these [[cardiovascular system]] changes result in the adaptation from fetal circulation patterns to an [[adult]] [[Circulatory system|circulation]] pattern. During this transition, some types of congenital heart disease that were not symptomatic ''[[in utero]]'' during fetal circulation will present with [[cyanosis]] or [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] signs.
[[File:Postnatal genetics en.svg|thumb|300px|Changing the composition of hemoglobin before and after birth. Also identifies the types of cells and organs in which the gene expression (data on ''Wood W.G.'', (1976). '''Br. Med. Bull. 32, 282.''')]]

Manifestations: When the newborn cries, there is a reversal of blood flow through the foramen ovale which causes the newborn to appear mildly cyanotic in the first few days of life. 
The heart rate of the newborn should be between 110-160 beats per minute and it is common for the heart rate to be irregular in the first few hours following birth. The heart sounds will have a variation in  pitch, duration, and intensity than that of an adult. Blood pressure readings should range from 60 to 80 mm Hg systolic and 40-50 mm Hg diastolic. Mean arterial pressure should be the same as the weeks of gestation at birth. Within the first hour after birth, there may be a drop of up to 15 mm Hg in the systolic blood pressure. &lt;ref name="Lowdermilk" /&gt;

[[Delayed cord clamping]] is defined as waiting more than 2 minutes to clamp the newborn’s umbilical cord. This has been proven to be beneficial in improving hematocrit and iron while also decreasing anemia. These benefits can last up to 6 months for the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=O|title=Effect of delayed versus early umbilical cord clamping on neonatal outcomes and iron status at 4 months: a randomised controlled trial|journal=BMJ|date=15 November 2011|volume=343|doi=10.1136/bmj.d7157|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d7157|page=d7157}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Assessments/Interventions: Assessment and monitoring of vital signs and skin color are important in detecting cardiovascular issues in the infant.
The apical pulse rate should be auscultated for one full minute when the newborn is calm or sleeping. Any irregular heart rate after the first few hours of life that is not related to crying or another outside factor should be monitored and evaluated. &lt;ref name="Lowdermilk" /&gt;
Blood pressure will be taken with an appropriately sized cuff, preferably when the newborn is at rest. 
Consistent tachycardia should be evaluated for conditions such as anemia, hyperthermia, hypovolemia, and sepsis. Consistent bradycardia could be an indication of congenital heart block or hypoxemia. Pallor and central cyanosis (cyanosis in hands and feet is a common and normal finding) can also indicate cardiovascular issues. &lt;ref name="Lowdermilk" /&gt;

==Ventilation and Oxygenation==
Physiology: Upon birth, the newborn's lungs become the center for gas exchange. There are a variety of factors that influence newborn respiratory functions; these factors include chemical, mechanical, thermal, and sensory. Respirations begin when fetal aortic and carotid chemoreceptors are stimulated by the varying concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide. During vaginal birth, the newborn's chest is compressed by the birth canal. Upon delivery, negative pressure allows air into the lungs. The first cries of the infant allow for alveoli expansion and absorption of fetal lung fluid. Temperature changes and other sensory stimulation contributes to respiratory function as well. 

Manifestations: Breathing patterns are often irregular and shallow. The infants respiration rate should be between 30-60 breaths per minute with preference for  nasal breathing. Ribs expands horizontally. Breath sounds should be clear and equal in both lungs. Abdominal breathing is normal. Acrocyanosis is a normal finding. &lt;ref name="Lowdermilk" /&gt;

Assessments/Interventions: Suctioning of nasal and oral secretions promotes fluid clearance. Auscultation of lung sounds to assess for any abnormalities. Pulse oximetry is performed to determine oxygen saturation. Monitor signs of respiratory distress such as: nasal flaring, grunting, central cyanosis. &lt;ref name="Lowdermilk" /&gt;   

==Metabolic==
Physiology: At birth, the newborn is cut off from motherś glucose supply and will begin to rely on stored fat for energy.[[Glycogen]] stores are maximal at term. Within the first hour of life, blood glucose will typically reach its lowest point and then stabilize within 2 to 4 hours, hence [[breastfeeding]] is promoted immediately. In cases where feeding is delayed, the neonate can use [[lactic acid|lactate]], free-fatty acids, and ketone bodies. 

Manifestations: Normal blood glucose levels range from 40-50mg/dl. &lt;ref name="Lowdermilk" /&gt;
Rooting and sucking reflex should be present and the neonate will eat small amounts frequently. All vital signs should be within normal limits coinciding with the neonates presentation of calmness and satiation. 

Assessments/Interventions: Monitor blood glucose level and encourage breastfeeding or formula feeding as early as possible. Lactation and breastfeeding education should be provided as appropriate. 

==Temperature regulation==
Physiology: Newborns lack the ability of thermogenesis due to underdeveloped shivering mechanism. Body heat is lost through conduction, convection, and radiant heat. &lt;ref name="Lowdermilk" /&gt; Thermoregulation is achieved through several methods: the metabolism of brown fat and Kangaroo care, also known as skin to skin. [[Brown adipose tissue|"brown fat"]] which is specialized adipose tissue with a high concentration of mitochondria designed to rapidly oxidize fatty acids in order to generate metabolic heat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mirnia |first1=Kayvan |last2=Arshadi Bostanabad |first2=Mohammad |last3=Asadollahi |first3=Maliheh |last4=Hamid Razzaghi |first4=Mir |title=Paternal Skin-to-Skin Care and its Effect on Cortisol Levels of the Infants |journal=Iranian Journal of Pediatrics |date=10 October 2016 |volume=In Press |issue=In Press |doi=10.5812/ijp.8151}}&lt;/ref&gt;Skin to skin to care is the immediate placement of the neonate directly onto a caregivers bare chest. This promotes thermoregulation of the neonate through heat generated from caregiver. 

Manifestations: Normal temperature ranges between 97.7 and 100.0 degrees. Cold infants may cry or appear restless. Neonates arms and legs maintain a fetal position, lessening their body surface area and reducing heat loss. &lt;ref name="Lowdermilk" /&gt;

Assessments/Interventions: Dry neonate immediately after birth and initiate skin-to-skin contact. Provide warm blankets and a hat. Utilize a radiant warmer if skin-to-skin is not appropriate. Frequently monitor axillary body temperature. Limit neonate’s exposure during diaper changes and assessments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4558">[[File:Apple for Health - Apple with Stethoscope (16348686815).jpg|thumb|It is commonly believed that apple consumption has health benefits.]]
'''"An apple a day keeps the doctor away"''' is a common English-language proverb of Welsh origin. It espouses the [[Traditional knowledge|folk-wisdom]] that [[apple]] consumption (or consumption of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] in general) has identifiable health benefits.

==Origin==
First recorded in the 1860s, the proverb originated in [[Wales]], and was particularly prevalent in [[Pembrokeshire]]. The original wording of the saying was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread." The current phrasing, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", began usage at the end of the 19th century, &lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/history-behind-an-apple-a-day/2013/09/24/aac3e79c-1f0e-11e3-94a2-6c66b668ea55_story.html | title=History behind ‘An apple a day’ | work=Washington Post | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=5 December 2015 | author=Ely, Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An apple a day keeps the doctor away|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkif_tTGtk}}&lt;/ref&gt; early print examples found as early as 1899.&lt;ref name="CtryGtlmn"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Google Books Search Results|url=https://www.google.ru/search?tbs=sbd%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1910&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22an+apple+a+day%22|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background for the proverb was that at bedtime it was served either a fried apple filled with [[caraway]] seeds or a fresh apple with caraway seeds stuck in the apple.&lt;ref name="Borgen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Annemarta  Borgen |title=Urtehagen på Knatten |date=1973 |publisher=Gyldendal |isbn=8205060118 |pages=37-38 |url=https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2007071701094;page=38 |language=Norwegian |chapter=Innenlandske ville kryddurter: Karve |quote=Opprinnelsen til ordspråket om at "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" er at ved sengetid ble det før servert enten et stekt eple fylt med karve eller et friskt gjennomstukket med karve. Eplet var der for at folk skulle få mest mulig karve i seg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Caraway was considered very healthy and the apple was a way to eat as much caraway as possible.&lt;ref name="Borgen"/&gt;

==Scientific evaluation==
A 2011 study found that consumption of apples and pears might prevent [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; A 2012 study found that apple consumption significantly lowered [[bad cholesterol]] levels in middle-aged adults.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; In 2013, the ''BMJ'' published a study as part of its humorous Christmas issue comparing the effects of prescribing everyone in the UK over age 50 either an apple or a [[statin]] a day. The study concluded that both interventions would be similarly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=A. D. M.|last2=Mizdrak|first2=A.|last3=Scarborough|first3=P.|title=A statin a day keeps the doctor away: comparative proverb assessment modelling study|journal=BMJ|date=17 December 2013|volume=347|issue=dec17 2|pages=f7267–f7267|doi=10.1136/bmj.f7267|lay-url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/12/18/255219148/an-apple-a-day-keeps-the-doctor-away-and-statins-do-too}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2015 study looked directly at the relationship between apple consumption and physician visits and found no evidence that the proverb was true. The study did, however, find that people who ate an apple a day did use fewer prescription medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Bynum|first2=Julie P. W.|last3=Sirovich|first3=Brenda E.|title=Association Between Apple Consumption and Physician Visits|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|date=1 May 2015|volume=175|issue=5|pages=777|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.5466|lay-url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/does-an-apple-a-day-really-keep-the-doctor-away/|pmc=4420713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 2011 study found that adding one ‘[[Golden Delicious]]’ apple to the daily diet of a small group of overweight men led to higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The results were attributed to the higher sugar and low-phenolic content of ‘Golden Delicious’ apples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/04/gardens-truth-about-apples-james-wong | title=Gardens: the truth about apples | work=The Guardian | date=4 October 2015 | accessdate=16 April 2016 | author=James, Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9773">'''Breastfeeding and medications''' is the description of the [[medication]]s that can be used by a [[breastfeeding]] mother with no or few consequences and those medications which are recommended to be avoided. Some medications are excreted in [[breastmilk]].&lt;ref name = leche&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/lv/lvaprmay97p39.html|title=The La Leche League InternationalI - Medications and Breastfeeding|publisher = La leche League International |accessdate = 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2001/0701/p119.html|title=Medications in the Breast-Feeding Mother|first1=Jeanne P.|last1=Spencer|first2=Luis S.

Some have no effect on the baby and can be used while breastfeeding.&lt;ref name = NIH2014&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.womenshealth.gov/files/assets/docs/breastfeeding/owh_fs_breastfeeding_7-25-2014.pdf | publisher =  Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services| date = 2014 | accessdate = 20 July 2017 | title = Breastfeeding}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The National Institutes of Medicine]] (US) maintains a [[database]] containing information on drugs and other [[chemicals]] to which breastfeeding mothers may be exposed. It includes information on the levels of such substances in breast milk and infant blood, and the possible [[adverse effect]]s in the nursing infant. Suggested therapeutic alternatives to those drugs are provided, where appropriate. All data are derived from reliable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/lactmed.htm|title=Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed)|website=toxnet.nlm.nih.gov}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medications and herbal supplements can be of concern. This can be because the drug can accumulate in breastmilk or have effects on the infant and the mother. Those medications of concern are those medications used to treat substance and alcohol addiction. Other medications of concern are those that are used in smoking cessation. Pain medications and antidepressants need evaluation.&lt;ref name = aap&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/Pages/Breastfeeding-and-Medication.aspx|title=Breastfeeding and Medication| publisher = American Association of Pediatrics|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Evaluating the potential for adverse effects==
The determination of the safety of a medication can be evaluated by considering the following:
*If and how much of the drug is present in breastmilk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*The age and maturity of the infant. [[Full term]] infants are better able to [[metabolize]] medications than [[premature infant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
*The weight of the infant.
*The amount and percentage of breastmilk consumed by the infant. An infant taking solid foods with breastfeeding will receive a lower dose of medication.
*The general health of the infant and the general health of the mother.
*The nature of the mother's illness, if present.
*The general information about the drug other literature documenting studies related to the drug and breastfeeding.
*The duration of the drug therapy.
*Is the drug short-acting? A short-acting form of the drug may be a better choice for a breastfeeding mother rather than a longer-acting form that stays in the mother's system for a longer period.
*How is the medication being given? 
*Does the drug interfere with lactation?&lt;ref name = leche/&gt;

== Lactation risk categories ==
Drugs can be categorised in one of five categories to determine how safe they are for breastfeeding:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medications and Mothers' Milk 2017|last=Hale|first=Thomas Wright|last2=Rowe|first2=Hilary E.|date=2016-12-30|publisher=Springer Publishing Co Inc|isbn=9780826128584|edition=17th|location=New York|language=English|id= {{ASIN|0826128580|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medsmilk.com/pages/reading|title=Medications and Mothers Milk Online|website=www.medsmilk.com|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medref.cmbc.bc.ca/drug-standards/lactation-drug-risk-categories/|title=Lactation Drug Risk Categories|last=|first=|date=|work=CMBC Medical Reference|access-date=2018-03-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aiVesab_2bwC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138|title=Breastfeeding and Human Lactation|last=Riordan|first=Jan|date=2005|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year=|isbn=9780763745851|location=|pages=138|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== L1 Compatible ===

"Drug which has been taken by a large number of breastfeeding mothers without any observed increase in adverse effects in the infant. Controlled studies in breastfeeding women fail to demonstrate a risk to the infant and the possibility of harm to the breastfeeding infant is remote; or the product is not orally bioavailable in an infant."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L2 Probably Compatible ===

"Drug which has been studied in a limited number of breastfeeding women without an increase in adverse effects in the infant. And/or, the evidence of a demonstrated risk which is likely to follow use of this medication in a breastfeeding woman is remote."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L3 Probably Compatible ===

"There are no controlled studies in breastfeeding women, however the risk of untoward effects to a breastfed infant is possible; or, controlled studies show only minimal non-threatening adverse effects. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant. (New medications that have absolutely no published data are automatically categorized in this category, regardless of how safe they may be.)"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L4 Possibly Hazardous ===

"There is positive evidence of risk to a breastfed infant or to breastmilk production, but the benefits of use in breastfeeding mothers may be acceptable despite the risk to the infant (e.g. if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective)."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L5 Hazardous ===

"Studies in breastfeeding mothers have demonstrated that there is significant and documented risk to the infant based on human experience, or it is a medication that has a high risk of causing significant damage to an infant. The risk of using the drug in breastfeeding women clearly outweighs any possible benefit from breastfeeding. The drug is contraindicated in women who are breastfeeding an infant."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Over the counter medications==
[[Over the counter medications]] are those medications that do not require a [[prescription drug|prescription]] to purchase in the US. Medications that require a prescription to purchase in the US may be available in other countries without a prescription. The following guidelines are recommended:

* taking oral medications after breastfeeding rather than before will allow some of the medication to leave the mother's body through her kidneys between nursings.
* in most women without kidney disease, [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s and [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) are used safely.
* [[aspirin]] can cause rashes and even cause bleeding in infants.
* limit the use of antihistamines for long periods of time. These anti-allergy medications can cause crying, sleep problems, fussiness, excessive sleepiness in babies. Antihistamines have an effect on the amount of milk the body produces and decrease the supply.
* carefully observe the infant for changes or side effects when first taking a medication to watch for side effects. Side effects indicating that the medication is having an affect on the baby is difficulty breathing, rash and other questionable changes that occurred after the medication was started by the mother.
* many times other young children are in the home and keeping these over the counter medications out of their reach is a safe practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familydoctor.org/otc-medicines-and-pregnancy/|title=OTC Medicines and Pregnancy - familydoctor.org|first=familydoctor.org editorial|last=staff|date=1 September 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other substances or chemicals have been evaluated regarding their safe use during pregnancy. Hair dye or solutions used for a 'permanent' do not pass to breastmilk. No adverse reports of using oral antihistamines and breastfeeding are found. Some of the older antihistamines used by a nursing mother can cause drowsiness in the infant. This may be a concern if the infant misses feedings by sleeping instead of nursing.&lt;ref name = uk&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk/detailed-information/drugs-in-breastmilk/drugs-faqs/|title= Drugs in Breastmilk -Is It Safe?|publisher= The Breasfeeding Network - Britains Nonprofit Breastfeeding Support Organization|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9540">The '''Demographic and Health Surveys''' (DHS) Program is responsible for collecting and disseminating accurate, nationally representative data on health and population in [[developing countries]]. The project is implemented by [[ICF International]] and is funded by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] ([[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]) with contributions from other donors such as [[Unicef|UNICEF]], [[UNFPA]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], and [[UNAIDS]].

The DHS is highly comparable to the [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys]] and the technical teams developing and supporting the surveys are in close collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF|url=http://www.unicef.org/statistics/index_24302.html|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since September 2013, ICF International has been partnering with seven internationally experienced organizations to expand access to and use of the DHS data: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Communication Programs; Program for Appropriate Technology in Health ([[Program for Appropriate Technology in Health|PATH]]); Avenir Health; Vysnova; Blue Raster; Kimetrica; and EnCompass.

==Overview==
Since 1984, The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program has provided technical assistance to more than 300 demographic and health surveys in over 90 countries. DHS surveys collect information on [[fertility]] and [[Total Fertility Rate|total fertility rate]] (TFR), [[Reproductive Health|reproductive health]], [[maternal health]], child health, [[immunization]] and [[child survival|survival]], [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]; [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]], [[child mortality]], [[malaria]], and nutrition among women and children [[stunted]]. The strategic objective of The DHS Program is to improve and institutionalize the collection and use of data by host countries for program monitoring and evaluation and for policy development decisions.

==Surveys==
The DHS Program supports the following data collection options:
 
* Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS): provide data for monitoring and impact evaluation indicators in the areas of population, health, and nutrition.
* AIDS Indicator Surveys (AIS): provide countries with a standardized tool to obtain indicators for the effective monitoring of national HIV/AIDS programs.
* Service Provision Assessment (SPA) Surveys: provide information about the characteristics of health and family planning services available in a country.
* Malaria Indicators Surveys (MIS): Provide data on bednet ownership and use, prevention of malaria during pregnancy, and prompt and effective treatment of fever in young children. In some cases, biomarker testing for malaria and anemia are also included.
* Key Indicators Survey (KIS): provide monitoring and evaluation data for population and health activities in small areas—regions, districts, catchment areas—that may be targeted by an individual project, although they can be used in nationally representative surveys as well.
* Other Quantitative Data: include Geographic Data Collection, and Benchmarking Surveys.
* [[Biomarker]] Collection: in conjunction with surveys, more than 2 million tests have been conducted for HIV, anemia, malaria, and more than 25 other biomarkers.
* Qualitative Research: provides information outside the purview of standard quantitative approaches.

==Data==
The DHS Program works to provide survey data for program managers, health care providers, policymakers, country leaders, researchers, members of the media, and others who can act to improve public health. The DHS Program distributes unrestricted survey data files for legitimate academic research at no cost.

Online databases include: STATcompiler, STATmapper, HIV/AIDS Survey Indicators Database, HIV Spatial Data Repository, HIVmapper, and Country QuickStats.

==Publications==
The DHS Program produces publications that provide country specific and comparative data on population, health, and nutrition in developing countries. Most publications are available online for download, but if an electronic version of the publication is not available, a hard copy may be available.

==Countries==
The DHS Program has been active in over 90 countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Central Asia]]; [[West Asia]]; and [[Southeast Asia]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]. A list of the publications for each country is available online at The DHS Program web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhsprogram.com/countries/ The DHS Program Country List]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special Focus Topics==

===HIV/AIDS===
Since 2001, The DHS Program has worked in over 15 countries in [[AIDS in Africa|Africa]], Asia and Latin America and Caribbean conducting population-based HIV testing. By collecting blood for HIV testing from representative samples of the population of men and women in a country, the DHS Program provides nationally representative estimates of HIV rates. The testing protocol provides for anonymous, informed, and voluntary testing of women and men.

The program also collects data on internationally recognized AIDS indicators. Currently, the main sources of HIV/AIDS indicators in the database are the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), the [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey]]s (MICS), the Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), the Sexual Behavior Surveys (SBS), and Behavioral Surveillance Surveys (BSS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhi.org/en/topics/bss.htm FHI.org BSS]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually it will cover all countries for which indicators are available. The project also collects data on the capacity of health care facilities to deliver HIV prevention and treatment services.

===Malaria===
Since 2000, DHS (and some AIS) surveys have collected data on ownership and use of mosquito nets, treatment of fever in children, and intermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women. In recent years, additional questions on indoor residual spraying, and biomarker testing for anemia and malaria have been conducted.This has however not changed the trend in malaria infections thereby calling for more interventions by researchers and scientists.

===Gender===
The DHS Program researches and trains for integrating gender into population, health and nutrition programs and HIV/AIDS-related activities in the developing world.

Questions on gender roles and empowerment are integrated into most DHS questionnaires. For countries interested in more in-depth data on gender, modules of questions are available on specific topics such as status of women, [[domestic violence]], and [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dhsprogram.com/What-We-Do/Survey-Types/DHS-Questionnaires.cfm DHS Questionnaire Modules]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth===
The DHS Program has interviewed thousands of young people and gathered information about their education, employment, media exposure, nutrition, sexual activity, fertility, unions, and general reproductive health, including HIV prevalence. 
The Youth Corner on the DHS website presents findings about youth and features profiles of young adults ages 15–24 from more than 30 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhsprogram.com/topics/youth/start.cfm The DHS Program Youth Topics]&lt;/ref&gt; The Youth Corner is part of the broader effort by the Interagency Youth Working Group (IYWG) to help program managers, donors, national and local governments, teachers, religious leaders, and nongovernmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) plan and implement programs to improve the reproductive health of young adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoforhealth.org/youthwg Interagency Youth Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographic information===
The DHS Program now analyzes the impact of geographic location using DHS data and [[geographic information systems]] (GIS). The DHS Program routinely collects geographic information in all surveyed countries. Using GIS, researchers can link DHS data with routine health data, health facility locations, local infrastructure such as roads and rivers, and environmental conditions.

===Biomarkers===
Using field-friendly technologies, the DHS Program is able to collect biomarker data relating to conditions and infections. DHS surveys have tested for [[anemia]] (by measuring [[hemoglobin]]), HIV infection, [[sexually transmitted diseases]] such as syphilis and the herpes simplex virus, serum retinol ([[Vitamin A]]), lead exposure, high blood pressure, and immunity from vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and tetanus. Traditionally, much of the data gathered in DHS surveys is self-reported. Biomarkers complement this information by providing an objective profile of a specific disease or health condition in a population. Biomarker data contributes to the understanding of behavioral risk factors and determinants of different illnesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8533">'''Dietary Reference Values''' (DRV) is the name of the nutritional requirements systems used by the [[United Kingdom]] [[Department of Health]] and the [[European Union]]'s [[European Food Safety Authority]].

In 1991, the [[United Kingdom]] [[Department of Health]] published the '''''Dietary Reference Values for Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom'''''. This records Dietary Reference Values which recommended nutritional intakes for the UK population. The DRVs can be divided into three types:&lt;ref&gt;Dietary Reference Values of Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom (Report on Health &amp; Social Subjects)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A comparison of dietary reference values for energy of different countries|last1=Hauber |first1=U |last2=Bruce |first2=A |last3=Neuhäuser-Berthold |first3=M |pmid=9467239|volume=36|journal=Z Ernahrungswiss|pages=394-402 |date=1997 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*RNI - Reference Nutrient Intake (95% of the population's requirement is met)
*EAR - Estimated Average Requirement (50% of the population's requirement is met)
*LRNI - Lower Recommended Nutritional Intake (5% of the population's requirement is met)

RNI is not the same as [[Dietary Reference Intake|RDA]] (Recommended Daily Allowance) or [[Guideline Daily Amount|GDA]], although they are often similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/nutritionscience/foodfacts/food-labelling-and-health-claims?start=2 |title=Food labelling and health claims |accessdate=31 January 2011 |publisher=British Nutrition Foundation }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current recommendations==

General advice is given for healthy people using the table. The government recommends that healthy people should eat a diet which contains plenty of starch (rice, bread, pasta and potatoes). It also recommends that a person should eat at least 5 fruit or vegetable portions each day. Meat, fish, eggs and other protein-rich foods should be eaten in moderation. Dairy products should also be moderately consumed. Finally, salt, saturated fat and sugar should be eaten least of all.

This advice is summarized in the '''[[eatwell guide]]'''&lt;ref name=eatwell&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-eatwell-guide | title=The Eatwell Guide | accessdate=30 July 2018 | publisher=Public Health England (part of UK government)}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Note that exceptions to these rules include pregnant women and young children. Additionally, those who have little exposure to sunlight may need to take vitamin D supplementation.

===Sources of energy===
The Dietary Reference Values below are specified mainly for adults. They define the proportion of a person's total energy intake which should come from different components of food. These include fat and fatty acids, fibre, starch and sugars. Note that these values do not apply to children, and children younger than five with small appetites should not have such restrictions imposed.&lt;ref name="nutguide"&gt;http://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/nutrientinstitution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Nutrient !! Population average % of food energy&lt;ref name="nutguide" /&gt;
|-
| Saturated Fatty Acid || Not more than 11%
|-
| Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid || 6.5%
|-
| Monounsaturated Fatty Acid || 13%
|-
| Trans fats || Not more than 2%
|-
| Total Fat || Not more than 35%
|-
| Non-milk extrinsic sugars || Not more than 11%
|-
| Intrinsic milk sugars and starch || 39%
|-
| Total Carbohydrate || 50%
|-
| Fibre as non-starch polysaccharide || 18% [not applicable to children under 5]
|-
|}

===Salt===

The guideline salt intake for adults is about 6 grams of salt (approximately one teaspoon). The Food Standards Agency estimate the average salt intake is about 8.6 grams/day &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/jul/sodiumrep08|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] Food Standards Agency - UK salt intake levels heading in the right direction|author=Food Standards Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2008). A high salt diet is likely to increase the risk of high blood pressure, which is associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Age !! Target salt intake (grams per day)&lt;ref name="nutguide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eatwell" /&gt;
|-
| 0–6 months || Less than 1g
|-
| 7–12 months || 1g
|-
| 1–3 years || 2g
|-
| 4–6 years || 3g
|-
| 7–10 years || 5g
|-
| 11 years+ || 6g
|-
|}

===Protein, vitamins and minerals===

Recommendations for protein, vitamins and minerals vary by age. Where different intakes for males and females are recommended, the higher value is identified in the table below to ensure that the greatest daily needs of the group is met: 

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Nutrient !! 1-3yrs !! 4-6yrs !! 7-10yrs !! 11-14yrs !! 15-18yrs !! Adults 19-50 yrs !! Adults 50+ 
|-
| Protein || 15g || 20g || 28g || 42g || 55g || 55g || 53g 
|-
| Iron || 7mg || 6mg || 9mg || 14.8mg || 14.8mg || 14.8mg || 9mg
|-
| Zinc || 5mg || 6.5mg || 7mg || 9mg || 9.5mg || 9.5mg || 9.5mg
|-
| Vitamin A (retinol equivalents) || 400mcg || 400mcg || 500mcg || 600mcg || 700mcg || 700mcg || 700mcg 
|-
| Folate || 70mcg || 100mcg || 150mcg || 200mcg || 200mcg || 200mcg || 200mcg 
|-
| Vitamin C || 30mg || 30mg || 30mg || 35mg || 40mg || 40mg || 40mg
|-
|}

==Extension to EU level==
{{update|date=July 2013}}
In recent times,{{When|date=June 2012}} '''Dietary Reference Values''' are under the interest of the [[European Food Safety Authority]] too, which intend to extend them at the EU level. EFSA is the equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, and acts as watchdog inside the European market in order to establish a common ground on food safety requirements and nutrition as well.

EFSA met in September 2009 with representative of the Member States in order to gain their views on fats, carbohydrates, fibres and water as well as Food-Based Dietary Guidelines.
Furthermore EFSA is searching for comments (Open Consultation) by 15 October, in order to validate its assumptions on the need to have:

* carbohydrates comprising 45%–60% of the overall daily caloric intake
* fats being comprised among 20%–35% of the overall caloric intake
* fibre needs: complying with 25 grams/day

EFSA considers that there are not sufficient data to set DRVs for sugars, and not systematic scientific substantiation linking diseases such as stroke or diabetes (DMT1 or DMT2) to an increased intake of sugars (glycemic load/glycemic index).
In any case, there is much literature referring to this link, on journals with very high impact factor and statistically robust design and results

Many problems seem nowadays to derive from having integrated EU level DRV:
* the presence of a previous EFSA opinion on Food Based Dietary Guidelines, aimed at stressing the need of having only country-based guidelines, against the WHO hypothesis. This is due to very different food patterns, for EFSA, inside Europe.
* the presence of private scheme such as GDA (Guidelines on Daily Amounts), referring on the same subject (calories from nutrient groups) but casting shadow on the effectiveness of DRVs as public authorities' scheme.

'''Emotional and behavioral disorders''' ('''EBD'''; also known as '''behavioural and emotional disorders''' ([[ICD-10]]);&lt;ref name="ICD-10-web-EN"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F90 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10): Behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90–F98) |date=2016 |access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICD-10-Clinical"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders. Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines |place=[[Geneva]] |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''emotional disturbance''' or '''serious emotional disturbance''') refer to a disability classification used in educational settings that allows educational institutions to provide [[special education]] and related services to students that have poor social or academic adjustment that cannot be better explained by biological abnormalities or a [[developmental disability]]. 

The classification is often given to students, after conducting a Functional Behavior Analysis. These students need individualized [[classroom management|behavior supports]] such as a Behavior Intervention Plan, to receive a [[free and appropriate public education]]. They would not be eligible for an [[individualized education program]] under another disability category of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA).

==Criteria==
The IDEA requires that a student must exhibit one or more of the following characteristics over a long duration, and to a marked degree that adversely affects their educational performance, to receive an EBD classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/categories/|title=Categories of Disability Under IDEA|work=parentcenterhub.org|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Difficulty to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors.
* Difficulty to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers.
* Inappropriate types of behavior (acting out against self or others) or feelings (expresses the need to harm self or others, low self-worth, etc.) under normal circumstances.
* A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.
* A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems.

The term "EBD" includes students diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], but does not apply to students who are "socially maladjusted", unless it is determined that they also meet the criteria for an EBD classification.

===Criticisms===
Providing or failing to provide an EBD classification to a student may be controversial, as the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] does not clarify which children would be considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an [[individualized education program]] under an EBD classification. Some states do not allow students with a psychiatric diagnosis of [[conduct disorder]] to receive additional educational services under an EBD classification,&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp/ |title=Students with Emotional Disturbance: Eligibility and Characteristics |work=cecp.air.org |accessdate=22 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115029/http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although many students with an EBD classification do meet the diagnostic criteria for various [[disruptive behavior disorder]]s, including [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), or [[conduct disorder]] (CD).&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Additionally, students considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an EBD classification (i.e., students diagnosed with [[conduct disorder]]), often receive better educational services in special education classrooms or alternative schools with high structure, clear rules, and consistent consequences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavior-consultant.com/social.htm|title=Social Maladjustment|work=behavior-consultant.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they would not receive in general education settings. The ambiguous guidelines for determining what students are "socially maladjusted", but without EBD, may cause many students that would benefit from special education services to receive less effective educational services.

==Student characteristics==
Students with EBD are a diverse population, and have a wide range of intellectual and academic abilities. Males, African-Americans, and economically disadvantaged students are overrepresented in the EBD population, and students with EBD are more likely to live in single-parent homes, foster homes, or other non-traditional living situations.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; They also tend to have low rates of positive social interactions with students and peers in instructional contexts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehby|first1=Joseph|last2=Symons|first2=F.|last3=Shores|first3=R. E.|title=A descriptive analysis of aggressive behavior in classrooms for children with emotional and behavioral disorders|journal=Behavioral Disorders|date=1995|volume=20|pages=87–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Students with EBD are often categorized as [[internalizing disorder|"internalizers"]] (e.g., have poor [[self-esteem]], or are diagnosed with an [[anxiety disorder]] or [[mood disorder]]) or [[Emotional and behavioral disorders#Internalizing and externalizing behavior|"externalizers"]] (e.g., disrupt classroom instruction, or are diagnosed with [[disruptive behavior disorders]] such as [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]]). Male students may be overrepresented in the EBD population because they tend to exhibit disruptive externalizing behavior that interferes with classroom instruction, whereas females more commonly exhibit internalizing behavior that does not interfere with classroom instruction;&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; thus, teachers may refer males for special education services more often than females. Students with EBD are also at an increased risk for [[learning disabilities]], [[school dropout]], [[substance abuse]], and [[juvenile delinquency]].&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

==Internalizing and externalizing behavior==
A person with EBD with [[internalizing disorder|"internalizing" behavior]] may have poor [[self-esteem]], suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]], experience [[anhedonia|loss of interest]] in social, academic, and other life activities, and may exhibit [[non-suicidal self-injury]] or [[substance abuse]]. Students with internalizing behavior may also have a diagnosis of [[separation anxiety]] or another [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[specific phobia|specific]] or [[social phobia]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[panic disorder]], and/or an [[eating disorder]]. Some research suggests students with EBD with internalizing behavior are underdiagnosed; teachers are more likely to write referrals for students that are overtly disruptive, and screening tools to detect students with high levels of internalizing behavior are not sensitive and are rarely used in practice.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

Students with EBD with "[[Externalizing Disorders|externalizing]]" behavior may be aggressive, noncompliant, extroverted, or disruptive, and generally "act out" inappropriately. Students with EBD that show externalizing behavior are often diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]], and/or [[bipolar disorder]]; however, this population can also include typically developing children that have [[operant conditioning|learned]] to exhibit externalizing behavior for various reasons (e.g., [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|escape from academic demands]] or [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|access to attention]]). These students often have difficulty inhibiting emotional responses resulting from anger, frustration, and disappointment, and may exhibit behaviors such as insulting, provoking, threatening, bullying, cursing, and fighting, along with other forms of aggression; noncompliance with and disrespect towards teachers and other authority figures is also common. Male students with EBD exhibit externalizing behavior more often than their female counterparts.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

An '''enterprise master patient index''' or '''enterprise-wide master patient index''' (EMPI) is a patient database used by healthcare organizations to maintain accurate medical data across its various departments. Patients are assigned a unique identifier, so they are represented only once across all the organization's systems.&lt;ref&gt;Enterprise Master Patient Index. URL: http://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/master-patient-index-MPI . Accessed 2012-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Patient data can include name; gender; date of birth; race and ethnicity; social security number; current address and contact information; insurance information; current diagnoses; and most recent date of hospital admission and discharge (if applicable).

EMPIs are intended to ensure patient data is correct and consistent throughout the organization regardless of which system is being updated. Non-healthcare organizations also face similar issues maintaining customer records across different departments.

Many software vendors use EMPI and '''MPI''' ('''master patient index''') synonymously, because an MPI is only workable if it is used by all software applications across an entire enterprise; that is, "master" implies enterprise-wide scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.infocomhealthsystems.com/master-patient-index.asp |title=iREACH {{!}} Enterprise Master Patient Index by Infocom System |access-date= 2006-10-31 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061020203328/http://www.infocomhealthsystems.com/master-patient-index.asp |archive-date= 2006-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
In [[computing]], an enterprise[-wide] master patient index is a form of [[customer data integration]] (CDI) specific to the [[healthcare industry]].  Healthcare organizations and groups use EMPI to identify, match, merge, de-duplicate, and cleanse patient records to create a master index that may be used to obtain a complete and single view of a patient.  The EMPI will create a unique identifier for each patient and maintain a mapping to the identifiers used in each records' respective system.

An EMPI will typically provide an [[Application Programming Interface]] (API) for searching and querying the index to find patients and the pointers to their identifiers and records in the respective systems. It may also store some subset of the attributes for the patient so that it may be queried as an authoritative source of the "single most accurate record" or "source of truth" for the patient.  Registration or other practice management applications may interact with the index when admitting new patients to have the single best record from the start, or may have the records indexed at a later time.

An EMPI may additionally work with or include [[enterprise application integration]] (EAI) capabilities to update the originating source systems of the patient records with the cleansed and authoritative data.

Even the best tuned EMPI will not be 100% accurate.  Thus an EMPI will provide a data stewardship interface for reviewing the match engine results, handling records for which the engine does not definitively determine a match or not.  This interface will provide for performing search, merge, unmerge, edit and numerous other operations.  This interface may also be used to monitor the performance of the match engine and perform periodic audits on the quality of the data.

EMPI can be used by organizations such as hospitals, medical centers, outpatient clinics, physician offices and rehabilitation facilities.

===Match engine===
A key component of an EMPI is the match engine, the method by which different records can be identified as being for the same patient.{{cn|date=January 2018}} A match engine may be deterministic, probabilistic, or naturalistic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/20070118/1071712-1.html Probabilistic Versus Deterministic Data Matching: Making an Accurate Decision]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jhi.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/10/01/1460458215607080.abstract A naturalistic patient matching algorithm: Derivation and validation]&lt;/ref&gt; The match engine must be configured and tuned for each implementation to minimize false matches and unmatches.  The accuracy and performance of the match engine are a big factor in determining the value and ROI for an EMPI solution.

The attributes a match engine is configured to use can typically include name, date of birth, sex, social security number, and address.  The match engine must be able to give consideration to data challenges such as typos, misspellings, transpositions and aliases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nextgatesolutions.com/blog/2010/07/match-engine-theory-and-configuration/ |title=Match Engine Theory and Configuration |access-date=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714180026/http://www.nextgatesolutions.com/blog/2010/07/match-engine-theory-and-configuration/ |archive-date=2011-07-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key benefits ==

Correctly matching patient records from disparate systems and different organizations provides a more complete view of a patient.  Additional benefits include:
* Better patient care can be provided.
* Improved customer service can be offered.
* In emergency or other critical care situations, medical staff can be more confident that they know medical conditions or other information that would be critical to providing proper care.
* Historical care related information can be obtained from across organizations.

== Vendors ==
&lt;!--There are many vendors in this space.  Please do not add any external links, per [[WP:EL]].  If the company has a Wikipedia article, please link to that.  If the company has media coverage of its MEPI product line in a reliable source but doesn't have an article yet, please feel free to list the company, and cite the source.  If you plan to write an article for any of the unlinked companies, you can wiki-link but it will be red linked until the article is complete. These unofficial guidelines can be discussed on the talk page.--&gt;
Numerous companies provide EMPI products.  Some are pure-play providers and others provide EMPI offerings as part of a broader MDM or integration solution. In addition there are healthcare industry specific MPI providers which offer commercially supported versions.

The '''fetal head''', from an obstetrical viewpoint, and in particular its size, is important because an essential feature of labor is the adaptation between the fetal head and the maternal bony [[pelvis]]. Only a comparatively small part of the head at term is represented by the face. The rest of the head is composed of the firm skull, which is made up of two frontal, two parietal, and two [[temporal bone]]s, along with the upper portion of the occipital bone and the wings of the [[sphenoid bone|sphenoid]]. 

These bones are separated by membranous spaces, or sutures. The most important sutures are the frontal, between the two frontal bones; the [[sagittal]], between the two parietal bones; the two coronal, between the frontal and parietal bones; and the two [[lambdoid]], between the posterior margins of the [[parietal bone]]s and upper margin of the [[occipital bone]]. Where several sutures meet, an irregular space forms, which is enclosed by a membrane and designated as a fontanel. The greater, or anterior fontanel, is a lozenge-shaped space that is situated at the junction of the [[sagittal]] and the coronal sutures. The lesser, or posterior fontanel, is represented by a small triangular area at the intersection of the [[sagittal]] and [[lambdoid]] sutures. The localization of these fontanels gives important information concerning the presentation and position of the fetus. The temporal, or casserian fontanels, have no diagnostic 

It is customary to measure certain critical diameters and circumferences of the newborn head. The diameters most frequently used, and the average lengths thereof, are:
#The [[occipitofrontal circumference|occipitofrontal]] (11.5&amp;nbsp;cm), which follows a line extending from a point just above the root of the nose to the most prominent portion of the occipital bone.
#The [[Parietal bone|biparietal]] (9.5&amp;nbsp;cm), the greatest transverse diameter of the head, which extends from one parietal boss to the other.
#The bitemporal (8.0&amp;nbsp;cm), the greatest distance between the two temporal sutures.
#The occipitomental (12.5&amp;nbsp;cm), from the chin to the most prominent portion of the [[occiput]].
#The suboccipitobregmatic (9.5&amp;nbsp;cm), which follows a line drawn from the middle of the large fontanel to the undersurface of the occipital bone just where it joins the neck.

The greatest circumference of the head, which corresponds to the plane of the [[occipitofrontal circumference|occipitofrontal]] diameter, averages 34.5&amp;nbsp;cm, a size too large to fit through the pelvis without flexion. The smallest circumference, corresponding to the plane of the suboccipitobregmatic diameter, is 32&amp;nbsp;cm. The bones of the cranium are normally connected only by a thin layer of fibrous
tissue that allows considerable shifting or sliding of each bone to accommodate the size and shape of the maternal pelvis. This intrapartum process is termed molding. The head position and degree of skull ossification result in a spectrum of cranial plasticity from minimal to great and, in some  Cases, undoubtedly contribute to fetopelvic disproportion, a leading indication for cesarean delivery.

The '''Freedom Fund''' is an international non-profit organisation dedicated to identifying and investing in the most effective frontline efforts to end slavery.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;&lt;ref name="Omidyar Forbes"/&gt; In 2017, the [[International Labour Organization]] reported that on any given day in 2016, there were 40 million people living in modern slavery worldwide across a wide range of industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alliance87.org/2017ge/modernslavery#!section=0|title=2017 Global Estimates of Modern Slavery and Child Labour|last=FFunction|website=2017 Global Estimates of Modern Slavery and Child Labour|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freedom Fund was founded in September 2013, by three leading anti-slavery donors, [https://humanityunited.org/ Humanity United], the [[Legatum|Legatum Foundation]] and the [[Walk Free Foundation]]&lt;ref name="Market Watch"/&gt; and officially announced by President [[Bill Clinton]] at the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] on September 26, 2013 where he declared "this is a huge deal and we should all support this."&lt;ref name="Clinton Foundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Our Story"/&gt;

==Freedom Fund’s Mission and Values==

The Freedom Fund has set a target of raising USD $100million by 2020 and investing it to bring about much needed strategic focus to the fight against modern slavery.&lt;ref&gt;http://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/68/66&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this, The Freedom Fund has focused its activities on three main areas:&lt;ref&gt;http://freedomfund.org/programs/our-approach/&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Hotspot projects''' – The Freedom Fund partners with frontline organisations to directly combat slavery in defined regions with a high concentration of slavery .&lt;ref name = ihrfg/&gt; They do this by setting up "hotspot" projects - clusters of the most effective community-based organisations in these regions. Partnering with these organisations in some of the world's poorest and most marginalised communities is difficult, demanding and time intensive, but it is also one of the most effective ways to achieve large scale and sustainable change. The Freedom Fund's northern India hotspot has been in place since 2014, and as of December 2017, had [http://freedomfund.org/impact/hotspot-impact/northern-india/ liberated over 11,000 people] from modern slavery.&lt;ref name="The Economist one brick at a time"/&gt; The Freedom Fund's hotspots are located in [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/central-nepal-hotspot/ central Nepal], [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/ethiopia-hotspot/ Ethiopia], [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/northern-india-hotspot/ northern India], [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/south-eastern-nepal-hotspot/ south-eastern Nepal], [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/southern-india-hotspot/ southern India] and [http://freedomfund.org/programs/hotspot-projects/thailand-hotspot/ Thailand].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/lifestyle/modern-slavery-britain/11109547/suburbia-domestic-slaves.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Global initiatives''' - The Freedom Fund tackles underlying systems that allow slavery to persist. They do this in their hotspots, engaging the government, private sector, media, social movements, and other key drivers of change. They also do it by catalysing action on selected global issues and industries that have a direct link to their hotspots. This allows the Freedom Fund to tackle systemic issues like slavery in fishing, migration, or to help develop new technological tools or legal initiatives.&lt;ref name="Thomson Reuters Foundation"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grono|first1=Nick|title=Using the law to defeat modern slavery|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20150224192144-q3sgb/?source=search|accessdate=2 April 2015|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation|date=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the Freedom Fund and C&amp;A Foundation announced a partnership to tackle forced labour in the textile industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=C&amp;A Foundation Launches New Partnership Strategy to Address Fight Bonded Labour in Apparel Industry|url=http://textilesupdate.com/ca-foundation-launches-new-partnership-strategy-to-address-fight-bonded-labour-in-apparel-industry|accessdate=2 April 2015|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
:'''Movement building initiatives''' - The Freedom Fund helps to build and empower a global anti-slavery movement, providing the platforms, tools and knowledge for organisations to connect and work together more effectively.&lt;ref name="Freedom Fund" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/69/67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
{{main|Nick Grono}}

The Freedom Fund's inaugural CEO, [[Nick Grono]], has written articles on modern slavery for the ''[[Huffington Post]]'',&lt;ref name = "Grono Huffpo 1"/&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'',&lt;ref name="Grono Newsweek 1"/&gt; and ''[[The Guardian]]'' &lt;ref name = "Guardian Econ case"/&gt; as well as contributed to the Freedom Fund blog.&lt;ref name = "Freedom Blog"/&gt; Grono previously served as Deputy President and COO of the Brussels-based [[International Crisis Group]]&lt;ref name="Legatum" /&gt; and as CEO of the [[Walk Free Foundation]], an international anti-slavery organisation. During his tenure, the Walk Free Foundation built a global anti-slavery movement with over five million supporters and launched the first ever [[Global Slavery Index]].&lt;ref name="Slavery Index"/&gt; Grono joined Freedom Fund in December 2013.&lt;ref name=Legatum/&gt;

==Impact==
In keeping with the Freedom Fund’s investment roots, they take their role in evaluating impact very seriously.&lt;ref&gt;http://freedomfund.org/impact/monitoring-and-evaluation/&lt;/ref&gt; They direct resources to anti-slavery initiatives across the world where they can make the biggest difference, measure what works, learn from unexpected results, and share knowledge.

As of December 2017 the Freedom Fund had:&lt;ref&gt;http://freedomfund.org/impact/global-metrics/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Oncology''' (GO) is an [[United States|American]] academic community-based healthcare organization. The organization was established at [[Harvard University]] in 2012.

== Background ==
Global Oncology was founded in 2012, by Ami S. Bhatt and Franklin W. Huang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/profile/person/54250 |title=Ami Bhatt &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst Profiles &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst |publisher=Connects.catalyst.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/profiles/profile/person/44526 |title=Franklin Huang &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst Profiles &amp;#124; Harvard Catalyst |publisher=Connects.catalyst.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is composed of physicians, staff, students, and members of the oncology community and other skilled professional volunteers. The mission of the organization is to improve cancer care and research in resource-limited settings through a variety of programs and efforts, including the development of training and research opportunities in global oncology. The organization supports the efforts of other leading organizations working in global oncology and cancer care including the [[Global Task Force on Expanded Access to Cancer Care and Control in Developing Countries]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The steering committee that advises the organization is composed of academic and faculty experts in cancer care and oncology drawn from Harvard-affiliated institutions and hospitals, including [[Harvard medical school|Harvard Medical School]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Children's Hospital Boston]], [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]], and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

== Programming ==
A primary effort of GO has been the creation of the GO! Talks, a unique bi-monthly Global Oncology seminar series that seeks to educate the larger community on global oncology issues and catalyze collaborations in the field. Speakers to date have included [[Paul Farmer]] and Eric Krakauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/ftcc/2012/10/22/paul-farmer-lecture-on-global-oncology-111-at-dana-farber/ |title=Paul Farmer Lecture on Global Oncology 11/1/12 at Dana-Farber » Center for Future Technologies in Cancer Care &amp;#124; Blog Archive &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Global Oncology  developed a first-of-its-kind Global Cancer Project Map that launched in 2015 as a resource for the global cancer community to identify projects and needs in global cancer work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2015/03/global-cancer-project-map-stanford-global-oncology.html?page=all |title='Cancer map' looks for global matches for research, care |publisher=San Francisco Business Times |date=2015-03-25 |accessdate=2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7518">The '''Global Polio Eradication Initiative''' is an initiative created in 1988, just after the [[World Health Assembly]] resolved to [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradicate the disease poliomyelitis]] by the year 2000. It was described by the [[World Health Organization]] as the largest public health initiative in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hale/Held|first1=Thomas/David|title=The Handbook of Transnational Governance: Institutions and Innovations|publisher=Polity press|isbn=978-0-7456-5060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
The strategy for the eradication of polio rests on immunizing every at risk child until there is no one left for the disease to transmit to and the disease eventually dies out. The Initiative is spearheaded by the following Organizations:

*WHO ([[World Health Organization]]) who are responsible for planning, technical direction, surveillance and eradication certification. 
*[[Rotary International]] whose responsibilities include fundraising, advocacy, and volunteer recruitment.
* The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] who are in charge of deploying scientists and public health experts to WHO and [[UNICEF]].
* [[UNICEF]] is in charge of the distribution of the vaccine and helping countries develop communication and awareness strategies.
* [[The Gates Foundation]] as well provided a large portion of the funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unicef's Engagement in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative|url=http://www.unicef.org/partners/files/Partnership_profile_2012_Polio_revised.pdf|website=Unicef.org|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key tactics used by the GPEI include strengthening childhood immunization through oral vaccines, conducting surveillance 
through investigation of [[acute flaccid paralysis]] cases among children under 15 years old (in order to determine areas where the virus is truly eradicated), and conducting "mop up" campaigns in areas where cases of polio have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wassilak/Orenstein|first1=Steven/Walter|title=Challenges faced by the global polio eradication initiative|journal=Expert Review of Vaccines|date=2010|doi=10.1586/erv.10.45|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1586/erv.10.45|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
By 2012 the GPEI had raised 9 billion dollars in funding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Impact of Polio Eradication on Strengthening (Routine Immunization and Primary Health Care|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/polio_eradication_impacts_study/files/2012/12/Fact-Sheet-Polio-Eradication-Impacts-Study.pdf|publisher=Middlebury College|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in alone 2011 the GPEI received a 1.1 billion dollars, for a budget of 0.98 billion dollars. 30% of their funding came from the [[Gates Foundation]] 30% from developed governments, 27% from countries at risk of polio, and the rest was made up of donations from non profits, private funders, and other foundations. It is likely that the GPEI will become almost entirely funded by private organizations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaccination funding landscape|url=http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/vaccination-organizations#Eradicationinitiatives|website=Givewell.org|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
In 1995 a Global Certification Commission was created to oversee the certification of the eradication of wild-type poliovirus transmissions. Certification for the six WHO regions requires all of the countries in that region to be certified by the commission. By the year 2000 both the regions of the Western Pacific and the Americas met the criteria to be certified free of polio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Technical Consultative Group to the World Health Organization on the Global Eradication of Poliomyelitis|title="Endgame" Issues for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=2002|volume=34|pages=72–77|doi=10.1086/338262|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/72.abstract|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 the initial number of estimated cases in 1988 of 350,000 across 125 endemic countries has dropped to 650 confirmed cases. In addition the 3 of the six WHO regions are now certified polio eradicated (Europe, the Americas, The West Pacific). [[India]], which many thought would face the greatest challenge to eradication was removed from the list of endemic countries. According to the most recent study by the GPEI, in 2016, there are only three countries still listed as endemic, [[Nigeria]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Monitoring|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx|website=Global Polio Eradication Initiative|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is owing to this dramatic reduction that the funding for the GPEI will likely soon come entirely from private donors and foundations such as the [[Gates Foundation]] instead of from individual countries. In fact [[Bill Gates]] has listed polio eradication as one of his "Top Personal Priorities".

A 2011 study by [[Middlebury College]] (commissioned by the [[Gates Foundation]]) indicated a list recommendations for how the GPEI should operate moving forward:

*  Include surveillance for other diseases in AFP (polio) surveillance systems
* Use integrated campaigns to reach marginalized populations
* Standardize and compile polio’s maps of marginalized populations to provide them with additional services
* Fund routine immunization in locations with frequent polio campaigns
* Build staff capacity in a variety of areas beyond polio
* Share pertinent information gathered during polio campaigns with other health programs
* Add questions on key health indicators of interest to post campaign monitoring
* Communicate to workers why repeated campaigns are necessary in high intensity areas
* Raise monetary incentives for campaign workers to a living wage or eliminate them entirely
* Conduct cross planning sessions to determine how programs and services can be integrated to reduce workforce burden without compromising programmatic objectives
* Conduct polio campaigns only where and when they are necessary
*  Mitigate the most serious effects of service interruption with strategic planning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Impact of Polio Eradication on Strengthening (Routine Immunization and Primary Health Care|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/polio_eradication_impacts_study/files/2012/12/Fact-Sheet-Polio-Eradication-Impacts-Study.pdf|publisher=Middlebury College|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endgame==
The final steps of polio eradication for the GPEI, or what is known as the "endgame" are as follows:
#  Detect and interrupt all poliovirus transmissions
# Strengthen immunization systems and withdraw oral polio vaccine
#  Contain poliovirus and certify interruption of transmission
# Ensure the remaining investments made to eradicate polio go to the greater cause of improving global health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013–2018|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/resourcelibrary/strategyandwork.aspx|website=Polio Eradication Initiative|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}

'''Healing''' is the process of the restoration of [[health]] from an unbalanced, diseased or damaged organism. The result of healing can be a cure to a health challenge, but one can heal without being cured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samueliinstitute.org/File%20Library/About%20Us/Samueli-Institute-Strategic-Plan.pdf|title=Building the Science of Healing|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession of nursing has been traditionally concerned with matters of healing, whereas historically the profession of medicine has been concerned with curing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McElligott|first=D|date=2010|title=Healing: The journey from concept to nursing practice|journal=Journal of Holistic Nursing|volume=28 | issue = 4 |pages=251–9|via=|pmid=20660908|doi=10.1177/0898010110376321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With physical damage or disease suffered by an organism, healing involves the repair of living [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and the [[biological system]] as a whole and resumption of normal functioning. It is the process by which the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[Human body|body]] regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or [[necrosis|necrotic]] area and replace it with new living tissue. The replacement can happen in two ways: by ''regeneration'' in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form similar tissue as was originally there; or by ''repair'' in which injured tissue is replaced with [[scar|scar tissue]]. Most [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms.

It is also referred to in the context of the grieving process.

In [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]], healing is the process by which [[neuroses]] and [[psychoses]] are resolved to the degree that the client is able to lead a normal or fulfilling existence without being overwhelmed by [[Psychopathology|psychopathological]] phenomena. This process may involve [[psychotherapy]], [[pharmaceutical]] treatment or [[alternative medicine|alternative]] approaches such as [[Holistic health|traditional spiritual healing]].

==Regeneration==
In order for an [[injury]] to be healed by regeneration, the cell type that was destroyed must be able to replicate. Cells also need a [[collagen]] framework along which to grow. Alongside most cells there is either a [[basement membrane]] or a [[extracellular matrix|collagenous network]] made by [[fibroblast]]s that will guide the cells' growth.  Since [[ischaemia]] and most [[toxin]]s do not destroy collagen, it will continue to exist even when the cells around it are dead.

===Example===
[[Acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN) in the [[kidney]] is a case in which cells heal completely by regeneration. ATN occurs when the [[epithelial cell]]s that line the kidney are destroyed by either a lack of [[oxygen]] (such as in [[hypovolemic shock]], when blood supply to the kidneys is dramatically reduced), or by toxins (such as some [[antibiotic]]s, [[heavy metals]] or [[carbon tetrachloride]]).

Although many of these epithelial cells are dead, there is typically patchy necrosis, meaning that there are patches of epithelial cells still alive. In addition, the collagen framework of the tubules remains completely intact.

The existing epithelial cells can replicate, and, using the basement membrane as a guide, eventually bring the kidney back to normal. After regeneration is complete, the damage is undetectable, even [[Microscope|microscopically]].

Healing must happen by repair in the case of injury to cells that are unable to regenerate (e.g. neurons). Also, damage to the collagen network (e.g. by [[enzyme]]s or physical destruction), or its total collapse (as can happen in an [[infarct]]) cause healing to take place by repair.

==Genetics==
Many genes play a role in healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=21719 | pmid=9751744 | volume=95 | title=Genetic analysis of a mammalian wound-healing trait | author=McBrearty BA, Clark LD, Zhang XM, Blankenhorn EP, Heber-Katz E | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=11792–7 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.20.11792}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in wound healing, P21 has been found to allow mammals to heal spontaneously. It even allows some mammals (like mice) to heal wounds without scars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/mar/15/mice-genetics-p21-heal-no-scar Genetic discovery promises healing without scars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/107/13/5845.abstract Lack of p21 expression links cell cycle control and appendage regeneration in mice]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LIN28]] gene also plays a role in wound healing. It is dormant in most mammals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-limb-regeneration-ins/ New Limb Regeneration Insight Surprises Scientists]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the proteins [[MG53]] and [[TGF beta 1]] play important roles in wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160302135149.htm Gene identified that helps wound healing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wound healing==
{{main | Wound healing}}

In response to an incision or wound, a [[Wound healing|wound healing cascade]] is unleashed.  This cascade takes place in four phases: clot formation, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation.

===Clotting phase===
Healing of a wound begins with [[clot]] formation to stop bleeding and to reduce infection by bacteria, [[virus]]es and [[fungi]]. Clotting is followed by [[neutrophil]] invasion three to 24 hours after the wound has been incurred, with [[mitosis|mitoses]] beginning in [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells after 24 to 48 hours .{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Inflammation phase===
In the inflammatory phase, [[macrophage]]s and other [[phagocytosis|phagocytic]] cells kill bacteria, debride damaged tissue and release chemical factors such as [[growth hormone]]s that encourage fibroblasts, [[epithelial cell]]s and endothelial cells which make new [[capillary|capillaries]] to migrate to the area and divide.

===Proliferative phase===
In the proliferative phase, immature [[granulation tissue]] containing plump, active fibroblasts forms. Fibroblasts quickly produce abundant type III [[collagen]], which fills the defect left by an open wound. Granulation tissue moves, as a wave, from the border of the injury towards the center.

As granulation tissue matures, the fibroblasts produce less collagen and become more spindly in appearance. They begin to produce the much stronger type I collagen. Some of the fibroblasts mature into myofibroblasts which contain the same type of [[actin]] found in [[smooth muscle]], which enables them to contract and reduce the size of the wound.

===Maturation phase===
During the maturation phase of wound healing, unnecessary vessels formed in granulation tissue are removed by [[apoptosis]], and type III collagen is largely replaced by type I. Collagen which was originally disorganized is cross-linked and aligned along tension lines. This phase can last a year or longer. Ultimately a scar made of collagen, containing a small number of fibroblasts is left.

== Tissue damaged by inflammation ==
After inflammation has damaged tissue (when combatting bacterial infection for example) and pro-inflammatory [[eicosanoid]]s have completed their function, healing proceeds in 4 phases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Anti-Inflammation Zone'', Barry Sears, pages 230-233, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recall phase===
In the recall phase the [[adrenal gland]]s increase production of [[cortisol]] which shuts down eicosanoid production and inflammation.

===Resolution phase===
In the Resolution phase, pathogens and damaged tissue are removed by [[macrophage]]s (white blood cells). Red blood cells are also removed from the damaged tissue by macrophages. Failure to remove all of the damaged cells and pathogens may retrigger inflammation. The two subsets of macrophage M1 &amp; M2 plays a crucial role in this phase, M1 macrophage being a pro inflammatory while as M2 is a regenerative and the plasticity between the two subsets determine the tissue inflammation or repair.

===Regeneration phase===
In the Regeneration phase, blood vessels are repaired and new cells form in the damaged site similar to the cells that were damaged and removed.  Some cells such as neurons and muscle cells (especially in the heart) are slow to recover.

===Repair phase===
In the Repair phase, new tissue is generated which requires a balance of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids.  Anti-inflammatory eicosanoids include [[lipoxin]]s, [[epi-lipoxin]]s, and [[resolvin]]s, which cause release of growth hormones.

'''Health economics''' is a branch of [[economics]] concerned with issues related to efficiency, effectiveness, value and behavior in the production and consumption of [[health]] and [[healthcare]].  In broad terms, health economists study the functioning of healthcare systems and health-affecting behaviors such as smoking.

A seminal 1963 article by [[Kenneth Arrow]], often credited with giving rise to health economics as a discipline, drew conceptual distinctions between health and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrow|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Factors that distinguish health economics from other areas include extensive [[government intervention]], intractable [[uncertainty]] in several dimensions, [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]], [[barriers to entry]],  [[Externality|externalities]] and the presence of a third-party agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Phelps |first=Charles E. |year=2003 |title=Health Economics |edition=3rd |publisher=Addison Wesley |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-321-06898-9 }} [http://www.lavoisier.fr/notice/frLWOS6SXAORW32O.html Description] and  2nd ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JajjFgTXwP8C&amp;pg=PT18 preview].&lt;/ref&gt;  In healthcare, the third-party agent is the physician, who makes purchasing decisions (e.g., whether to order a lab test, prescribe a medication, perform a surgery, etc.) while being insulated from the price of the product or service.

Health economists evaluate multiple types of financial information: costs, charges and expenditures.

Uncertainty is intrinsic to health, both in patient outcomes and financial concerns. The knowledge gap that exists between a physician and a patient creates a situation of distinct advantage for the physician, which is called ''asymmetric information''.

Externalities arise frequently when considering health and health care, notably in the context of infectious disease. For example, making an effort to avoid catching the [[common cold]] affects people other than the decision maker.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, Victor R. (1987).

==Scope==
The scope of health economics is neatly encapsulated by [[Alan Williams (economist)|Alan Williams]]' "[[plumbing diagram]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Williams |first=A. |year=1987 |chapter=Health economics: the cheerful face of a dismal science |editor-last=Williams |editor-first=A. |title=Health and Economics |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; dividing the discipline into eight distinct topics:
* What influences health? (other than healthcare)
* What is health and what is its value?
* The [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for healthcare
* The [[Supply (economics)|supply]] of healthcare
* [[Micro-economic]] evaluation at [[therapy|treatment]] level
* [[Market equilibrium]]
* Evaluation at whole system level
* Planning, [[budgeting]] and monitoring mechanisms.

==Healthcare demand==
The demand for healthcare is a [[derived demand]] from the demand for health. Healthcare is demanded as a means for consumers to achieve a larger stock of "health capital." The demand for health is unlike most other goods because individuals allocate resources in order to both consume and produce health.

The above description gives three roles of persons in health economics. The World Health Report (p.&amp;nbsp;52) states that people take four roles in the healthcare:
# Contributors
# Citizens
# Provider
# Consumers

[[Michael Grossman (economist)|Michael Grossman]]'s 1972 [[Grossman model of health demand|model of health production]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Grossman |first=Michael |title=On the Concept of Health Capital and the Demand for Health |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |year=1972 |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=223–55 |doi=10.1086/259880 |citeseerx=10.1.1.604.7202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been extremely influential in this field of study and has several unique elements that make it notable.  Grossman's model views each individual as both a producer and a consumer of health.  Health is treated as a stock which degrades over time in the absence of "investments" in health, so that health is viewed as a sort of [[Social capital|capital]]. The model acknowledges that health is both a [[Good (economics)|consumption good]] that yields direct satisfaction and [[utility]], and an [[investment good]], which yields satisfaction to consumers indirectly through fewer sick days. Investment in health is costly as consumers must trade off time and resources devoted to health, such as exercising at a local gym, against other goals. These factors are used to determine the optimal level of health that an individual will demand. The model makes predictions over the effects of changes in prices of healthcare and other goods, labour market outcomes such as employment and wages, and technological changes. These predictions and other predictions from models extending Grossman's 1972 paper form the basis of much of the econometric research conducted by health economists.

In Grossman's model, the optimal level of investment in health occurs where the [[marginal cost]] of health capital is equal to the [[marginal benefit]]. With the passing of time, health depreciates at some rate δ. The interest rate faced by the consumer is denoted by r. The marginal cost of health capital can be found by adding these variables: &lt;math&gt;MC_{HK}=r+\delta\,&lt;/math&gt;. The marginal benefit of health capital is the rate of return from this capital in both market and non-market sectors. In this model, the optimal health stock can be impacted by factors like age, wages and education. As an example, &lt;math&gt;\delta\,&lt;/math&gt; increases with age, so it becomes more and more costly to attain the same level of health capital or health stock as one ages. Age also decreases the marginal benefit of health stock.  The optimal health stock will therefore decrease as one ages.

Beyond issues of the fundamental, "real" demand for medical care derived from the desire to have good health (and thus influenced by the production function for health) is the important distinction between the "marginal benefit" of medical care (which is always associated with this "real demand" curve based on derived demand), and a separate "effective demand" curve, which summarizes the amount of medical care demanded at particular market prices.  Because most medical care is not purchased from providers directly, but is rather obtained at subsidized prices due to insurance, the out-of-pocket prices faced by consumers are typically much lower than the market price.  The consumer sets MB=MC out of pocket, and so the "effective demand" will have a separate relationship between price and quantity than will the "marginal benefit curve" or real demand relationship.  This distinction is often described under the rubric of "ex-post moral hazard" (which is again distinct from ex-ante moral hazard, which is found in any type of market with insurance).

==Health technology assessment==
{{main|Health technology assessment}}
[[Economic evaluation]], and in particular [[cost-effectiveness analysis]], has become a fundamental part of technology appraisal processes for agencies in a number of countries. The Institute for Quality and Economy in Health Services ([[Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen]] – IQWiG) in Germany and the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in the United Kingdom, for example, both consider the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals entering the market.

Some agencies, including NICE, recommend the use of [[cost–utility analysis]] (CUA). This approach measures outcomes in a composite metric of both length and quality of life, the [[Quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY).

==Healthcare markets==
The five health markets typically analyzed are:
* Healthcare [[financing]] market
* [[Physician]] and [[nurse]]s services market
* [[Institutional]] services market
* [[Input factors]] markets
* Professional [[education]] market

Although assumptions of textbook models of economic markets apply reasonably well to healthcare markets, there are important deviations. Many states have created [[Health insurance in the United States#State risk pools|risk pools]] in which relatively healthy enrollees subsidise the care of the rest. Insurers must cope with [[adverse selection]] which occurs when they are unable to fully predict the medical expenses of enrollees; adverse selection can destroy the risk pool. Features of insurance market risk pools, such as group purchases, preferential selection ("cherry-picking"), and [[preexisting condition]] exclusions are meant to cope with adverse selection.

Insured patients are naturally less concerned about healthcare costs than they would if they paid the full price of care. The resulting [[moral hazard]] drives up costs, as shown by the famous [[RAND Health Insurance Experiment]]. Insurers use several techniques to limit the costs of moral hazard, including imposing copayments on patients and limiting physician incentives to provide costly care. Insurers often compete by their choice of service offerings, cost sharing requirements, and limitations on physicians.

Consumers in healthcare markets often suffer from a lack of adequate information about what services they need to buy and which providers offer the best value proposition. Health economists have documented a problem with [[supplier induced demand]], whereby providers base treatment recommendations on economic, rather than medical criteria. Researchers have also documented substantial "practice variations", whereby the treatment also on service availability to rein in inducement and practice variations.

Some economists argue that requiring doctors to have a medical license constrains inputs, inhibits innovation, and increases cost to consumers while largely only benefiting the doctors themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Svorny |first=Shirley |year=2004 |title=Licensing Doctors: Do Economists Agree? |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=279–305 |url=http://www.aier.org/ejw/archive/complete-issues/doc_view/3685-ejw-200408?tmpl=component&amp;format=raw }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==

===Medical economics===
Often used synonymously with health economics, ''medical economics'', according to [[Anthony J. Culyer|Culyer]],&lt;ref&gt;[[A.J. Culyer]] (1989) "A Glossary of the more common terms encountered in health economics" in MS Hersh-Cochran and KP Cochran (Eds.) ''Compendium of English Language Course Syllabi and Textbooks in Health Economics'', Copenhagen, WHO, 215–34&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of economics concerned with the application of economic theory to phenomena and problems associated typically with the second and third health market outlined above. Typically, however, it pertains to cost–benefit analysis of pharmaceutical products and cost-effectiveness of various medical treatments. Medical economics often uses [[mathematical model]]s to synthesise data from [[biostatistics]] and [[epidemiology]] for support of medical [[decision-making]], both for individuals and for wider health policy.

===Behavioral economics===
[[Peter R. Orszag|Peter Orszag]] has suggested that [[behavioral economics]] is an important factor for improving the healthcare system, but that relatively little progress has been made when compared to retirement policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter R. Orszag|Peter Orszag]], [http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/96xx/doc9673/08-07-Presentation_RRC.pdf "Behavioral Economics: Lessons from Retirement Research for Health Care and Beyond,"] Presentation to the Retirement Research Consortium, August 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The relevance of behavioural economics in healthcare is further highlighted in Vuong et al. (2018).&lt;ref name=Vuongetal2018b&gt;{{cite journal|title=Healthcare consumers' sensitivity to costs: a reflection on behavioural economics from an emerging market|journal=Palgrave Communications|volume=4|issue=1|pages=70|date=June 19, 2018|doi=10.1057/s41599-018-0127-3|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0127-3|accessdate=June 19, 2018|last1=Vuong|first1=Thu-Trang|last2=Nguyen|first2=Hong-Kong|last3=Ho|first3=Tung-Manh|last4=Vuong|first4=Quan-Hoang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health economics===
Mental health economics incorporates a vast array of subject matters, ranging from [[pharmacoeconomics]] to [[Labour economics|labor economics]] and [[welfare economics]]. Mental health can be directly related to economics by the potential of affected individuals to contribute as human capital. In 2009 Currie and Stabile published "Mental Health in Childhood and Human Capital" in which they assessed how common childhood mental health problems may alter the human capital accumulation of affected children.&lt;ref&gt;Currie, Janet and Mark Stabile. "Mental Health in Childhood and Human Capital". ''The Problems of Disadvantaged Youth: An Economic Perspective'' ed. J. Gruber. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalities may include the influence that affected individuals have on surrounding human capital, such as at the workplace or in the home.&lt;ref name="Evers, S. 2007"&gt;{{citation |last1=Evers |first1=S. |first2=L. |last2=Salvador–Carulla |first3=V. |last3=Halsteinli |first4=D. |last4=McDaid |author5=MHEEN Group |title=Implementing mental health economic evaluation evidence: Building a Bridge between theory and practice |journal=Journal of Mental Health |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=223–41 |year=April 2007 |doi=10.1080/09638230701279881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the economy also affects the individual, particularly in light of globalization. For example, studies in India, where there is an increasingly high occurrence of western outsourcing, have demonstrated a growing hybrid identity in young professionals who face very different sociocultural expectations at the workplace and in at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Bhavsar |first1=V. |first2=D. |last2=Bhugra |title=Globalization: Mental health and social economic factors |journal=Global Social Policy |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=378–96 |date=December 2008 |doi=10.1177/1468018108095634 |url=http://gsp.sagepub.com/content/8/3/378.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental health economics presents a unique set of challenges to researchers. Individuals with cognitive disabilities may not be able to communicate preferences. These factors represent challenges in terms of placing value on the mental health status of an individual, especially in relation to the individual's potential as human capital. Further, employment statistics are often used in mental health economic studies as a means of evaluating individual productivity; however, these statistics do not capture "[[presenteeism]]", when an individual is at work with a lowered productivity level, quantify the loss of non-paid working time, or capture externalities such as having an affected family member. Also, considering the variation in global wage rates or in societal values, statistics used may be contextually, geographically confined, and study results may not be internationally applicable.&lt;ref name="Evers, S. 2007"/&gt;

Though studies have demonstrated mental healthcare to reduce overall healthcare costs, demonstrate efficacy, and reduce employee absenteeism while improving employee functioning, the availability of comprehensive mental health services is in decline. Petrasek and Rapin (2002) cite the three main reasons for this decline as (1) stigma and privacy concerns, (2) the difficulty of quantifying medical savings and (3) physician incentive to medicate without specialist referral.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Petrasek M, Rapin L |title=The mental health paradox |journal=Benefits Q |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=73–77 |year=2002 |pmid=12004583 |last2=Rapin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evers et al. (2009) have suggested that improvements could be made by promoting more active dissemination of mental health economic analysis, building partnerships through policy-makers and researchers, and employing greater use of [[knowledge broker]]s.&lt;ref name="Evers, S. 2007"/&gt;

'''Health information management''' ('''HIM''') is [[information management]] applied to [[health]] and [[health care]]. It is the practice of acquiring, analyzing and protecting digital and traditional medical information vital to providing [[health care quality|quality patient care]]. With the widespread computerization of health records, traditional (paper-based) records are being replaced with [[electronic health record]]s (EHRs). The tools of [[health informatics]] and [[health information technology]] are continually improving to bring greater [[efficiency]] to information management in the [[health care system|health care sector]]. Both [[hospital information system]]s and [[HRHIS|Human Resource for Health Information System (HRHIS)]] are common implementations of HIM.

'''Health information management professionals''' plan [[information system]]s, develop [[health policy]], and identify current and future information needs. In addition, they may apply the science of [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] to the collection, storage, analysis, use, and transmission of information to meet legal, professional, ethical and administrative records-keeping requirements of [[health care]] delivery.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2010). ''Classifying health workers''. Geneva: WHO.&lt;/ref&gt;  They work with clinical, epidemiological, demographic, financial, reference, and coded healthcare data. [[Registered Health Information Administrator|Health information administrators]] have been described to "play a critical role in the delivery of healthcare in the [[United States]] through their focus on the collection, maintenance and use of quality data to support the information-intensive and information-reliant healthcare system".&lt;ref&gt;(LaTour, Kathleen M., &amp; Maki, Shirley Eichenwald. (2010). Health information management concepts, principles, and practice. Chicago, Illinois: American Health Information Management Association.)(LaTour, &amp; Maki, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] stated that the proper collection, management and use of information within healthcare systems "will determine the system's effectiveness in detecting health problems, defining priorities, identifying innovative solutions and allocating resources to improve health outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;Stansfield S. (2005). "Structuring information and incentives to improve health". ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'', 83(8):562.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health information management's standards history is dated back to the introduction of the [[American Health Information Management Association]], founded in 1928 "when the [[American College of Surgeons]] established the Association of Record Librarians of North America (ARLNA) to 'elevate the standards of clinical records in hospitals and other medical institutions.'"&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA (2010). "[http://www.ahima.org/about/history.asp AHIMA History]". AHIMA. Retrieved 2010-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, AHIMA was known as American Association of Medical Record Librarians (AAMRL) and its members were known as medical record experts or [[librarian]]s who studied medical record science. The goal was to raise the standards of records keeping in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. The individuals involved in this profession were promoters for the successful management of clinical records to guarantee accuracy and precision. Over time, the organization's name changed to reflect the evolving field of health information management practices, eventually becoming the American Health Information Management Association. The association's current name is meant to cover the wide variety of areas which health professionals work in today.

AHIMA members affect the quality of patient information and patient care at every touch point in the healthcare delivery cycle. They often serve in bridge roles, connecting clinical, operational, and administrative functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahima.org/popups/partner.asp Partner in the Delivery of Quality Healthcare]. (n.d.). Retrieved November 28, 2009, from American Health Information Management Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIMSS establishment in 1961 increased industry knowledge===
The [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society]] (HIMSS) was organized in 1961 as the Hospital Management Systems Society (HMSS), an independent, [[Unincorporated entity|unincorporated]], [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]], voluntary association of individuals. It was preceded by increasing amounts of [[Management engineering (healthcare)|management engineering]] activity in healthcare during the 1950s, when teachings of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.]] began to attract the attention of health leaders.&lt;ref&gt;HIMSS (2008). "[http://www.himss.org/content/files/HIMSS_HISTORY.pdf AHIMA History]". HIMSS Legacy Workgroup. Retrieved 2010-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIMSS grew to include chapters, membership categories, publications, conventions, and continues to grow in different parts of the world via its [[Europe]], [[Asia Pacific]], and [[Middle East]]ern branches.&lt;ref&gt;HIMSS. [http://www.himss.org HIMSS.org]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accredited HIM educational program development===
The [[Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education]] (CAHIIM) defines standards which [[higher education]] health information management and technology programs must meet to qualify for [[accreditation]]. Students who graduate from an accredited [[Associate's degree|associate's]], [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] or [[Academic certificate|certificate]] program are qualified to sit for their respective exams for certification as a [[Registered Health Information Technician]] (RHIT) – via graduation from an accredited associate or certification program or [[Registered Health Information Administrator]] (RHIA), which requires education through an accredited bachelor or certification program. Competency requirements are maintained by CAHIIM in their associate degree Entry-Level Competencies and Baccalaureate Degree Entry-Level Competencies definitions.&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA. 6/3/2004 [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/internalproject_bok/bok1_036792.pdf HIM Associate Degree Entry-Level Competencies].

==Modern development==

===Electronic health records===
{{Main|Electronic health record}}
&lt;!--Full information on electronic health records can be found at its own article.--&gt;
The electronic health record has been continually expressed as an evolvement of health record-keeping. Because it is electronic, this means of record keeping has been both supported and debated in the health professional community and within the public realm.

In the United States, 89% of those who responded to a recent [[Wall Street Journal]] poll described themselves as "Very/Somewhat Confident" in their health care provider who used electronic health records compared to 71% of respondents who responded positively about their providers who didn't or don't use electronic health records.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal. [https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB119565244262500549.html?mod=blog "Benefits of Electronic Health Records Seen as Outweighing Privacy Risks"]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, more than fifty-percent of [[Chief Information Officer]]s polled listed that they wanted ambulatory electronic health records in order to have the health information record available to move across each stage of health care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himss.org/content/files/IntegrationConnectivitySurvey.pdf Healthcare Integration and Connectivity: Results of a Survey by the Enterprise Information Systems Steering Committee] page 4. HIMSS. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health information managers are charged with the protection of patient privacy and are responsible for training their employees in the proper handling and usage of the confidential information entrusted to them. With the rise of technology's importance in healthcare, health information managers must remain competent with the use of information databases that generate crucial reports for administrators and physicians.

=== Educational programs ===
{{main|List of CAHIIM-accredited HIM Programs in the United States}}

The requisites and accreditation processes for health information management education and professional activity vary across jurisdictions.

In the United States, the CAHIIM requires continued accreditation for accredited programs in health information management. The current standard is that accreditation may be maintained with periodic site visits, submission of an annual report, informing CAHIIM of adverse changes within the program and paying CAHIIM administrative fees.&lt;ref&gt;CAHIIM. [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/accreditation/bok1_044387.pdf 2005 Interpretation of Standards: Associate Degree] section VI.F. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CAHIIM. [http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/accreditation/bok1_044386.pdf Interpretation of Standards: Baccalaureate Degree] section VI.F. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  HIM students may opt to participate in a full-time [[Bridge program (higher education)|bridge program]] called the Joint Bachelor of Science/Masters Program. With this program, students can achieve both the Bachelor of Science in Health Information Management and the Master of Health Services Administration Program (BSHIM/MHSA). The full-time bridge program allows students to achieve both degrees in five years. Students pursuing the BSHIM/MHSA will be prepared to assume management and executive positions in health-related organizations such as: hospitals, managed care organizations, health information system developers and vendors, and [[pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] companies, and bring their knowledge in HIM to these positions.

In Canada, graduates of Canadian Health Information Management Association (CHIMA) programs are eligible to write a national certification examination to pursue a profession in HIM.&lt;ref&gt;Alberta Occupational Profiles, 2011. ''Health Information Management Professional'' http://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/Content/RequestAction.asp?aspAction=GetHTMLProfile&amp;format=html&amp;OCCPRO_ID=71002536&lt;/ref&gt;

====Online program availability====
There are many programs that are also available online. Online students collaborate with in-class students using internet technology. With online learning, students are allowed to go through the programs at their own pace. Online students are included in class through group lectures that are recorded and put online, discussion boards and are members of group projects with in-class students. Some online students are even allowed to attend some classes on campus and take some classes online.

The CAHIIM lists accredited online programs on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cahiim.org/accredpgms.asp CAHIIM.org] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120721005333/http://www.cahiim.org/accredpgms.asp |date=2012-07-21 }}. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Further education for health information professionals====
Education is an important aspect in being successful in the world of health information management. Aside from initial credentials, health information professionals may wish to pursue a Masters of Health Information Management, [[Masters of Business Administration]], [[Masters of Health Administration]], or other Masters programs in health data management, information technology and systems, and organization and management. Gaining further education advances the health professional's career and qualifies the individual for upper-management positions.

==Canada (CHIMA)==
In Canada, current HIM employees are mostly called the "Health Information Management Professionals", with the designation of "Certified Health Information Manager" (CHIM). The accrediting association here is the Canadian Health Information Management Association (CHIMA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.echima.ca/home Canadian Health Information Management Association (CHIMA) Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The following list below consists of Canadian post-secondary schools that have given full accreditation for their HIM programs from CHIMA:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.echima.ca/cchim/him-program Accredited HIM Schools in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
Healthcare quality and safety require that the right information be available at the right time to support patient care and health system management decisions. Gaining consensus on essential data content and documentation standards is a necessary prerequisite for high-quality data in the interconnected healthcare system of the future. Continuous quality management of data standards and content is key to ensuring that information is usable and actionable.&lt;ref&gt;Mervat Abdelhak et al.: “Health Information: Management of a Strategic Resource”, Second Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Records===
*The '''patient health record''' is the primary legal record documenting the health care services provided to a person in any aspect of the health care system. The term includes routine clinical or office records, records of care in any health related setting, preventive care, lifestyle evaluation, research protocols and various clinical databases. This repository of information about a single patient is generated by health care professionals as a direct result of interaction with a patient or with individuals who have personal knowledge of the patient.
*The '''primary patient record''' is the record that is used by health care professionals while providing patient care services to review patient data or document their own observations, actions, or instructions.
*The '''secondary patient record''' is a record that is derived from the primary record and contains selected data elements to aid non clinical persons in supporting, evaluating and advancing patient care.  Patient care support refers to administration, regulation, and payment functions.

===Practices===

====Methods to ensure Data Quality====
The accuracy of data depends on the manual or computer information system design for collecting, recording, storing, processing, accessing and displaying data as well as the ability and follow- through of the people involved in each phase of these activities. Everyone involved with documenting or using health information is responsible for its quality. According to AHIMA’s Data Quality Management Model, there are four key processes for data:

#'''Application''': the purpose for which the data are collected.
#'''Collection''': the processes by which data elements are accumulated.
#'''Warehousing''': the processes and systems used to store and maintain data and data journals.
#'''Analysis''': the process of translating data into information utilized for an application.

Each aspect is analyzed with 10 different data characteristics:

#'''Accuracy''': Data are the correct values and are valid.
#'''Accessibility''': Data items should be easily obtainable and legal to collect.
#'''Comprehensiveness''': All required data items are included. Ensure that the entire scope of the data is collected and document intentional limitations.
#'''Consistency''': The value of the data should be reliable and the same across applications.
#'''Currency''': The data should be up to date. A datum value is up to date if it is current for a specific point in time. It is outdate if it was current at some preceding time yet incorrect at a later time.
#'''Definition''': Clear definitions should be provided so that current and future data users will know what the data mean. Each data element should have clear meaning and acceptable values.
#'''Granularity''': The attributes and values of data should be defined at the correct level of detail.
#'''Precision''': Data values should be just large enough to support the application or process.
#'''Relevancy''': The data are meaningful to the performance of the process or application for which they are collected.
#'''Timeliness''': Timeliness is determined by how the data are being used and their context.

==Health information professionals==
HIM is a very broad and successful field for [[health care provider|health care professionals]]. There are several career opportunities in Health Information Management and many different traditional and non-traditional settings for an HIM professional to work within.

*Traditional settings include: Managing an HIM medical records department, [[cancer registry]], [[Medical classification|coding]], trauma registry, [[Medical transcription|transcription]], [[Quality management|quality improvement]], [[Release of information department|release of information]], patient admissions, compliance auditor, physician accreditation, utilization review, physician offices and [[risk management]].
*Non-traditional settings include: consulting firms, government agencies, law firms, insurance companies, correctional facilities, extended care facilities, pharmaceutical research, information technology and [[medical software]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocoS103.htm Medical Records and Health Information Technicians]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health information managers===
Professional health information managers manage and construct health information programs to guarantee they accommodate medical, legal, and ethical standards. They play a crucial role in the maintenance, collection, and analyzing of data that is received by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare players. In return these healthcare data contributors rely on the information to deliver quality healthcare. Managers must work with a group of information technicians to guarantee that the patient's medical records are accurate and are available when needed.

In the United States, health information managers are typically certified as a [[Registered Health Information Administrator]] (RHIA) after achieving a bachelor's degree in health informatics or health information management from a school accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM) and after passing their respective certification exam.&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA.

Retrieved 3/2/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is to credit a working level IT or clinical professional who is able to support physician adoption of Health IT.  A CHISP professional needs to process knowledge of the health care environment, Health IT, IT, and soft skills including communication skills.

RHIAs usually assume a managerial position that interacts with all levels of an organization that use patient data in decision making and everyday operations.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago State University [http://www.csu.edu/healthsciences/healthinformationadministration/documents/profession.pdf Profession]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They may work in a broad range of settings that span the continuum of healthcare including office based physician practices, nursing homes, home health agencies, mental health facilities, and public health agencies.

Health information managers may specialize in registry management, data management, and data quality among other areas.

===Medical records and Health information technicians===
{{See also|Clinical coder}}
Medical records (MR) and Health information technicians (HIT) are described as having the following duties according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Outlook Handbook:&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition. [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocoS103.htm Medical Records and Health Information Technicians]. Retrieved 1/8/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;assemble patients' health information including medical history, symptoms, examination results, diagnostic tests, treatment methods, and all other healthcare provider services. Technicians organize and manage health information data by ensuring its quality, accuracy, accessibility, and security. They regularly communicate with physicians and other healthcare professionals to clarify diagnoses or to obtain additional information.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The International Labour Organization's [[International Standard Classification of Occupations]] further notes: "Occupations included in this category require knowledge of medical terminology, legal aspects of health information, health data standards, and computer- or paper-based data management as obtained through formal education and/or prolonged on-the-job training.&lt;ref&gt;International Standard Classification of Occupations, 2008 revision: Unit Group 3252: Medical records and health information technicians. http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

MRHITs usually work in hospitals. However they also work in a variety of other healthcare settings, including office based physician practices, [[nursing home]]s, [[home care|home health agencies]], [[Psychiatric hospital|mental health facilities]], and public health agencies. Technicians who specialize in coding are called [[medical coder]]s or coding specialists.

In the United States, health information technicians are certified as a [[Registered Health Information Technician]] (RHIT) after completing an associate degree in [[health information technology]] from a school accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM) before they may take their certification exam.&lt;ref&gt;AHIMA (2008).

The health of American author [[Robert E. Howard]] (1906–1936), especially his mental health, has been the focus of the biographical and critical analysis of his life. In terms of physical health, Howard had a weak heart which he treated by taking [[digitalis]].  The precise nature of Howard's mental health has been much debated, both during his life and following his suicide.  Three main points of view exists.  Some have declared that Howard suffered from an [[Oedipus complex]] or similar mental disorder.  Another viewpoint is that Howard suffered from [[major depressive disorder]].  The third view is that Howard had no disorders and his suicide was a common reaction to stress.

==Physical health==
Howard had a weak heart, which was treated by taking [[digitalis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first indication of this problem came when, while working with an oil-field surveyor in the period before he became a successful author, Howard passed out in the heat.  A later diagnosis confirmed that his heart had a mild tendency to race under stress and he was told that a heavy blow to his chest could be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (13th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 1933 Howard was involved in a traffic accident.  Driving back from a football game in Brownwood with three friends in the mist and rain, he crashed into a flag pole in [[Ranger, Texas|Ranger]].  A piece of windshield cut his neck close to the [[jugular vein]] and he was forced heavily into the steering column.  This impact to his chest could have been lethal with his heart problems but he escaped with just bruised ribs.  None of the other passengers were seriously injured either and one escaped injury altogether. The town helped to pay for repairs to the car and the flag pole was eventually removed following further accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (40th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
[[Image:Reh moustache.jpg|right|thumb|150px|alt=Robert E. Howard with a moustache, wearing a broad brimmed hat.|Late photograph of Robert E. Howard, with moustache.]]
In the years since his suicide, there has been a lot of speculation about Robert E. Howard's mental health.  Even during his life, others in Cross Plains thought of him as crazy or odd.  Some have suggested that he had an [[Oedipus complex]], others have found evidence for [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]], and others still have diagnosed him as being mentally healthy.  His act of suicide is often the basis of these opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (55-56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all speculation is in the form of amateur-psychoanalysis from people with no qualifications in the field.&lt;ref name="Burke 56"&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gramlich 2006 99 106" /&gt;

===Eccentric behavior===
The people of Cross Plains considered Howard to be an odd person and possibly "crazy".  Cross Plains was mainly used to blue-collar agricultural and oil field work, as well as professions such as a teacher or doctor; they were not used to some who only wrote all day.  From their perspective, Howard did not seem to be doing any work at all.  His neighbors even complained about the noise he made typing, as well as loudly reading his own narration as he did so, throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard displayed eccentric behavior, such as: having his pants hemmed short so he would not trip in a potential fight; carrying a gun in his car in case of enemies; shouting stories as he wrote them; dressing oddly for the time and place, including a large moustache and sombrero; shadow-boxing as he walked down the street.  At the time, Novalyne Price told her roommate, "He’s trying to tell people he’s a writer and writers have a right to be odd. Since they think he’s crazy, anyway, he’ll show them just how crazy he can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of his break-up with Novalyne Price, Howard's behavior became increasing eccentric.  On one occasion, having taken Novalyne to a drug store for a soda, he loudly and publicly re-told his story "[[Red Nails]]."  He changed his appearance and grew a large, drooping mustache.  Later he began to wear about town a black [[sombrero]] with red bandana and black [[cowboy|vaquero]] pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Charles Gramlich's opinion on Howard's behavior is that these are either normal acts or just eccentricities, which does not extend to having a mental disorder. The carrying of gun is, in Gramlich's opinion, normal for Texas, especially in the 1930s when the Wild West was within recent, living memory. The story about needing the gun in case of "enemies," given to E. Hoffmann Price, may have just been a tall tale invented by Howard for his friend. Novalyne Price considered Howard's talk of enemies to be part of an act. Finn notes that [[Highwayman|highwaymen]] had operated in the area during the oil boom and this was the reason Howard gave to Price for the gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shadow-boxing and shouting out of stories as they were written were due to Howard being a writer and simply getting caught up in a story. Other acts were intentionally eccentric as a reaction to the criticism from other townspeople. He was expressing his anger to this criticism by acting in a contrary manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=102–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of depression===
Howard maintained in correspondence with other writers that he was a failure and a [[Hack writer|hack]].  This was despite being commercially successful, sought after by publishers and receiving fan mail for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When sending condolences to [[August Derleth]] in May 1936, the month before his suicide, Howard wrote "Death to the old is inevitable, and yet somehow I often feel that it is a greater tragedy than death to the young...I don't want to live to be old.  I want to die when my time comes, quickly and suddenly, in the full tide of my strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[E. Hoffmann Price]] visited Howard in early 1934.  His impression on leaving was "Bob lived in a dream world people by enemies, and by peers and other folks who downgraded him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard suffered from nightmares and sleep walking into his early twenties, probably as a result of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=99, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In spring 1926, Howard went to Brownwood to see Tevis Clyde Smith.  In the night Clyde Smith was woken by Howard's scream; he saw him wrestle with a large shape and fall through a closed window.  The family found him wandering outside in a daze.  Clyde Smith talked to him until he went back to sleep, on prior instructions, and then woke him.  Howard had apparently dreamed that he saw a newspaper with the headline "Axe Murderer Slays Three."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Howard went to a hospital in [[Temple, Texas|Temple]] complaining of a [[varicocele]], gas in the stomach and an abnormally small penis. The working diagnosis at the time was [[Neurasthenia|sexual neurasthenia]] but the symptoms may instead point towards [[neurotic depressive disorder]]. The doctor concluded that "We do not think there is anything wrong with Robert.  We can find no varicocele of any consequence, and his organs are normally developed and he tests out good in every respect.  His trouble, in our judgment, is due to his thinking there is something wrong.  After he has dispelled this thought from his mind he will be in fine shape."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Mark Finn suggests that Howard picked up on his mother's depression.  She was dying of tuberculosis and may have suffered a miscarriage in October 1907.  Howard's father's job as a country doctor required him to make long journeys away from home, which would often mean him spending the night elsewhere.  This frequently left Howard alone with his mother and later put him in the role of primary caregiver.  The situation may have been exacerbated by frequent moves during his youth, which prevented Howard making many friends of his own during his early years, and the gradual breakdown of his parents' marriage.  His life was not his own and he developed a hatred of authority and any control placed over him.  He rebelled by boxing and drinking but, nevertheless, he felt duty-bound to remain and look after his mother.  Even after he became a success as a writer, he continued to live with his parents; although this was not unusual at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finn writes that "Robert was [[Major depressive disorder|clinically depressed]] by any definition applicable, and had been for many years.  Whether the cause of the depression was a chemical imbalance, an untenable situation at home, or a combination of the two is not important."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; His suicide, once his duty to his mother was done, may have been an act of finally asserting control over his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of an Oedipus complex===
[[L. Sprague de Camp]] wrote in ''The Science Fiction Handbook'' (1953) that "the neurotic Howard suffered from an Oedipean devotion to his mother and... from delusions of persecution."  Faced with refutations from Glenn Lord, de Camp eventually stopped making claims about an Oedipus Complex but maintained that Howard was insane, especially due to Howard's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of the speculations about Howard's mental state appear to originate in the first, flawed, biography of Howard, ''[[Dark Valley Destiny]]'' by L. Sprague de Camp and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tend to be from a Freudian perspective and suggest an Oedipal attraction between Robert and his mother Hester, based on the facts that Howard took care of his dying mother, that his bedroom had a window through to his parents' bedroom and that he killed himself on the day she was going to die herself.  Gramlich points out that Dr. Isaac Howard's job forced him to take house calls and be away on business while Robert E. Howard's job as a writer meant he was at home most of the time; so, naturally, Robert became the primary caregiver.  Howard's bedroom was a converted porch and the window was a pre-existing part of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of no mental disorders===
Dr. Charles Gramlich, a professor of psychology and an author of fantasy fiction, believes that Howard had no mental disorders and that amateur psychoanalysis has only come to such a conclusion through cherry-picking of evidence from Howard's life.&lt;ref name="Gramlich 2006 99 106"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=99, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burke concurs that almost all speculation is in the form of amateur psychoanalysis from people like L. Sprague de Camp with no qualifications in the field.&lt;ref name="Burke 56" /&gt;

===Suicide===
Confidants such as [[Tevis Clyde Smith]] and [[Novalyne Price Ellis]] found Howard to be an agreeable companion most of the time, full of life and good humor — but always with an underlying simmering melancholy.  Smith noted that Howard first mentioned suicide in October 1923 when a classmate, Roy Guthrie, committed suicide.  It affected Howard and he increasingly defended the right to do so in later years.  Howard may have considered suicide as early as 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Howard first talked of his own death in 1928 when his dog Patch was dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Novalyne Price was admitted to hospital in 1935, her doctor, a friend of Howard's father, asked her if Howard had ever talked about not wanting to live after his mother died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Howard's suicide, Gramlich believes it was nothing to do with any long-term mental abnormality; it was a common reaction to the strain he was under at the time.  While Howard did talk of suicide during his life, statistics show that one out of three teenagers contemplate suicide and the details of Howard's are normal (white, single, from the south of the United States, with a gun).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment of Howard's death, he was mentally and physically exhausted with little available support: he was caring for his dying mother as her condition got worse; he was not being paid the money owed to him by ''Weird Tales'', at a time when he needed it for his mother's healthcare bills; he was working increasingly harder to make the money through other markets; his relationship with Novalyne Price had recently broken down; Tevis Clyde Smith had recently married and moved away; he did not have a strong relationship with his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gramlich ends by saying "He wasn't crazy; he was just a very good writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hayles wrote in the Times: "Maybe, at the end of it all, Howard felt that he had done what he needed to do. The prolific writer, whose 160-plus published stories were full of men facing death on their own terms, wanted to do the same. In a letter to the fantasy writer August Derleth he stated: 'I don’t want to live to be old. I want to die when my time comes, quickly and suddenly, in the full tide of my strength and health.' Youthful bravado perhaps, but he was true to his word. He wrote about men who didn’t age — his heroes were immortal. In bowing out in his prime, so was Robert E. Howard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hayles|2009|loc=Saturday Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Healthy Life Years''' indicator (HLY) is a European structural indicator computed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20120301003227/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/dataset?p_product_code=HLTH_HLYE Eurostat]. It is one of the summary measures of population health, known as health expectancies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurohex.eu/pdf/Glossary_v4.pdf Glossary EurOhex website]&lt;/ref&gt; composite measures of health that combine [[Mortality rate|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] data to represent overall population health on a single indicator.&lt;ref&gt;J.-M. Robine. ''Summarizing health status''. In: Pencheon D, Guest C, Melzer D, Gray JAM, editors. Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;160-168&lt;/ref&gt; HLY measures the number of remaining years that a person of a certain age is expected to live without disability. It is actually a disability-free [[life expectancy]].

== History ==
The European Union has decided to include a small set of health expectancies among its European Community Health Indicators (ECHI) to provide synthetic measures of disability, chronic morbidity, and perceived health. Therefore the Minimum European Health Module (MEHM), composed of 3 general questions covering these dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;B. Cox, H. Van Oyen, E. Cambois, C. Jagger, S. Le Roy, J-M Robine, I.Romieu. The reliability of the Minimum European Health Module. ''International Journal of Public Health'' 2009;(54):55-60 (DOI 10.1007/s00038-009-7104-y), p57&lt;/ref&gt; has been introduced into the Eurostat EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey (EU-SILC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R1177:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC)]&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the comparability of health expectancies between countries. In addition life expectancy without long term activity limitation, based on the disability question, was selected in 2004 to be one of the structural indicators to be examined every year, during the European Spring Council for assessing the EU strategic goals ([[Lisbon Strategy]]) under the name of “Healthy Life Years” (HLY)'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_information/indicators/lifeyears_en.htm Health Life Years in the core of the Lisbon Strategy ]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Furthermore the European Union is co-funding a Joint Action on Chronic Diseases and Promoting Healthy Ageing across the Life Cycle (CHRODIS-JA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chrodis.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; This aims to promote and facilitate a process of exchange and transfer of good practices between European countries and regions, addressing chronic conditions, with a specific focus on health promotion and prevention of chronic conditions, multi-morbidity and diabetes.'''   

Detailed information on the Health Expectancies in Europe are available from the EurOhex Advanced research on European health expectancies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurohex.eu EurOhex]&lt;/ref&gt; while latest Healthy Life Years values can be found on the general public website devoted to the Healthy Life Years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthy-life-years.eu healthy-life-years.eu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
Dramatic increases in [[life expectancy]] in the most developed countries - and therefore in the countries of the European Union - constitute one of the most remarkable advances of the last decades. But why prolong life if this is to be accompanied by increases in severe mental and physical impairment? Thus a further challenge confronts the European Community:
:''increasing life expectancy in good health.''

In this context, the classical mortality indicators are no longer sufficient to monitor the health status of European populations. The availability of health expectancy indicators dividing life expectancy into life spent in different states of health is useful to health authorities in the field of [[public health]] and [[health policy|health policies]] provided that these indicators allow comparisons over time and between geographic areas and between socio-economic groups in society. As the post-war generation reaches retirement, the pace of ageing will increase dramatically in our European societies, with profound social effects. HLY is an important indicator :
* Health of a population is inherently difficult to measure because it is often defined differently among individuals, populations, cultures, and even across time periods.
* Many studies focus on measures such as physical impairment or disability in functional tasks or presence of a specific chronic disease. Self-assessed health, being much more global and subjective in nature, can incorporate a variety of aspects of health including cognitive and emotional as well as physical status, and therefore provide insights into the needs of an [[ageing]] society. Hence, self-assessed health measures as HLY may be a particularly important indicator of the potential demand for health services and long-term care needs.
* The two components of the calculation of the HLY are life tables and self-perceived disability assessed by health surveys. From 1995 to 2001, data from the Eurostat European Community Household Panel (ECHP) survey have been used for the EU-15 Member States. Its successor, the Eurostat EU-SILC has been used from 2005 onwards for the EU-25 and then 27 Member States.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

== Example ==
[[File:HLY 2010.jpg|thumb|Healthy Life Years in Europe - 2010]]
* The HLY estimates are provided for the 27 EU Member States using the EU-SILC data for 2010 (see graph above)
* The first analyses of the healthy life years values disclose significant inequalities among the European countries.&lt;ref&gt;C. Jagger, C. Gillies, F. Mascone, E. Cambois, H. Van Oyen, W.J. Nusselder, J.-M. Robine, EHLEIS team. Inequalities in healthy life years in the 25 countries of the European Union in 2005: a cross-national meta-regression analysis. ''The Lancet'' 2008;372(9656):2124-2131 (DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61594-9)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical Findings==
Different estimations are made for men and women. In 2015, the number of healthy years of women in the EU-28 was estimated to be at 63.3 years and of men to be at 62.6 years. The interesting part of this is that the gender gap was considerably smaller in regards to healthy life years than to overall life expectancy. This would imply that biologically, gender would not really affect the rate and time at which humans would become healthy yet gender would play a role in how long human beings would be able to live in an unhealthy state. 

==Data Sources and their Availability==
Eurostat calculates information about the healthy life years at three different ages during a person's life. One is at birth, another is at age 50, and the third is at age 65, with an indicator used separately for men and women. The data is calculated and collected by using mortality statistics as well as self perceived longstanding activity limitations- a dimension that captures longstanding limitation in regards to health and/or disability to perform usual and frequent activities. 
An example of a question that might be asked concerning the longstanding activity limitation is: "For the last six months, to what extent have you been limited because of a health problem in activities that people usually do?" Some available answers are "severely limited", "limited but not severely", or "not limited at all".

'''Healthy building''' refers to an emerging area of interest that supports the physical, [[psychological]], and social [[health]] and [[well-being]] of people in buildings and the [[built environment]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/learn/about/576/buildings-health|title=Buildings and Health - GSA Sustainable Facilites Tool|last=|first=|date=|website=sftool.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings can be key promoters of health and well-being since most people spend a majority of their time indoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/health/unhealthy-vs-healthy-office/index.html|title=Is your office making you unhealthy?|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Human Activity Pattern Survey, Americans spend “an average of 87% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6% of their time in enclosed vehicles.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klepeis|first=N. E.|last2=Nelson|first2=W. C.|last3=Ott|first3=W. R.|last4=Robinson|first4=J. P.|last5=Tsang|first5=A. M.|last6=Switzer|first6=P.|last7=Behar|first7=J. V.|last8=Hern|first8=S.

Healthy building can be seen as the next generation of [[Green building]] that not only includes environmentally responsible and resource-efficient building concepts, but also integrates “health, wellness, and human experience in buildings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/articles/healthy-buildings-and-healthy-people-next-generation-green-building|title=Healthy buildings and healthy people: The next generation of green building {{!}} U.S. Green Building Council|website=www.usgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits can include “reducing [[absenteeism]] and [[presenteeism]], lowering health care costs, and improving individual and organizational performance.” Healthy building encompasses a wide range of concepts and applications that promote human health which include but are not limited to: site selection and construction, occupant engagement, personal control, [[Green building#Indoor environmental quality enhancement|indoor environmental quality]], [[daylighting]], [[Biophilia hypothesis#Biophilic design|biophilic design]], access to [[Drinking water|potable water]], healthy dining options, exercise in the workplace, and smoking restrictions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Integrated design ==
Healthy building involves many different concepts, fields of interest, and disciplines. As such, taking an integrative or [[integrated design]] approach is essential to successfully creating a healthy building. Forming a diverse and interdisciplinary team early in the process can generate integrated or complementary strategies for improved performance or health impact considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/261/integrative-design-process|title=Integrative Design Process - GSA Sustainable Facilites Tool|last=|first=|date=|website=sftool.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An integrated design team can consist of stakeholders and specialists such as facility managers, architects, building engineers, health and wellness experts, and public health partners. Conducting [[Charrette|charrettes]] with an integrated design team can foster collaboration and help the team develop goals, plans, and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/planning-and-conducting-integrated-design-id-charrettes|title=Planning and Conducting Integrated Design (ID) Charrettes {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=www.wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buildings and health components ==
There are many different components that can support health and well-being in buildings.

=== Site selection ===
[[Site selection]] is an important factor in designing a building and ensuring positive health and environmental impacts. Creating a [[Walkability|walkable]] environment that connects people to workplaces, green spaces, public transportation, fitness centers, and other basic needs and services can influence daily physical activity, “the distances people travel to work, the convenience of purchasing healthy foods, and the safety and attractiveness of neighborhoods for walking.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.preventioninstitute.org/publications/strategies-for-enhancing-the-built-environment-to-support-healthy-eating-and-active-living|title=Strategies for Enhancing the Built Environment to Support Healthy Eating and Active Living|last=|first=|date=|website=www.preventioninstitute.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, proximity to green spaces (e.g., parks, walking trails, gardens, and etc.) or therapeutic landscapes can reduce absenteeism and improve well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-11-01|title=Encountering place: A psychoanalytic approach for understanding how therapeutic landscapes benefit health and wellbeing|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829212001293|journal=Health &amp; Place|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1381–1387|doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.07.002|issn=1353-8292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building design ===
There are many aspects of a building that can be designed to support positive health and well-being. For example, creating well-placed collaboration and social areas (e.g., break rooms, open collaboration areas, cafe spaces, courtyard gardens) can encourage social interaction and well-being. Quiet and wellness rooms can provide quiet zones or rooms that help improve well-being and mindfulness. Specifically, a designated lactation room can support nursing mothers by providing privacy and helping them return to work more easily. A lactation room is required for offices with more than 50 employees and recommended for all other offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/nursingmothers/faqBTNM.htm|title=Faqs - Break Time for Nursing Mothers  - Wage and Hour Division (WHD) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=www.dol.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another design aspect to consider is [[biophilic design]], which focuses on reconnecting people to the natural environment. Biophilic design has been linked to health outcomes such as stress reduction, enhanced mood, improved cognitive performance, enhanced social engagement, enhanced sleep, and enhanced movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/learn/about/580/biophilic-design|title=Biophilic Design - GSA Sustainable Facilites Tool|last=|first=|date=|website=sftool.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ergonomics]] can also minimize stress and strain on the body by providing ergonomically designed workstations.

=== Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) ===
According to the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), "Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) refers to the quality of a building’s environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/default.html|title=CDC - Indoor Environmental Quality - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|date=2017-12-11|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; IEQ is determined by many factors including [[indoor air quality]] (IAQ), temperature, [[lighting]], and selection of building materials. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) recommends three strategies to improve indoor air quality: source control, improved ventilation, and air cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/improving-indoor-air-quality|title=Improving Indoor Air Quality {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selecting low-emitting products and materials that reduce [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) emissions is one way prevent indoor air pollution. Product characteristics to consider include durability, indoor air quality effects, material transparency, and health impact on building occupants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/evaluating-and-selecting-green-products|title=Evaluating and Selecting Green Products {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=www.wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other aspects of IEQ that can improve health and well-being include [[thermal comfort]], [http://www.wbdg.org/resources/acoustic-comfort acoustic comfort], and [[integrated pest management]] (IPM).

==== Daylighting ====
[[Daylighting]] refers to providing access to natural daylight, which can be aesthetically pleasing and can reduce energy use. Light has a direct effect on human health because of how it affects [[Circadian rhythm|circadian rhythms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Figueiro|first=Mariana G|last2=Rea|first2=Mark S|last3=Bullough|first3=John D|date=2006-08-10|title=Does architectural lighting contribute to breast cancer?|journal=Journal of Carcinogenesis|volume=5|pages=20|doi=10.1186/1477-3163-5-20|issn=1477-3163|pmc=1557490|pmid=16901343}}&lt;/ref&gt; If daylighting is not available, supplemental electric lighting can help ensure occupants receive enough light for the [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of circadian rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/office-of-governmentwide-policy/office-of-federal-highperformance-buildings/projects-and-research/building-research/circadian-light-for-your-health|title=Circadian Light For Your Health|website=www.gsa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diet ===
Providing access to water and healthy, nutritional food is essential to promoting health and a quality environment. The design of a building should take into consideration proximity to water and nutritional foods via cafeterias, vending machines, local stores and restaurants or farmers’ markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fitwel.org/standard|title=Standard {{!}} Fitwel|website=fitwel.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://standard.wellcertified.com/nourishment?_ga=2.169976551.67290029.1533775794-912338317.1532549105|title=Nourishment {{!}} WELL Standard|website=standard.wellcertified.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise ===
Site selection and building design can promote increased physical activity and exercise. Well-lit and accessible stairwells can provide building occupants the opportunity to increase regular physical activity. Fitness centers or an exercise room can encourage exercise during the work day, which can improve mood and performance, leading to improved focus and better work-based relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coulson|first=J.C.|last2=McKenna|first2=Jim|last3=Field|first3=M|date=2008-09-26|title=Exercising at work and self-reported work performance|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235275530_Exercising_at_work_and_self-reported_work_performance|journal=International Journal of Workplace Health Management|volume=1|issue=3|pages=176–197|doi=10.1108/17538350810926534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise can also be promoted by encouraging alternative means of transportation (e.g., cycling, walking, running) to and from the building. Providing facilities such as bicycle storage and locker/changing rooms can increase the appeal of cycling, walking, or running. Active workstations, such as of sit/stand desks, treadmill desks, or cycle desks, can encourage increased movement and exercise as well.

== Occupant engagement ==
While some components of healthy buildings are inherently designed into the built environment, other components rely on the behavioral change of occupants, users, or organizations residing within the building. “Behavioral measures” can be taken to “encourage better public health outcomes: e.g., reducing sedentary behaviors by increasing access to stairways, using more active transportation options, and working at sit-to-stand desks.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/office-of-governmentwide-policy/office-of-federal-highperformance-buildings/policy/green-building-advisory-committee/advice-letters-and-resolutions|title=Green Building Advisory Committee - Advice Letter and Report: Recommendations for Adoption of Health and Wellness Policies for Federal Facilities|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gsa.gov|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples that can promote health and well-being include establishing [[workplace wellness]] programs, health promotion campaigns, and encouraging activity and collaboration.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Hyperemesis gravidarum''' ('''HG''') is a [[complication of pregnancy|pregnancy complication]] that is characterized by severe [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[weight loss]], and possibly [[dehydration]].&lt;ref name=Drug2013&gt;{{cite journal|title=Management of hyperemesis gravidarum.|journal=Drug Ther Bull|date=November 2013|volume=51|issue=11|pages=129-9|doi=10.1136/dtb.2013.11.0215|pmid=24227770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs and symptoms may also include vomiting many times a day and [[Lightheadedness|feeling faint]].&lt;ref name=Women2010/&gt; Hyperemesis gravidarum is considered more severe than [[morning sickness]].&lt;ref name=Women2010/&gt; Often symptoms get better after the 20th week of pregnancy but may last the entire pregnancy duration.&lt;ref name=Women2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Pregnancy|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-are-pregnant/pregnancy-complications.html|website=Office on Women's Health|accessdate=5 December 2015|date=September 27, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210060201/http://womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-are-pregnant/pregnancy-complications.html|archivedate=10 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The exact causes of hyperemesis gravidarum are unknown.&lt;ref name=BMC2010/&gt; Risk factors include the first pregnancy, [[multiple pregnancy]], obesity, prior or family history of HG, [[trophoblastic disorder]], and a history of [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=BMC2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=Fred F.|title=Ferri's clinical advisor 2013 5 books in 1|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|isbn=9780323083737|page=538|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=OR3VERnvzzEC&amp;pg=PA538|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208051113/https://books.google.ca/books?id=OR3VERnvzzEC&amp;pg=PA538|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is usually made based on the observed signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name=BMC2010/&gt; HG has been technically defined as more than three episodes of vomiting per day such that weight loss of 5% or three [[kilogram]]s has occurred and [[Ketone bodies|ketones]] are present in the urine.&lt;ref name=BMC2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jueckstock|first1=JK|last2=Kaestner|first2=R|last3=Mylonas|first3=I|title=Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge.|journal=BMC Medicine|date=15 July 2010|volume=8|pages=46|pmid=20633258|doi=10.1186/1741-7015-8-46|pmc=2913953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other potential causes of the symptoms should be excluded including [[urinary tract infection]] and [[thyrotoxicosis|high thyroid levels]].&lt;ref name=Sheehan07/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Treatment includes drinking fluids and a bland diet.&lt;ref name=Women2010/&gt; Recommendations may include [[electrolyte-replacement drinks]], [[thiamine]], and a higher protein diet.&lt;ref name=BMC2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gab2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gabbe|first1=Steven G.|title=Obstetrics : normal and problem pregnancies|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|isbn=9781437719352|page=117|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=-3ufSTqeb6cC&amp;pg=PA117|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208074242/https://books.google.ca/books?id=-3ufSTqeb6cC&amp;pg=PA117|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women require [[intravenous fluids]].&lt;ref name=Women2010/&gt; With respect to medications [[pyridoxine]] or [[metoclopramide]] are preferred.&lt;ref name=Sheehan07/&gt; [[Prochlorperazine]], [[dimenhydrinate]], or [[ondansetron]] may be used if these are not effective.&lt;ref name=BMC2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sheehan07/&gt; Hospitalization may be required.&lt;ref name=BMC2010/&gt; [[Psychotherapy]] may improve outcomes.&lt;ref name=BMC2010/&gt; Evidence for [[acupressure]] is poor.&lt;ref name=BMC2010/&gt;

&lt;!-- History, epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
While vomiting in pregnancy has been described as early as 2,000 BC, the first clear medical description of hyperemesis gravidarum was in 1852 by [[Antoine Dubois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Christopher J.|title=Nausea and Vomiting : Mechanisms and Treatment|date=1986|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642704796|page=152|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ufoqBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208045341/https://books.google.ca/books?id=ufoqBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperemesis gravidarum is estimated to affect 0.3–2.0% of pregnant women.&lt;ref name=Goodwin2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=TM|title=Hyperemesis gravidarum|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America|date=September 2008|volume=35|issue=3|pages=401–17, viii|pmid=18760227|doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2008.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; While previously known as a common cause of death in pregnancy, with proper treatment this is now very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kumar|first1=Geeta|title=Early Pregnancy Issues for the MRCOG and Beyond|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107717992|page=Chapter 6|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=lfSUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208043543/https://books.google.ca/books?id=lfSUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeLegge|first1=Mark H.|title=Handbook of home nutrition support|date=2007|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=9780763747695|page=320|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=KtSF221KP-0C&amp;pg=PA320|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208055738/https://books.google.ca/books?id=KtSF221KP-0C&amp;pg=PA320|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected have a lower risk of [[miscarriage]] but a higher risk of [[premature birth]].&lt;ref name=Fer2013 /&gt; Some pregnant women choose to have an [[abortion]] due to HG's symptoms.&lt;ref name=Gab2012/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
When vomiting is severe, it may result in the following:&lt;ref name="Emergency"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Summers A |title=Emergency management of hyperemesis gravidarum |journal=Emergency Nurse |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=24–8 |year=2012 |pmid=22876404 |doi=10.7748/en2012.07.20.4.24.c9206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Loss of 5% or more of pre-pregnancy [[body weight]]
* [[Dehydration]], causing [[ketosis]],&lt;ref name="Ahmed2013"/&gt; and [[constipation]]
* [[Nutrition disorder|Nutritional disorders]], such as [[Vitamin B1 deficiency|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (thiamine) deficiency]], [[Vitamin B6 deficiency|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (pyridoxine) deficiency]] or [[vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (cobalamin) deficiency]]
* [[Metabolism|Metabolic]] imbalances such as metabolic [[ketoacidosis]]&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt; or [[thyrotoxicosis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Matthews DC, Syed AA |title=The role of TSH receptor antibodies in the management of Graves' disease |journal=European Journal of Internal Medicine |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=213–6 |year=2011 |pmid=21570635 |doi=10.1016/j.ejim.2011.02.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical and emotional [[stress (biology)|stress]]
* Difficulty with [[activities of daily living]]

Symptoms can be aggravated by [[hunger]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[prenatal vitamins]] (especially those containing [[iron]]), and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].&lt;ref name="Guide to Women's Health"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carlson, Karen J., MD |author2=Eisenstat, Stephanie J., MD |author3=Ziporyn, Terra |title=The New Harvard Guide to Women's Health|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-01343-3 |pages=392–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people with HG are extremely sensitive to [[odor]]s in their environment; certain smells may exacerbate symptoms. Excessive salivation, also known as [[sialorrhea gravidarum]], is another symptom experienced by some women.

Hyperemesis gravidarum tends to occur in the first trimester of [[pregnancy]]&lt;ref name="Ahmed2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ahmed KT, Almashhrawi AA, Rahman RN, Hammoud GM, Ibdah JA|title=Liver diseases in pregnancy: diseases unique to pregnancy|journal=World J Gastroenterol |volume=19 |issue=43 |pages=7639–46 |date=November 2013|pmid= 24282353|pmc=3837262| doi=10.3748/wjg.v19.i43.7639|last2=Almashhrawi|last3=Rahman|last4=Hammoud|last5=Ibdah}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lasts significantly longer than morning sickness. While most women will experience near-complete relief of morning sickness symptoms near the beginning of their [[second trimester]], some sufferers of HG will experience severe symptoms until they give birth to their baby, and sometimes even after giving birth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Do I Have Morning Sickness or HG?|url=http://www.helpher.org/mothers/hyperemesis-or-morning-sickness/index.php|publisher=H.E.R.

A small percentage rarely vomit, but the nausea still causes most (if not all) of the same issues that hyperemesis with vomiting does.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Causes==
There are numerous theories regarding the cause of HG, but the cause remains controversial. It is thought that HG is due to a combination of factors which may vary between women and include [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt; Women with family members who had HG are more likely to develop the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang Y, Cantor RM, MacGibbon K, Romero R, Goodwin TM, Mullin PM, Fejzo MS |title=Familial aggregation of hyperemesis gravidarum |journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=204 |issue=3 |pages=230.e1–7 |year=2011 |pmid=20974461 |pmc=3030697 |doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2010.09.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor is an [[adverse effect|adverse reaction]] to the hormonal changes of pregnancy, in particular, elevated levels of beta [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (β-hCG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=LA|title=Biological functions of hCG and hCG-related molecules |journal=Reproductive biology and endocrinology |volume=8 |issue=102 |pages=102|date=August 2010|pmid=20735820 |doi=10.1186/1477-7827-8-102 |pmc=2936313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15157839"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hershman JM |title=Physiological and pathological aspects of the effect of human chorionic gonadotropin on the thyroid |journal=Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=249–65 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15157839 |doi=10.1016/j.beem.2004.03.010|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1521690X0400020X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory would also explain why hyperemesis gravidarum is most frequently encountered in the first trimester (often around 8–12 weeks of gestation), as β-hCG levels are highest at that time and decline afterward. Another postulated cause of HG is an increase in maternal levels of [[estrogen]]s (decreasing [[intestinal motility]] and [[gastric emptying]] leading to nausea/vomiting).&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Morning sickness.svg|thumb|275px|Morning sickness]]
Although the [[pathophysiology]] of HG is poorly understood, the most commonly accepted theory suggests that levels of [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|β-hCG]] are associated with it.&lt;ref name=Sheehan07/&gt; [[Leptin]], a hormone that inhibits hunger, may also play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aka N, Atalay S, Sayharman S, Kiliç D, Köse G, Küçüközkan T |title=Leptin and leptin receptor levels in pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum |journal=The Australian &amp; New Zealand journal of obstetrics &amp; gynaecology |volume=46|issue=4 |pages=274–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16866785 |doi=10.1111/j.1479-828X.2006.00590.x|last2=Atalay |last3=Sayharman |last4=Kiliç |last5=Köse |last6=Küçüközkan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Hyperemesis gravidarum is considered a [[diagnosis of exclusion]].&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt; HG can be associated with serious problems in the mother or baby, such as [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]], [[coagulopathy]] and [[peripheral neuropathy]].&lt;ref name=Sheehan07&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afpbackissues/2007/200709/200709sheenan.pdf |last1=Sheehan |first1=P |title=Hyperemesis gravidarum—assessment and management |journal=Australian Family Physician |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=698–701 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17885701 |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606225903/http://www.racgp.org.au/afpbackissues/2007/200709/200709sheenan.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum often are dehydrated and lose weight despite efforts to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/healthy_living/pregnancy/hic_hyperemesis_gravidarum_severe_nausea_and_vomiting_during_pregnancy.aspx |title=Hyperemesis Gravidarum (Severe Nausea and Vomiting During Pregnancy) |year=2012 |work= |publisher=Cleveland Clinic |accessdate=23 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215124015/http://my.clevelandclinic.org/healthy_living/pregnancy/hic_hyperemesis_gravidarum_severe_nausea_and_vomiting_during_pregnancy.aspx |archivedate=15 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Medline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001499.htm |title=Hyperemesis gravidarum |author=Medline Plus |year=2012 |work= |publisher=National Institutes of Health |accessdate=30 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127162906/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001499.htm |archivedate=27 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of the nausea and vomiting in hyperemesis gravidarum is typically before the 20th week of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt;

===Investigations===
Common investigations include [[blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN) and electrolytes, [[liver function tests]], [[urinalysis]],&lt;ref name="Medline"/&gt; and [[thyroid function tests]]. Hematological investigations include [[hematocrit]] levels, which are usually raised in HG.&lt;ref name="Medline" /&gt; An [[ultrasound scan]] may be needed to know gestational status and to exclude molar or partial molar pregnancy.&lt;ref name=manual7&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Arthur T.|editor-last=Evans|title=Manual of obstetrics|year=2007|publisher=Wolters Kluwer / Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781796965|pages=265–8|edition=7th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWKW3KZv9roC&amp;pg=PA265|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911002137/https://books.google.com/books?id=NWKW3KZv9roC&amp;pg=PA265|archivedate=2017-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Dry bland food and [[Oral rehydration therapy|oral rehydration]] are first-line treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-are-pregnant/pregnancy-complications.html |title=Pregnancy Complications |author=Office on Women's Health |year=2010 |work= |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=27 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192747/http://womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-are-pregnant/pregnancy-complications.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the potential for severe dehydration and other complications, HG is treated as an emergency. If conservative dietary measures fail, more extensive treatment such as the use of [[antiemetic]] medications and intravenous [[Fluid replacement|rehydration]] may be required. If oral nutrition is insufficient, [[Parenteral nutrition|intravenous nutritional support]] may be needed.&lt;ref name="Ahmed2013"/&gt; For women who require hospital admission, [[Compression stockings|thromboembolic stockings]] or [[Low molecular weight heparin|low-molecular-weight heparin]] may be used as [[thromboprophylaxis|measures to prevent the formation of a blood clot]].&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt;

===Intravenous fluids===
[[Intravenous therapy|Intravenous (IV) hydration]] often includes supplementation of [[electrolyte]]s as persistent vomiting frequently leads to a deficiency. Likewise, supplementation for lost [[thiamine]] (Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) must be considered to reduce the risk of [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]].&lt;ref name="BNF"&gt;{{cite book | author=British National Formulary | authorlink=British National Formulary | title=BNF | edition=45 |date=March 2003 | chapter=4.6 Drugs used in nausea and vertigo – Vomiting of pregnancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A and B vitamins are depleted within two weeks, so extended malnutrition indicates a need for evaluation and supplementation. In addition, electrolyte levels should be monitored and supplemented; of particular concern are [[sodium]] and [[potassium]].

After IV rehydration is completed, patients typically begin to tolerate frequent small liquid or bland meals. After rehydration, treatment focuses on managing symptoms to allow normal intake of food. However, cycles of hydration and dehydration can occur, making continuing care necessary. Home care is available in the form of a [[PICC line|peripherally-inserted central catheter (PICC) line]] for hydration and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tuot|first1=D|last2=Gibson|first2=S|last3=Caughey|first3=AB|last4=Frassetto|first4=LA|title=Intradialytic hyperalimentation as adjuvant support in pregnant hemodialysis patients: case report and review of the literature|journal=International urology and nephrology|date=March 2010|volume=42|issue=1|pages=233–7|pmid=19911296|doi=10.1007/s11255-009-9671-5|pmc=2844957}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Home treatment is often less expensive and reduces the risk for a [[hospital-acquired infection]] compared with long-term or repeated hospitalizations.

===Medications===
A number of [[antiemetic]]s are effective and safe in pregnancy including: [[pyridoxine/doxylamine]], [[antihistamines]] (such as [[diphenhydramine]]), and [[phenothiazines]] (such as [[promethazine]]).&lt;ref name=BMJ2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarvis|first1=S|last2=Nelson-Piercy|first2= C|title=Management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=June 2011|volume=342|pages=d3606|pmid=21685438|doi=10.1136/bmj.d3606}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to effectiveness, it is unknown if one is superior to another for relieving nausea or vomiting.&lt;ref name=BMJ2011/&gt; Limited evidence from published clinical trials suggests the use of medications to treat hyperemesis gravidarum.&lt;ref name="matthews2015" /&gt;

While pyridoxine/doxylamine, a combination of [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[doxylamine]], is effective in [[nausea and vomiting of pregnancy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=PC|last2=Omar|first2=SZ|title=Contemporary approaches to hyperemesis during pregnancy|journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=April 2011|volume=23|issue=2|pages=87–93|pmid=21297474|doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e328342d208}}&lt;/ref&gt; some have questioned its effectiveness in HG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tamay|first1=AG|last2=Kuşçu|first2= NK|title=Hyperemesis gravidarum: current aspect|journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|date=November 2011|volume=31|issue=8|pages=708–12|pmid=22085059|doi=10.3109/01443615.2011.611918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ondansetron]] may be beneficial, however, there are some concerns regarding an association with [[cleft palate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koren|first=G|title=Motherisk update. Is ondansetron safe for use during pregnancy?|journal=Canadian Family Physician|date=October 2012|volume=58|issue=10|pages=1092–3|pmid=23064917|pmc=3470505}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is little high-quality data.&lt;ref name="BMJ2011" /&gt; [[Metoclopramide]] is also used and relatively well tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=PC|last2=Omar|first2= SZ|title=Contemporary approaches to hyperemesis during pregnancy|journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=April 2011|volume=23|issue=2|pages=87–93|pmid=21297474|doi=10.1097/GCO.0b013e328342d208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the use of [[corticosteroid]]s is weak; there is some evidence that corticosteroid use in pregnant women may slightly increase the risk of [[cleft lip and cleft palate]] in the infant and may suppress fetal adrenal activity.&lt;ref name="Emergency" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poon|first=SL|title=Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: Best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. BET 2: Steroid therapy in the treatment of intractable hyperemesis gravidarum|journal=Emergency medicine journal : EMJ|date=October 2011|volume=28|issue=10|pages=898–900|pmid=21918097|doi=10.1136/emermed-2011-200636}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[hydrocortisone]] and [[prednisolone]] are inactivated in the placenta and may be used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum after 12 weeks.&lt;ref name="Emergency" /&gt;

===Nutritional support===
Women not responding to IV rehydration and medication may require nutritional support. Patients might receive [[parenteral nutrition]] (intravenous feeding via a PICC line) or enteral nutrition (via a [[nasogastric tube]] or a [[nasojejunal tube]]). There is only limited evidence from trials to support the use of [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] to improve outcome.&lt;ref name="matthews2015" /&gt; An oversupply of nutrition ({{Nbsp}}[[hyperalimentation]]) may be necessary in certain cases to help maintain volume requirements and allow weight gain.&lt;ref name=manual7 /&gt; A physician might also prescribe [[Vitamin B1|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] (to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy) and [[folic acid]].&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt;

===Alternative medicine===
[[Acupuncture]] (both with P6 and traditional method) has been found to be ineffective.&lt;ref name=matthews2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Anne|last2=Haas|first2=David M.|last3=O'Mathúna|first3=Dónal P.|last4=Dowswell|first4=Therese|date=2015-09-08|year=|title=Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=9|pages=CD007575|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007575.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26348534|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[ginger]] products may be helpful, but evidence of effectiveness is limited and inconsistent, though three recent studies support ginger over [[Placebo effect|placebo]].&lt;ref name=matthews2015 /&gt;

==Complications==

===Pregnant woman===
If HG is inadequately treated, [[anemia]],&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt; [[hyponatremia]],&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt; [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]],&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt; [[kidney failure]], [[central pontine myelinolysis]], [[coagulopathy]], [[atrophy]], [[Mallory–Weiss syndrome|Mallory-Weiss tear]]s,&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt; [[hypoglycemia]], [[jaundice]], [[malnutrition]], [[pneumomediastinum]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[deconditioning]], [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[pulmonary embolism]], splenic avulsion, or [[vasospasm]]s of [[cerebral arteries]] are possible consequences. [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Christodoulou-Smith J, Gold JI, Romero R, Goodwin TM, Macgibbon KW, Mullin PM, Fejzo MS |title=Posttraumatic stress symptoms following pregnancy complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum |journal=The Journal of Maternal-fetal &amp; Neonatal Medicine |volume=24 |issue=11 |pages=1307–11 |year=2011 |pmid=21635201 |pmc=3514078 |doi=10.3109/14767058.2011.582904 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are common secondary [[complication (medicine)|complications]] of HG and emotional support can be beneficial.&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt;

===Infant===
The effects of HG on the fetus are mainly due to [[electrolyte imbalance]]s caused by HG in the mother.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Thomas H. |editor-last=Bourne, |editor2-first=George |editor2-last=Condous|title=Handbook of early pregnancy care|year=2006|publisher=Informa Healthcare |isbn=9781842143230|pages=149–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants of women with severe hyperemesis who gain less than {{Convert|7|kg|}} during pregnancy tend to be of lower [[birth weight]], [[small for gestational age]], and born before 37 weeks gestation.&lt;ref name="Ahmed2013"/&gt; In contrast, infants of women with hyperemesis who have a pregnancy weight gain of more than 7&amp;nbsp;kilograms appear similar to infants from uncomplicated pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dodds L, Fell DB, Joseph KS, Allen VM, Butler B. |title=Outcomes of pregnancies complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum |journal=Obstet.

==Epidemiology==
Vomiting is a common condition affecting about 50% of pregnant women, with another 25% having nausea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp1003896 | last1 = Niebyl | first1 = Jennifer R. | year = 2010| title = Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 16| pages = 1544–50 | pmid = 20942670 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the incidence of HG is only 0.3–1.5%.&lt;ref name=Sheehan07/&gt; After preterm labor, hyperemesis gravidarum is the second most common reason for hospital admission during the first half of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt; Factors, such as infection with ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', a rise in [[thyroid hormone]] production, low age, low [[body mass index]] prior to pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, [[Hydatidiform mole|molar pregnancies]], and a past history of hyperemesis gravidarum have been associated with the development of HG.&lt;ref name="Emergency"/&gt;

==History==
[[Thalidomide]] was prescribed for treatment of HG in Europe until it was recognized that thalidomide is [[teratogenic]] and is a cause of [[phocomelia]] in neonates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Cohen|editor-first=Wayne R.|title=Cherry and Merkatz's complications of pregnancy.|year=2000|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780683016734|pages=124|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Hyperemesis gravidarum is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''hyper-'', meaning excessive, and ''emesis'', meaning [[vomiting]], and the [[Latin]] ''gravidarum'', the feminine genitive plural form of an adjective, here used as a noun, meaning "pregnant [woman]". Therefore, hyperemesis gravidarum means "excessive vomiting of pregnant women".

==Notable cases==
Author [[Charlotte Brontë]] is often thought to have suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum. She died in 1855 while four months pregnant, having been afflicted by intractable nausea and vomiting throughout her pregnancy, and was unable to tolerate food or even water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McSweeny|first=Linda|title=What is acute morning sickness?|url=http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/what-is-acute-morning-sickness-20100602-wzuy.html|accessdate=2012-12-04|newspaper=The Age|date=2010-06-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206055217/http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/what-is-acute-morning-sickness-20100602-wzuy.html|archivedate=2012-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]] was hospitalised due to hyperemesis gravidarum during her first pregnancy, and was treated for a similar condition during the subsequent two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/prince-william-kate-expecting-2nd-child-1.2758929 |title=Prince William, Kate expecting 2nd child |date=8 September 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908133456/http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/prince-william-kate-expecting-2nd-child-1.2758929 |archivedate=8 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/904633975381127168|title=Read the press release in full ↓pic.twitter.com/vDTgGD2aGF|last=Kensington Palace|first=|date=2017-09-04|website=@KensingtonRoyal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904205914/https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/904633975381127168|archive-date=2017-09-04|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4277">The '''inverse benefit law''' states that the ratio of benefits to harms among patients taking new [[drug]]s tends to vary inversely with how extensively a drug is [[marketed]]. Two Americans, Howard Brody and Donald Light, have defined the inverse benefit law, inspired by [[Julian Tudor Hart|Tudor Hart]]'s [[inverse care law]].&lt;ref name=pmid21233426&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2010.199844 |pmid=21233426 |pmc=3036704 |title=The Inverse Benefit Law: How Drug Marketing Undermines Patient Safety and Public Health |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=399–404 |year=2011 |last1=Brody |first1=Howard |last2=Light |first2=Donald W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A drug [[effective]] for a serious [[Disorder (medicine)|disorder]] is less and less effective as it is promoted for milder cases and for other conditions for which the drug was not approved. Although [[effectiveness]] becomes more diluted, the risks of harmful [[side effects]] persist, and thus the benefit-harm ratio worsens as a drug is [[marketing|marketed]] more widely. The inverse benefit law highlights the need for [[comparative effectiveness research]] and other reforms to improve [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] prescribing.&lt;ref name=pmid21233426/&gt;

== State of affairs ==
The law is manifested through 6 basic marketing strategies:
* reducing thresholds for diagnosing disease,
* relying on surrogate endpoints,
* exaggerating [[safety]] claims,
* exaggerating [[efficacy]] claims,
* [[Disease mongering|creating new diseases]],
* encouraging unapproved uses.

== Impact ==
This is the reason why organizations like "Worst Pill, Best Pill" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpills.org/ |title=Worst Pill, Best Pill. Public Citizen's Health Research Group |publisher=Worstpills.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommend not to use/prescribe new medications before being in the market for at least ten years (except in the case of important new drugs that treat previously unsolved problems).

Agencies of drugs, committee of ethics and organizations of patients' safety should consider: 
* Requiring that clinical trials run long enough to pick up evidence of side effects and record all adverse reactions, including in subjects who drop out.&lt;ref name=pmid10328077&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.281.18.1753 |pmid=10328077 |title=The Safety of New Medicines |journal=JAMA |volume=281 |issue=18 |pages=1753–4 |year=1999 |last1=Wood |first1=Alastair J. J }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paying companies more for new drugs in proportion to how much better they are for patients than existing drugs, and marketing according to the value of the new drugs (ratio of benefits to harms and marketing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.prescrire.org/en/81/168/46799/0/NewsDetails.aspx |title=Astellas' lawsuit against Prescrire: French court rules that Prescrire did not "denigrate" Protopic° (tacrolimus). Prescrire. 2 March 2011 |publisher=English.prescrire.org |date=2011-03-02 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Considering that market could be a force against the best use of medications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actasanitaria.com/el-mirador-de-juan-gervas-garum/ Gérvas J. Garum. Acta Sanitaria. 07/03/2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand Italian|Magistrato alla Sanità|date=August 2018}}

The '''Magistrate for Health''' ({{lang-it|Magistrato alla Sanità}}) was a magistracy of the [[Republic of Venice]] instituted in 1485 to manage public health in the city of Venice and its territories, with specific attention to preventing the spread of epidemics within the maritime republic. The magistracy was expanded several times, notably in 1556 with the introduction of a supervisory role and in 1563 with a regulatory body. It was among the first health authorities in Europe to institute public inoculation projects to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The office of the Magistrate for Health was retained until the [[Fall of the Republic of Venice]], during which tumultuous time it was briefly replaced by a health committee and eventually superseded by other magistracies entirely.

[[File:Avviso di inoculazione antivaiolosa 1770.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of a 1770 smallpox variolation notice from the Archive of the Superintendents for Health of the Republic of Venice.]]

==Organisation==

The Magistrate for Health initially comprised three superintendents appointed by the [[Venetian Senate]], but fell under the jurisdiction of the [[Great Council of Venice]] in 1537. In 1556, it was expanded with two supervisors tasked with directing and controlling the work of the superintendents in the name of the Republic. In 1563, a regulatory body for the activities of the Magistrate for Health was introduced in the form of a college of ten “wise men” ({{lang-it|Savi}}) who were elected individually by the Venetian Senate.

The authority of the Magistrate for Health extended not only to the entirety of the [[Venetian Lagoon]] but also to the other cities of the Venetian Republic by means of establishing health offices in each. Extensive infrastructure was introduced in the [[Venetian rule in the Ionian Islands|Ionian Islands]], which were viewed particularly throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as likely sources of disease outbreaks due to its proximity to [[Asia Minor]] and by extension the [[Ottoman Empire]]. &lt;ref name="Ionian"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Katerina Konstantinidou, Elpis Mantadakis, Matthew E. Falagas, Thalia Sardi &amp; George Samonis | title = Venetian rule and control of plague epidemics on the Ionian Islands during 17th and 18th centuries | journal = [[Emerging infectious diseases]] | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–43
 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.3201/eid1501.071545 | pmid = 19116047 | pmc = 2660681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fall of the Republic of Venice]], as [[Napoleon]]’s troops were occupying the Republic’s territory with numerous reforms to government and infrastructure, the office of the Magistrate for Health was folded into the Health Committee ({{lang-it|Comitato di Sanità}}) for a short period of time before eventually being disbanded, with its duties assigned to other magistracies.

==Function==

Upon its institution as a permanent body, the Magistrate for Health was tasked with safeguarding the public health of the state, with particular attention to preventing the spread of foreign diseases within the republic’s territory, a regular threat for a city with such extensive reliance on trade routes bearing risk of contact with foreign outbreaks (notably in the 1347 outbreak of the [[Black Death]], in which Venice’s interactions with seagoing vessels had made it one of the first cities in Europe to be devastated by the plague). In order to do so, the superintendents (and upon their introduction, the supervisors) were empowered with numerous legal authorities, including the right to pronounce capital punishment, ostensibly for purposes of [[quarantine]]. 

The officials of the Magistrate for Health exercised their authority in supervising a wide range of professions and services: in addition to the colleges of barbers and physicians, it regularly supervised the food industry, [[Leper colony|lazar houses]], waste disposal, sewage and water management and mortuary services. It was also known to interact with prostitutes, vagrants, beggars and guesthouses, further aiding the surveillance of possible transmission of foreign maladies within their jurisdiction. However, in many cases, their authority was often not direct; for example, the lazar houses, or ''lazaretti'', were able to bypass local health authorities and report directly to the regional government in times of low disease activity, only falling under the health office’s direct jurisdiction in times of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Konstantinidou |first=Katerina |date=2007 |title= The disaster creeps crawling… The plague epidemics of the Ionian Islands|language=Greek|publisher=Hellenic Institute of Byzantine and Post Byzantine Studies|publication-place = Venice (Italy)|pages=55–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venetian Magistrate for Health was the second health provider in Italy to introduce [[variolation]], which had only recently been introduced to Europe from eastern schools of medicine, as a means of [[inoculation]] against smallpox, preceded only by the Hospital of Santa Maria degli Innocenti in Florence, and the first to offer it freely to the public for purposes of [[herd immunity]].

Despite their precautions, epidemics continued to occur regularly in Venice. The [[Black Death#Recurrence|outbreak of plague]] of 1576–1577 killed around 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population;&lt;ref&gt;"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fQxAkrbksTEC&amp;pg=PA41 Medicine and society in early modern Europe]''".

==Archive==

The Archive of the Superintendents for Health contains nearly four centuries of documentation on not only the conditions of public health and sanitation within the Venetian Republic, but also of other contemporary states, on account of the extensive information gathered by the officials from their foreign counterparts as part of their regular surveillance of potential foreign-borne epidemics. The inventory for the archive, along with an index of names and locations, was published by Salvatore Carbone in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Carbone, Salvatore.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5082">A '''maternity hospital''' specializes in caring for women during [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]]. It also provides care for newborn [[infant]]s, and may act as a centre for clinical training in [[midwifery]] and [[obstetrics]]. Formerly known as [[lying-in]] hospitals, most of them, like [[cottage hospital]]s, have been absorbed into larger [[general hospital]]s, where they operate as the maternity department.

==History==
[[File:General Lying-in Hospital ES.jpg|thumb|The premises of the former [[General Lying-In Hospital]], now a hotel]]
Maternity hospitals in the United Kingdom can be traced back to a number of 18th century establishments in London and Dublin. Prior to these foundations, childbirth was a domestic occasion. The term coined for these establishments, but now [[archaism|archaic]], is "a lying-in hospital", referring to the custom of [[lying-in]], prolonged [[bedrest]] after childbirth, better known now as [[postpartum confinement]].

The first noted lying-in hospital appears to be one founded by Sir [[Richard Manningham]] in [[Jermyn Street]], London, in 1739 and which evolved into the [[Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital|Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital]]. A better documented foundation is that of the [[Rotunda Hospital|Dublin Lying-In Hospital]], established in 1745 by [[Bartholomew Mosse]], and which served as a model for three subsequent London foundations: the [[British Lying-In Hospital]], a 1749 establishment in [[Holborn]]; the 1750 [[City of London Maternity Hospital|City of London Lying-In Hospital]], in [[City of London|the City]]; and the [[General Lying-In Hospital]] on [[Westminster Bridge Road]], established in 1767.&lt;ref name="AIM25"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=11905&amp;inst_id=118|website=AIM25 - Archives in London and the M25 area|title=Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LMA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Leaflet Number 35 Records of patients in London hospitals|website=London Metropolitan Archives|publisher=City of London|accessdate=3 September 2016|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/35-records-of-patients-in-london-hospitals.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofqueench00ryan |title=The history of Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital |first=Thomas |last=Ryan |date=1885|pages=ix-xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other such hospitals were formed in the mid-18th century. All of these were run by male physicians, women being blocked from completing training as doctors until the 1870s. 

The first maternity hospital founded and run by a woman was [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]]'s [[New Hospital for Women]], which evolved from an existing dispensary in the 1770s, and was renamed in 1918 the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital.&lt;ref name="UCLH"&gt;[http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our+hospitals/university+college+hospital+elizabeth+garrett+anderson+wing.htm UCLH - Our hospitals - University College Hospital Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Wing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411051037/http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/Our+hospitals/University+College+Hospital+Elizabeth+Garrett+Anderson+Wing.htm |date=2009-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2007-10-28 | title='Run by Women, (mainly) for Women': Medical Women's Hospitals in Britain, 1866-1948 | url=http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/rodopi/00457183/v61n1/s7.pdf?expires=1193614133&amp;id=40280224&amp;titleid=484&amp;accname=Guest+User&amp;checksum=52F76CF81F43E1C0AF4A8643DEEC9AEB | last=Elston | first=Mary Ann | format=pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707212420/http://docserver.ingentaconnect.com/deliver/connect/rodopi/00457183/v61n1/s7.pdf?expires=1193614133&amp;id=40280224&amp;titleid=484&amp;accname=Guest+User&amp;checksum=52F76CF81F43E1C0AF4A8643DEEC9AEB | archivedate=2012-07-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/rodopi/clio/2001/00000061/00000001/art00007 | title = 'Run by Women, (mainly) for Women': Medical Women's Hospitals in Britain, 1866-1948 | publisher = [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]] | accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3197216 | title = Elizabeth Garrett Anderson - Victorian Women's Campaigner | publisher = [[BBC]] |date=December 2004 | accessdate = 2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work continues in the modern Elizabeth Garrett Anderson maternity wing of [[University College Hospital]], part of UCLH NHS Foundation Trust.

==Today==
The [[Portland Hospital]] in central London was created in 1983 as a [[private hospital]], i.e. not part of the [[National Health Service]]. Also in 1983, the [[Rosie Hospital]] opened in Cambridge, next to [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]].

The [[National Maternity Hospital, Dublin]] is the largest mother-and-baby hospital in Ireland.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
The '''menstrual cycle''' is the regular natural change that occurs in the [[female reproductive system]] (specifically the [[uterus]] and [[ovary|ovaries]]) that makes [[pregnancy]] possible.&lt;ref name=Silverthorn&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Silverthorn |first1 = Dee Unglaub |title = Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach |edition=6th |publisher = Pearson Education |location = Glenview, IL |year = 2013 | isbn = 0-321-75007-1 |pages=850–890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwood&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Sherwood |first1 = Laurelee |title = Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems | edition=8th |publisher = Cengage |location = Belmont, California | year = 2013 |isbn = 1-111-57743-9 |pages=735–794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle is required for the production of oocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Silverthorn /&gt; Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; Common symptoms include [[acne vulgaris|acne]], tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes.&lt;ref name=Women2014PMS&gt;{{cite web|title=Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) fact sheet|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/premenstrual-syndrome.html|website=Office on Women's Health, USA|accessdate=23 June 2015|date=December 23, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628073755/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/premenstrual-syndrome.html|archivedate=28 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as [[premenstrual syndrome]] in 20 to 30% of women.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=AFP2011/&gt; --&gt; In 3 to 8%, they are severe.&lt;ref name=AFP2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biggs|first1=WS|last2=Demuth|first2=RH|title=Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder.|journal=[[American Family Physician]]|date=15 October 2011|volume=84|issue=8|pages=918–24|pmid=22010771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Mechanism --&gt;
The menstrual cycle is governed by hormonal changes.&lt;ref name=Women2014Men/&gt; These changes can be altered by using [[hormonal birth control]] to prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klump KL, Keel PK, Racine SE, Burt SA, Burt AS, Neale M, Sisk CL, Boker S, Hu JY | title = The interactive effects of estrogen and progesterone on changes in emotional eating across the menstrual cycle | journal = J Abnorm Psychol | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 131–7 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 22889242 | doi = 10.1037/a0029524 | pmc=3570621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each cycle can be divided into three phases based on events in the ovary (ovarian cycle) or in the uterus (uterine cycle).&lt;ref name=Silverthorn /&gt; The ovarian cycle consists of the [[follicular phase]], [[ovulation]], and [[luteal phase]] whereas the uterine cycle is divided into [[menstruation]], proliferative phase, and secretory phase.

Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of [[estrogen]] in the follicular phase, discharges of blood (menses) flow stop, and the [[Endometrium|lining]] of the uterus thickens. [[Ovarian follicle|Follicles]] in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24–36 hours after the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[ovocyte]], in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the [[endometrium|uterine lining]] changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation. Menstruation also occurs in closely related [[primate]]s ([[ape]]s and [[monkeys]]).&lt;ref name=Kris2013&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristin H.

The cessation of menstrual cycles at the end of a woman's reproductive period is termed [[menopause]]. The average age of menopause in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. Menopause before age 45 is considered ''premature'' in industrialised countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Clinical topic&amp;nbsp;— Menopause | work = NHS | url = http://www.cks.nhs.uk/menopause#-292420 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090707095123/http://www.cks.nhs.uk/menopause#-292420 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 7 July 2009 | accessdate = 2 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the age of menarche, the age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors;&lt;ref name=beyene&gt;{{cite book | first=Yewoubdar | last=Beyene | year=1989 | title=From Menarche to Menopause: Reproductive Lives of Peasant Women in Two Cultures | publisher=State University of New York Press| location=Albany, NY | isbn=0-88706-866-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Shuman | first = Tracy | title = Your Guide to Menopause | work = WebMD |date=February 2006 | url = http://www.webmd.com/content/article/9/2953_504.htm | accessdate = 16 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of a woman's menstrual cycle typically varies somewhat, with some shorter cycles and some longer cycles. A woman who experiences variations of less than eight days between her longest cycles and shortest cycles is considered to have regular menstrual cycles. It is unusual for a woman to experience cycle length variations of more than four days. Length variation between eight and 20 days is considered as moderately [[irregular cycles]]. Variation of 21 days or more between a woman's shortest and longest cycle lengths is considered very irregular. &lt;!--(see [[#Cycle abnormalities|cycle abnormalities]])--&gt;&lt;ref name=kippley&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Kippley |first2=Sheila |last2=Kippley |year=1996 |title=The Art of Natural Family Planning |edition=4th |publisher=The Couple to Couple League |location=Cincinnati |isbn=978-0-926412-13-2 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days. The variability of menstrual cycle lengths is highest for women under 25 years of age and is lowest, that is, most regular, for ages 25 to 39.&lt;ref name=Chiazze1968&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chiazze L, Brayer FT, Macisco JJ, Parker MP, Duffy BJ | title = The length and variability of the human menstrual cycle | journal = JAMA | volume = 203 | issue = 6 | pages = 377–80 | date = February 1968 | pmid = 5694118 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1968.03140060001001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the variability increases slightly for women aged 40 to 44.&lt;ref name=Chiazze1968/&gt;

Some women with [[Neurology|neurological conditions]] experience increased activity of their conditions at about the same time during each menstrual cycle. For example, drops in estrogen levels have been known to trigger [[migraines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyheadache.com/2006/04/linking_migrain.html |title=Migraine and Estrogen Officially Linked |publisher=The Daily Headache |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when the woman who suffers migraines is also taking the birth control pill. Many women with [[epilepsy]] have more seizures in a pattern linked to the menstrual cycle; this is called "[[catamenial epilepsy]]".&lt;ref name=pmid18164632&gt;{{cite journal | author = Herzog AG | title = Catamenial epilepsy: definition, prevalence pathophysiology and treatment | journal = Seizure | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–9 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18164632 | doi = 10.1016/j.seizure.2007.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different patterns seem to exist (such as seizures coinciding with the time of menstruation, or coinciding with the time of ovulation), and the frequency with which they occur has not been firmly established.

Mice have been used as an experimental system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of [[sex steroid]] hormones might regulate [[nervous system]] function. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when progesterone is highest, the level of [[Neuron|nerve-cell]] [[GABA A receptor|GABA receptor]] subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]], nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.&lt;ref name=Maguire&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maguire JL, Stell BM, Rafizadeh M, Mody I | title = Ovarian cycle-linked changes in GABA(A) receptors mediating tonic inhibition alter seizure susceptibility and anxiety | journal = Nat.

Among women living closely together, it was once thought that the onsets of menstruation tend to [[Menstrual synchrony|synchronize]]. This effect was first described in 1971, and possibly explained by the action of [[pheromone]]s in 1998.&lt;ref name=Mclintock&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stern K, McClintock MK | title = Regulation of ovulation by human pheromones | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = 6672 | pages = 177–9 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9515961 | doi = 10.1038/32408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Adams | first = Cecil | authorlink = Cecil Adams | title = Does menstrual synchrony really exist? | work = The Straight Dope | publisher = The Chicago Reader | date = 20 December 2002 | url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/021220.html | accessdate = 10 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most fertile period (the time with the highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from [[sexual intercourse]]) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation.&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), pp.242,374&lt;/ref&gt; In a 28‑day cycle with a 14‑day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week. A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called [[fertility awareness]].

There are many [[fertility testing]] methods, including [[Urinalysis|urine test]] kits that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs).&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|007062|LH urine test (home test)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called [[fertility monitors]]. Fertility awareness methods that rely on cycle length records alone are called [[calendar-based methods]].&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite journal |title=Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use:Fertility awareness-based methods | version = Third edition |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2004 |url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/mec/fab.html |accessdate=29 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods that require observation of one or more of the three primary fertility signs ([[basal body temperature]], [[cervical mucus]], and cervical position)&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), p.52&lt;/ref&gt; are known as symptoms-based methods.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

However, despite this hypothesis, a similar [[paternal age effect]] has also been observed.

As measured on women undergoing [[in vitro fertilization]], a longer menstrual cycle length is associated with higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment.&lt;ref name="Brodin2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brodin T, Bergh T, Berglund L, Hadziosmanovic N, Holte J | title = Menstrual cycle length is an age-independent marker of female fertility: Results from 6271 treatment cycles of in vitro fertilization | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 90 | issue = 5 | pages = 1656–1661 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18155201 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.09.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delivery rate]]s after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days.&lt;ref name="Brodin2008"/&gt; A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to [[gonadotropin]] stimulation and [[embryo quality]].&lt;ref name="Brodin2008"/&gt;

=== Mood and behavior ===
The different phases of the menstrual cycle correlate with women's [[Mood (psychology)|moods]]. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt PJ, Nieman LK, Danaceau MA, Adams LF, Rubinow DR | title = Differential behavioral effects of gonadal steroids in women with and in those without premenstrual syndrome | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 338 | issue = 4 | pages = 209–16 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9435325 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199801223380401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian [[hormones]] may contribute to increased [[empathy]] in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different phases of the menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the [[Follicular phase|follicular stage]] of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their [[Luteal phase|midluteal phase]]. A significant correlation between [[progesterone]] levels and the ability to accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on [[emotion recognition]] tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Derntl B, Hack RL, Kryspin-Exner I, Habel U | title = Association of menstrual cycle phase with the core components of empathy | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 63 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–104 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23098806 | pmc = 3549494 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.10.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.

[[Fear processing in the brain|Fear response]] in women during two different points in the menstrual cycle has been examined. When [[oestrogen|estrogen]] is highest in the [[Preovulatory|preovulatory stage]], women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwartz DH, Romans SE, Meiyappan S, De Souza MJ, Einstein G | title = The role of ovarian steroid hormones in mood | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 62 | issue = 4 | pages = 448–54 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22902271 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the examination of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of [[stress (biology)|stress]] or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pearson R, Lewis MB | title = Fear recognition across the menstrual cycle | journal = Horm Behav | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–71 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15708754 | doi = 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2004.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.

Sexual feelings and behaviors change during the menstrual cycle. Before and during ovulation, high levels of estrogen and [[androgen]]s result in women having an increased interest in sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discovering Human Sexuality|last=Levay|first=Simon|last2=Baldwin|first2=Janice|last3=Baldwin|first3=John|publisher=Sinauer Associtates, Inc.|year=2015|isbn=9781605352756|location=Massachusetts|pages=44|chapter=Women's Bodies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other animal species, women show interest in sex across all days of the menstrual cycle, regardless of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolutionary Biology of Human Female Sexuality|last=Thornhill|first=Randy|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780195340990|location=New York|pages=12|chapter=Background and Overview of the Book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preferences for facial features in mates can also change across the cycle.&lt;ref name=Thorn2008 /&gt; There has been no difference found in preference for long-term mating partners during the menstrual cycle; however, those seeking a short-term relationship were more likely to choose a partner with more masculine features than usual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leva2015/&gt; This was found to be the case especially during the woman's high conception risk stage and when salivary testosterone was high.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeBruine|first=Lisa|last2=Jones|first2=Benedict C.|last3=Frederick|first3=David A.|last4=Haselton|first4=Martie G.|last5=Penton-Voak|first5=Ian S.|last6=Perrett|first6=David I.|date=2010-01-01|title=Evidence for menstrual cycle shifts in women's preferences for masculinity: a response to Harris (in press) "Menstrual cycle and facial preferences reconsidered"|journal=Evolutionary Psychology: An International Journal of Evolutionary Approaches to Psychology and Behavior|volume=8|issue=4|pages=768–775|issn=1474-7049|pmid=22947833|doi=10.1177/147470491000800416}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when women are in the luteal (non-fertile) phase, they tend to prefer men (and females) with more feminine faces.&lt;ref name=Leva2015/&gt; A preference is also shown for self-resembling faces and apparent health in faces during the luteal phase of the cycle.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Benedict C.|last2=DeBruine|first2=Lisa M.|last3=Perrett|first3=David I.|last4=Little|first4=Anthony C.|last5=Feinberg|first5=David R.|last6=Smith|first6=Miriam J.

=== Eating behavior ===
Females have been found to experience different eating habits at different stages of their menstrual cycle, with food intake being higher during the [[luteal phase]] than the [[follicular phase]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Dye| first = L.| last2 = Blundell| first2 = J.

Various studies have shown that during the luteal phase woman consume more [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s and [[fat]]s and that 24-hour [[Energy homeostasis|energy expenditure]] shows increases between 2.5-11.5%.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidsen|first=L.|last2=Vistisen|first2=B.|last3=Astrup|first3=A.|date=2007-08-07|title=Impact of the menstrual cycle on determinants of energy balance: a putative role in weight loss attempts|url=http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v31/n12/full/0803699a.html|journal=International Journal of Obesity|language=en|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1777–1785|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803699|issn=0307-0565}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing intake during the luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and fatty foods, which occurs naturally and is enhanced during the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This is due to the higher metabolic demand during this phase.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; In particular, women tend to show a cravings for chocolate, with higher cravings during the luteal phase.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Females with [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS) report  changes in appetite across the menstrual cycle more than non-sufferers of PMS, possibly due to their oversensitivity to changes in hormone levels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In women with PMS, food intake is higher in the [[luteal phase]] than [[Follicular phase|follicular]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wurtman|first=Judith J.|last2=Brzezinski|first2=Amnon|last3=Wurtman|first3=Richard J.|last4=Laferrere|first4=Blandine|title=Effect of nutrient intake on premenstrual depression|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0002937889906716|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=161|issue=5|pages=1228–1234|doi=10.1016/0002-9378(89)90671-6|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining symptoms of PMS, including mood changes and physical symptoms, also occur during the luteal phase. No difference for preference of food types has been found between PMS sufferers and non-sufferers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The different levels of [[ovarian hormones]] at different stages of the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, with a high [[estrogen]] level dopamine is ineffective in converting to [[Norepinephrine|noradrenaline]], a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence [[binge eating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klump|first=K.

It is theorized that the use of [[oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]s should affect eating behaviour as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]] is also thought to play a role in food intake. Serotonin is responsible for inhibiting eating and controlling meal size,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blundell|first=J.

A number of factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes: age, weight loss and the diet itself. First, younger women are likely to experience [[Irregular menstruation|menstrual irregularities]] due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, [[anovulatory cycle]]s can occur as a result of adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dye|first=L.|last2=Blundell|first2=J.

=== Substance abuse ===
Studies investigating effects of the menstrual cycle on alcohol consumption have found mixed evidence.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Haley A.|last2=Lustyk|first2=M.

The level of substance abuse increases with PMS, mostly with addictive substances such as [[nicotine]], [[tobacco]] and [[cocaine]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; One theory behind this suggests this higher level of substance abuse is due to decreased self-control as a result of the higher metabolic demands during the luteal phase.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== Menstrual disorders === &lt;!-- [[Irregular]] refers to here --&gt;
{{main|Menstrual disorder}}
Infrequent or irregular ovulation is called ''oligoovulation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Galan | first = Nicole | title = Oligoovulation | publisher = about.com | date = 16 April 2008 | url = http://pcos.about.com/od/glossary/g/oligoovulation.htm | accessdate = 12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of ovulation is called ''[[anovulation]]''. Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an [[anovulatory cycle]]. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will be formed and  stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow resulting from a very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called ''estrogen breakthrough bleeding''. Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called [[withdrawal bleeding]].&lt;ref name=tcoyf3&gt;Weschler (2002), p.107&lt;/ref&gt; Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before [[menopause]] (perimenopause) and in women with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]].&lt;ref name=emed2&gt;{{EMedicine|med|146|Anovulation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little flow (less than 10 ml) is called ''[[hypomenorrhea]]''. Regular cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer are ''[[polymenorrhea]]''; frequent but irregular menstruation is known as ''[[metrorrhagia]]''. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed ''[[menorrhagia]]''.&lt;ref name=emed1&gt;{{EMedicine|ped|2781|Menstruation Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is ''[[menometrorrhagia]]''. The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is ''[[oligomenorrhea]]''.&lt;ref name=afp&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oriel KA, Schrager S | title = Abnormal uterine bleeding | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 1371–80; discussion 1381–2 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10524483 | url = http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=10524483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amenorrhea]] refers to more than three&lt;ref name=emed1/&gt; to six&lt;ref name=afp/&gt; months without menses (while not being pregnant) during a woman's reproductive years.
The term for painful periods is ''[[Dysmenorrhea]]''.

== Cycles and phases ==
[[File:MenstrualCycle3 en.svg|thumb|350px|right|Menstrual cycle]]
[[File:Menstrual cycle diagram.png|thumb|350px|right|Flowchart of the hormonal control of the menstrual cycle]]
The menstrual cycle can be described by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the [[Endometrium|endometrial lining]] of the uterus.  Both cycles can be divided into three phases.  The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.&lt;ref name=Silverthorn /&gt;

=== Ovarian cycle ===

==== Follicular phase ====
{{main|Follicular phase}}
The follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg.&lt;ref name=Silverthorn /&gt; The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.

Through the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt; These follicles, which were present at birth&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt; and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or Graafian follicle, and it contains the ovum.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt;

==== Ovulation ====
{{main|Ovulation}}
[[File:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg]]

Ovulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center. Retrieved 2 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During the follicular phase, [[estradiol]] suppresses release of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) from the [[anterior pituitary gland]]. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of [[estradiol]] reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day&amp;nbsp;12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnology.com/ovulate/16/2/10/1/15/2013|title=Ovulation Calendar|publisher=Pregnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact mechanism of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol is not well understood.&lt;ref name=Lentz&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lentz, Gretchen M; Lobo, Rogerio A.; Gershenson, David M; Katz, Vern L.|title=Comprehensive gynecology.|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-06986-1|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195&amp;isbn=978-0-323-06986-1&amp;sid=1291988935&amp;uniqId=327920693-3#4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In animals, a [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) surge has been shown to precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion.&lt;ref name=Lentz /&gt; This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: [[estrogen receptor alpha]], which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and [[estrogen receptor beta]], which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu L, Gustofson RL, Feng H, Leung PK, Mores N, Krsmanovic LZ, Catt KJ | title = Converse regulatory functions of estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta subtypes expressed in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons | journal = Mol. Endocrinol. | volume = 22 | issue = 10 | pages = 2250–9 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18701637 | pmc = 2582533 | doi = 10.1210/me.2008-0192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in humans it has been shown that high levels of estradiol can provoke abrupt increases in LH, even when GnRH levels and pulse frequencies are held constant,&lt;ref name=Lentz /&gt; suggesting that estrogen acts directly on the pituitary to provoke the LH surge.

The release of LH matures the egg and weakens the wall of the follicle in the ovary, causing the fully developed follicle to release its [[secondary oocyte]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt; If it is fertilized by a sperm, the secondary oocyte promptly matures into an [[ootid]] and then becomes a mature [[ovum]]. If it is not fertilized by a sperm, the secondary oocyte will degenerate. The mature ovum has a diameter of about 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gray, Henry David |title=Anatomy of the human body |chapter=The Ovum |publisher=Bartleby.com |location=Philadelphia |year=2000 |chapterurl=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/gray/subjects/subject/3 |isbn=1-58734-102-6 |accessdate=5 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725031743/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/gray/subjects/subject/3 |archivedate=25 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Which of the two ovaries—left or right—ovulates appears essentially random; no known left and right co-ordination exists.&lt;ref name=ov&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ecochard R, Gougeon A | title = Side of ovulation and cycle characteristics in normally fertile women | journal = Hum. Reprod. | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 752–5 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10739814 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/15.4.752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, both ovaries will release an egg;&lt;ref name=ov/&gt; if both eggs are fertilized, the result is [[fraternal twin]]s.&lt;ref name=twins&gt;{{cite web | title = Multiple Pregnancy: Twins or More&amp;nbsp;— Topic Overview | work = WebMD Medical Reference from Healthwise | date = 24 July 2007 | url = http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/multiple-pregnancy-twins-or-more-topic-overview | accessdate = 5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being released from the ovary, the egg is swept into the [[fallopian tube]] by the [[Fimbria (female reproductive system)|fimbria]], which is a fringe of tissue at the end of each fallopian tube. After about a day, an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt;

Fertilization by a [[spermatozoon]], when it occurs, usually takes place in the [[Ampulla of uterine tube|ampulla]], the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg immediately begins the process of [[Human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt; It has usually reached the [[blastocyst]] stage at the time of implantation.

In some women, ovulation features a characteristic pain called ''[[mittelschmerz]]'' (German term meaning ''middle pain'').&lt;ref name=allmenses/&gt; The sudden change in hormones at the time of ovulation sometimes also causes light mid-cycle blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Luteal phase ====
{{main|Luteal phase}}
The luteal phase is the final phase of the ovarian cycle and it corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt; Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Weschler (2002), p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg.  The [[syncytiotrophoblast]], which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the [[blastocyst]]) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy.  Most [[pregnancy test]]s look for the presence of hCG.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"/&gt;

=== Uterine cycle ===
The uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative, secretory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Textbook of Medical Physiology | chapter = Chapter 81 Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones |pages =  1018ff  | edition = 11th |editors= Guyton AC and Hall JE|publisher = Elsevier Saunders | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780721602400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Menstruation ====
{{main|Menstruation}}
Menstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses, catamenia or a period) is the first phase of the uterine cycle. The flow of menses normally serves as a sign that a woman has not become [[pregnancy|pregnant]].

Painful cramping in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs is common during the first few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as [[dysmenorrhea]], and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma P, Malhotra C, Taneja DK, Saha R | title = Problems related to menstruation amongst adolescent girls | journal = Indian J Pediatr | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–9 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18334791 | doi = 10.1007/s12098-008-0018-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When menstruation begins, symptoms of [[premenstrual syndrome]] (PMS) such as [[mastalgia|breast tenderness]] and irritability generally decrease.&lt;ref name=allmenses/&gt; Many [[Menstruation#Menstrual products|sanitary products]] are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.

==== Proliferative phase ====

The proliferative phase is the second phase of the uterine cycle when estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time.&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-303120-8"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Losos | first1 = Jonathan B. | last2 = Raven | first2 = Peter H. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = George B. | last4 = Singer | first4 = Susan R. | title = Biology | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2002 | pages = 1207–09 | isbn = 0-07-303120-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of [[estradiol]], and [[estrogen]]. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of [[endometrium]] in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates [[Crypt (anatomy)|crypts]] in the [[cervix]] to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing [[fertility awareness]].&lt;ref name=tcoyf2&gt;{{cite book | first=Toni | last=Weschler | year=2002 | title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility | pages=359–361 | edition=Revised | publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York | isbn=0-06-093764-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Secretory phase ====

The secretory phase is the final phase of the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the [[endometrium]] receptive to [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of the [[blastocyst]] and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the [[smooth muscle]] in the uterus;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lombardi, Julian|title=Comparative Vertebrate Reproduction|publisher=Springer|year=1998|isbn=9780792383369|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqQX9RMPAegC&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's [[basal body temperature]].&lt;ref name=tcoyf&gt;Weschler (2002), pp.361-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ovulation suppression ==

=== Birth control ===
{{main|Hormonal contraception}}
[[File:pillpacketopen.jpg|thumb|right|Half-used blister pack of a combined oral contraceptive. The white pills are [[placebos]], mainly for the purpose of reminding the woman to continue taking the pills.]]
While some forms of [[birth control]] do not affect the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen [[negative feedback]] decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name=hatcher&gt;{{cite book |author=Trussell, James |year=2007 |chapter=Contraceptive Efficacy |editor=Hatcher, Robert A. |display-editors=etal |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th rev. |pages= |location=New York |publisher=Ardent Media |isbn=0-9664902-0-7 |chapterurl=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=speroff&gt;{{cite book |author1=Speroff, Leon |author2=Darney, Philip D. |year=2005 |chapter=Oral Contraception |title=A Clinical Guide for Contraception |edition=4th |pages=21–138 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=0-7817-6488-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=loose&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Laurence L. |editor1-last=Brunton |editor2-first=John S. |editor2-last=Lazo |editor3-first=Keith |editor3-last=Parker |title=[[Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] |edition=11th |pages=1541–71| publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2005 | isbn=0-07-142280-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of ovulation suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional [[progestogen only pill]]s, [[subdermal implant]]s [[Norplant]] and Jadelle, and [[IntraUterine System|intrauterine system]] Mirena—inhibit ovulation in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of cervical mucus, for their contraceptive effectiveness.&lt;ref name=glasier&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Anna Glasier|Glasier]] |first=Anna |editor=DeGroot, Leslie J. |editor2=Jameson, J. Larry |title=Endocrinology |edition=5th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-7216-0376-9 |pages=3000–1 |chapter=Contraception}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant [[Nexplanon]]—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.&lt;ref name=glasier/&gt;

Combined hormonal contraceptives include both an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular [[breakthrough bleeding]].&lt;ref name=hatcher/&gt;&lt;ref name=speroff/&gt;&lt;ref name=loose/&gt; Several combined hormonal contraceptives—[[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[NuvaRing]], and the [[contraceptive patch]]—are usually used in a way that causes regular [[withdrawal bleeding]]. In a normal cycle, [[menstruation]] occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly.&lt;ref name=tcoyf/&gt; Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive|taken continuously]], although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.

=== Breastfeeding ===
{{main|Lactational amenorrhea method}}
[[Breastfeeding]] causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending on the strength of the negative feedback, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume.&lt;ref name=mcneilly&gt;{{cite journal | author = McNeilly AS | title = Lactational control of reproduction | journal = Reprod.

=== Etymological ===
The word "menstruation" is etymologically related to "moon".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2511">The '''mental environment''' refers to the sum of all societal influences upon [[mental health]].

The term is often used in a context critical of the mental environment in industrialized societies. It is argued that just as industrial societies produce physical [[toxins]] and [[pollutants]] which harm humans physical health, they also produce psychological toxins (e.g. television, excessive noise, violent marketing tactics, [[Internet addiction]], [[social media]]) that cause psychological damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redroom.com/publishedwork/the-mental-environment-mostly-about-mind-pollution-0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912004053/http://www.redroom.com/publishedwork/the-mental-environment-mostly-about-mind-pollution-0 |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }}{{full|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

This poor mental environment may help explain why rates of mental illness are reportedly higher in industrial societies which might also have its roots in poor educational environment and mechanical routinised life present. Magico-religious beliefs are an important contribution of such communal settings. Delusions such as these rooted from childhood are often hard to completely regulate from a person's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000285035 |pmid=9168565 |title=Magico-Religious Beliefs and Psychosis |journal=Psychopathology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=93–9 |year=1997 |last1=Vlachos |first1=Ioannis O. |last2=Beratis |first2=Stavroula |last3=Hartocollis |first3=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The idea has its roots in [[evolutionary psychology]], as the deleterious consequences of a poor mental environment can be explained by the mismatch between the mental environment humans  evolved to exist within and the one they exist within today.

"We live in both a mental and physical environment. We can influence the mental environment around us, but to a far greater extent we are influenced by the mental environment. The mental environment contains forces that affect our thinking and emotions and that can dominate our personal minds." - Marshall Vian Summers

The system was developed in 1942 by Canadian engineer Neil George, who at the time was an employee of [[Inco Limited]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]]. The program is used throughout Canada and internationally.&lt;ref name="CMJ 1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Five Simple Steps to Safety|journal=Canadian Mining Journal|date=1 October 2004|url=http://www.canadianminingjournal.com/features/five-simple-steps-to-safety/|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HSA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Safety reminder|journal=Holmes Safety Association Bulletin|date=July 1997|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is made up of five components:
#Check entrance and travelway to workplace.
#Are workplace and equipment in good working order?
#Are employees working properly?
#Do an act of safety.
#Can and will employees continue to work properly?

Points one through three are done by the employee, and verified by the supervisor upon arrival to the workplace. The fourth step is safety discussion between the employee and the supervisor, while the fifth is a verification by the employee that he or she has the correct training, experience, and motivation to continue working safely. This is also verified by the supervisor prior to his or her leaving the workplace.&lt;ref name="HSA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8894">'''Nutrient density''' identifies the proportion of [[nutrients]] in foods, with terms such as '''nutrient rich''' and  '''micronutrient dense''' referring to similar properties. Several different national and international standards have been developed and are in use (see [[Nutritional rating systems]]).

==Definition and usage==
According to the [[World Health Organization]], [[nutrient profiling]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010/en/ Nutrient Profiling: Report of a WHO/IASO Technical Meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, accessed 10/15/2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; classifies and/or ranks foods by their nutritional composition in order to promote human (and/or animal) health and to prevent disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/profiling/en/ Nutrient Profiling, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ranking by nutrient density is one such nutrient profiling strategy.  Ordering foods by nutrient density is a statistical method of comparing foods by the proportion of nutrients in foods.  Some such comparisons can be the [[glycemic index]] and the [[Overall Nutritional Quality Index]].

Nutrient-dense foods such as [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s are the opposite of [[energy density|energy-dense]] food (also called "[[empty calorie]]" food), such as [[alcohol]] and foods high in added [[sugar]] or processed [[cereals]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/food/nutrition/nutrition/dietary_guide/hgic4062.html Hunter, J. G., Cason, K. L., Nutrient Density, Clemson University, 2006(November), accessed 10/15/2014.  Nutrient density is defined as "a measure of the nutrients provided per calorie of food, or the ratio of nutrients to calories (energy)."]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B758G-4HP5YFV-D/2/c86659719922a2736490366333062119 Darmon, N., Darmon, M., Maillot, M., Drewnowski, A., ''A Nutrient Density Standard for Vegetables and Fruits: Nutrients per Calorie and Nutrients per Unit Cost'', Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 105(12),2005 (December), 1881–1887, DOI: 10.1016/j.jada.2005.09.005, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond its use to distinguish different ''types'' of food from each other, nutrient density allows comparison to be made for different examples or samples of the same kind of food. Nutrient density is correlated with soil quality and mineralization levels of the soil, although the relationship is complex and incorporates other dimensions.

The [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] reported in 2013 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several indicators of nutrient quality have been summarized by the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Drewnowski, A., Defining nutrient density: Development and validation of the nutrient rich foods index. J Am Coll Nutr. 2009; 28(suppl 4):421S-426S.&lt;/ref&gt;

First published February 24, 2010, doi: 10.3945/ajcn.2010.28450D]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==International standards==

The Nutrient Profiling Scoring Calculator (NPSC) in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] is a calculator for determining whether health claims can be made for a food by its reference to the Nutrient Profiling Scoring Criterion (NPSC).  It is defined by the FSANZ Board, which operates under the FSANZ Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/industry/labelling/pages/nutrientprofilingcalculator/Default.aspx FSANZ Board, Nutrient Profiling Scoring Calculator, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom Ofcom nutrient profiling model provides "a single score for any given food product, based on calculating the number of points for ‘negative’ nutrients which can be offset by points for ‘positive’ nutrients."  A 2007 UK-commissioned review of nutrient profiling models commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency identified over 40 different schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publichealth.ox.ac.uk/bhfhprg/publicationsandreports/acad-publications/bhfcpnppublished/nutrientprofilemodel Rayner, M., Scarborough, P., Lobtein, P., The UK Ofcom Nutrient Profiling Model, October 2009, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] reviews scientific and operational issues related to human nutrition, specifically when developing world populations are impacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010/en/ World Health Organization, Nutrient profiling: report of a technical meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, 20 pages, Publication date: 2011], {{ISBN|978 92 4 150220 7}}, accessed 10/15/2014, downloadable as a PDF from http://www.who.int/entity/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personal protective equipment]], administrative controls, and engineering controls can all work to reduce exposure to noise and chemicals, either by providing the worker with protection such as [[earplug]]s, or by reducing the [[noise]] or chemicals at the source or limiting the time or level of exposure.

== Background ==
OHL is defined as any type of hearing loss, i.e. [[Sensorineural hearing loss|sensorineural]], [[Conductive hearing loss|conductive]], or mixed hearing loss, that occurs due to hazardous characteristics of a work environment.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim KS | title = Occupational hearing loss in Korea | language = English | journal = Journal of Korean Medical Science | volume = 25 | issue = Suppl | pages = S62-9 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21258593 | doi = 10.3346/jkms.2010.25.s.s62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing loss can range in severity from mild to profound.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Hazards of a [[Workplace|work environment]] that can result in OHL include excessive noise, ototoxic chemicals, or physical trauma.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; OHL caused by excessive exposure to noise is also known as [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL). Noise exposure combined with ototoxic chemical exposure can results in more damage to hearing. OHL caused by physical trauma may include foreign bodies in the ear, vibration, [[barotrauma]], or [[head injury]]. OHL, as well as hearing loss in general, can cause negative secondary social and emotional effects that can impact quality of life.&lt;ref name="pmid14570962"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalton DS, Cruickshanks KJ, Klein BE, Klein R, Wiley TL, Nondahl DM | title = The impact of hearing loss on quality of life in older adults | journal = The Gerontologist | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 661–8 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14570962 | doi = 10.1093/geront/43.5.661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12918624"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arlinger S | title = Negative consequences of uncorrected hearing loss--a review | journal = International Journal of Audiology | volume = 42 Suppl 2 | issue = | pages = 2S17–20 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12918624 | doi = | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stig_Arlinger/publication/10612964_Negative_consequences_of_uncorrected_hearing_loss_-_A_review/links/0912f502caf00a31ce000000/Negative-consequences-of-uncorrected-hearing-loss-A-review.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[United States|United States of America]], approximately 10 million people have NIHL. Over twice that number (~22 million) are occupationally exposed to dangerous noise levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/default.html|title=Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention|last=NIOSH|first=|date=Mar 22, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing loss accounted for a sizable percentage of occupational illness in 2007, at 14% of cases.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/stats.html|title=CDC - Facts and Statistics: Noise - NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  United States government agencies such as [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] and [[Mine Safety and Health Administration|MSHA]]  are working to understand the causes of OHL and how it can be prevented while providing regulations and guidelines to help protect the hearing of workers in all occupations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Noise exposure ===
Exposure to noise can cause [[vibration]]s able to cause permanent damage to the ear. Both the volume of the noise and the duration of exposure can influence the likelihood of damage. Sound is measured in units called [[decibel]]s, which is a [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] scale of sound levels that corresponds to the level of loudness that an individual's ear would perceive. Because it is a logarithmic scale, even small incremental increases in decibels correlate to large increases in loudness, and an increase in the risk of hearing loss.

Sounds above 80&amp;nbsp;dB have the potential to cause permanent hearing loss. The intensity of sound is considered too great and hazardous if someone must yell in order to be heard. [[Ringing in the ears]] upon leaving work is also indicative of noise that is at a dangerous level. Farming, machinery work, and construction are some of the many occupations that put workers at risk of hearing loss.

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] establishes recommended exposure limits (RELs) to protect workers against the health effects of exposure to hazardous substances and agents encountered in the workplace. These NIOSH limits are based on the best available science and practices.  NIOSH established the REL for occupational noise exposures to be 85 decibels, A-weighted (dB[A]) as an 8-hour time-weighted average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf|title=Criteria for a Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure|last=NIOSH|first=|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational noise exposure at or above this level are considered hazardous. The REL is based on exposures at work 5 days per week and assumes that the individual spends the other 16 hours in the day, as well as weekends, in quieter conditions. NIOSH also specifies a maximum allowable daily noise dose, expressed in percentages. For example, a person continuously exposed to 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) over an 8-hour work shift will reach 100% of their daily noise dose. This dose limit uses a 3-dB time-intensity tradeoff commonly referred to as the exchange rate or equal-energy rule: for every 3-dB increase in noise level, the allowable exposure time is reduced by half.  For example, if the exposure level increases to 88&amp;nbsp;dB(A), workers should only be exposed for four hours.  Alternatively, for every 3-dB decrease in noise level, the allowable exposure time is doubled, as shown in the table below.

OSHA's current [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) for workers is an average of 90&amp;nbsp;dB over an 8-hour work day. Unlike NIOSH, OSHA uses a 5-dB exchange rate, where an increase in 5-dB for a sound corresponds to the amount of time workers may be exposed to that particular source of sound being halved. For example, workers cannot be exposed to a sound level of 95&amp;nbsp;dB for more than 4 hours per day, or to sounds at 100&amp;nbsp;dB for more than 2 hours per day. Employers who expose workers to 85&amp;nbsp;dB or more for 8 hour shifts are required to provide hearing exams and protection, monitor noise levels, and provide training.

[[Sound level meter]]s and [[Noise dosimeter|dosimeters]] are two types of devices that are used to measure sound levels in the workplace. Dosimeters are typically worn by the employee to measure their own personal sound exposure. Other sound level meters can be used to double check dosimeter measurements, or used when dosimeters cannot be worn by the employees. They can also be used to evaluate engineering controls aimed at reducing noise levels.

Some recent studies suggest that some smartphone applications may be able to measure noise as precisely as a Type 2 SLM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kardous CA, Shaw PB | title = Evaluation of smartphone sound measurement applications | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 135 | issue = 4 | pages = EL186-92 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 25236152 | pmc = 4659422 | doi = 10.1121/1.4865269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27794313"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kardous CA, Shaw PB | title = Evaluation of smartphone sound measurement applications (apps) using external microphones-A follow-up study | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 140 | issue = 4 | pages = EL327 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27794313 | pmc = 5102154 | doi = 10.1121/1.4964639 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most smartphone sound measurement apps are not accurate enough to be used for legally required measurements, the [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/app.html NIOSH Sound Level Meter app] met the requirements of IEC 61672/ANSI S1.4 Sound Level Meter Standards (Electroacoustics - Sound Level Meters - Part 3: Periodic Tests).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celestina|first=Metod|last2=Hrovat|first2=Jan|last3=Kardous|first3=Chucri A. | name-list-format = vanc |date=October 2018|title=Smartphone-based sound level measurement apps: Evaluation of compliance with international sound level meter standards|journal=Applied Acoustics|volume=139|pages=119–128|doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2018.04.011|issn=0003-682X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ototoxic chemical exposure ===
Chemically-induced hearing loss (CIHL) is a potential result of occupational exposures. Certain chemical compounds may have [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic]] effects.[https://synergist.aiha.org/201811-the-ear-poisons] Exposure to [[organic solvents]], [[Heavy Metals|heavy metals]], and [[Asphyxiant gas|asphyxiants]] such as [[carbon monoxide]] can all cause hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/literature_reviews/combined-exposure-to-noise-and-ototoxic-substances|title=Combined exposure to noise and ototoxic substances|last=EU-OSHA|first=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work|date=2009|website=Combined exposure to noise and ototoxic substances|publisher=EU OSHA|access-date=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohl/default.html|title = CDC - NIOSH Topic: Occupational Hearing Loss (OHL) Surveillance|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chemicals can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. Damage can occur to either the inner ear or the auditory nerve.Certain medications may also have the potential to cause hearing loss.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/worksafe/ototoxic-chemicals-chemicals-result-hearing-loss|title = Ototoxic chemicals - chemicals that result in hearing loss|website = Department of Commerce Western Australia|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both noise and chemical exposures are common in many industries, and can both contribute to hearing loss simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campo P, Morata TC, Hong O | title = Chemical exposure and hearing loss | journal = Disease-A-Month | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 119–38 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23507352 | pmc = 4693596 | doi = 10.1016/j.disamonth.2013.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage may be more likely or more severe if both are present, in particular if noise is impulsive.&lt;ref name="pmid29604694"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fuente A, Qiu W, Zhang M, Xie H, Kardous CA, Campo P, Morata TC | title = Use of the kurtosis statistic in an evaluation of the effects of noise and solvent exposures on the hearing thresholds of workers: An exploratory study | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 143 | issue = 3 | pages = 1704 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29604694 | doi = 10.1121/1.5028368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Venet T, Campo P, Thomas A, Cour C, Rieger B, Cosnier F | title = The tonotopicity of styrene-induced hearing loss depends on the associated noise spectrum | journal = Neurotoxicology and Teratology | volume = 48 | pages = 56–63 | pmid = 25689156 | doi = 10.1016/j.ntt.2015.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industries in which combinations of exposures may exist include construction, fiberglass, metal manufacturing, and many more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is estimated that over 22 million workers are exposed to dangerous noise levels, and 10 million are exposed to solvents that could potentially cause hearing loss every year, with an unknown number exposed to other ototoxic chemicals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A 2018 informational bulletin by the US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) introduces the issue, provides examples of ototoxic chemicals, lists the industries and occupations at risk and provides prevention information.[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-124/pdfs/2018-124.pdf]

== Prevention ==
OHL is preventable, but currently the interventions to prevent NIHL are complex. A 2017 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] review&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tikka C, Verbeek JH, Kateman E, Morata TC, Dreschler WA, Ferrite S | title = Interventions to prevent occupational noise-induced hearing loss | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = CD006396 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28685503 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006396.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that hearing loss prevention programs revealed that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels. [[Hearing protection devices]], such as [[earmuffs]] and [[earplug]]s can reduce noise exposure to safe levels, but, instructions are needed on how to put plugs into the ears correctly to achieve potential attenuation. Giving workers information on their noise exposure levels by itself was not shown to decrease noise. Engineering solutions might lead to similar noise reduction as that provided by hearing protection. Better evaluation of the noise exposures resulting from engineering interventions is needed, as most of the available information is limited to observations in laboratory conditions. Overall, the effects of hearing loss prevention programs are unclear. Better use of hearing protection as part of a program but does not necessarily protect against hearing loss. The review concluded that in order to prevent NIHL in the workplace the quality of the implementation of prevention programs affects results, and that better quality of studies, especially in the field of engineering controls, and better implementation of legislation are needed. While the 2017 systematic review concluded there is a lack of conclusive evidence it highlighted that this should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. The implications is that further research could affect conclusions reached.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Hierarchy of controls ===
{{Main|Hierarchy of hazard control}}
[[File:NIOSH Hierarchy of Controls.png|alt=NIOSH Hierarchy of Controls showing elimination as most effective, followed by substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and then as lease effective are personal protective equipment|thumb|350x350px|NIOSH Hierarchy of Controls]]
The [[Hierarchy of hazard control|hierarchy of controls]] provides a visual guide to the effectiveness of the various workplace controls set in place to eliminate or reduce exposure to occupational hazards, including noise or ototoxic chemicals. The hierarchy includes the following from most effective to least effective:
* [[Hazard elimination|Elimination]]: complete removal of the hazard
* [[Hazard substitution|Substitution]]: replacement that offers a smaller risk
* [[Engineering controls]]: physical changes to reduce exposure
* [[Administrative controls]]: changes in work procedures or training
* [[Personal protective equipment]] (PPE): individual equipment to reduce exposure, e.g. [[earplug]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saunions.org.au/ohs/hierachy_of_controls.htm|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=SA Unions|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Engineering controls ====
[[Engineering controls]] is the next highest in the [[hierarchy]] of risk reduction methods when elimination and substitution of the hazard are not possible. These types of controls typically involve making changes in equipment or other changes to minimize the level of noise that reaches a worker's ear. They may also involve measures such as barriers between the worker and the source of the noise, mufflers, regular maintenance of the machinery, or substituting quieter equipment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noisecontrol/|title=NIOSH - Engineering Noise Control - Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miningsh.arizona.edu/node/46|title=Noise controls (Engineering, Administrative, PPE) {{!}} Mining Safety &amp; Health Resource Center|website=miningsh.arizona.edu|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OSHA Technical Manual (OTM) on noise provides technical information about workplace hazards and controls to OSHA’s Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/new_noise/index.html|title=OSHA Technical Manual - Noise|last=OSHA|first=|date=Aug 15, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the OTM is based on currently available research publications, OSHA standards, and consensus standards. The OTM is available to the public for use by other health and safety professionals, employers, and anyone involved in developing or implementing an effective workplace safety and health program.

Examples of noise control strategies adopted in the workplace can be seen among the winners of the [[Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|Safe-in-Sound Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Awards.]]

==== Administrative controls ====
[[Administrative controls|Administrative control]], behind engineering control, is the next best form of prevention of noise exposure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They can either reduce the exposure to noise, or reduce the decibel level of the noise itself. Limiting the amount of time a worker is allowed to be around an unsafe level of noise exposure, and creating procedures for operation of equipment that could produce harmful levels of noise are both examples of administrative controls.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Personal protection ====
{{Main|Personal protective equipment}}
Elimination or reduction of the source of noise or chemical exposure is ideal, but when that is not possible or adequate, wearing [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) such as earplugs or earmuffs can help reduce the risk of hearing loss due to noise exposure. PPE should be a last resort and  not be used in substitution for engineering or administrative controls. It is important that workers are properly trained on the use of PPE to ensure proper protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Other initiatives ===
In addition to the hierarchy of controls, other programs have been created to promote the prevention of hearing loss in the workplace. For example, the [[Buy Quiet]] program was created to encourage the purchase of quieter tools and machinery in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/|title=Buy Quiet|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Safe-In-Sound Award|Safe-n-Sound Award]] was created to recognize organizations that excel in preventing occupational hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe-in-Sound|publisher=|access-date=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Occupational hearing loss is a very present industrial issue that has been noticed since the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sataloff |first1=Robert Thayer |last2=Sataloff |first2=Joseph | name-list-format = vanc |title=Occupational hearing loss |date=1993 |publisher=M. Dekker |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8247-8814-8 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As industrial society continues to grow, this issue is becoming increasingly detrimental due to the exposure of chemicals and physical objects. Millions of employees have been affected by occupational hearing loss, especially in industry.&lt;ref name="pmid11500698"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Otaibi ST | title = Occupational hearing loss | journal = Saudi Medical Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 523–30 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 11500698 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialized countries see most of these damages as they result in both economic and living problems.

Within the United States of America alone, 10 of the 28 million people that have experienced hearing loss related to noise exposure. Rarely do workers express concerns or complaints regarding Occupational hearing loss. In order to gather relevant information, workers who have experienced loud work environments are questioned regarding their hearing abilities during everyday activities. When analyzing OHP, it is necessary to consider family history, hobbies, recreational activities, and how they could play a role in a person’s hearing loss. In order to test hearing loss, [[audiometer]]s are used to and are adjusted to [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) regulations. The Occupation and Safety Health Association (OSHA) of the United States of America requires a program that conserves hearing when noise levels are greater than 85&amp;nbsp;dB. This program includes:
1.”Monitoring to assess and record noise levels.”
2. “Periodic audiometry.”
3. “Noise Control”
4. “Education and record keeping.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6266">'''Occupational rehabilitation''' is the science and practices of returning injured workers to a level of work activity that is appropriate to their functional and cognitive capacity, both of which are influenced by the severity of a worker's injuries.

; [[Occupational therapist]]s&lt;ref name="Keough"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoefsmit2012/&gt;
: The role of occupational therapists in the workplace is to facilitate individuals’ ability to return to work. Occupational therapists assist their clients in reaching their maximum level of function with the aim of meeting the physical and emotional demands of their job. Occupational therapists are also qualified to make recommendations to employers on how to downgrade job demands to meet the functional status of an employee in order to prevent further injury during occupational rehabilitation. Individual functional capacity evaluations are used to screen for [[person-environment fit]]. Industrial occupational therapists use a collaborative approach involving the workers and employers to encourage a supportive work environment that empowers the worker to reach productivity and other work related goals.&lt;ref name="Keough"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keough |first1=Jeremy L. |last2=Fisher |first2=Thomas F. |date=2001 |title=Occupational-psychosocial perceptions influencing return to work and functional performance of injured workers |journal=Work |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=101-110 |pmid=12441463 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational therapy interventions in occupational rehabilitation include developing assertiveness; communication and interpersonal skills; controlling anger; and stress management.&lt;ref name="Keough"/&gt;

== For common mental disorders ==
{{See also | Psychiatric rehabilitation }}
Many workers have an increased risk of developing common mental disorders (CMDs) in the workplace due to job stressors such as job insecurity, bullying or psychological harassment, low social support at work, employee perceptions of fairness in the workplace, and an imbalance between job demands and rewards.  These CMDs may include anxiety disorders, alcohol dependence, addiction-related disorders, suicidal ideation, and depression &lt;ref name="LaMontagne"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LaMontagne |first1=Anthony D. |last2=Martin |first2=Angela |last3=Page |first3=Kathryn M. |last4=Reavley |first4=Nicola J. |last5=Noblet |first5=Andrew J. |last6=Milner |first6=Allison J. |last7=Keegel |first7=Tessa |last8=Smith |first8=Peter M. |date=9 May 2014 |title=Workplace mental health: developing an integrated intervention approach |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=14 |page=131 |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-14-131 |pmid=24884425 |pmc=4024273 |url=https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-244X-14-131 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches ===
A symptom of CMDs is having disorganized and deteriorated habits. Therefore, during work rehabilitation, occupational therapists and/or other rehabilitation professionals often use a graded environment, intentionally eliminating barriers to increase individuals’ performance and self-esteem. An integrative approach, based on the three key disciplines of medicine, public health, and psychology, is being utilized by occupational therapists to reduce job stressors and improve the psychological well-being of employees with CMDs.&lt;ref name="LaMontagne"/&gt; The purpose of an integrative approach is to prevent further harm to the employee and to learn how to manage the illness through health promotion, [[occupational psychology]], positive psychology management, psychiatry, and [[occupational medicine]].&lt;ref name="LaMontagne"/&gt;

Cognitive work hardening programs administered by occupational therapists using the Canadian Model of Client-Centered Enablement (CMCE) improve return to work outcomes of employees suffering from depression. Cognitive work hardening incorporates meaningful occupations or work tasks that are graded to fit individual needs within an environment that is supportive in order to improve self-worth. Cognitive work hardening programs are individualized to promote interpersonal communication and coping skills within a real-life work setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wisenthal |first1=Adeena |last2=Krupa |first2=Terry |date=2013 |title=Cognitive work hardening: a return-to-work intervention for people with depression.

The Stimulating Healthy Participation and Relapse Prevention (SHARP) approach is used for individuals with CMDs who experience many sick absences from work. The SHARP approach encompasses five steps including:  listing positive and negative situations encountered in the workplace; solutions to negative situations or problems; support need for solutions; planning how to implement solutions; and evaluation of implementation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arends |first1=Iris |last2=Bultmann |first2=Ute |last3=Nielsen |first3=Karina |last4=van Rhenen |first4=Willem |last5=de Boer |first5=Michiel R. |last6=van der Klink |first6=Jac J.L.

'''Ovarian drilling''', also known as multiperforation or [[laparoscopic]] ovarian diathermy, is a surgical technique of puncturing the membranes surrounding the ovary with a laser beam or a surgical needle using minimally invasive [[laparoscopy|laparoscopic procedures]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It differs from ovarian wedge resection, because resection involves the cutting of tissue.

If patients do not become pregnant 6 months after ovulation has been reestablished from ovarian drilling treatment, drug treatments may be reintroduced or [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) may be considered.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Hormonal Effects ==
Part of the criteria of PCOS diagnosis includes elevated levels of androgens in the bloodstream or other signs of androgen excess ([[hyperandrogenism]]).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=H.|last2=Morin-Surruca|first2=M.|last3=Torre|first3=A.|last4=Faivre|first4=E.|last5=Deffieux|first5=X.|last6=Gervaise|first6=A.|date=2011|title=Review: Ovarian drilling for surgical treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome: a comprehensive review.|url=|journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=22|pages=556–568|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2011.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure causes a drop in serum [[androgen]] levels and possibly in [[estrogen]] levels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After ovarian follicles and stroma are destroyed, there is a reduction in these hormone levels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The procedure results in a decrease in plasma [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and in pulsations as well as a periodic drop in [[inhibin B]] levels.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The most plausible theory states that the reduction of these hormone concentrations leads to an increase in the secretion of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and sex hormone-binding [[globulin]], leading to effective follicular maturation and ovulation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Low serum [[oestradiol]] concentrations are associated with decreased [[aromatase]] activity.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Inflammatory growth factors such as [[insulin-like growth factor-1]] are produced due to injury and aid the effects of FSH through greater blood flow and gonadotropin delivery.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Circulating and intrafollicular levels of [[anti-mullerian hormone]] (AMH), which can help quantify recruitable ovarian follicle activity, are reduced after laparoscopic ovarian drilling in women with PCOS.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paramu|first=Sobhana|title=Impact of laparoscopic ovarian drilling on serum anti-mullerian hormone levels in patients with anovulatory Polycystic Ovarian syndrome|url=http://cms.galenos.com.tr/FileIssue/15/1182/article/203-207.pdf|journal=Journal of Turkish Society of Obstetric and Gynecology|volume=13|issue=4|pages=203–207|doi=10.4274/tjod.97523|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedures ==
When the clinician determines that ovarian drilling is appropriate and the woman decides to undergo this treatment, consent is obtained. The risks are communicated to the woman.&lt;ref name=Hoffman/&gt;

The most commonly performed method is with a monopolar needle or hook because of the equipment's availability and simple installation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other common instrumentation consists of the use of a bipolar electrical surgical electrodes or a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, argon, or ND-YAG [[laser]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniell|first=James F.|last2=Miller|first2=Wayne|title=Polycystic ovaries treated by laparoscopic laser vaporization|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0015-0282(16)60482-X|journal=Fertility and Sterility|language=en|volume=51|issue=2|pages=232–236|doi=10.1016/s0015-0282(16)60482-x|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; This instrumentation has the ability to produce the intended results with a very focal approach. Typically, a 100 W electrical cautery dissector is first used to cross the ovarian cortex, then electrocoagulation is performed at 40 W, however rates range from 30 to 400 W.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The surgical punctures are performed on the ovarian cortex and are usually 4–10&amp;nbsp;mm deep and 3&amp;nbsp;mm wide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The number of punctures is related to subsequent ability to conceive&amp;mdash;it has been found that five to ten punctures are more likely to produce the intended conception.&lt;ref name=Hoffman&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = Barbara | title = Williams gynecology |publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780071716727 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ovarian drilling is performed laparoscopically and either transumbilical ([[culdoscopy]]) or transvaginal ([[fertiloscopy]]).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;!--pages 1139---&gt;

== Risks ==
Though preferable to creating incisions on the ovary, ovarian drilling does have some risks. These are: pelvic adhesion formation, [[hemorrhage]], [[gas embolism]], [[pneumothorax]], [[premature ovarian failure]], long-term ovarian function, developing [[Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome|hyperstimulation syndrome]], adhesion formation, [[infertility]] and [[Multiple birth#Human multiple births|multiple births]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Joshua J.|last2=Bates|first2=G.

'''Poly Implant Prothèse''' ('''PIP''') was a French company founded in 1991 that produced [[silicone gel]] [[breast implant]]s. The company was preemptively [[liquidation|liquidated]] in 2010 following the revelation that they had been illegally manufacturing and selling breast implants made from cheaper industrial-grade silicone since 2001 (instead of the mandated medical-grade silicone they had previously used). The hundreds of thousands of unapproved implants sold globally by PIP from 2001 to 2010 were found to have a 500% higher risk of [[Breast implant#Complications|rupturing or leaking]] than approved models, as well as being implicated in at several deaths due to systemic toxicity and several cases of induced [[breast cancer]]. The scandal, which produced fears of a massive health disaster, prompted a full recall of the company's implants by the French health ministry in 2010, by which time the company was already defunct.&lt;ref name=stbr&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-breast-implants-idUSTRE7BM14420111224 |title=France, UK issue clashing advice on breast implants |author1=Love, B. |author2=Flynn, D. |work=Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PIP was founded in 1991&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; by the Frenchman&lt;ref name=ia/&gt; Jean-Claude Mas, born in 1939, a former [[butcher]] and later [[Pharmaceutical sales representative|medical sales representative]] for the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol Myers]] company&lt;ref name=tlback/&gt; for 15 years.&lt;ref name=gmmi/&gt; Mas had previously teamed up with plastic surgeon Henri Arion, who had introduced breast implants to France in 1965.&lt;ref name=tlback/&gt; After Arion died in a plane crash, Mas went on alone and launched PIP in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The terrifying story of how a former French butcher earned millions from selling faulty breast implants made from mattress filling |author=Steve Bird |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2080547/PIP-breast-implant-butcher-Jean-Claude-Mas-denies-manslaughter-charges.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=December 31, 2011 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandal==
Starting in 1991, the company produced approximately 2 million sets of silicone breast implants over a 20-year period. The implants were exported to Latin American countries such as [[Brazil]],&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; [[Venezuela]]&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; and [[Argentina]], Western European markets including [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (25,000), [[Germany]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], as well as [[Australia]] (8900).&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

Following the FDA ruling in 2000 which banned silicone breast implants in the US market (leading to a slump in sales worldwide), Mas sought to "tighten PIP's belt" and recoup some of its lost [[market share]] by severely cutting costs. In particular, Mas was credited with the idea that by switching PIP's silicone from externally purchased medical-grade to in-house produced industrial-grade, huge savings (on the order of 90%) could be generated that would ensure profits remained high no matter the market. As one PIP engineer later noted, 
this decision involved a relatively small change in the formula for the silicone, enough so that only superficial differences in the end product were noted. However, none of the relevant regulations were followed for manufacturing medical implants, and no pre-launch tests were conducted.

== Timeline ==
2000: Implant sales in [[United States|USA]] halted by an [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] launched moratorium on silicone implants.&lt;ref name=uslaw/&gt;

2001: PIP began to use unapproved in-house manufactured industrial-grade instead of [[Medical grade silicone|medical-grade]] [[silicone]] in the majority of its implants.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

2003: the first signs of legal problems and financial losses can be traced by regulatory filings.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

2009: Concerns surfaced in France first in 2009 when surgeons started reporting an abnormally high rupture rates. Which resulted in a flood of legal complaints and the company's bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

2010: [[TÜV Rheinland]], headquartered in [[Germany]], gave a quality certificate to the production process used by the company until March 2010. However, this didn't apply to the type of silicone used. A former PIP worker and union chief, Eric Mariaccia said, "You had to have been a chemist to have noticed anything".&lt;ref name=chiboss/&gt; He also said that "The responsible ones aren't the workers but the heads of the company, notably the four who were linked to production and thus responsible for their quality".&lt;ref name=chiboss/&gt;

2010: In March 2010 PIP was placed into liquidation with losses of {{nowrap|9 million [[Euro|EUR]]}} after the French medical safety agency recalled its implants. In a subsequent inspection of the manufacturing site, the company was found to use unapproved industrial-grade, [[silicone]], with a cost of only 10% of an approved gel.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

2011: On December 20 French officials say that an action plan is underway&lt;ref name=gr/&gt; following the death of a woman from [[Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma|ALCL]].&lt;ref name=mhra-upd/&gt; The French government recommended on December 23, 2011&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; that 30,000 women&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; in France seek removal of breast implants made of a suspect silicone gel by the worldwide exporting PIP firm.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;

== Issues ==
Medical problems arise when breast implants rupture and cause [[inflammation]] and [[irritation]]. Further, impure gel may also release toxic substances.&lt;ref name=swbo/&gt; Removing implants "carries risks in itself", says the French government.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; By the end of 2011, eight cases of [[Breast cancer|breast tumours]] had been uncovered in women after removing the implants, yet, while of concern,&lt;ref name=swbo/&gt; according to the French government, there is no evidence of any increased [[cancer]] risk.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] medical watchdog, the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority]] (MHRA), says France has reported rupture rates of around 5% for PIP implants, compared with 1% in the UK.&lt;ref name=bbc-dd/&gt; But a "leading cosmetic surgery firm" has privately warned ministers that the proportion of women at risk is as high as 8%.&lt;ref name=in8/&gt; Symptoms can include lumps around the implant or in the under-arm, inflammation in the breast tissue and a hardening of the breast.&lt;ref name=in8&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/exclusive-silicone-implant-risk-eight-times-greater-6283809.html independent.co.uk - Exclusive: Silicone implant risk 'eight times greater], 2012-01-01&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patient UK]] says French regulatory authority has reported a rupture rate of up to 10%, with a gel leak in 11% of cases.&lt;ref name=ptsc/&gt;

Nigel Mercer of the [[British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons|British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons]] (BAAPS) says the French move was "certainly not unreasonable" but the British cosmetic surgeon Kevin Hancock said the divergent government responses would cause distress for British women. [[Plastic surgery|Plastic surgeon]] Hancock, of the [[Liverpool Women's Hospital]], says there were concerns in the profession over a high rupture rate and that "We are worried about the rupture risk because it is the rupture that brings the contents into direct contact with the body's tissues... We know that the contents were not what they were supposed to be. So in general we agree with the (French) decision to remove them".&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

Patients are used as "guinea pigs", said Nigel Mercer, a former president of the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), because medical implants lack the requirement of an independent [[clinical trial]].&lt;ref name=bbc-al/&gt;

The company sold a high-end product that used approved silicone for wealthier clients and which cost five times more than products with silicon gel manufactured in-house. Most PIP implants were manufactured with the in-house silicon. The lawyer, Haddad, representing the founder, said "There is a product made by PIP which did not formally receive the [regulators'] approval and in this regard there was a violation of regulations,". The company did not ask France's medical device safety regulators for approval of their in-house manufactured product, but expected it would have gotten approval if the company asked for it.&lt;ref name=rerg/&gt;

Cancer has been found in 20 women with the allegedly faulty PIP breast implants but French health authorities ([[Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé]] (AFSSAPS)) insisted there was still no proven link with the disease.&lt;ref name=mx&gt;[http://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-cancer-cases-french-women-pip.html medicalxpress.com - 20 cancer cases in French women with PIP implants: agency], 2011-12-30&lt;/ref&gt;

AFSSAPS has as of 28 December,{{When|date=June 2012}} registered 15 cases of breast [[adenocarcinoma]], the most frequent form of breast cancer, one case of breast [[lymphoma]], two cases of other lymphoma, one case of [[lung cancer]] and one case of acute [[myelogenous leukemia]] in women with the implants.&lt;ref name=mx/&gt;

A French woman with a PIP breast implant where [[Capsular contracture|capsular]] [[Granulation tissue|scar tissue]] formed in the breast, which is a common occurrence with implants.&lt;ref name=ptsc/&gt; This tissue developed [[anaplastic large-cell lymphoma]] (ALCL), a rare form of cancer that affects the immune system cells.&lt;ref name=mhra-upd/&gt; The cancer caused death in this case and caused the French authorities to act.&lt;ref name=mhra-upd/&gt;&lt;!-- grammar check? --&gt;

During the 672 registered preventive extractions, in 43 cases (6.4%) the implants had ruptured and in 14 cases (2.1%) they were "oozing", AFSSAPS said.&lt;ref name=mx/&gt;
 
The PIP implants have been resold as "Rofil M-implants".&lt;ref name=tet/&gt;
British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) believes many British women may have had the bad Rofil M-implants used when they bought cut-price breast enlargement surgery from clinics in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]]  and [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name=tet/&gt;

The PIP factory was shut down and their products banned after it was found they had used the chemicals Baysilone, Silopren and Rhodorsil in their implants.&lt;ref name=tet/&gt; These chemicals are normally used as [[List of gasoline additives|fuel additive]]s or in the manufacture of industrial [[Synthetic rubber|rubber]]&lt;!--assumed synthetic, not natural--&gt; tubing.&lt;ref name=tet/&gt;

In 1993, there was an availability crisis of silicone materials for use in medical long-term implant applications.&lt;ref name=nush&gt;[http://www.nusil.com/products/healthcare/index.aspx nusil.com - Healthcare products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204224215/http://www.nusil.com/products/healthcare/index.aspx |date=4 February 2012 }}, 2012, read 2012-01-26&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Mas ordered the staff to "hide the truth" and "We did it for 13 years without a problem".&lt;ref name=gucont/&gt; The PIP gel cost {{nowrap|5 [[Euro|EUR]]}} per litre while the authorized American gel Nusil cost {{nowrap|35 EUR}} per litre. The PIP implants were made with 75% non-authorised gel and 25% Nusil.&lt;ref name=gucont/&gt; "The material was better than that used to make the officially authorised gel," Mas said. "Usually, from 1997 onwards we hid the products used to make the PIP gel. I wasn't allowed to buy these products because they were not authorised. We organised everything to escape being monitored."&lt;ref name=gucont/&gt; Investigators interviewed Mas on 18 and 19 November 2010 after the French health authority [[Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé|AFSSAPS]] discovered the PIP breast implants did not conform to regulations. They passed the case to a judge who ordered a police inquiry for "aggravated deception".&lt;ref name=gucont&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/06/french-breast-implant-firm-boss-unrepentant?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 guardian.co.uk - French breast implant firm boss unrepentant over unauthorised silicone], 2012-01-06&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chest, testicle and buttock implants ==
The bad silicone has been used to make male [[chest]], [[testicle]]&lt;ref name=tet/&gt;&lt;ref name=ndt/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzt/&gt; and [[buttock]] implants as well.&lt;ref name=nzt/&gt; "Three people were specially trained to work with a machine that made silicon testicles'" said a former PIP worker.&lt;ref name=nzt/&gt;&lt;!--France's Le Parisien--&gt;

Most of the male chest, buttock and testicle implants were exported to [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=nzt/&gt;

== Impact per country ==

=== France ===
The French government recommended per December 23, 2011&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; that 30,000 women&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; in France seek removal of breast implants made by PIP.&lt;ref name=rt&gt;REUTERS/Interpol/Handout&lt;/ref&gt; For women that want to keep their implants, the state will pay for a six-month ultrasound scan.&lt;ref name=bbc-dd/&gt;

French public health care funds will be used to finance the recommended implant removals, at a cost estimated at {{nowrap|60 million [[Euro|EUR]]}}. New implants will be paid for in cases where they were used initially for medical reasons, others will need to finance a new implant by themselves. Associations representing women with PIP implants demand that public funds cover all cases. "This announcement is just a smokescreen and the victims of PIP are angry," said Alexandra Blachere, head of the association of PIP implant users in France.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

A government [[Helpline|hotline]] has been set up by December 2011.&lt;ref name=rerg/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In Britain, there are an estimated 30,000{{ndash}}40,000 affected women. The chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said, "Women with PIP implants should not be unduly worried. We have no evidence of a link to cancer or an increased risk of rupture. If women are concerned they should speak to their surgeon". Removing the implant "carries risks in itself," she said.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

Concerns were filed with the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] in 2009 when a lump was found during a [[Mammography|mammogram]] and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound scan]] in a female patients breast but no action was taken by MHRA at the time.&lt;ref name=bbc-al/&gt;

Shadow Health Secretary [[Andy Burnham]] said private clinics in Britain that fitted PIP implants must be forced to pick up the cost of removing them.&lt;ref name=tet/&gt;

On 6 January 2012, [[National Health Service|NHS]] officials began to offer examinations and possible removal - in instances where a doctor ruled that necessary. They also called on private medical centers to offer the same deal to patients who had paid for private sector cosmetic surgery.&lt;ref name=bhre&gt;[http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2012/01/06/2338588/czech-republic-recommends-faulty.html bellinghamherald.com - Mixed advice in Europe over faulty breast implants], 2012-01-06&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2012, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that leading cosmetic surgeon [[Jan Stanek]] had conducted a study with colleague Mike Berry into PIP implants. Their report to the Journal of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery revealed that, in an audit of 453 patients, between 16% and 34% of the PIP implants ruptured. This compared to a failure rate of less than 1% in other implants.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah-Kate Templeton, John Follain, 'Leak Rate Of Faulty Implants Is 1 in 3 In The UK' {{cite web |url=http://www.janstanek.com/file/comment_pdf_1326041882781050132.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524045639/http://www.janstanek.com/file/comment_pdf_1326041882781050132.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}, The Sunday Times, 8 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany and Brazil ===
Germany's medical safety board and Brazil's health watchdog called for users of PIP implants to visit their doctor for checks.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

On 6 January 2012 Germany's [[Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices]] recommended the removal of PIP breast implants as a precaution.&lt;ref name=bhre/&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
The bad breast implants were sold to about 1000 [[Dutch people|Dutch]] women under the name "M-implants" by the Dutch importer Rofil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advocaat: artsen kozen voor die implantaten' (transl.: Lawyer: doctors opted for those implants|url= http://nos.nl/artikel/2047963-advocaat-artsen-kozen-voor-die-implantaten.html|publisher= [[NOS Nieuws]]|date= 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Healthcare in the Netherlands|Dutch healthcare]] spokeswoman Diana Bouhys said, "We have advised them to consult their physician", but also declined to disclose the name of the company. PIP was the third largest maker of breast implants in the world.&lt;ref name=gmmi&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/242781/news/world/sub-standard-breast-implants-sold-to-dutch-firm-under-new-name gmanetwork.com - Sub-standard breast implants sold to Dutch firm under new name], 2011-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
Approximately 5000 implants have already been sold, corresponding to an estimated 2500 Swedish women with the controversial implants. Nine clinics in Sweden has sold them says Gert Bruse of the [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|Swedish Medical Products Agency]] (Läkemedelsverket) told the [[Dagens Nyheter]] (DN) newspaper this week. The agency also recommends that the implants to be removed.

Sweden banned the company's implants in March 2010, along with many other European countries, when it was discovered that substandard silicone gel was causing unusually many implants to burst. "We've had cases where the implants have burst in Sweden, but it's fewer than in France in relation to how many women have these implants in both countries... Implants shouldn't burst and they shouldn't have an irritating effect that spreads throughout the body. What this company has done is criminal, simply put." said Bruse. PIP's implants have only been used in cosmetic breast augmentation surgery, not in reconstructive surgery.&lt;ref name=swbo&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/38116/20111223/ thelocal.se - Swedish women warned over French fake boobs], 2011-12-23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland and Estonia ===
Patients from Finland often visit [[Tallinn]] to get cosmetic surgery. In October 2011 (two months before 22 December 2011), a Finnish woman in her 30s had received a different implant than what was agreed to in advance. An M-implant with the same type code as the implant from PIP was inserted instead of a promised [[Allergan]] implant. At least two Estonian clinics operating in Tallinn have offered M-implants as recently as December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Finnish+woman+got+dangerous+breast+implant+in+Estonia/1135270081610|title=Finnish woman got dangerous breast implant in Estonia|date=2011-12-22|publisher=www.hs.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Documents filed with the US government show that implants were sold until May 2000 through Heritage Worldwide, when the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] launched a moratorium on silicone implants. At the time, the US market accounted for 40% of Heritage Worldwide's revenues, or {{nowrap|3 million [[Euro|EUR]]}}, according to corporate documents filed in 2009 with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC).  In 2007 significant losses started as both users and distributors filed complaints. Between 1996 and 2009, PIP was targeted by several dozen lawsuits in the United States, filed by users and business partners, claiming breach of contract or unmet payments. Starting in 2003, dozens of women began filing lawsuits mainly for product liability against PIP. However, as of 2009, no trial date had yet been set. Many of the lawsuits were later dismissed.&lt;ref name=uslaw&gt;[http://www.thelocal.fr/2128/20111227/ thelocal.fr - French breast implant maker faced US lawsuits], 2011-12-27&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
On 29 December Health Minister [[Renato Balduzzi]] said that hospitals and clinics are required to compile a list of women who has received breast implants from PIP. Even clinics that didn't use any PIP implants will be required to send a declaration stating that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/Italy-orders-list-of-women-with-French-firms-implants jpost.com - Italy orders list of women with French firm's implants], 2011-12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Czech Republic ===
Czech Republic health ministry said about 2000 women with potentially faulty implants should have them removed.&lt;ref name=bhre/&gt;

=== Iceland ===
According to the Icelandic Directorate of Health, 440 women underwent breast surgery where PIP breast implants were used. The Ministry of Welfare have stated that health insured women will be offered counsel and ultrasound examination, free of charge. The Ministry of Welfare also stated that in the event that the implant is leaking, the government will pay a portion of the cost to have it removed.&lt;ref name=gvre&gt;[http://grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Government-Will-Assist-With-Breast-Implant-Removal grapevine.is - Government Will Assist With Breast Implant Removal], 2012-01-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The adequacy of regulations on silicone-filled breast implants, investigation by the regulatory authorities and advice given to women implanted with PIP silicone pre-filled breast implants was criticized in December 2012 in a report examining information publicly available from the regulatory authorities.&lt;ref name=qfi_pr25&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality First International Limited Medical Devices Consultancy|url=http://www.qualityfirstint.com/info_center/pressreleases/pr25.htm|date=2013-01-07|accessdate=2013-01-17|publisher=qualityfirstint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New company ==
A new firm has been registered under the name France Implant Technologie (FIT), with Mas' son Nicolas Lucciardi, 27, and daughter, Peggy Lucciardi, 24, at the address of their mother, Dominique Lucciardi, who was Mas' former civil partner.&lt;ref name=nc/&gt;

The local paper Nice-Matin obtained the business plan in which Mas is named as a "technical-commercial consultant" to the company and described as "a creative genius". Two former PIP managers were listed in senior positions in the company. With the objective to export implants to the "European, South American and Chinese markets". An investment of {{nowrap|2 million [[Euro|EUR]]}} was planned to put the former PIP plant back into operation, aiming to manufacture 400 implants a day with about 20 workers. However, Nicolas Lucciardi said that the project had collapsed due to media coverage of the scandal, adding, "That's obvious".&lt;ref name=nc&gt;[http://www.english.rfi.fr/americas/20111230-french-breast-implant-fraud-boss-tries-start-new-company rfi.fr - French breast implant fraud boss tries to start new company], 2011-12-30&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal process ==
The lawyer Yves Haddad is representing Mas.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; Legal complaints have been filed by 2500 women&lt;ref name=nc/&gt; in France and 250 women in Britain. Mas is wanted in &lt;!--[[France]] and--&gt; [[Costa Rica]] for "life and health" offenses, a warrant issued by [[Interpol]].&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

By February 2011, [[TÜV Rheinland]] sued PIP, claiming it had been "thoroughly and continuously misled" regarding the silicone used.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt; Many [[Senior management|executive]]s are expected to face charges of [[aggravated fraud]] in an ongoing court case in France, expected to be scheduled for October 2012, which carries the possibility of [[prison]] terms of up to five years.&lt;ref name=stbr/&gt;

A criminal charge will be made within a few days he said to [[TF1]] on 25 December 2011. The decision has been made in consultation with minister of health, [[Xavier Bertrand]].&lt;ref name=chiboss/&gt;

British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says that poor [[postmarketing surveillance]] is the root of the crisis, and proposes significantly more stringent monitoring of all medical devices including breast implants and all cosmetic injectables, via compulsory, regular reporting of adverse effects and [[mystery shopping]].

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Edema|Swelling]] (especially in the hands and face) was originally considered an important sign for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. However, because swelling is a common occurrence in pregnancy, its utility as a distinguishing factor in pre-eclampsia is not high. [[Pitting edema]] (unusual swelling, particularly of the hands, feet, or face, notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on) can be significant, and should be reported to a health care provider.

In general, none of the signs of pre-eclampsia are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice. Further, a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn. Diagnosis, therefore, depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression after delivery.

==Causes==
There is no definitive known cause of pre-eclampsia, though it is likely related to a number of factors. Some of these factors include:&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; 
* Abnormal [[placentation]] (formation and development of the placenta) 
* Immunologic factors
* Prior or existing maternal pathology—pre-eclampsia is seen more at a higher incidence in individuals with pre-existing [[hypertension]], obesity, [[antiphospholipid antibody syndrome]], and those with history of pre-eclampsia
* Dietary factors, e.g. calcium supplementation in areas where dietary calcium intake is low has been shown to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; 
* Environmental factors, e.g. air pollution&lt;ref name=EHP&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jun Wu |author2=Cizao Ren |author3=Ralph J. Delfino |author4=Judith Chung |author5=Michelle Wilhelm |author6=Beate Ritz |title=Association Between Local Traffic-Generated Air Pollution and Pre-eclampsia and Preterm Delivery in the South Coast Air Basin of California |publisher=Environmental Health Perspectives |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0800334/0800334.pdf |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719065531/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0800334/0800334.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those with long term [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] have a risk 7 to 8 times higher than those without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bramham|first=K|author2=Parnell, B |author3=Nelson-Piercy, C |author4=Seed, PT |author5=Poston, L |author6= Chappell, LC |title=Chronic hypertension and pregnancy outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Apr 15, 2014|volume=348|page=g2301|pmid=24735917 |pmc=3988319 |doi=10.1136/bmj.g2301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physiologically, research has linked pre-eclampsia to the following physiologic changes: alterations in the interaction between the maternal immune response and the placenta, placental injury, [[endothelial]] cell injury, altered vascular reactivity, oxidative stress, imbalance among [[vasoactive]] substances, decreased intravascular volume, and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mustafa|first=Reem|author2=Ahmed, Sana |author3=Gupta, Anu |author4= Venuto, Rocco C. |title=A Comprehensive Review of Hypertension in Pregnancy|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|year=2012|volume=2012|pages=1–19|doi=10.1155/2012/105918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact cause of pre-eclampsia remains unclear, there is strong evidence that a major cause predisposing a susceptible woman to pre-eclampsia is an abnormally implanted placenta.&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; This abnormally implanted placenta may result in poor uterine and placental perfusion, yielding a state of hypoxia and increased oxidative stress and the release of anti-angiogenic proteins along with inflammatory mediators into the maternal plasma.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; A major consequence of this sequence of events is generalized [[endothelial]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt; The abnormal implantation may stem from the maternal [[immune system]]'s response to the placenta, specifically a lack of established [[immunological tolerance in pregnancy]]. Endothelial dysfunction results in hypertension and many of the other symptoms and complications associated with pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt; Those with pre-eclampsia may have a lower risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Innes, KE|author2=Byers, TE|year=1999|title=Preeclampsia and breast cancer risk|journal=Epidemiology|pages=722–32|jstor=3703514|pmid=10535787|volume=10|doi=10.1097/00001648-199911000-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Placental abnormalities such as placental ischemia.

==Pathogenesis==
Although much research into mechanism of pre-eclampsia has taken place, its exact pathogenesis remains uncertain. Pre-eclampsia is thought to result from an abnormal placenta, the removal of which ends the disease in most cases.&lt;ref name=Al2014 /&gt; During normal pregnancy, the placenta vascularizes to allow for the exchange of water, gases, and solutes, including nutrients and wastes, between maternal and fetal circulations.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; Abnormal development of the placenta leads to poor placental perfusion. The placenta of women with pre-eclampsia is abnormal and characterized by poor trophoblastic invasion.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; It is thought that this results in oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the release of factors that promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and other possible reactions.&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DrifeMagowan&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Drife | first1 = James O. | last2 = Magowan | first2 = Brian. | title = Clinical obstetrics and gynecology | year = 2004 | publisher = Saunders | location = Edinburgh, New York | isbn = 0-7020-1775-2 | pages = 367–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia are associated with general endothelial dysfunction, including vasoconstriction and end-organ ischemia.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; Implicit in this generalized endothelial dysfunction may be an imbalance of [[angiogenic]] and [[anti-angiogenic]] factors.&lt;ref name=Al2014 /&gt; Both circulating and placental levels of [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFlt-1) are higher in women with pre-eclampsia than in women with normal pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; sFlt-1 is an anti-angiogenic protein that antagonizes [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[placental growth factor]] (PIGF), both of which are proangiogenic factors.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Soluble [[endoglin]] (sEng) has also been shown to be elevated in women with pre-eclampsia and has anti-angiogenic properties, much like sFlt-1 does.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt;

Both sFlt-1 and sEng are upregulated in all pregnant women to some extent, supporting the idea that hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|maternal immune tolerance]] for a foreign placenta, it is not surprising that the maternal immune system might respond more negatively to the arrival of some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled [[spiral arteries]] in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.

Oxidative stress may also play an important part in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the enzyme [[xanthine oxidase]] (XO) and this enzyme mainly occurs in the liver. One hypothesis is that the increased purine catabolism from placental hypoxia results in increased ROS production in the maternal liver and release into the maternal circulation that causes endothelial cell damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McMaster-Fay RA | title = Pre-eclampsia: a disease of oxidative stress resulting from the catabolism of DNA (primarily fetal) to uric acid by xanthine oxidase in the maternal liver; a hypothesis. | journal = Bioscience Hypotheses | year = 2008 | volume = 1 | pages = 35–43 | doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abnormalities in the maternal [[immune system]] and insufficiency of [[gestational immune tolerance]] seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward [[T helper cell|Th&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; responses]] and the production of [[Interferon gamma|IFN-γ]]. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the [[natural killer cell]]s of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of [[T helper cells]], alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of [[regulatory T cell]]s in pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Laresgoiti-Servitje"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laresgoiti-Servitje E, Gómez-López N, Olson DM | title = An immunological insight into the origins of pre-eclampsia | journal = Hum Reprod Update | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 510–24 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20388637 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq007 | url = http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/5/510?etoc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers.&lt;ref name="Laresgoiti-Servitje" /&gt; It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal [[Nucleated red blood cell|erythroblasts]] as well as [[cell-free fetal DNA]] are increased in the maternal circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia. These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into the maternal circulation, that in turn leads to an [[immune response]] and endothelial damage, and that ultimately results in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

One hypothesis for vulnerability to pre-eclampsia is the maternal-fetal conflict between the maternal organism and fetus.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Redman CW, Sargent IL | title = Latest Advances in Understanding Preeclampsia | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5728 | pages = 1592–94 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15947178 | pmc = | doi = 10.1126/science.1111726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first trimester trophoblasts enter the spiral arteries of the mother to alter the spiral arteries and thereby gain more access to maternal nutrients.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt; Occasionally there is impaired trophoblast invasion that results in inadequate alterations to the uterine spiral arteries.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt; It is hypothesized that the developing embryo releases biochemical signals that result in the woman developing hypertension and pre-eclampsia so that the fetus can benefit from a greater amount of maternal circulation of nutrients due to increased blood flow to the impaired placenta.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt; This results in a conflict between maternal and fetal fitness and survival because the fetus is invested in only its survival and fitness while the mother is invested in this and subsequent pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt;

Another evolutionary hypothesis for vulnerability to pre-eclampsia is the idea of ensuring pair-bonding between the mother and father and paternal investment in the fetus.&lt;ref name="Davis2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Gallup | first2 = G. G.

In normal early embryonic development, the outer epithelial layer contains cytotrophoblast cells, a stem cell type found in the trophoblast that later differentiates into the fetal placenta. These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells. Extravillous trophoblast cells are an invasive cell type which remodel the maternal spiral arteries by replacing the maternal epithelium and smooth muscle lining the spiral arteries causing artery dilation. This prevents maternal vasoconstriction in the spiral arteries and allows for continued blood and nutrient supply to the growing fetus with low resistance and high blood flow.&lt;ref name="Chen D., Wang W. 2013 1–11"/&gt;

In pre-eclampsia, abnormal expression of chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) in placental cell lines reduces extravillus trophoblast migration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xie L. |author2=Mouillet J.-F. |author3=Cu T. |author4=Parks W.

This impairs extravillus trophoblast cells invasion to the maternal spiral arteries, causing high resistance and low blood flow and low nutrient supply to the fetus.&lt;ref name="Chen D., Wang W. 2013 1–11"/&gt;

Testing for pre-eclampsia is recommended throughout [[pregnancy]] via measuring a woman's blood pressure.&lt;ref name=USPSTF2017/&gt;

===Diagnostic criteria===
Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant woman develops:&lt;ref name="Harrison's"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Longo | first1 = Dan L. (Dan Louis) | title = Harrison's principles of internal medicine | year = 2012 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6 | pages = 55–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blood pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90 mmHg diastolic on two separate readings taken at least four to six hours apart after 20 weeks' gestation in an individual with previously normal blood pressure.
* In a woman with essential hypertension beginning before 20 weeks' gestational age, the diagnostic criteria are: an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥30 mmHg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥15 mmHg.
* [[Proteinuria]] ≥ {{convert|0.3|g|mg}} or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample or a SPOT urinary protein to creatinine ratio ≥0.3 or a urine dipstick reading of 1+ or greater (dipstick reading should only be used if other quantitative methods are not available).&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt;

Suspicion for pre-eclampsia should be maintained in any pregnancy complicated by elevated blood pressure, even in the absence of proteinuria. Ten percent of individuals with other signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia and 20% of individuals diagnosed with eclampsia show no evidence of proteinuria.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; In the absence of proteinuria, the presence of new-onset [[hypertension]] (elevated blood pressure) and the new onset of one or more of the following is suggestive of the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia:&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; 
* Evidence of kidney dysfunction ([[oliguria]], elevated [[creatinine]] levels)
* Impaired liver function (noted by [[liver function tests]])
* [[Thrombocytopenia]] (platelet count &lt;100,000/microliter)
* [[Pulmonary edema]]
*[[Peripheral edema|Ankle edema]] (pitting type)
* Cerebral or visual disturbances

Pre-eclampsia is a progressive disorder and these signs of organ dysfunction are indicative of severe pre-eclampsia. A systolic blood pressure ≥160 or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 and/or proteinuria &gt;5g in a 24-hour period is also indicative of severe pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; Clinically, individuals with severe pre-eclampsia may also present [[Epigastrium|epigastric]]/right upper quadrant abdominal pain, headaches, and vomiting.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; Severe pre-eclampsia is a significant risk factor for intrauterine fetal death.

A rise in baseline blood pressure (BP) of 30 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]] systolic or 15 mmHg diastolic, while not meeting the absolute criteria of 140/90, is important to note but is not considered diagnostic.

===Predictive tests===
There have been many assessments of tests aimed at predicting pre-eclampsia, though no single biomarker is likely to be sufficiently predictive of the disorder.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Predictive tests that have been assessed include those related to placental perfusion, vascular resistance, kidney dysfunction, [[endothelial]] dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Examples of notable tests include:
* Doppler [[ultrasonography]] of the uterine arteries to investigate for signs of inadequate placental perfusion. This test has a high negative predictive value among those individuals with a history of prior pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt;
* Elevations in serum uric acid ([[hyperuricemia]]) is used by some to "define" pre-eclampsia,&lt;ref name="al. 2010"/&gt; though it has been found to be a poor predictor of the disorder.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; Elevated levels in the blood ([[hyperuricemia]]) are likely due to reduced uric acid clearance secondary to impaired kidney function.
* [[Angiogenic]] proteins such as [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[placental growth factor]] (PIGF) and anti-angiogenic proteins such as [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFlt-1) have shown promise for potential clinical use in diagnosing pre-eclampsia, though evidence is sufficient to recommend a clinical use for these markers.&lt;ref name="al. 2010"/&gt;
* Recent studies have shown that looking for [[podocyte]]s (specialized cells of the kidney) in the urine has the potential to aid in the prediction of pre-eclampsia. Studies have demonstrated that finding podocytes in the urine may serve as an early marker of and diagnostic test for pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craici|first=IM |author2=Wagner, SJ |author3=Bailey, KR |author4=Fitz-Gibbon, PD |author5=Wood-Wentz, CM |author6=Turner, ST |author7=Hayman, SR |author8=White, WM |author9=Brost, BC |author10=Rose, CH |author11=Grande, JP |author12=Garovic, VD|title=Podocyturia predates proteinuria and clinical features of preeclampsia: longitudinal prospective study.|journal=Hypertension|date=Jun 2013|volume=61|issue=6|pages=1289–96|pmid=23529165|doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.01115|pmc=3713793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News - Pre-eclampsia predicted using test during pregnancy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15694021|title=BBC News – Pre-eclampsia predicted using test during pregnancy|work=|accessdate=2011-11-22|date=2011-11-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118120704/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15694021|archivedate=2011-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mechanisms and Management of Hypertension in Pregnant Women."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:21656283 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416082731/http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:21656283 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-16 |title=Mechanisms and Management of Hypertension in Pregnant Women. |work= |accessdate=2011-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==

Pre-eclampsia can mimic and be confused with many other diseases, including chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, primary seizure disorders, gallbladder and [[pancreatic disease]], immune or [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[antiphospholipid syndrome]] and [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]. It must be considered a possibility in any pregnant woman beyond 20 weeks of gestation. It is particularly difficult to diagnose when pre-existing conditions such as [[hypertension]] are present.&lt;ref name=AMN1&gt;{{cite web | title =Pre-eclampsia-Eclampsia | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work =Diagnosis and management of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia | url=http://www.health.am/gyneco/more/pre-eclampsia_eclampsia/ | year = 2003 | accessdate=2005-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with [[acute fatty liver of pregnancy]] may also present with elevated blood pressure and protein in the urine, but differ by the extent of liver damage. Other disorders that can cause high blood pressure include [[Hyperthyroidism|thyrotoxicosis]], [[pheochromocytoma]], and [[Substance abuse|drug misuse]].&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;

==Prevention==
Preventive measures against pre-eclampsia have been heavily studied. Because the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is not completely understood, prevention remains a complex issue. Below are some of the currently accepted recommendations.

===Diet===
Supplementation with a balanced protein and energy diet does not appear to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ota|first1=E|last2=Hori|first2=H|last3=Mori|first3=R|last4=Tobe-Gai|first4=R|last5=Farrar|first5=D|title=Antenatal dietary education and supplementation to increase energy and protein intake.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2 June 2015|issue=6|pages=CD000032|pmid=26031211|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000032.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there is no evidence that changing [[salt]] intake has an effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duley L, Henderson-Smart D, Meher S | title = Altered dietary salt for preventing pre-eclampsia, and its complications. | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | page = CD005548 | date =October 19, 2005 | pmid = 16235411 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplementation with [[antioxidant]]s such as vitamin C, D and E has no effect on pre-eclampsia incidence;&lt;ref name="NEJM2006-Rumbold"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rumbold AR, Crowther CA, Haslam RR, Dekker GA, Robinson JS | title = Vitamins C and E and the risks of pre-eclampsia and perinatal complications | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = 17 | pages = 1796–806 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16641396 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa054186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=WHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.|date=2011|isbn=978-92-4-154833-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, supplementation with vitamins C, E, and D is not recommended for reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Calcium]] supplementation of at least 1 gram per day is recommended during pregnancy as it prevents pre-eclampsia where dietary calcium intake is low, especially for those at high risk.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=GJ|last2=Lawrie|first2=TA|last3=Atallah|first3=AN|last4=Duley|first4=L|last5=Torloni|first5=MR|title=Calcium supplementation during pregnancy for preventing hypertensive disorders and related problems.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jun 24, 2014|volume=6|pages=CD001059|pmid=24960615|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001059.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30277579|date = December 2018}} Low [[selenium]] status is associated with higher incidence of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name="pmid14634566"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rayman MP, Bode P, Redman CW | title = Low selenium status is associated with the occurrence of the pregnancy disease pre-eclampsia in women from the United Kingdom | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 189 | issue = 5 | pages = 1343–49 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14634566 | doi = 10.1067/S0002-9378(03)00723-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smoking cessation===
In low-risk pregnancies, the association between cigarette [[smoking]] and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has been consistent and reproducible across epidemiologic studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) showed no significant protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology increases the risk of pre-eclampsia to such a degree that any measurable reduction of risk due to smoking is masked.&lt;ref name="pmid18566591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeyabalan A, Powers RW, Durica AR, Harger GF, Roberts JM, Ness RB | title = Cigarette Smoke Exposure and Angiogenic Factors in Pregnancy and Preeclampsia | journal = Am.

==Treatment==
The definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia is the delivery of the baby and placenta. The timing of delivery should balance the desire for optimal outcomes for the baby while reducing risks for the mother.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; The severity of disease and the maturity of the baby are primary considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles R.B. Beckmann ...

Treatment can range from expectant management to expedited delivery by [[Labor induction|induction of labor]] or [[Caesarean section]], in addition to medications. Important in management is the assessment of the mothers organ systems, management of severe hypertension, and prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Separate interventions directed at the baby may also be necessary. Bed rest has not been found to be useful and is thus not routinely recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCall|first1=CA|last2=Grimes|first2=DA|last3=Lyerly|first3=AD|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=June 2013|volume=121|issue=6|pages=1305–8|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/aog.0b013e318293f12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood pressure===
The World Health Organization recommends that women with severe [[hypertension]] during pregnancy should receive treatment with anti-hypertensive agents.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Severe hypertension is generally considered systolic BP of at least 160 or diastolic BP of at least 110.&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt; Evidence does not support the use of one anti-hypertensive over another.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; The choice of which agent to use should be based on the prescribing clinician's experience with a particular agent, its cost, and its availability.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Diuretics are not recommended for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; [[Labetalol]], [[Hydralazine]] and [[Nifedipine]] are commonly used antihypertensive agents for [[Hypertensive disease of pregnancy|hypertension in pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[Angiotensin II receptor blocker|angiotensin receptor blockers]] are contraindicated as they affect fetal development.&lt;ref name="Harrison's" /&gt;

The goal of treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is to prevent cardiovascular, kidney, and cerebrovascular complications.&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt; The target blood pressure has been proposed to be 140–160 mmHg systolic and 90–105 mmHg diastolic, although values are variable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvog-documenten.nl/uploaded/docs/Hypertensieve%20aandoeningen/Hypertensive_disorders_in_pregnancy%5B1%5D.pdf Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy.

===Prevention of eclampsia===
The intrapartum and postpartum administration of magnesium sulfate is recommended in severe pre-eclampsia for the prevention of [[eclampsia]].&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Further, magnesium sulfate is recommended for the treatment of eclampsia over other anticonvulsants.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Magnesium sulfate acts by interacting with [[NMDA receptor]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison's" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Pre-eclampsia affects approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies worldwide,&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (WHO). World health report 2005: make every mother and child count. Geneva: WHO; 2005, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of pre-eclampsia has risen in the U.S. since the 1990s, possibly as a result of increased prevalence of predisposing disorders, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;

Pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide.&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt; Nearly one-tenth of all maternal deaths in Africa and Asia and one-quarter in Latin America are associated with hypertensive diseases in pregnancy, a category that encompasses pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt;

Pre-eclampsia is much more common in women who are pregnant for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins and Cotran, ''Pathological Basis of Disease, 7th ed.''&lt;/ref&gt; Women who have previously been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia are also more likely to experience pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; Pre-eclampsia is also more common in women who have pre-existing [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], [[autoimmune]] diseases such as [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]], various inherited thrombophilias such as [[Factor V Leiden]], [[chronic renal failure|renal disease]], multiple gestation ([[twin]]s or [[multiple birth]]), and advanced maternal age.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; Women who live at high altitude are also more likely to experience pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/pr/journal/v54/n1/full/pr2003356a.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206095253/http://www.nature.com/pr/journal/v54/n1/full/pr2003356a.html |archivedate=2017-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=LG|last2=Shriver|first2=M|last3=Bemis|first3=L|last4=Hickler|first4=B|last5=Wilson|first5=M|last6=Brutsaert|first6=T|last7=Parra|first7=E|last8=Vargas|first8=E|title=Maternal adaptation to high-altitude pregnancy: an experiment of nature – a review.|journal=Placenta|date=April 2004|volume=25 Suppl A|pages=S60–71|pmid=15033310|url=http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~parraest/profile/PDF%20files/Moore%20et%20al.,%202004.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2004.01.008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817104315/http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~parraest/profile/PDF%20files/Moore%20et%20al.%2C%202004.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-eclampsia is also more common in some ethnic groups (e.g. African-Americans, Sub-Saharan Africans, Latin Americans, African Caribbeans, and Filipinos).&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Urquia ML, Glazier RH, Gagnon AJ, Mortensen LH, Nybo Andersen AM, Janevic T, Guendelman S, Thornton D, Bolumar F, Río Sánchez I, Small R, Davey MA, Hjern A |title=Disparities in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia among immigrant women giving birth in six industrialised countries |journal=BJOG |volume=121 |issue=12 |pages=1492–500 |year=2014 |pmid=24758368 |pmc=4232918 |doi=10.1111/1471-0528.12758 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change of paternity in a subsequent pregnancy has been implicated as affecting risk, except in those with a family history of hypertensive pregnancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hjartardottir S, Leifsson BG, Geirsson RT, Steinthorsdottir V | title = Paternity change and the recurrence risk in familial hypertensive disorder in pregnancy | journal = Hypertension in Pregnancy | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 219–25 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15369654 | doi = 10.1081/PRG-120037889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eclampsia]] is a major complication of pre-eclampsia. Eclampsia affects 0.56 per 1,000 pregnant women in developed countries and almost 10 to 30 times as many women in low-income countries as in developed countries.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;

==Complications==
Complications of pre-eclampsia can affect both the mother and the fetus. Acutely, pre-eclampsia can be complicated by [[eclampsia]], the development of [[HELLP syndrome]], hemorrhagic or ischemic [[stroke]], liver damage and dysfunction, [[acute kidney injury]], and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS).&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt;

Pre-eclampsia is also associated with increased frequency of [[Caesarean section]], [[Preterm birth|preterm delivery]], and [[placental abruption]]. Furthermore, an elevation in blood pressure can occur in some individuals in the first week postpartum attributable to volume expansion and fluid mobilization.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; Fetal complications include fetal growth restriction and potential fetal or perinatal death.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt;

Long-term, an individual with pre-eclampsia is at increased risk for recurrence of pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.

===Eclampsia===
[[Eclampsia]] is the development of new [[convulsion]]s in a pre-eclamptic patient that may not be attributed to other cause. It is a sign that the underlying pre-eclamptic condition is severe and is associated with high rates of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Warning symptoms for eclampsia in an individual with current pre-eclampsia may include headaches, visual disturbances, and right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain, with a headache being the most consistent symptom.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= F. Gary Cunningham, et al. (editors) |title=Williams Obstetrics|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0071497015|edition=23rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magnesium sulfate]] is used to prevent convulsions in cases of severe pre-eclampsia.

===HELLP Syndrome===
[[HELLP syndrome]] is defined as [[hemolysis]] (microangiopathic), elevated liver enzymes (liver dysfunction), and low platelets ([[thrombocytopenia]]). This condition may occur in 10–20% of patients with severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; and is associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In 50% of instances, HELLP syndrome develops preterm, while 20% of cases develop in late gestation and 30% during the post-partum period.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;

===Long term===
There is also an increased risk for cardiovascular complications, including hypertension and ischemic heart disease, and kidney disease.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; Other risks include [[stroke]] and [[Venous thrombosis|venous thromboembolism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellamy L, Casas JP, Hingorani AD, Williams DJ |title=Pre-eclampsia and risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in later life: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7627 |page=974 |year=2007 |pmid=17975258 |pmc=2072042 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39335.385301.BE |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McDonald SD, Malinowski A, Zhou Q, Yusuf S, Devereaux PJ |title=Cardiovascular sequelae of preeclampsia/eclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analyses |journal=Am.

Lowered blood supply to the fetus in pre-eclampsia causes lowered nutrient supply, which could result in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight.&lt;ref name="Chen D., Wang W. 2013 1–11"/&gt; The fetal origins hypothesis states that fetal undernutrition is linked with coronary heart disease later in adult life due to disproportionate growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barker D.

J. | year = 1995 | title = Fetal origins of coronary heart disease | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 311 | issue = | pages = 171–74 | doi=10.1136/bmj.311.6998.171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because pre-eclampsia leads to a mismatch between the maternal energy supply and fetal energy demands, pre-eclampsia can lead to IUGR in the developing fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sharma D. |author2=Shastri S. |author3=Sharma P. | year = 2016 | title = Intrauterine Growth Restriction: Antenatal and Postnatal Aspects | url = | journal = Clinical Medicine Insights: Pediatrics | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 67–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants suffering from IUGR are prone to suffer from poor neuronal development and in increased risk for adult disease according to the Barker hypothesis. Associated adult diseases of the fetus due to IUGR include, but are not limited to, coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cancer, osteoporosis, and various psychiatric illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Calkins K., Devaskar S. U. | year = 2011 | title = Fetal origins of adult disease | url = | journal = Current Problems in Pediatric &amp; Adolescent Health Care | volume = 41 | issue = 6| pages = 158–76 | doi=10.1016/j.cppeds.2011.01.001| pmc = 4608552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of pre-eclampsia and development of placental dysfunction has also been shown to be recurrent cross-generationally on the maternal side and most likely on the paternal side. Fetuses born to mothers that were born small for gestational age (SGA) were 50% more likely to develop pre-eclampsia while fetuses born to both SGA parents were three-fold more likely to develop pre-eclampsia in future pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wikström A. K. |author2=Svensson T. |author3=Kieler H. |author4=Cnattingius S. | year = 2011 | title = Recurrence of placental dysfunction disorders across generations | url = | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 205 | issue = 5| page = 454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word eclampsia is from the Greek term for [[lightning]].&lt;ref name=Em2006/&gt; The first known description of the condition was by [[Hippocrates]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name=Em2006/&gt;

An outdated medical term for pre-eclampsia is [[wikt:toxemia|toxemia]] of pregnancy, a term that originated in the mistaken belief that the condition was caused by [[toxins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601156/toxemia-of-pregnancy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328201744/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601156/toxemia-of-pregnancy |archivedate=2014-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
{{anchor|paternal tolerance}} 
Some studies have suggested the importance of a woman's [[Immune tolerance|immunological tolerance]] to her baby's father, as the baby and father share genetics. There is tentative evidence that ongoing exposure either by vaginal or oral sex to the same semen that resulted in the pregnancy decreases the risk of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=SeminalPriming&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson SA, Bromfield JJ, Tremellen KP | title = Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia-a unifying hypothesis | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 253–65 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12896827 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As one early study described, "although pre-eclampsia is a disease of first pregnancies, the protective effect of multiparity is lost with change of partner".&lt;ref name=Dekk9618714&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dekker GA, Robillard PY, Hulsey TC | title = Immune maladaptation in the etiology of pre-eclampsia: a review of corroborative epidemiologic studies | journal = Obstetrical &amp; Gynecological Survey | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | pages = 377–82 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9618714 | doi = 10.1097/00006254-199806000-00023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also concluded that although women with changing partners are strongly advised to use condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, "a certain period of sperm exposure within a stable relation, when pregnancy is aimed for, is associated with protection against pre-eclampsia".&lt;ref name="Dekk9618714"/&gt;

Several other studies have since investigated the decreased incidence of pre-eclampsia in women who had received blood transfusions from their partner, those with long preceding histories of sex without barrier contraceptives, and in women who had been regularly performing [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name=Elizabeth_Bonney&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bonney EA | title = Preeclampsia: A view through the danger model | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 76 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 68–74 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17482268 | pmc = 2246056 | doi = 10.1016/j.jri.2007.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having already noted the importance of a woman's immunological tolerance to her baby's paternal genes, several Dutch reproductive biologists decided to take their research a step further. Consistent with the fact that human immune systems tolerate things better when they enter the body via the mouth, the Dutch researchers conducted a series of studies that confirmed a surprisingly strong correlation between a diminished incidence of pre-eclampsia and a woman's practice of oral sex, and noted that the protective effects were strongest if she swallowed her partner's semen.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth_Bonney"/&gt;&lt;ref name = mattar_sexual_behavior&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattar R, Soares RV, Daher S | title = Sexual behavior and recurrent spontaneous abortion | journal = International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 154–55 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15694097 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2004.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A team from the [[University of Adelaide]] has also investigated to see if men who have fathered pregnancies which have ended in [[miscarriage]] or pre-eclampsia had low seminal levels of critical immune modulating factors such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-beta]]. The team has found that certain men, dubbed "dangerous males", are several times more likely to father pregnancies that would end in either pre-eclampsia or [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="SeminalPriming"/&gt; Among other things, most of the "dangerous males" seemed to lack sufficient levels of the seminal immune factors necessary to induce [[immunological tolerance]] in their partners.&lt;ref name=Dekker_Partner_Role&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dekker G | title = The partner's role in the etiology of pre-eclampsia | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 57 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 203–15 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12385843 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0378(02)00039-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the theory of immune intolerance as a cause of pre-eclampsia has become accepted, women who with repeated pre-eclampsia, miscarriages, or [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] failures could potentially be administered key immune factors such as TGF-beta along with the father's foreign proteins, possibly either orally, as a sublingual spray, or as a vaginal gel to be applied onto the vaginal wall before intercourse.&lt;ref name="SeminalPriming"/&gt;

Pseudonymization can be one way to comply with the [[European Union]]'s new [[General Data Protection Regulation]] demands for secure data storage of personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dativa.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/ Data science under GDPR with pseudonymization in the data pipeline] Published by Dativa, 17 April, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudonymized data can be restored to its original state with the addition of information which then allows individuals to be re-identified, while anonymized data can never be restored to its original state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protegrity.com/pseudonymization-vs-anonymization-help-gdpr/ Pseudonymization vs. Anonymization and How They Help With GDPR] Published January, 2017 Retrieved April 20, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data fields==
The choice of which data fields are to be pseudonymized is partly subjective. Less selective fields, such as Birth Date or Postal Code are often also included because they are usually available from other sources and therefore make a record easier to identify. Pseudonymizing these less identifying fields removes most of their analytic value and is therefore normally accompanied by the introduction of new derived and less identifying forms, such as year of birth or a larger [[postal code]] region.

Data fields that are less identifying, such as date of attendance, are usually not pseudonymized. It is important to realize that this is because too much statistical utility is lost in doing so, not because the data cannot be identified. For example, given prior knowledge of a few attendance dates it is easy to identify someone's data in a pseudonymized dataset by selecting only those people with that pattern of dates. This is an example of an [[inference attack]].

The weakness of pseudonymized data to inference attacks is commonly overlooked. A famous example is the [[AOL search data scandal]].

Protecting statistically useful pseudonymized data from re-identification requires:
#  a sound [[information security]] base 
#  controlling the risk that the analysts, researchers or other data workers cause a privacy breach

The pseudonym allows tracking back of data to its origins, which distinguishes pseudonymization from [[anonymization]],&lt;ref&gt;http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.31.pdf Anonymity, Unlinkability, Undetectability, Unobservability, Pseudonymity, and Identity Management – A Consolidated Proposal for Terminology&lt;/ref&gt; where all person-related data that could allow backtracking has been purged. Pseudonymization is an issue in, for example, patient-related data that has to be passed on securely between clinical centers.

The application of pseudonymization to e-health intends to preserve the patient's privacy and data confidentiality. It allows primary use of medical records by authorized health care providers and privacy preserving secondary use by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer T, Heurix J. A methodology for the pseudonymization of medical data. Int J Med Inform. 2011 Mar;80(3) 190-204. doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2010.10.016. {{PMID|21075676}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, plain pseudonymization for privacy preservation often reaches its limits when [[genetic data]] are involved (see also [[genetic privacy]]). Due to the identifying nature of genetic data, depersonalization is often not sufficient to hide the corresponding person. Potential solutions are the combination of pseudonymization with fragmentation and [[encryption]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xylem-technologies.com/2011/09/07/privacy-preserving-storage-and-access-of-medical-data-through-pseudonymization-and-encryption Privacy-Preserving Storage and Access of Medical Data through Pseudonymization and Encryption&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of application of pseudonymization procedure is creation of datasets for [[de-identification]] research by replacing [[Personally identifiable information|identifying]] words with words from the same category (e.g. replacing a name with a random name from the names dictionary),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neamatullah | first1 = Ishna | last2 = Douglass | first2 = Margaret M | last3 = Li-wei | last4 = Lehman | first4 = H | last5 = Reisner | first5 = Andrew | last6 = Villarroe | first6 = Mauricio | last7 = Long | first7 = William J | last8 = Szolovits | first8 = Peter | last9 = Moody | first9 = George B | last10 = Mark | first10 = Roger G | last11 = Clifford | first11 = Gari D | year = 2008 | title = Automated de-identification of free-text medical records | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/8/32 | journal = BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making | volume = 8 | issue ishna neamatullah, automated de-identification of free-text medical records, http://www.physionet.= | page = 32 | doi=10.1186/1472-6947-8-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;org/physiotools/deid/doc/ishna-meng-thesis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deleger | first1 = L | display-authors = etal   | year = 2014 | title = Preparing an annotated gold standard corpus to share with extramural investigators for de-identification research | url = | journal = J Biomed Inform | volume = 50| issue = | pages = 173–183| doi = 10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in this case it is in general not possible to track data back to its origins.

[[File:Angolan community members at HIV AIDS outreach event (5686747785).jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Public health]] education with regard to prevention of [[HIV/AIDS]] in an educational outreach session in [[Angola]].]]
Within the framework of the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) definition of [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, '''reproductive health''', or '''sexual health'''/'''hygiene''', addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en/|title=WHO: Reproductive health|access-date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UN agencies claim, sexual and reproductive health includes physical, as well as psychological well-being vis-a-vis sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf | title = International technical guidance on sexuality education: an evidence-informed approach | publisher = UNESCO | year = 2018 | isbn = 978-92-3-100259-5 | location = Paris | pages = 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive health implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and [[Safer sex|safer sex life]] and that they have the capability to reproduce and the [[Family planning|freedom to decide]] if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be [[sex education|informed]] of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of [[birth control]]; also access to appropriate [[reproductive medicine|health care services]] of [[sexual medicine|sexual]], [[reproductive medicine]] and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of [[maternal health|women to go safely]] through [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.

Individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall KS, Moreau C, Trussell J | title = Determinants of and disparities in reproductive health service use among adolescent and young adult women in the United States, 2002-2008 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–67 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22390451 | pmc = 3483992 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproductive health ==
The WHO assessed in 2008 that "Reproductive and sexual ill-health accounts for 20% of the global burden of ill-health for women, and 14% for men."&lt;ref name="WHOstrat2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/strategy.htm|title=Reproductive Health Strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=World Health Organization | access-date=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive health is a part of [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]]. According to the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA), unmet needs for sexual and reproductive health deprive women of the right to make "crucial choices about their own bodies and futures", affecting family welfare. Women bear and usually nurture children, so their reproductive health is inseparable from gender equality. Denial of such rights also worsens poverty.&lt;ref name="SRH2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sexual-reproductive-health|title=Sexual reproductive health|publisher=UN Population Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adolescent health ==
[[File:Teenage birth rate per 1000 women 15–19, 2000-09.svg|thumb|300px|Teenage birth rate per 1,000 females aged 15–19, 2000–2009&lt;ref name="ustats-births"&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2009-2010/Table10.pdf Live births by age of mother and sex of child, general and age-specific fertility rates: latest available year, 2000–2009]&amp;nbsp;— United Nations Statistics Division&amp;nbsp;– Demographic and Social Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Further|Teenage pregnancy|Adolescent sexuality}}
[[Adolescent health]] creates a major global burden and has a great deal of additional and diverse complications compared to adult reproductive health such as early pregnancy and parenting issues, difficulties accessing contraception and safe abortions, lack of healthcare access, and high rates of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, and mental health issues. Each of those can be affected by outside political, economic and socio-cultural influences.&lt;ref name="pmid26433504"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris JL, Rushwan H | title = Adolescent sexual and reproductive health: The global challenges | journal = International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics | volume = 131 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = S40–2 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26433504 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2015.02.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For most adolescent females, they have yet to complete their body growth trajectories, therefore adding a pregnancy exposes them to a predisposition to complications. These complications range from anemia, malaria, HIV and other STI's, postpartum bleeding and other postpartum complications, mental health disorders such as depression and suicidal thoughts or attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health | url = http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/maternal/adolescent_pregnancy/en/ | publisher = World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, adolescent birth rates between the ages of 15-19 was 44 per 1000, 1 in 3 experienced sexual violence, and there more than 1.2 million deaths. The top three leading causes of death in females between the ages of 15-19 are maternal conditions 10.1%, self-harm 9.6%, and road conditions 6.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health (2016-2030) Key Statistics | url = http://www.who.int/life-course/partners/global-strategy/global-strategy-key-statistics-03-11-2017.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The causes for teenage pregnancy are vast and diverse. In developing countries, young women are pressured to marry for different reasons. One reason is to bear children to help with work, another on a [[dowry system]] to increase the families income, another is due to prearranged marriages. These reasons tie back to financial needs of girls' family, cultural norms, religious beliefs and external conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Girl Child Marriage: A Persistent Global Women’s Health and Human Rights Violation | title = Global Perspectives on Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Across the Lifecourse | last = Raj | first  = A nita | last2 = Jackson | first2 = Emma | last3 = Dunham | first3 = Serena | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2018| publisher = Springer, Cham | isbn = 9783319604169 | pages = 3–19 | doi=10.1007/978-3-319-60417-6_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolescent pregnancy, especially in developing countries, carries increased health risks, and contributes to maintaining the [[cycle of poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/adolescence/9789241502214/en/|title=Preventing early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents in developing countries |publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=September 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability and type of [[sex education]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; for teenagers varies in different parts of the world. LGBT teens may suffer additional problems if they live in places where homosexual activity is socially disapproved and/or illegal; in extreme cases there can be depression, social isolation and even [[suicide among LGBT youth]].

== Maternal health ==

Ninety nine percent of maternal deaths occur in developing countries and in 25 years, maternal mortality globally dropped to 44%.&lt;ref name="WHO_Maternal_mortality"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality|title=Maternal mortality|website=World Health Organization |access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistically, a woman’s chance of survival during childbirth is closely tied to her social economic status, access to healthcare, where she lives geographically, and cultural norms.&lt;ref name="Alkema_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alkema L, Chou D, Hogan D, Zhang S, Moller AB, Gemmill A, Fat DM, Boerma T, Temmerman M, Mathers C, Say L | title = Global, regional, and national levels and trends in maternal mortality between 1990 and 2015, with scenario-based projections to 2030: a systematic analysis by the UN Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group | journal = Lancet | volume = 387 | issue = 10017 | pages = 462–74 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26584737 | pmc = 5515236 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00838-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To compare, a woman dies of complications from childbirth every minute in developing countries versus a total of 1% of total maternal mortality deaths in developed countries. Women in developing countries have little access to family planning services, different cultural practices, have lack of information, birthing attendants, prenatal care, birth control, postnatal care, lack of access to health care and are typically in poverty. In 2015, those in low-income countries had access to antenatal care visits averaged to 40% and were preventable.&lt;ref name="WHO_Maternal_mortality" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alkema_2016" /&gt; All these reasons lead to an increase in the [[Maternal Mortality Ratio|Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)]].

One of the international [[Sustainable Development Goals]] developed by [[The UN|United Nation]]s is to improve maternal health by a targeted 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.&lt;ref name="Alkema_2016" /&gt; Most models of maternal health encompass family planning, preconception, prenatal, and postnatal care. All care after childbirth recovery is typically excluded, which includes [[Premenopause|pre-menopause]] and aging into old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/maternal-health|title=Maternal health|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During childbirth, women typically die from severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, delivery complications, or an unsafe abortion. Other reasons can be regional such as complications related to diseases such as malaria and AIDS during pregnancy.  The younger the women is when she gives birth, the more at risk her and her baby is for complications and possibly mortality.&lt;ref name="WHO_Maternal_mortality" /&gt;

There is a significant relationship between the quality of maternal services made
available and the greater financial standings of a country&lt;ref&gt;Borghi, Jo. “Mobilising Domestic Financial Resources for Development.” 2002, doi:10.14217/9781848597655-4-en.&lt;/ref&gt;. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
exemplify this as these regions are significantly deprived of medical staff and affordable health
opportunities&lt;ref&gt;Filippi, Véronique, et al. “Maternal Health in Poor Countries: the Broader Context and a Call for Action.” The Lancet, vol. 368, no. 9546, 28 Sept. 2006, pp. 1535–1541., doi:10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69384-7.&lt;/ref&gt;. Most countries provide for their health services through a combination of
funding from government tax revenue and local households&lt;ref&gt;Borghi, Jo. “Mobilising Domestic Financial Resources for Development.” 2002, doi:10.14217/9781848597655-4-en.&lt;/ref&gt;. Poorer nations or regions with
extremely concentrated wealth can leave citizens on the margins uncared for or overlooked.
However, the lack of proper leadership in the can result in a nation’s public sectors being
mishandled or poorly performing despite said nation’s resources and standing&lt;ref&gt;Borghi, Jo. “Mobilising Domestic Financial Resources for Development.” 2002, doi:10.14217/9781848597655-4-en.&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition,
poorer nations funding their medical services through taxes places a greater financial burden on
the public and effectively the mothers themselves&lt;ref&gt;Filippi, Véronique, et al. “Maternal Health in Poor Countries: the Broader Context and a Call for Action.” The Lancet, vol. 368, no. 9546, 28 Sept. 2006, pp. 1535–1541., doi:10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69384-7.&lt;/ref&gt;.
Responsibility and accountability on the part of mental health sectors are strongly
emphasized as to what will remedy the poor quality of maternal health globally&lt;ref&gt;Filippi, Véronique, et al. “Maternal Health in Poor Countries: the Broader Context and a Call for Action.” The Lancet, vol. 368, no. 9546, 28 Sept. 2006, pp. 1535–1541., doi:10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69384-7.&lt;/ref&gt;.

of different maternal health interventions across the globe stagger variously and are vastly
uneven&lt;ref&gt;Borghi, Jo. “Mobilising Domestic Financial Resources for Development.” 2002, doi:10.14217/9781848597655-4-en.&lt;/ref&gt;. This is the result of a lack of political and financial commitment to the issue as most
safe motherhood programs internationally have to compete for significant funding&lt;ref&gt;Filippi, Véronique, et al. “Maternal Health in Poor Countries: the Broader Context and a Call for Action.” The Lancet, vol. 368, no. 9546, 28 Sept. 2006, pp. 1535–1541., doi:10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69384-7.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some
resolve that if global survival initiatives were promoted and properly funded it would prove to be
mutually beneficial for the international community. Investing in maternal health would
ultimately advance several issues such as: gender inequality, poverty and general global health
standards&lt;ref&gt;Nyamtema, Angelo S, et al. “Maternal Health Interventions in Resource Limited Countries: a Systematic Review of Packages, Impacts and Factors for Change.” BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, vol. 11, no. 1, 2011, doi:10.1186/1471-2393-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;. As it currently stands, pregnant women are subjugated to high financial costs
throughout the duration of their term internationally that are highly taxing and strenuous.

== Contraception ==
[[File:Pilule_contraceptive.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Combined oral contraceptive pill]]]]

Access to reproductive health services is very poor in many countries. Women are often unable to access [[maternal health]] services due to lack of knowledge about the existence of such services or lack of [[freedom of movement]]. Some women are subjected to [[forced pregnancy]] and banned from leaving the home. In many countries, women are not allowed to leave home without a male relative or husband, and therefore their ability to access medical services is limited. Therefore, increasing women's autonomy is needed in order to improve reproductive health, however doing may require a cultural shift. According to the WHO, "All women need access to antenatal care in pregnancy, skilled care during childbirth, and care and support in the weeks after childbirth".

The fact that the law allows certain reproductive health services, it does not necessary ensure that such services are ''de facto'' available to people. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being [[conscientious objector]]s.

In developing regions of the world, there are about 214 million women who want to avoid pregnancy but are unable to use safe and effective [[family planning]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.unfpa.org/family-planning | title=Family planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taken correctly, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. However, it does not protect from [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). Some methods, such as using [[condom]]s, achieve both protection from STIs and unwanted pregnancies. There are also [[natural family planning]] methods, which may be preferred by religious people, but some very conservative religious groups, such as the [[Quiverfull]] movement, oppose these methods too, because they advocate the maximization of procreation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.thenation.com/article/arrows-war/ | title=Arrows for the War| journal=The Nation| date=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/protestant-group-advocates-leaving-fertility-in-gods-hands-no-birth-control | title=Protestant Group Advocates Leaving Fertility in God's Hands - No Birth Control Artificial or Natural}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the oldest ways to reduce unwanted  pregnancy  is [[coitus interruptus]] - still widely used in the developing world.

There are many types of contraceptives. One type of contraceptive includes barrier methods.&lt;ref name = "NICHD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/contraception/conditioninfo/types|title=What are the different types of contraception? | work = National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) | access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One barrier method includes condoms for males and females.&lt;ref name = "NICHD" /&gt; Both types stop sperm from entering the woman’s uterus, thereby preventing pregnancy from occurring.&lt;ref name = "NICHD" /&gt; Another type of contraception is the birth control pill, which stops ovulation from occurring by combining the chemicals progestin and estrogen.&lt;ref name = "NICHD" /&gt; Many women use this method of contraception, however they discontinue using it equally as much as they use it.&lt;ref name = "Stevens_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stevens LM | title = "We have to be mythbusters": Clinician attitudes about the legitimacy of patient concerns and dissatisfaction with contraception | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine (1982) | volume = 212 | issue = | pages = 145–152 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30031980 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.07.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this is because of the side effects that occur from using the pill. Some side effects that result from birth control pill usage include minor side effects such as increased BMI and frequent headaches, and major side effects like dangerous blood pressure levels.&lt;ref name = "Stevens_2018" /&gt; Another reason stems from health care providers not taking women’s concerns about negative side effects seriously.&lt;ref name = "Stevens_2018" /&gt; When women report negative side effects to their physicians, they are told to continue using the pill.&lt;ref name = "Stevens_2018" /&gt; This causes women to dedicate more thought towards which side effects can be accepted rather than how to stop side effects.&lt;ref name = "Stevens_2018" /&gt;

{{Main|Sexually transmitted infection}}

A [[Sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) --previously known as a ''sexually transmitted disease (STD)'' or ''venereal disease (VD)--'' is an infection that has a significant likelihood of transmission between humans by means of [[sexual activity]]. The CDC analyses the eight most common STI's: [[Chlamydia trachomatis|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], [[Hepatitis B virus|hepatitis B viru]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (HBV), [[herpes simplex virus]] type 2 ([[Hsv 2|HSV-2]]), human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV/AIDS|HIV]]), [[Human papillomavirus HPV|human papillomavirus (HPV)]], [[syphilis]], and [[trichomoniasis]].&lt;ref name="CDC_2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/sti-estimates-fact-sheet-Feb-2013.pdf | title= Incidence, Prevalence, and Cost of Sexually Transmitted Infections in the United States | date = February 2013 | work = CDC STI Fact Sheet | publisher = United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more than 600 million cases of STI's worldwide and more than 20 million new cases within the United States.&lt;ref name="CDC_2013" /&gt; Numbers of such high magnitude weigh a heavy burden on the local and global economy. A study&lt;ref name="Shah_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shah M, Risher K, Berry SA, Dowdy DW | title = The Epidemiologic and Economic Impact of Improving HIV Testing, Linkage, and Retention in Care in the United States | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 220–229 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26362321 | pmc = 4690480 | doi = 10.1093/cid/civ801 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted at Oxford University in 2015 concluded that despite giving participants early antiviral medications [[Antiretroviral therapy|(ART)]], they still cost an estimated $256 billion over 2 decades. HIV testing done at modest rates could reduce HIV infections by 21%, HIV retention by 54% and HIV mortality rates by 64%, with a cost-effectiveness ration of $45,300 per [[Quality-adjusted life year]]. However, the study concluded that the United States has led to an excess in infections, treatment costs, and deaths, even when interventions do not improve over all survival rates.&lt;ref name="Shah_2016" /&gt;

There is a profound reduction on STI rates once those who are sexually active are educated about transmissions, condom promotion, interventions targeted at key and vulnerable populations through a comprehensive [[Sex education]] courses or programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sexually-transmitted-infections-(stis)|title=Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)|website=World Health Organization |access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa’s policy addresses the needs of women at risk for HIV and who are HIV positive as well as their partners and children.

They found a profound difference that those women who had graduated from college were far less likely to have STIs, potentially be benefiting from a reduction in vulnerability to acquiring STIs/HIV as they gain in education status and potentially move up in demographic areas and/or status.&lt;ref name="Painter_2012" /&gt;

Globally, an estimated 25 million [[unsafe abortion]]s occur each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-09-2017-worldwide-an-estimated-25-million-unsafe-abortions-occur-each-year | title=Worldwide, an estimated 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of such unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-09-2017-worldwide-an-estimated-25-million-unsafe-abortions-occur-each-year | title=Worldwide, an estimated 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both terms are considered [[loaded word|loaded]] in mainstream media, where terms such as “abortion rights” or “anti-abortion” are generally preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  Paul | last = Martin | name-list-format = vanc | title = Hyperbole | work = Style and Substance | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/styleandsubstance/2010/01/31/vol-23-no-1/ |publisher=Wall Street Journal |access-date=4 November 2011 |date=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position, with small numbers of anti-abortion advocates using [[anti-abortion violence|violence]], such as murder and arson.

Articles from the World Health Organization call legal [[abortion]] a [[Fundamental rights|fundamental right]] of women regardless of where they live, and argue that [[unsafe abortion]] is a silent [[pandemic]]. In 2005, it was estimated that 19-20 million abortions had complications, some complications are permanent, while another estimated 68,000 women died from unsafe abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html |title=WHO: Unsafe Abortion&amp;nbsp;— The Preventable Pandemic |access-date=2010-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113104553/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html |archive-date=2010-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having access to safe abortion can have positive impacts on women's health and life, and vice versa.

The [[Maputo Protocol]], which was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], states at  Article 14 (Health and Reproductive Rights) that: "(2). States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to: [...] c) protect the reproductive rights of women by authorising medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/#14 | title=Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa | work = Legal Instruments | publisher = African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maputo Protocol is the first international treaty to recognize abortion, under certain conditions, as a woman's human right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.achpr.org/instruments/general-comment-two-rights-women/ | title=General Comment No. 2 on Article 14.1 (a), (b), (c) and (f) and Article 14. 2 (a) and (c) of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa | work = Legal Instruments | publisher = African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  ''General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], on the right to life'', adopted by the [[Human Rights Committee]] in 2018, defines, for the first time ever, a human right to abortion - in certain circumstances (however these UN general comments are considered [[soft law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Keller H, Grover L | chapter = General Comments of the Human Rights Committee and their legitimacy. | veditors = Keller H, Ulfstein G | title = UN Human Rights Treaty Bodies: Law and Legitimacy. | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 2012 | pages = 116–98 | series = Studies on Human Rights Conventions | isbn = 9781139047593 | doi = 10.1017/CBO9781139047593.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as such, not legally binding).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although   States   parties   may  adopt measures designed to regulate voluntary terminations of pregnancy, such measures must not result in violation of the right to life of a pregnant woman or girl, or her other rights under the Covenant. Thus, restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion must not, inter alia, jeopardize their lives, subject them  to  physical  or  mental  pain  or  suffering  which violates  article  7,  discriminate  against them  or  arbitrarily  interfere  with  their  privacy.  ''States  parties  must  provide  safe,  legal  and effective  access  to  abortion where  the  life  and  health  of  the  pregnant  woman  or girl  is  at risk,  and  where  carrying a pregnancy to term  would cause  the  pregnant  woman  or  girl substantial  pain  or  suffering,  most  notably  where  the  pregnancy  is  the  result  of  rape  or incest or is not viable.'' [8] In addition, States parties may not regulate pregnancy or abortion in all other cases in a manner that runs contrary to their duty to ensure that women and girls do  not  have  to  undertake  unsafe  abortions,  and  they should  revise  their  abortion  laws accordingly.  [9]  For  example,  they  should  not  take measures  such  as  criminalizing pregnancies  by  unmarried  women  or  apply  criminal  sanctions  against  women  and  girls undergoing  abortion  [10]  or  against  medical  service providers  assisting  them  in  doing  so, since  taking  such  measures  compel  women  and  girls  to  resort  to  unsafe  abortion.  States parties should not introduce new barriers and should remove existing barriers [11] that deny effective  access  by  women  and  girls  to  safe  and  legal  abortion  [12],  including  barriers caused  as  a  result  of  the  exercise  of  conscientious objection  by  individual  medical providers.

When negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states that: "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of  safe  abortion  and  post abortion  care,  forced  continuation  of pregnancy,  abuse  and mistreatment  of  women  and  girls  seeking  sexual  and  reproductive  health  information, goods and services, are forms of [[violence against women|gender based violence]] that, depending on   the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web | title = General recommendation No. 35 on gender-based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19 | url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf | date = 30 October 2018 | work = Human Rights Committee | publisher = United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same ''General Recommendation'' also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:

In 2008, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], a group comprising members from 47 European countries, has adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2008/04/council-europe-urges-member-states-decriminalize-abortion | title=Council of Europe Urges Member States to Decriminalize Abortion| date=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accesses to abortion is not only a question of legality, but also an issue of overcoming de ''facto barriers'', such as [[conscientious objection]]s from medical stuff, high prices, lack of knowledge about the law, lack of access to medical care (especially in [[rural areas]]). The ''de facto'' inability of women to access abortion even in countries where it is legal is highly controversial because it results in a situation where women have rights only on paper not in practice; the UN in its 2017 resolution on ''Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence'' urged states to guarantee access to "safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/170 | title=United Nations Official Document}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two primary arguments for maintaining legalized abortion today in the U.S. The first is recognizing the full citizenship of women.&lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rose |first1=Melody |title=Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?: Abortion Politics in the United States |date=2007 |publisher=CQ Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reproductive Politics"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solinger |first1=Rickie |title=Reproductive Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roe v. Wade court case on abortion compared the citizenship of women and fetuses &lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt; Because the Constitution defines born people as citizens, Justice Harry Blackmun ruled that fetuses were not citizens.&lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt; The citizenship of women is emphasized because fetuses are not individual entities that can exist without the woman.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Politics" /&gt; Another reason why the full citizenship of women is defined by advocates for abortion is that it recognizes the right of women to manage their own bodies.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Politics" /&gt; Fertility affects women’s bodies. The argument for abortion prevents others from making decisions that alter a woman’s body.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Politics"/&gt; Pro-choice advocates also attempt to confirm that state-mandated education or other outside biases don’t attempt to influence these decisions.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Politics" /&gt; Feminists argue that women throughout history have had to justify their citizenship politically and socially.&lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt; The right to manage one’s own body is a matter of health, safety, and respect.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Politics" /&gt; The citizenship of women and the right to manage their own bodies is a societal confirmation that feminists highlight as a pro-choice justification.&lt;ref name="Reproductive Politics" /&gt; 

The second primary argument to uphold legalized abortion and creating better access to it is the necessity of abortion and the health and safety of pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McBride |first1=Dorothy |last2=Keys |first2=Jennifer  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Abortion in the United States: a Reference Handbook |date=2018 |publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Krannich_1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krannich |first1=Richard |title=Abortion in the United States: Past, Present, and Future Trends |journal=Family Relations |date=1980 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=365-374 |jstor=583858}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two events that largely changed the course of public opinion about abortion in the U.S. &lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reproductive Politics"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solinger |first1=Rickie |title=Reproductive Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first is Sherry Finkbine, who was denied access to an abortion by the board of obstetrician-gynecologists at her local hospital.&lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt; Although she was privileged enough to afford the trip, Finkbine was forced to travel to Sweden for an abortion to avoid caring for a damaged fetus in addition to four children &lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rose |first1=Melody |title=Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?: Abortion Politics in the United States |date=2007 |publisher=CQ Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The other event that changed public opinion was the outbreak of rubella in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reproductive Politics"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solinger |first1=Rickie |title=Reproductive Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Because rubella disrupted the growth of fetuses and caused deformities during pregnancy, the California Therapeutic Abortion Act was signed in 1967.&lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt; This Act allowed doctors to perform abortions when the pregnancy risked the physical or mental health of the pregnant person.&lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt; These two events are commonly used to show how the health and safety of pregnant women are contingent upon abortions as well as the ability to give birth to and adequately take care of a child. Another argument in favor of legalized abortion to service necessity are the reasons why an abortion might be necessary. Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and over half of all unintended pregnancies in the United States are met with abortion.&lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt; Unintended pregnancy can lead to serious harm to women and children for reasons such as not being able to afford to raise a baby, inaccessibility to time off of work, difficulties facing single motherhood, difficult socio-economic conditions for women.&lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt; Unintended pregnancies also have a greater potential for putting women of color at risk due to systematically produced environmental hazards from proximity to pollution, access to livable income, and affordable healthy food &lt;ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voyles |first1=Traci |title=Wastelanding: Legacies of uranium Mining in Navajo Country |date=2015 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These factors as threats to the health and safety of pregnant women run parallel to data that shows the number of [[abortion in the United States|abortions in the United States]] did not decline while laws restricting legal access to abortion were implemented.&lt;ref name = "Krannich_1980" /&gt;

At a global level, the region with the strictest abortion laws is considered to be [[Latin America]] (see [[Reproductive rights in Latin America]]), a region strongly influenced by the [[Catholic Church in Latin America]].

Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital circumcision or cutting, is the traditional, non-medical practice of altering or injuring the female reproductive organs, often by removing all or parts of the  external genitalia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is mostly practiced in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, and affects over 200 million women and girls worldwide. More severe forms of FGM are highly concentrated in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/|title=WHO &amp;#124; Female genital mutilation (FGM)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO categorizes FGM into four types:

* '''Type I''' ([[Clitoridectomy|Cliteridectomy]]) is the removal of all or part of the [[clitoris]]. This may or may not include removing the prepuce along with the clitoral glans.
* '''Type II''' (Excision) is the removal of the clitoris along with all or part of the [[labia minora]]. This may or may not include removing all or part of the [[labia majora]].
* '''Type III''' (Infibulation) is the act of removing the inner or outer labia and sealing the wound, leaving only a narrow opening.
* '''Type IV''' refers to "all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes (piercing, scraping, cauterizing of the genital area)."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

FGM often takes the form of a traditional celebration conducted by an elder or community leader. The age that women undergo the procedure varies depending on the culture, although it is most commonly performed on prepubescent girls. Certain cultures value FGM as coming of age ritual for girls, and use it to preserve a woman's virginity and faithfulness to the husband after marriage. It is also closely connected with some traditional ideals of female beauty and hygiene.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klein E, Helzner E, Shayowitz M, Kohlhoff S, Smith-Norowitz TA | title = Female Genital Mutilation: Health Consequences and Complications-A Short Literature Review | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology International | volume = 2018 | pages = 7365715 | date = 2018-07-10 | pmid = 30116269 | pmc = 6079349 | doi = 10.1155/2018/7365715 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FGM may or may not have religious connotations depending on the circumstances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are no health benefits of FGM, as it interferes with the natural functions of a woman's and girls' bodies, such as causing severe pain, shock, hemorrhage, tetanus or sepsis (bacterial infection), urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue, recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections, cysts, increased risk of infertility, childbirth complications and newborn deaths. Sexual problems are 1.5 more likely to occur in women who have undergone FGM, they may experience painful intercourse, have less sexual satisfaction, and be two times more likely to report lack of sexual desire. In addition, the maternal and fetal death rate is significantly higher due to childbirth complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Caroline | name-list-format = vanc | title = The psychological impact of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) on girls/women's mental health: a narrative literature review | journal = Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology | date = 19 September 2014 | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 469–485 | doi = 10.1080/02646838.2014.949641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FGM can have severe negative psychological effects on women, both during and after the procedure. These can include long-term symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and low self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women report that the procedure was carried out without their consent and knowledge, and describe feelings of fear and helplessness while it was taking place. A 2018 study found that larger quantities of the hormone [[cortisol]] were secreted in women who had undergone FGM, especially those who had experienced more severe forms of the procedure and at an early age. This marks the body's chemical response to trauma and stress, and can indicate a greater risk for developing symptoms of PTSD and other trauma disorders, although there are limited studies showing a direct correlation.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Köbach A, Ruf-Leuschner M, Elbert T | title = Psychopathological sequelae of female genital mutilation and their neuroendocrinological associations | language = En | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 187 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29895282 | pmc = 5998450 | doi = 10.1186/s12888-018-1757-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation has been introduced in certain countries to prevent FGM. A 2016 survey of 30 countries showed 24 had policies to manage and prevent FGM, although the process to provide funding, education, and resources were often inconsistent and lacking. Some countries have seen a slight decline in FGM rates, while others show little to no change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansen RE, Ziyada MM, Shell-Duncan B, Kaplan AM, Leye E | title = Health sector involvement in the management of female genital mutilation/cutting in 30 countries | language = En | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 240 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29615033 | pmc = 5883890 | doi = 10.1186/s12913-018-3033-x | url = https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3033-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits FGM (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/168046031c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child and forced marriage==
{{Main|Child marriage|Forced marriage}}
[[File:Girl_Summit_-_22nd_July_in_London_(14498368279).jpg|thumb|250px|Poster against child and forced marriage]]
The practice of forcing young girls into early marriage, common in many parts of the world, is threatening their reproductive health. According to the World Health Organization:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/news/news/2012/12/child-marriage-a-threat-to-health | title=Child marriage – a threat to health| date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sexual and reproductive health of the female in a child marriage is likely to be jeopardized, as these young girls are often forced into sexual intercourse with an older male spouse with more sexual experience. The female spouse often lacks the status and the knowledge to negotiate for safe sex and contraceptive practices, increasing the risk of acquiring HIV or other sexually transmitted infections, as well as the probability of pregnancy at an early age." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Niger]] has the highest prevalence of child marriage under 18 in the world, while [[Bangladesh]]  has the highest rate of marriage of girls under age 15.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicef.org/media/files/Child_Marriage_Report_7_17_LR..pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Practices such as [[bride price]] and [[dowry]] can contribute to child and forced marriages.

== International Conference on Population and Development, 1994 ==
The [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) was held in [[Cairo]], Egypt, from 5 to 13 September 1994. Delegations from 179 States took part in negotiations to finalize a Programme of Action on population and development for the next 20 years. Some 20,000 delegates from various governments, [[UN]] agencies, [[NGOs]], and the [[Mass media|media]] gathered for a discussion of a variety of population issues, including [[immigration]], [[infant mortality]], [[birth control]], [[family planning]], and the education of women.

In the ICPD Program of Action,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/populatin/icpd.htm#intro ICPD Program of Action]&lt;/ref&gt; 'reproductive health' is defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and...not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed [about] and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods of birth control which are not against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.&lt;ref&gt;ICPD Programme of Action, paragraph 7.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition of the term is also echoed in the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/health.htm United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women]&lt;/ref&gt; or the so-called Beijing Declaration of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations
Fourth World Conference on Women&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ICPD Program of Action, even though it received the support of a large majority of UN Member States, does not enjoy the status of an international legal instrument; it is therefore not legally binding.

The Program of Action endorses a new strategy which emphasizes the numerous linkages between population and development and focuses on meeting the needs of individual women and men rather than on achieving [[demographic targets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/populatin/icpd.htm#intro |author=ICPD| title=ICPD Program of Action | access-date=2009-02-04| authorlink=International Conference on Population and Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Conference on Population and Development|ICPD]]  achieved consensus on four qualitative and quantitative goals for the international community, the final two of which have particular relevance for reproductive health:

* '''Reduction of maternal mortality''': A reduction of [[maternal mortality]] rates and a narrowing of disparities in maternal mortality within countries and between geographical regions, socio-economic and ethnic groups.
* '''Access to reproductive and sexual health services including family planning''': [[Family planning]] counseling, pre-natal care, safe delivery and post-natal care, prevention and appropriate treatment of [[infertility]], prevention of [[abortion]] and the management of the consequences of abortion, treatment of reproductive tract infections, [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and other reproductive health conditions; and education, counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Services regarding [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[breast cancer]], infertility, delivery, [[hormone therapy]], [[sex reassignment therapy]], and abortion should be made available. Active discouragement of [[female genital cutting|female genital mutilation (FGM)]].

The keys to this new approach are empowering women, providing them with more choices through expanded access to education and health services, and promoting skill development and employment. The programme advocates making family planning universally available by 2015 or sooner, as part of a broadened approach to reproductive health and rights, provides estimates of the levels of national resources and international assistance that will be required, and calls on governments to make these resources available.

== Sustainable Development Goals ==
Half of the development goals put on by the United Nations started in 2000 to 2015 with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). Reproductive health was Goal 5 out of 8. To monitor the progress, the UN agreed to four indicators:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/The%20Millennium%20Development%20Goals%20Report%202008.pdf|title=2008 MDG Progress Report|author=UN|pages=28–29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203222613/http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/The%20Millennium%20Development%20Goals%20Report%202008.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-03|deadurl=yes|access-date=2009-02-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Contraceptive prevalence rates
*Adolescent birth rate
*Antenatal care coverage
*Unmet need for family planning

Progress was slow, and according to the [[WHO]] in 2005, about 55% of women did not have sufficient antenatal care and 24% had no access to family planning services.&lt;ref name="progressMDG52"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/making_pregnancy_safer/topics/mdg/en/index.html|title=What progress has been made on MDG 5?|author=WHO|access-date=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MDGs expired in 2015 and were replaced with a more comprehensive set of goals to cover a span of 2016-2030 with a total of 17 goals, called the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. All 17 goals are comprehensive in nature and build off one another, but goal 3 is "To ensure health lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages". Specific goals are to reduce global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births, end preventable deaths of newborns and children, reduce the number by 50% of accidental deaths globally, strengthen the treatment and prevention programs of substance abuse and alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/sustainable-development-goals/targets/en/|title=Sustainable Development Goal 3: Health|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By region==
===Africa===
{{See|HIV/AIDS in Africa}}
[[File:Kenya2006- worldaidsday- contesto- COSV (3).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[World AIDS Day]] 2006 event in [[Kenya]].]]
HIV/AIDS in Africa is a major public health problem. Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected world region for prevalence of HIV, especially among young women. 90% of the children in the world living with HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HIV/AIDS | url = http://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids | publisher = World Health Organization Africa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most African countries, the total fertility rate is very high,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html | chapter = Country Comparison: Total Fertility Rate | title = The World Factbook | publisher = United States Central Intelligence Agency | year = 2017 | title-link = The World Factbook }}&lt;/ref&gt; often due to lack of access to contraception and family planning, and practices such as forced and child marriage. Niger, Angola, Mali, Burundi	and Somalia have very high fertility rates.

The updated contraceptive guidelines in [[South Africa]] attempt to improve access by providing special service delivery and access considerations for sex workers, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals, migrants, men, adolescents, women who are perimenopausal, have a disability, or chronic condition. They also aim to increase access to long acting contraceptive methods, particularly the copper IUD, and the introductions of single rod progestogen implant and combined oestrogen and progestogen injectables. The copper IUD has been provided significantly less frequently than other contraceptive methods but signs of an increase in most provinces were reported. The most frequently provided method was injectable progesterone, which the article acknowledged was not ideal and emphasised condom use with this method because it can can increase the risk of HIV: The product made up 49% of South Africa’s contraceptive use and up to 90% in some provinces.&lt;ref name="RSA_2014" /&gt;

[[Tanzania]]n provider perspectives address the obstacles to consistent contraceptive use in their communities. It was found that the capability of dispensaries to service patients was determined by inconsistent reproductive goals, low educational attainment, misconceptions about the side effects of contraceptives, and social factors such as gender dynamics, spousal dynamics, economic conditions, religious norms, cultural norms, and constraints in supply chains. A provider referenced and example of propaganda spread about the side effects of contraception: "There are influential people, for example elders and religious leaders. They normally convince people that condoms contain some microorganisms and contraceptive pills cause cancer". Another said that women often had pressure from their spouse or family that caused them to use birth control secretly or to discontinue use, and that women frequently preferred undetectable methods for this reason.  Access was also hindered as a result of a lack in properly trained medical personnel: "Shortage of the medical attendant...is a challenge, we are not able to attend to a big number of clients, also we do not have enough education which makes us unable to provide women with the methods they want". The majority of medical centers were staffed by people without medical training and few doctors and nurses, despite federal regulations, due to lack of resources. One center had only one person who was able to insert and remove implants, and without her they were unable to service people who wanted an implant inserted or removed. Another dispensary that carried two methods of birth control shared that they sometimes run out of both materials at the same time. Constraints in supply chains sometimes cause dispensaries to run out of contraceptive materials. Providers also claimed that more male involvement and education would be helpful.&lt;ref name="pmid27337850"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baraka J, Rusibamayila A, Kalolella A, Baynes C | title = Challenges Addressing Unmet Need for Contraception: Voices of Family Planning Service Providers in Rural Tanzania | journal = African Journal of Reproductive Health | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 23–30 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 27337850 | doi =  | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7e2f/02d167efbda5c739175dc076ee82d56692a3.pdf | jstor = 24877606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to family planning, by tracking specific, standardized family planning and reproductive health indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.measureevaluation.org/prh/rh_indicators|title=Family Planning and Reproductive Health Indicators Database — MEASURE Evaluation|website=www.measureevaluation.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34160">In the United States, [[prison]]s are obligated to provide [[health care]] to [[prisoner]]s. Such health care is sometimes called ''[[correctional medicine]]''. In women's prisons, correctional medicine includes attention to [[reproductive health]].

The number of [[Incarceration of women in the United States|women incarcerated in the United States]] has increased greatly over the last few decades,{{specify|date=June 2016}} and at a faster rate than the number of incarcerated men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Many of the same factors that increase women's likelihood of incarceration also put them at a higher risk for contracting [[HIV/AIDS]] and other [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and for having [[High-risk pregnancy|high-risk pregnancies]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithewaite|first=Ronald L.|last2=Treadwell|first2=Henrie M.|last3=Arriola|first3=Kimberly R J|date=2005|title=Health disparities and incarcerated women: a population ignored|pmc=1449417|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=95|issue=10|pages=1679–1681|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.065375|pmid=16186446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The majority of incarcerated women are economically disadvantaged and poorly educated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeve|first=M Katherine|date=1999|title=Adjudicated Health: Incarcerated Women and the Social Constructions of Health|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1008376229520|journal=Crime, Law and Social Change|volume=31|pages=49|doi=10.1023/A:1008376229520|pmid=|access-date=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have not had adequate access to [[preventive healthcare]] prior to their imprisonment,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; such as [[Pap test]]s, [[STI test|STI screening]], and pregnancy counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Jennifer G.|last2=Hebert|first2=Megan R.|last3=Rosengard|first3=Cynthia|last4=Rose|first4=Jennifer S.|last5=DaSilva|first5=Kristen M.|last6=Stein|first6=Michael D.|date=2006|title=Reproductive Health Care and Family Flanning Feeds Among Incarcerated Women|pmc=1470599|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=96|issue=5|pages=834–839|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.060236|pmid=16571701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal standards for health care availability ==
=== Historical precedence ===

==== Estelle v. Gamble (1976) ====
[[Estelle v. Gamble]] obligates prisons to provide for the serious medical needs of their inmates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YdHAAAAMAAJ|title=The Incarcerated Woman: Rehabilitative Programming in Women's Prisons|last=Anderson|first=Tammy L.|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780130940674|editor-last=Sharp|editor-first=Susan F.|pages=49–60|language=en|chapter=Issues in the availability of health care for women prisoners|editor-last2=Muraskin|editor-first2=Roslyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it also requires that an incarcerated person must demonstrate that they had a serious medical need, and that they didn't receive adequate medical care because officials showed "deliberate indifference."  Due to the difficulty inherent in proving that a prison official knew about a medical condition, yet failed to respond to it, this standard makes it difficult to hold correctional facilities accountable for their mistakes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ekaWZJHfqMC|title=Our Bodies, Our Crimes: The Policing of Women’s Reproduction in America|last=Flavin|first=Jeanne|date=2008|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814727553|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Todaro v. Ward (1977) ====
Todaro v. Ward argued that women within a New York prison did not have adequate, constitutional access to healthcare.  Since Todaro v. Ward was the first major court case that called into question incarcerated women's actual access to health care, it spurred organizations such as the American Medical Association, American Correctional Association, and the American Public Health Association to start creating standards for health care within prisons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Brown v. Beck (1980) ====
With this ruling, the court determined that the medical care provided to prisoners must only be "reasonable,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; not necessarily "perfect, the best obtainable, or even very good."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Relevant federal legislation and standards ===
Currently, no national agency monitors the treatment of prisoners, although a few governmental and non-governmental agencies do provide monitoring standards that facilities may use if they wish to become accredited (about thirty percent of prisons are accredited), and some federal legislation has been passed regarding correctional health care.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Federal Prisoner Co-Payment Act (1999) ====
This legislation required that incarcerated individuals pay for some of their health care bill while in prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Prison Litigation Reform Act (1996) ====
The [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] made it much more difficult for prisoners to file class action and individual lawsuits against a prison.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=Ellen M|date=2001|title=Bad Medicine: Health Care Inadequacies in Women's Prisons|url=http://uu5bm5kq6z.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Bad+medicine%3A+Health+care+inadequacies+in+women%27s+prisons&amp;rft.jtitle=Criminal+Justice&amp;rft.au=Ellen+M+Barry&amp;rft.date=2001-04-01&amp;rft.pub=American+Bar+Association&amp;rft.issn=0887-7785&amp;rft.volume=16&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.spage=38&amp;rft.externalDocID=73033132&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=Criminal Justice|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PRLA) requires that prisoners exhaust a facility's own administrative resources and solutions before attempting to file a lawsuit.  This can be detrimental because prisoners' health problems are often time-sensitive.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth|first=Rachel|date=2004|title=Searching for the State: Who Governs Prisoners' Reproductive Rights?|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/173809|journal=Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State and Society|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PRLA also includes a cap on attorney fees, which has made fewer attorneys willing to represent prisoners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although PRLA applies to all lawsuits filed by incarcerated people, it is particularly relevant for women's health because most lawsuits filed by incarcerated women concern substandard health care.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Correctional reproductive health care ==

=== Pregnancy and prenatal care ===
As of 2005, about five to ten percent of incarcerated women were pregnant (most upon intake), and about 2,000 incarcerated women give birth every year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Incarcerated women already tend to have more high-risk pregnancies, due to possible complications by drug and alcohol abuse and STIs, histories of victimization and abuse, and poor support networks, so they are particularly in need of quality [[prenatal care]] as compared to non-incarcerated women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acoca|first=Leslie|date=January 1998|title=Defusing the Time Bomb: Understanding and Meeting the Growing Health Care Needs of Incarcerated Women in America|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&amp;u=mnalmgl&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A20517103&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=mnalmgl&amp;authCount=1|journal=Crime and Delinquency|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found mixed results when it comes to the effects of incarceration on pregnancy outcomes. Some studies have found that incarceration correlates to lower [[birth weight]], and an increased chance of [[Complications of pregnancy|complications in the pregnancy]]; others have found the opposite: that incarceration is associated with higher birth weight and a decreased likelihood of [[Preterm birth|premature delivery]]. However, the latter finding may simply speak to the low level of medical care available to women in poverty in the free world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 1996 study conducted by the [[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]] (NCCD) on women in California, Connecticut, and Florida state prisons found a lack of adequate prenatal and postnatal medical care, [[prenatal nutrition]], level of [[methadone maintenance]] for opiate-dependent pregnant inmates, education regarding childbirth and parenting, and preparation for the mother's separation from her child.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Often, inmates report receiving no regular pelvic exams or sonograms, and little to no information about proper prenatal care and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Prison diets often lack proper nutrition, particularly for the changing and special dietary needs of pregnant women, and many women prisoners report not being allowed to alter their diets during their pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite the lack or low quality of prenatal care in most institutions, many correctional facilities have made strides to provide adequate care.  For example, Washington State has a program called the Birth Attendants Prison Doula project, which provides support to incarcerated pregnant and [[Postpartum period|postpartum]] women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When asked about her prison's response to pregnancy, Boo, an inmate in an Arizona correctional facility, said:

{{quote|text=They're real good people to me... I get taken care of in here very well. They give us three pregnancy bags a day which contain two cartons of milk, two orange juices, and two fruits, and you get three pills three times a day during breakfast, lunch, and dinner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

In general, pregnant inmates are transported to outside medical facilities to give birth, because most correctional facilities are not medically equipped to provide such services.  These transports often result in complications due to the risk of injury to both the mother and the child, and due to the additional stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The practice of [[shackling]] inmates, both in transit to the hospital and during [[Childbirth|labor]], is also common at many facilities.  Forty-one states permit the use of restraints during transport to the hospital, and twenty-three states and the federal government permit the use of restraints during labor.  These restraints may include [[Belly chain (restraint)|belly chains]], shackles, handcuffs, or nylon "soft restraints."  The use of restraints on women so far into their pregnancy and during labor poses many health risks.  Restraints inhibit the movement of a woman, something that aids the progression of the labor and alleviates some of her discomfort.  They may also hinder the ability of health care professionals to respond quickly to emergencies during the labor.  Organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] have pressured correctional facilities to stop the use of shackles on pregnant women, pointing out the fact that most pregnant women are incarcerated for nonviolent offenses and pose no risk (especially during childbirth), so the restraints are unnecessary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Maria Jones, a pregnant inmate, described her experience being shackled during labor:

{{quote|text=Because I was shackled to the bed, they couldn't remove the lower part of the bed for the delivery, and they couldn't put my feet in the stirrups. My feet were still shackled together, and I couldn't get my legs apart. The doctor called for the [[Prison officer|officer]], but the officer had gone down the hall. No one else could unlock the shackles, and my baby was coming but I couldn't open my legs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

=== HIV/AIDS ===
Incarcerated women are 15 times more likely to be infected with [[HIV]] than are women who are free,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and are also more than twice as likely than incarcerated men to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weatherhead|first=Kendra|date=2003|title=Cruel but not Unusual Punishment: The Failure to Provide Adequate Medical Treatment to Female Prisoners in the United States|url=http://uu5bm5kq6z.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Cruel+but+not+Unusual+Punishment%3A+The+Failure+to+Provide+Adequate+Medical+Treatment+to+Female+Prisoners+in+the+United+States&amp;rft.jtitle=Health+Matrix%3A+Journal+of+Law-Medicine&amp;rft.au=Kendra+Weatherhead&amp;rft.date=2003-07-01&amp;rft.pub=Case+Western+Reserve+University+Health+Matrix%3A+Journal+of+Law-Medicine&amp;rft.volume=13&amp;rft.spage=429&amp;rft.epage=429&amp;rft.externalDocID=13_Health_Matrix_429_srctype_smi_srcid_3B15_key_8f97eab4a9b73e1350b316e5e67dcf23|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandler|first=Cynthia|date=2003|title=Death and Dying in America: The Prison Industrial Complex's Impact on Women's Health|url=http://uu5bm5kq6z.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Death+and+Dying+in+America%3A+The+Prison+Industrial+Complex%27s+Impact+on+Women%27s+Health&amp;rft.jtitle=Berkeley+Women%27s+Law+Journal&amp;rft.au=Cynthia+Chandler&amp;rft.date=2003-01-01&amp;rft.pub=The+Regents+of+the+University+of+California+on+behalf+of&amp;rft.volume=18&amp;rft.spage=40&amp;rft.epage=304&amp;rft.externalDocID=18_Berkeley_Women_s_L_J_40_srctype_smi_srcid_3B15_key_8549afa72665cf5fdaf04f403446adfb&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=Berkeley Women's Law Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in New York, a state which does [[blind testing]], 14.6% of incarcerated women and 7.3% of incarcerated men tested positive for HIV.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Health Behind Bars: From Prisons to Communities|last=Balis|first=Andrea F.|publisher=Springer New York|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Greifinger|editor-first=Robert B.|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=320–332|chapter=Female Prisoners and the Case for Gender-Specific Reentry Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1996 NCCD study found that female African American and Hispanic/Latina inmates were significantly more likely than their White counterparts to report testing positive for HIV.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many of the same social factors that increase the likelihood of incarceration for women, such as poverty, race, gender, and a history of victimization, are also correlated to HIV infection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2000 study by the [[American Correctional Association]] found that mandatory HIV testing is conducted upon intake in 23 states, and that a few also provide 6-month follow-up testing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Most prisons test inmates who either ask to be tested, or display symptoms of HIV (this is the policy in 44 out of 51 jurisdictions), and fifteen states also specifically test inmates that are in high-risk groups.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Three states, the District of Columbia, and the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] test inmates upon release.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The same American Correctional Association study also found that most prisons provide HIV-positive individuals with medications while they are in the prison, may provide them with a small supply after they are released, and may also direct them towards community resources where they can receive more medication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Treatment of inmates who have tested positive for HIV varies greatly from state to state.  For example, in New Jersey, female HIV positive prisoners were shackled to their beds for up to six months after being diagnosed.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  However, Ohio and New York, among other states, have infirmaries specifically adapted to attend to the needs of inmates with HIV/AIDS, and allow some inmates to reside in a hospital for treatment.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In addition to this, New York State's Division of Health Services department does regular evaluations of the state prisons' services for AIDS patients, and also provides space for support groups to meet, and patients to be counseled on their illness.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Women's symptoms and treatment needs for HIV infection are quite different from those of men, but the treatment resources for incarcerated women are often limited.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The treatment of HIV requires a specialist, and generally, prison doctors don't have adequate training to treat women effectively.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Or, prisons often do not have adequate facilities, staff, or a follow-up treatment system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  For example, the 1996 NCCD study also found that within the entire California women's prison system, one of the largest in the nation, there was only one full-time specialist able to provide "gender-specific treatment" to women with HIV.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Male prisoners, however, did have access to gender-specific HIV treatment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Abortion ===
Federal courts have established, according to constitutional law, that prisoners retain the right to have an abortion once they are incarcerated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  However, state standards regarding abortion for incarcerated women are unclear - actions are often left up to the discretion of prison officials on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Most state abortion policies are written and approved without going through the administrative process which other policies are generally subject to; thus, they are frequently incomplete.  In fact, fourteen state [[Department of Corrections|DOCs]] have no official written abortion policies, and others simply will not release or publish their policies.  Alaska has a provision which bans abortion funding in its policy on general medical services, but no specific policy guidelines on abortion.  Other states may not define the exact type of abortions they pay for.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Most states require that women pay for all of the costs of an abortion procedure, including transportation to the clinic (which is often far due to prisons' rural locations, and the urban locations of most abortion clinics), security, and the actual surgery. Minnesota and Wisconsin are the only two states which explicitly mention in their policies that they pay for abortions if a woman has been raped.  The policy of the Federal Bureau of Prisons since 1987 has been to pay for abortion only in the cases of rape or life endangerment (although they do pay for transportation to the clinic).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women's experiences and perceptions of their own access to abortion reflect these policies. In a nationwide survey of correctional health care and inmates' access to abortion, 68% of respondents said that women within their prison were allowed to have an abortion if they requested one.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sufrin|first=Carolyn B.|date=2009|title=Incarcerated Women and Abortion Provision: A Survey of Correctional Health Providers|jstor=20462705|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|doi=10.1363/4100609|pmid=|volume=41|pages=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many respondents also stated that although their prison did allow access to abortion, women receive little to no help with arranging an appointment, paying for the procedure, and getting themselves to the clinic.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Other reproductive health care ===

==== Cancer and general gynecological care ====
According to the U.S. Department of Justice [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], [[cancer]] is one of the leading causes of death for women (both inside and outside prison), and one-quarter of deaths of incarcerated women due to cancer are from [[Breast cancer|breast]], [[Cervical cancer|cervical]], [[Ovarian cancer|ovarian]], and [[uterine cancer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In particular, women in prison are at a high risk for contracting cervical cancer due to their high rates of substance abuse and diseases such as [[hepatitis C]], HIV, and other STIs.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magee|first=Catherine G.|last2=Hult|first2=Jen R.|last3=Turalba|first3=Ruby|last4=McMillan|first4=Shelby|date=2005|title=Preventive Care for Women in Prison: A Qualitative Community Health Assessment of the Papanicolaou Test and Follow-Up Treatment at a California State Women's Prison|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/215091831?pq-origsite=summon|journal=American Journal of Public Health|doi=10.2105/ajph.2005.063677|pmid=|access-date=May 31, 2016|pmc=1449425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; However, reproductive health care reform in prisons generally focuses on pregnancy or HIV.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Incarcerated women have higher rates of STIs and gynecologic infections than non-incarcerated women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In fact, one study estimated that about 9% of incarcerated women tested positive for [[gonococcus]] infection, and between 11 and 17% of incarcerated women are infected with [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  However, not every infected woman will be diagnosed and given treatment, because many prisons only test women who request to be tested, or show symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

States often have their own legislation regarding correctional health care, but it doesn't always completely take into consideration the complexities of women's reproductive health.  For example, the [[New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision]] (DOCCS) has issued two main documents which outline their institutional health care policies: the Health Services Policy Manual, and the Women's Health Primary Care Practice Guideline (first published in 2000, and updated in 2008 and 2011).  Within these documents, the Patient Bill of Rights includes the right of a patient to respectful care, the right to refuse treatment, and the right to complete information regarding a diagnosis; the Professional Code of Ethics outlines the standards that staff must follow, including having a respect for [[human dignity]], and a [[Doctor–patient relationship|professional relationship with the patient]].  The DOCCS does not monitor how well facilities actually adhere to these standards, and there are no consequences for those who do not.  Also, many women are not informed of their patient's rights, so are unaware when standards have been breached.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraft-Stolar|first=Tamar|date=2015|title=Reproductive Injustice: The State of Reproductive Health Care for Women in New York State Prisons|url=http://www.correctionalassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reproductive-Injustice-FULL-REPORT-FINAL-2-11-15.pdf|journal=Women in Prison Project of the Correctional Association of New York|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOCCS has no written policies on [[pregnancy test]]s, [[pregnancy options counseling]], [[abortion]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[miscarriage]], [[stillbirth]], nutrition for pregnant and nursing women, or [[Hysterectomy|hysterectomies]], and has incomplete policies regarding [[menopause]], vitamins, health care for pregnant women, women in labor, or women who have recently given birth.  The DOCCS policies stray from community standards in the areas of the starting age for yearly GYN check-ups, the frequency of breast exams and [[Pap smear]]s, follow-up for abnormal Pap smears, frequency of prenatal visits and [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasounds]], and the time frame for postpartum check-ups for women who have a [[Caesarean section]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Federal Bureau of Prisons' policy is to provide each inmate with a complete [[medical exam]] (which includes [[gynecological]] and [[obstetrical]] history) within 30 days of admission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The BOP currently{{specify|date=June 2016}} adheres to the standards for yearly exams put forth by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to a 1997 survey, approximately 90 percent of the inmates in women's state prisons reported having received a gynecologic exam from their institution upon intake.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Additionally, an American Correctional Association study found that  most women's correctional institutions provided [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|OB/GYN]] services, [[Prenatal care|prenatal]] and postpartum care, [[mammography]], and Pap smears upon request.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Fewer provided counseling for inmates regarding their reproductive health,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; many correctional facilities do not provide follow-up exams, and screenings often do not continue on the recommended schedule.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a New York city juvenile detention facility, the 5,000 youth who went through the system annually were all served by a single physician.  Less than one-third of the inmates received a Pap smear test, and one in five were tested for [[gonorrhea]], chlamydia, and [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women often report long delays and wait times in signing up for appointments with a GYN doctor, and in getting treated.   For example, more than half of respondents in a survey of incarcerated women in New York state prisons said that they were not able to see the GYN when necessary, and 47% of respondents stated that their problems became worse in the time that they had to wait.  In one extreme case, Sara, a woman incarcerated in New York, had to wait seven months before she was finally diagnosed with an aggressive cancer.  Another woman had to wait four months to receive a colposcopy, a follow-up to her Pap test.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Another woman at the same prison wrote:

{{quote|I’ve never seen the GYN. I dropped a tab [note to the doctor] explaining to them about being diagnosed with abnormal cells. . . and how I’d like to get a check-up, but no one answered. This was six months ago.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;}}

In a [[qualitative study]] on the experiences of incarcerated women with the [[Pap test|Papanicolaou test]] (a test which screens for cervical cancer) in California state prisons, researchers found a lack of communication between medical providers within the prison, which tended to result in long delays or cancellations of treatment, no standardized process for scheduling a Pap test, and a lack of education and explanation regarding both the test itself, and how to fill out the medical forms associated with it.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In addition to this, women who aren't called in for a Pap test are sometimes required to pay a $5 fee if they request one.  This can be a significant barrier to requesting a test, considering an average prisoner's wage is around 7 to 13 cents per hour.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the same study, women brought attention to the discomfort suffered by inmates with personal histories of sexual abuse and victimization when they were forced to be examined by a male physician.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Women interviewed in New York State prisons had similar complaints about their physicians' seeming lack of awareness of female prisoners' past traumas, and the lack of explanation of the procedures.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One woman stated:

{{quote|text=Ninety-nine percent of the women have been abused or raped.  To have a man take us into an office the size of a closet... stripped down... [it's] rough and hurts us... it takes us right back to the beginning."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;}}

==== Perceptions of Medical Care ====
Another consideration in correctional reproductive health care is the relationship between the prisoner-patients and the physicians. Studies have shown that female inmates often report distrust of physicians and disappointment with their interactions with providers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Researchers have found that most of the women interviewed in the 2005 California state prison study had negative perceptions of their gynecologic tests and treatment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to the women interviewed, the prison doctors who performed their tests were often unprofessional and disrespectful.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One woman described her experience, saying: "They expect us to give them respect, but they don't respect us. They treat us like we are animals just because we are incarcerated."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Prisons in California|California prison system]] employs [[corrections officer]]s who are also trained to be licensed nurses (called medical technical assistants).  Similarly, in Chicago, the county jails train corrections officers as [[doula]]s and [[birth attendant]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Inmates generally must request medical treatment through either these officers, or through other, non-medically trained correctional staff, and studies have shown that female patients' complaints and requests for medical assistance are often not taken as seriously as those of male patients.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The simultaneous positions that these officers hold as both security personnel and medical caretakers or advocates may contribute to female inmates' distrust of them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A 1999 study found that female inmates were more likely than their male counterparts to think that their access to health care was inadequate and that their quality of care was low compared to the care male prisoners were given.  Women in this study also visited the health care facility more often than their male counterparts and reported being healthy less often than men did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindquist|first=Christine H|last2=Lindquist|first2=Charles A|date=2009|title=Health Behind Bars: Utilization and Evaluation of Medical Care Among Jail Inmates|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018794305843|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=24|issue=4|pages=285|doi=10.1023/A:1018794305843|pmid=10463472|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues in correctional reproductive health care ==

=== Lack of resources ===
A lack of resources, specifically of adequate staff, within facilities is largely what contributes to the substandard care of inmates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, although California's prison system is the largest in the country, an obstetrician/gynecologist was not hired at the [[California Institution for Women]] (CIW) until pregnant prisoners in California filed a class action lawsuit (Harris v. McCarthy) against CIW. The [[Valley State Prison|Valley State Prison for Women]] (VSPW), another prison in California, had just two OB/GYN doctors on staff in 2000 (one of whom was indicted on four counts of sexual misconduct and eventually fired). Albion, a women's prison in New York State, has 1,000 prisoners, but only one GYN doctor, who works only 16 hours per week.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Taconic, another facility in New York, which holds about 370 women, has no GYN doctor on site.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In these cases, routine GYN care falls to the general nurse practitioner or Medical Director.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition to the lack of staff, medical doctors are often not on duty on the weekends and during evening hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  This can be dangerous if medical emergencies arise during non-business hours.  For example, a prisoner in CIW in 1997 went into labor over the weekend, when there was only one nurse on duty.  The nurse strapped the woman into a gurney, but refused to help with her labor.  When the baby was born not breathing, the nurse had to call paramedics, because she was unable to activate the breathing apparatus.  By the time the newborn was transported to the hospital, he was declared brain dead.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The difficulty with recruiting qualified staff can be attributed to both the physical isolation of women's prisons (often placed in areas that are considered undesirable to live in, where there are few available medical professionals), and to the relative lack of medical resources and low salaries that prisons offer to medical staff.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Dr. Valda Chijide, a former HIV doctor in an Alabama prison, for instance, resigned from her position due to inadequate support.  In this case, the HIV unit was rat-infested, with broken windows covered in plastic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Privatization of prison health care ===
There is also a trend towards privatizing health care by hiring outside, for-profit health care companies to provide medical care to inmates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  According to a 1996 survey by the [[National Institute of Corrections]] (NIC), forty-four state Departments of Corrections contract out at least some of their medical care to private vendors - in 1996 this amounted to $706 million.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This can result in a lack of accountability, as proper monitoring makes a contract more expensive.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Oversight is often lacking. In Alabama, the same official who previously held a high level position at Prison Health Services, one of the nation's largest private vendors, now works in a position within the Alabama Department of Corrections which requires her to oversee Prison Health's compliance to the contract.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Prison Health Services, which has cared for 237,000 inmates, has had to pay millions of dollars in fines and settlements due to inadequate care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In another example, according to a former supervisory nurse of a jail operated by [[Corizon|Correctional Medical Services]]  (CMS), a large private contractor, the jail would often release pregnant women when they went into labor, and then arrest them again after they gave birth, in order to avoid having to pay for the inmates' medical expenses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Lack of accountability also results due to varying state and federal laws on private contractors' liability for medical abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Private contractors can be challenged under the same federal civil rights law that applies to state and local governments, but these corporations cannot be sued for unconstitutional medical practices.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]] that vary amongst countries around the world.&lt;ref name="COOK"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2950752 |jstor=2950752 |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=115–21 |year=1996 |last1=Cook |first1=Rebecca J. |last2=Fathalla |first2=Mahmoud F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of [[discrimination]], [[coercion]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726150133/http://www.who.int//reproductive-health/gender/index.html |archivedate=2009-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Women's reproductive rights may include some or all of the following: the [[abortion-rights movements|right to legal and safe abortion]]; the right to [[birth control]]; freedom from [[compulsory sterilization|coerced sterilization]] and contraception; the right to access good-quality [[reproductive health]]care; and the right to [[family planning|education and access]] in order to make free and informed reproductive choices.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt; Reproductive rights may also include the right to receive [[sex education|education]] about [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] and other aspects of sexuality, and protection from practices such as [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/zavales4.html|title=Template|website=Nocirc.org|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights began to develop as a subset of [[human rights]] at the United Nation's 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN" /&gt; The resulting [[Non-binding resolution|non binding]] Proclamation of Tehran was the first international document to recognize one of these rights when it stated that: "Parents have a basic human right to determine [[Political freedom|freely]] and [[Moral responsibility|responsibly]] the number and the spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2939211 |pmid=8475521 |jstor=2939211 |title=Human Rights and Reproductive Choice |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=18–30 |year=1993 |last1=Freedman |first1=Lynn P. |last2=Isaacs |first2=Stephen L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teheran_proc&gt;{{cite web |title=Proclamation of Teheran|publisher=International Conference on Human Rights|year= 1968|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm|accessdate=2007-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017025912/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/b_tehern.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; States, though, have been slow in incorporating these rights in [[treaty|internationally legally binding instruments]]. Thus, while some of these rights have already been recognized in [[soft law|hard law]], that is, in legally binding [[international human rights instruments]], others have been mentioned only in non binding recommendations and, therefore, have at best the status of [[soft law]] in [[international law]], while a further group is yet to be accepted by the international community and therefore remains at the level of [[advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003):&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have been leaders in bringing arguments for a woman's right to choose abortion within the rubric of international human rights. However, there is no binding hard norm that recognizes women's right to terminate a pregnancy. (...) While there are hard norms prohibiting sex discrimination that apply to girl adolescents, these are problematic since they must be applied to a substantive right (i.e., the right to health) and the substantive reproductive rights of adolescents are not `hard' (yet!). There are no hard norms on age discrimination that would protect adolescents' ability to exercise their rights to reproductive health, sexual education, or reproductive decisionmaking. In addition, there are no hard norms prohibiting discrimination based on marital status, which is often an issue with respect to unmarried adolescents' access to reproductive health services and information. The soft norms support the idea that the hard norms apply to adolescents under 18. They also fill in the substantive gaps in the hard norms with respect to reproductive health services and information as well as adolescents' reproductive autonomy. (...) There are no hard norms in international human rights law that directly address HIV/AIDS directly. At the same time, a number of human rights bodies have developed soft norms to secure rights that are rendered vulnerable by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. (...) Practices with implications for women's reproductive rights in relation to HIV/AIDS are still not fully covered under existing international law, although soft norms have addressed them to some extent. (...) There is a lack of explicit prohibition of mandatory testing of HIV-positive pregnant women under international law. (...) None of the global human rights treaties explicitly prohibit child marriage and no treaty prescribes an appropriate minimum age for marriage. The onus of specifying a minimum age at marriage rests with the states' parties to these treaties. (...) We have to rely extensively on soft norms that have evolved from the TMBs and that are contained in conference documents to assert that child marriage is a violation of fundamental human rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues related to reproductive rights are some of the most vigorously contested rights' issues worldwide, regardless of the population's [[socioeconomic]] level, [[religion]] or [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of reproductive rights is frequently presented as being of vital importance in discussions and articles by [[List of population concern organizations|population concern organizations]] such as [[Population Matters]].&lt;ref name=popsearch&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Matters search on "reproductive rights"|url=http://populationmatters.org/search_results.php?q=%22reproductive+rights%22|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140627121618/http://populationmatters.org/search_results.php?q=%22reproductive+rights%22|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-06-27|website=Populationmatters.org/|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights are a subset of [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]].

==History==
===Proclamation of Tehran===
In 1945, the [[United Nations Charter]] included the obligation "to promote... universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race, sex, language, or religion". However, the Charter did not define these rights. Three years later, the [[United Nations|UN]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the first international legal document to delineate [[human rights]]; the UDHR does not mention reproductive rights.  Reproductive rights began to appear as a subset of human rights in the 1968 Proclamation of Tehran, which states: "Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children".&lt;ref name=tehran_proc /&gt;

This right was affirmed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in the 1969 [[Declaration on Social Progress and Development]] which states "The family as a basic unit of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members, particularly children and youth, should be assisted and protected so that it may fully assume its responsibilities within the community. Parents have the exclusive right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/m_progre.htm|title=unhchr.ch|website=Unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Women's Year#International|1975 UN International Women's Year Conference]] echoed the Proclamation of Tehran.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Cairo Programme of Action===
The twenty-year "Cairo Programme of Action" was adopted in 1994 at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. The [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]] Programme of Action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. It recommended that [[family planning]] services be provided in the context of other reproductive health services, including services for healthy and safe childbirth, care for sexually transmitted infections, and post-abortion care. The ICPD also addressed issues such as [[violence against women]], [[sex trafficking]], and adolescent health.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=5–6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cairo Program is the first international policy document to define [[reproductive health]],&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/&gt; stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed [about] and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods for regulation of fertility which are not against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant [para. 72].&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike previous population conferences, a wide range of interests from grassroots to government level were represented in Cairo. 179 nations attended the ICPD and overall eleven thousand representatives from governments, [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]], international agencies and citizen activists participated.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/&gt; The ICPD did not address the far-reaching implications of the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS epidemic]]. In 1999, recommendations at the ICPD+5 were expanded to include commitment to AIDS education, research, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission, as well as to the development of vaccines and microbicides.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cairo Programme of Action was adopted by 184 UN member states. Nevertheless, many Latin American and Islamic states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] to the programme, in particular, to its concept of reproductive rights and sexual freedom, to its treatment of abortion, and to its potential incompatibility with [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html|title=A/CONF.171/13: Report of the ICPD (94/10/18) (385k)|website=Un.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action varies considerably from country to country. In many countries, post-ICPD tensions emerged as the [[human rights]]-based approach was implemented. Since the ICPD, many countries have broadened their reproductive health programs and attempted to integrate maternal and child health services with family planning. More attention is paid to adolescent health and the consequences of unsafe abortion. Lara Knudsen observes that the ICPD succeeded in getting [[feminist]] language into governments' and population agencies' literature, but in many countries the underlying concepts are not widely put into practice.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"/&gt; In two preparatory meetings for the ICPD+10 in Asia and Latin America, the United States, under the George W. Bush Administration, was the only nation opposing the ICPD's Programme of Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beijing Platform===
The 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing, in its [[non-binding resolution|non-binding]] [[Beijing Declaration|Declaration]] and [[Beijing Platform for Action|Platform for Action]], supported the Cairo Programme's definition of reproductive health, but established a broader context of reproductive rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences [para. 96].&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Beijing Platform demarcated twelve interrelated critical areas of the human rights of women that require advocacy. The Platform framed women's reproductive rights as "indivisible, universal and inalienable human rights."&lt;ref name="BUNCH"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/495143 |jstor=3175048 |title=Beijing '95: Moving Women's Human Rights from Margin to Center |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=200–4 |year=1996 |last1=Bunch |first1=Charlotte |last2=Fried |first2=Susana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yogyakarta Principles===

In relation to reproductive health, Principle 9 on "The Right to Treatment with Humanity while in Detention" requires that "States shall... &lt;nowiki&gt;[p]rovide&lt;/nowiki&gt; adequate access to medical care and counseling appropriate to the needs of those in custody, recognizing any particular needs of persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity, including with regard to reproductive health, access to [[HIV/AIDS]] information and therapy and access to [[hormone therapy|hormonal]] or other therapy as well as to [[sex reassignment therapy|gender-reassignment treatments]] where desired."&lt;ref&gt;"The Yogyakarta Principles" Preamble and Principle 9. The Rights to Treatment with Humanity While in Detention&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, African, Caribbean and Islamic Countries, as well as the [[Russian Federation]], have objected to the use of these principles as Human Rights standards.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, Official Records, Third Committee, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/576/53/PDF/N0957653.pdf?OpenElement Summary record of the 29th meeting held in New York, on Monday, 25 October 2010, at 3 p.m] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927135721/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/576/53/PDF/N0957653.pdf?OpenElement |date=27 September 2012 }}. For instance, [[Malawi]], speaking on behalf of all African States, argued that the Yogyakarta Principles were "controversial and unrecognized," while the representative of the Russian Federation said that they "had not been agreed to at the intergovernmental level, and which therefore could not be considered as authoritative expressions of the opinion of the international community" (para. 9, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

===State abuses===
State abuses against reproductive rights have happened both under right-wing and left-wing governments. Such abuses include attempts to forcefully increase the birth rate - one of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies of the 20th century was that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people - as well as attempts to decrease the fertility rate - [[China]]'s [[one child policy]] (1978-2015). State mandated [[forced marriage]] was also practiced by authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf |format=PDF|author=Natalae Anderson|title=Memorandum: Charging Forced Marriage as a Crime Against Humanity|date=September 22, 2010|website=D.dccam.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments have implemented [[eugenic]] policies of [[forced sterilizations]] of 'undesirable' population groups. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2148793.stm|title=BBC NEWS - World - Americas - Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-08-19|date=2002-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Human rights}}
Since most existing legally binding [[international human rights instruments]] do not explicitly mention sexual and reproductive rights, a [[Epistemic community (international relations)|broad coalition]] of NGOs, civil servants, and experts working in [[international organizations]] have been promoting a reinterpretation of those instruments to link the realization of the already internationally recognized human rights with the realization of reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-defenders/issues/challenges/srr-defenders Defenders of Sexual and Reproductive Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002004052/http://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-defenders/issues/challenges/srr-defenders |date=2013-10-02 }}; [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3326&amp;Itemid=548 International Women’s Health Coalition and the United Nations],  [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=205&amp;Itemid=110 Campaign for an Inter-American Convention on Sexual and Reproductive Rights ], Women's Health Collection, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=105915323 Abortion as a human right: possible strategies in unexplored territory.

In this regard, the Center for Reproductive Rights has noted that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Our goal is to ensure that governments worldwide guarantee women's reproductive rights out of an understanding that they are bound to do so. The two principal prerequisites for achieving this goal are: (1) the strengthening of international legal norms protecting reproductive rights; and (2) consistent and effective action on the part of civil society and the international community to enforce these norms. Each of these conditions, in turn, depends upon profound social change at the local, national and international (including regional) levels. (...) Ultimately, we must persuade governments to accept reproductive rights as binding norms. Again, our approach can move forward on several fronts, with interventions both at the national and international levels. Governments' recognition of reproductive rights norms may be indicated by their support for progressive language in international conference documents or by their adoption and implementation of appropriate national-level legislative and policy instruments. In order to counter opposition to an expansion of recognized reproductive rights norms, we have questioned the credibility of such reactionary yet influential international actors as the United States and the Holy See. Our activities to garner support for international protections of reproductive rights include: Lobbying government delegations at UN conferences and producing supporting analyses/materials; fostering alliances with members of civil society who may become influential on their national delegations to the UN; and preparing briefing papers and factsheets exposing the broad anti-woman agenda of our opposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this linkage is provided by the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents and other relevant United Nations consensus documents. These rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence as expressed in human rights documents. In the exercise of this right, they should take into account the needs of their living and future children and their responsibilities towards the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.ca/Cairo/program/p07002.html |title=[programme&amp;#93; Basis for action |publisher=Iisd.ca |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similarly, [[Amnesty International]] has argued that the realisation of reproductive rights is linked with the realisation of a series of recognised [[human rights]], including the [[right to health]], the right to freedom from [[discrimination]], the [[right to privacy]], and the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |title=Stop Violence Against Women: Reproductive rights |accessdate=2007-12-08 |author=Amnesty International USA |year=2007 |work=SVAW |publisher=Amnesty International USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120140923/http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[World Health Organization]] states that:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/srh-rights-comment/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Sexual and reproductive health and rights encompass efforts to eliminate preventable maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, to ensure quality sexual and reproductive health services, including contraceptive services, and to address sexually transmitted infections (STI) and cervical cancer, violence against women and girls, and sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents. Universal access to sexual and reproductive health is essential not only to achieve sustainable development but also to ensure that this new framework speaks to the needs and aspirations of people around the world and leads to realisation of their health and human rights."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, not all states have accepted the inclusion of reproductive rights in the body of internationally recognized human rights. At the Cairo Conference, several states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] either to the concept of reproductive rights or to its specific content.  [[Ecuador]], for instance, stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to the Programme of Action of the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and laws of Ecuador and the norms of international law, the delegation of Ecuador reaffirms, inter alia, the following principles embodied in its Constitution:  the inviolability of life, the protection of children from the moment of conception, freedom of conscience and religion, the protection of the family as the fundamental unit of society, responsible paternity, the right of parents to bring up their children and the formulation of population and development plans by the Government in accordance with the principles of respect for sovereignty. Accordingly, the delegation of Ecuador enters a reservation with respect to all terms such as "regulation of fertility", "interruption of pregnancy", "reproductive health", "reproductive rights" and "unwanted children", which in one way or another, within the context of the Programme of Action, could involve abortion.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similar reservations were made by [[Argentina]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Malta]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and the [[Holy See]]. Islamic Countries, such as [[Brunei]], [[Djibouti]], [[Iran]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Yemen]] made broad reservations against any element of the programme that could be interpreted as contrary to the [[Sharia]]. Guatemala even questioned whether the conference could legally proclaim new human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html United Nations, Report of the Fourth International Conference on Population and Development, Cario, 5 - 13 September 1994]. Guatemala entered the following reservation:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chapter VII:  we enter a reservation on the whole chapter, for the General Assembly's mandate to the Conference does not extend to the creation or formulation of rights; this reservation therefore applies to all references in the document to "reproductive rights", "sexual rights", "reproductive health", "fertility regulation", "sexual health", "individuals", "sexual education and services for minors", "abortion in all its forms", "distribution of contraceptives" and "safe motherhood"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights==
{{see also|Women’s rights|Reproductive justice}}
{{Feminism sidebar}}
The [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) advocate for reproductive rights with a primary emphasis on [[women's rights]]. In this respect the UN and WHO focus on a range of issues from access to [[family planning]] services, sex education, [[menopause]], and the reduction of [[obstetric fistula]], to the relationship between reproductive health and economic status.

The reproductive rights of women are advanced in the context of the right to freedom from [[discrimination]] and the social and economic status of women. The group Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) explained the link in the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Control over reproduction is a basic need and a basic right for all women. Linked as it is to women's health and social status, as well as the powerful social structures of religion, state control and administrative inertia, and private profit, it is from the perspective of poor women that this right can best be understood and affirmed. Women know that childbearing is a social, not a purely personal, phenomenon; nor do we deny that world population trends are likely to exert considerable pressure on resources and institutions by the end of this century. But our bodies have become a pawn in the struggles among states, religions, male heads of households, and private corporations.

Women's reproductive rights have long retained key issue status in the debate on [[overpopulation]].&lt;ref name=popsearch/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only ray of hope I can see – and it's not much – is that wherever women are put in control of their lives, both politically and socially; where medical facilities allow them to deal with birth control and where their husbands allow them to make those decisions, birth rate falls.

According to [[OHCHR]]: "Women’s sexual and reproductive health is related to multiple human rights, including the right to life, the right to be free from torture, the right to health, the right to privacy, the right to education, and the prohibition of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/women/wrgs/pages/healthrights.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts have been made to analyse the socioeconomic conditions that affect the realisation of a woman's reproductive rights. The term [[reproductive justice]] has been used to describe these broader social and economic issues.

{{Masculism sidebar}}
Men's reproductive rights have been claimed by various organizations, both for issues of reproductive health, and other rights related to sexual reproduction.

Three international issues in men's reproductive health are [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, cancer and exposure to [[toxins]].&lt;ref name = "NETWORK"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/Network/v18_3/NW183ch2.htm |title=Men's Reproductive Health Risks: Threats to men's fertility and reproductive health include disease, cancer and exposure to toxins |accessdate=2008-01-02 |last1=Best |first1=Kim |date=Spring 1998 |journal=Network |pages=7–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently men's reproductive right with regards to paternity have become subject of debate in the U.S.  The term "[[male abortion]]" was coined by Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in a 1998 article.  The theory begins with the premise that when a woman becomes pregnant she has the option of abortion, adoption, or parenthood; it argues, in the context of legally recognized [[gender equality]], that in the earliest stages of pregnancy the putative (alleged) father should have the right to relinquish all future parental rights and financial responsibility, leaving the informed mother with the same three options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCulley Melanie G | year = 1998 | title = The male abortion: the putative father's right to terminate his interests in and obligations to the unborn child | url = | journal = The Journal of Law and Policy | volume = VII | issue =1 | pages =1–55 |pmid=12666677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been supported by a former president of the feminist organization [[National Organization for Women]], attorney [[Karen DeCrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2000/10/19/mens_choice|title=A man's right to choose|last1=Young|first1=Kathy|date=Oct 19, 2000|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate= May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminist]] argument for male reproductive choice contends that the uneven ability to choose experienced by men and women in regards to parenthood is evidence of a state-enforced [[coercion]] favoring traditional [[sex roles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lisa Lucile |last1=Owens |year=2013 |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |journal=Alabama Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=5 |pages=1–33 |ssrn=2439294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the National Center for Men brought a case in the US, ''[[Dubay v. Wells]]'' (dubbed by some "''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' for men"), that argued that in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, when an unmarried woman informs a man that she is pregnant by him, he should have an opportunity to give up all paternity rights and responsibilities.  Supporters argue that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women.&lt;ref&gt;Traister, Rebecca. (March 13, 2006).

==Intersex and reproductive rights==

Intersex, in [[human]]s and other [[animal]]s, is a variation in [[sex]] characteristics including [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female. Such variation may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal [[genotype]] and sexual [[phenotype]] other than XY-male and XX-female.&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl.

UN agencies have begun to take note. On 1 February 2013, Juan E Mendés, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, issued a statement condemning non-consensual surgical intervention on intersex people. His report stated, "Children who are born with atypical sex characteristics are often subject to irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents, "in an attempt to fix their sex", leaving them with permanent, irreversible infertility and causing severe mental suffering".&lt;ref name="untorture"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture], [[Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement'' with the [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]].

===Minors===
{{See|Parental consent}}
In many jurisdictions minors require parental consent or parental notification in order to access various reproductive services, such as contraception, abortion, gynecological consultations,  testing for STDs etc. The requirement that minors have parental consent/notification for testing for [[HIV/AIDS]] is especially controversial, particularly in areas where the disease is endemic, and it is a sensitive subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/adolescent/hiv-testing-treatment/page/Informed_consent_and_HIV_testing|title=World Health Organization - HIV and Adolescents from Guidance to Action|first=World Health|last=Organization|website=apps.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/696753/doh-backs-bill-allowing-minor-to-get-hiv-aids-tests-without-parental-consent|title=DOH backs bill allowing minor to get HIV, AIDS tests without parental consent|first=Jocelyn R.|last=Uy|website=Newsinfo.inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2014/july/20140723_youth|title=Challenging parental consent laws to increase young people's access to vital HIV services - UNAIDS|website=Unaids.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balancing minors' rights versus parental rights is considered an [[ethical]] problem in medicine and law, and there have been many court cases on this issue in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/456472_6|title=Medscape Log In|website=Medscape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important concept recognized since 1989 by the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] is that of the [[evolving capacities|
evolving capacities of a minor]], namely that minors should, in accordance with their maturity and level of understanding, be involved in decisions that affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ippfwhr.org/sites/default/files/srrightsyoungen.pdf|title=Sexual and Reproductive Rights of Young People: Autonomous decision making and confidential services|work=International Planned Parenthood Federation|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Youth]] are often denied equal access to reproductive health services because [[health workers]] view adolescent sexual activity as unacceptable,&lt;ref name=Mugisha&gt;{{cite book |last=Mugisha|first=Frederick |editor-first=Andy|editor-last=Furlong|title=Handbook of Youth and Young Adulthood |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |pages=344–352 |chapter=Chapter 42: HIV and AIDS, STIs and sexual health among young people |isbn=978-0-415-44541-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or see sex education as the responsibility of parents.  Providers of reproductive health have little accountability to youth clients, a primary factor in denying youth access to reproductive health care.&lt;ref name=Mugisha /&gt; In many countries, regardless of legislation, minors are denied even the most basic reproductive care, if they are not accompanied by parents: in India, for instance, in 2017, a 17-year-old girl who was rejected by her family due to her pregnancy, was also rejected by hospitals and gave birth in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/india-chandil-homeless-street-jharkand-medical-centre-a7918611.html|title=Homeless girl in India forced to give birth on street metres away from health centre: She was shivering and unable to lift and cuddle her infant|date=August 29, 2017|first=Andrew|last=Lowry|work=The Independent|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the lack of reproductive rights for adolescents has been a concern of international organizations, such as [[UNFPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/adolescent-sexual-and-reproductive-health|title=Adolescent sexual and reproductive health - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandatory involvement of parents in cases where the minor has sufficient maturity to understand their situation is considered by health organization as a violation of minor's rights and detrimental to their health. The [[World Health Organization]] has criticized parental consent/notification laws:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women. Examples include specific individuals or groups being subjected to physical and verbal abuse or violence; involuntary treatment; '''breaches of confidentiality and/or denial of autonomous decision-making, such as the requirement of consent to treatment by parents, spouses or guardians'''; and lack of free and informed consent. [...] Laws and policies must respect the principles of autonomy in health care decision-making; guarantee free and informed consent, privacy and confidentiality; prohibit mandatory HIV testing; prohibit screening procedures that are not of benefit to the individual or the public; and ban involuntary treatment and '''mandatory third-party authorization and notification requirements'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/|title=Joint United Nations statement on ending discrimination in health care settings — Joint WHO/UN statement|work=World Health Organization|date=June 27, 2017|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to UNICEF: "When dealing with sexual and reproductive health, the obligation
to inform parents and obtain their consent becomes a significant barrier with consequences for adolescents’ lives and for public health in general."&lt;ref name="UnicefBAJA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/lac/1._DIG._Min_age_of_medical_consent_PDF_BAJA_.pdf|title=Legal minimum ages and the realization of adolescents' rights|website=Unicef|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One specific issue which is seen as a form of hypocrisy of legislators is that of having a higher age of medical consent for the purpose of reproductive and sexual health than the [[age of sexual consent]] - in such cases the law allows youth to engage in sexual activity, but does not allow them to consent to medical procedures that may arise from being sexually active; UNICEF states that "On sexual and reproductive health matters, the minimum age of medical consent should never be higher than the age of sexual consent."&lt;ref name="UnicefBAJA" /&gt;

[[File:No Sex Signage in Ghana.jpg|thumb|Ad promoting abstinence in [[Ghana]]: ''No Sex Ad'' (Anti-[[HIV/AIDS]] ― [[signage]]). [[Abstinence-only sex education]] is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]] outside of marriage, most often excluding other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, such as [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. [[Comprehensive Sex Education|Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence.]]

Many [[unintended pregnancies]] stem from traditional contraceptive methods or no [[contraceptive]] measures.&lt;ref name=Lukale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lukale|first=Nelly|title=Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights for Young People in Africa|journal=ARROWs for Change|year=2012|volume=18|issue=2|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth sexual education in Uganda is relatively low.  [[Comprehensive sex education]] is not generally taught in schools; even if it was, the majority of young people do not stay in school after the age of fifteen, so information would be limited regardless.&lt;ref name=Knudson&gt;{{cite book|last=Knudson|first=Lara|title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context: South Africa, Uganda, Peru, Denmark, United States, Vietnam, Jordan|year=2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|location=Nashville, TN}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] experiences high rates of unintended pregnancy, along with high rates of [[HIV/AIDS]].  Young women aged 15–24 are eight times more likely to have HIV/AIDS than young men. [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] is the world region most affected by HIV/AIDS, with approximately 25 million people living with HIV in 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for two-thirds of the global total of new HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids|title=HIV/AIDS Factsheet|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempted [[abortions]] and [[unsafe abortions]] are a risk for youth in Africa.  On average, there are 2.4 million unsafe abortions in East Africa, 1.8 million in Western Africa, over 900,000 in Middle Africa, and over 100,000 in Southern Africa each year.&lt;ref name=Lukale /&gt;

In [[Uganda]], abortion is illegal except to save the mother's life.  However, 78% of teenagers report knowing someone who has had an abortion and the police do not always prosecute everyone who has an abortion.  An estimated 22% of all [[maternal deaths]] in the area stem from illegal, unsafe abortions.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;

===European Union===
Over 85% of European women (all ages) have used some form of [[birth control]] in their lives.&lt;ref name=Irala /&gt;  Europeans as an aggregate report using [[Oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] and [[condoms]] as the most commonly used contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Irala&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.004 |pmid=22078183 |title=Choice of birth control methods among European women and the role of partners and providers |journal=Contraception |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=558–64 |year=2011 |last1=De Irala |first1=Jokin |last2=Osorio |first2=Alfonso |last3=Carlos |first3=Silvia |last4=Lopez-Del Burgo |first4=Cristina |hdl=10171/19110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Views on sexual practice vary throughout the region.  For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), sex among youth is generally looked down upon and seen as a problem in need of solution.  In the [[Netherlands]], sex between youth is viewed as normal and therefore not discussed in terms of solutions, but rather in terms of ensuring safe practices.  That being said, the UK tends to focus on stopping sexual behavior, while the Netherlands focuses on building self-esteem and healthy relationships.&lt;ref name=Ketting /&gt;

===Latin America===
{{Main|Reproductive rights in Latin America}}
[[Latin America]] has come to international attention due to its harsh anti-abortion laws. Latin America is home to some of the few countries of the world with a complete ban on abortion, without an exception for saving [[maternal mortality|maternal life]].&lt;ref name="ChileCourt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41005517|title=Chile abortion: Court approves easing total ban|date=August 21, 2017|work=BBC|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some of these countries, particularity in [[Central America]], the enforcement of such laws is very aggressive: [[Abortion in El Salvador|El Salvador]] and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]] have drawn international attention for strong enforcement of their complete bans on abortion. In 2017, [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]] relaxed its total ban, allowing abortion to be performed when the woman’s life is in danger, when a fetus is unviable, or in cases of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/chile-the-long-road-to-abortion-reform-a7917791.html|title=Chile: the long road to abortion reform — After a fierce debate, one of the most restrictive reproductive laws in the world has been eased|date=August 29, 2017|first=Cordelia|last=Freeman |work=The Independent|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ecuador]], education and class play a large role in the definition of which young women become pregnant and which do not - 50% of young women who are illiterate get pregnant, compared to 11% of girls with secondary education.  The same is true for poorer individuals - 28% become impregnated while only 11% of young women in wealthier households do.  Furthermore, access to reproductive rights, including contraceptives, are limited, due to age and the perception of female morality.  Health care providers often discuss contraception theoretically, not as a device to be used on a regular basis.  Decisions concerning sexual activity often involve secrecy and taboos, as well as a lack of access to accurate information.  Even more telling, young women have much easier access to maternal healthcare than they do to contraceptive help, which helps explain high pregnancy rates in the region.&lt;ref name=Goicolea&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goicolea|first=Isabel|title=Adolescent Pregnancies in the Amazon Basin of Ecuador: A Rights and Gender Approach to Adolescents' Sexual and Reproductive Health|journal=Global Health Action|year=2010|volume=3|pages=1–11|doi=10.3402/gha.v3i0.5280|pmid=20596248|pmc=2893010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among sexually experienced teenagers, 78% of teenage females and 85% of teenage males used contraception the first time they had sex; 86% and 93% of these same females and males, respectively, reported using contraception the last time they had sex.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet Guttmacher"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Contraceptive Use in the United States|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=2004-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The male [[condom]] is the most commonly used method during first sex, although 54% of young women in the United States rely upon the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|pill]].&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet Guttmacher" /&gt;

Young people in the U.S. are no more sexually active than individuals in other developed countries, but they are significantly less knowledgeable about contraception and safe sex practices.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt; As of 2006, only twenty states required [[sex education]] in schools - of these, only ten required information about contraception.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  On the whole, less than 10% of American students receive sex education that includes topical coverage of [[abortion]], [[homosexuality]], [[Intimate relationships|relationships]], [[pregnancy]], and STI prevention.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  [[Abstinence-only education]] was used throughout much of the United States in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  Based upon the moral principle that sex outside of marriage is unacceptable, the programs often misled students about their rights to have sex, the consequences, and prevention of pregnancy and STIs.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;

[[Abortion in the United States]] is legal since the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' which decriminalised abortion nationwide in 1973, and established a minimal period during which abortion is legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). That basic framework, modified in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), remains nominally in place, although the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many counties have no abortion providers.&lt;ref name="Doan3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|page=57|author1=Alesha Doan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' held that a law cannot place legal restrictions imposing an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] for "the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."&lt;ref&gt;Casey, 505 U.S. at 877.&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion is a controversial political issue, and regular attempts to restrict it occur in most states. One such case, originating in [[Texas]], led to the Supreme Court case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v.

One of the reasons why reproductive rights are poor in many places, is that the vast majority of the population does not know what the law is. Not only are ordinary people uninformed, but so are medical doctors. A study in Brazil on medical doctors found considerable ignorance and misunderstanding of the law on abortion (which is severely restricted, but not completely illegal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brazilian obstetrician-gynecologists and abortion: a survey of knowledge, opinions and practices|first1=Lisa A.|last1=Goldman|first2=Sandra G.|last2=García|first3=Juan|last3=Díaz|first4=Eileen A.|last4=Yam|date=15 November 2005|journal=Reproductive Health|volume=2|pages=10|doi=10.1186/1742-4755-2-10|pmid=16288647|pmc=1308861}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ghana, abortion, while restricted, is permitted on several grounds, but only 3% of pregnant women and 6% of those seeking an abortion were aware of the legal status of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/abortion-ghana|title=Abortion in Ghana|date=24 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, abortion was legalized in 2002, but a study in 2009 found that only half of women knew that abortion was legalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/09/nepal-only-half-of-women-know-abortion-is-legal/|title=NEPAL: Only Half of Women Know Abortion is Legal - Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also do not understand the laws on [[sexual violence]]: in Hungary, where [[marital rape]] was made illegal in 1997, in a study in 2006, 62% of people did not know that marital rape was a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur27/002/2007/en/|title=Wayback Machine|date=8 June 2011|publisher=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/undp-cpr-8-point-agenda-practical-positive-outcomes-girls-women-crisis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|first=United Nations General|last=Assembly|website=www.un-documents.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equality and violence against women==
{{Further|Gender equality|Violence against women|Sexual violence|Forced marriage|Child marriage}}
Addressing issues of gender-based violence is crucial for attaining reproductive rights. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] refers to "'''''Equality and equity for men and women''', to enable individuals to make free and informed choices in all spheres of life, free from discrimination based on gender''" and "''Sexual and reproductive security, '''including freedom from sexual violence and coercion''', and the right to privacy,''" as part of achieving reproductive rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/rights/rights.htm |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; Supporting the Constellation of Reproductive Rights |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that the '''right to liberty and security of the person''' which is fundamental to reproductive rights obliges states to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/english/ch3/ch3_box9.htm |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; State of World Population 2005 |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Take measures to prevent, punish and eradicate all forms of gender-based violence
* Eliminate female genital mutilation/cutting

The WHO states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hhr/activities/GRR/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and Reproductive Rights |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Gender and Reproductive Rights (GRR) aims to promote and protect human rights and gender equality as they relate to sexual and reproductive health by developing strategies and mechanisms for promoting gender equity and equality and human rights in the Departments global and national activities, as well as within the functioning and priority-setting of the Department itself."

Amnesty International writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/campaigns/stop-violence-against-women/issues/implementation-existing-laws/srr |title=Sexual and reproductive rights &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Violence against women violates women's rights to life, physical and mental integrity, to the highest attainable standard of health, to freedom from torture and it violates their sexual and reproductive rights."

One key issue for achieving reproductive rights is criminalization of [[sexual violence]]. If a woman is not protected from forced sexual intercourse, she is not protected from [[forced pregnancy]], namely [[pregnancy from rape]]. In order for a woman to be able to have reproductive rights, she must have the right to choose with whom and when to reproduce; and first of all, decide whether, when, and under what circumstances to be sexually active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/gender_rights/sexual_health/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and human rights |publisher=Who.int |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, these rights of women are not respected, because women do not have a choice in regard to their partner, with [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]] being common in parts of the world; and neither do they have any rights in regard to sexual activity, as many countries do not allow women to refuse to engage in sexual intercourse when they do not want to (because [[marital rape]] is not criminalized in those countries) or to engage in consensual sexual intercourse if they want to (because sex outside marriage is illegal in those countries). In addition to legal barriers, there are also social barriers, because in many countries a complete sexual subordination of a woman to her husband is expected (for instance, in one survey 74% of women in Mali said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?rh04047 |title=Bioline International Official Site (site up-dated regularly) |publisher=Bioline.org.br |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while sexual/romantic relations disapproved by family members, or generally sex outside marriage, can result in serious violence, such as [[honor killings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/ |title=Ethics: Honour Crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the CDC, "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens a person’s immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. No effective cure exists for HIV. But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/index.html|title=HIV Basics {{!}} HIV/AIDS {{!}} CDC|website=Cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-05|date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HIV amelioration is an important aspect of reproductive rights because the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or birth, or via breast milk.

The WHO states that: "All women, including those with HIV, have the right “to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights”".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/11/08-059360/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Reproductive choices for women with HIV |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive rights of people living with HIV, and their health, are very important. The link between HIV and reproductive rights exists in regard to four main issues:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* prevention of unwanted pregnancy
* help to plan wanted pregnancy
* healthcare during and after pregnancy
* access to abortion services

==Child and forced marriage==
{{Main|Child marriage|Forced marriage}}
The WHO states that the reproductive rights and health of girls in child marriages are negatively affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/news/news/2012/12/child-marriage-a-threat-to-health|title=Child marriage – a threat to health|date=20 December 2012|website=www.euro.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations Population Fund|UNPF]] calls child marriage a "human rights violation" and states that in developing countries, one in every three girls is married before reaching age 18, and one in nine is married under age 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/child-marriage|title=Child marriage - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or more of the parties is married without his or her consent or against his or her will. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul convention]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women and domestic violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Convention of Belem do Para and the Istanbul Convention : A response to violence against women worldwide |publisher=Oas.org |accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires countries which ratify it to prohibit [[forced marriage]] (Article 37) and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization (Article 32).&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/168046031c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual violence in armed conflict==
{{Main|Wartime sexual violence|Pregnancy from rape}}
Sexual violence in armed conflict is [[sexual violence]] committed by [[combatant]]s during [[armed conflict]], war, or [[military occupation]] often as [[War looting|spoils of war]]; but sometimes, particularly in [[ethnic conflict]], the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. It often includes [[gang rape]]. Rape is often used as a tactic of war and a threat to international security.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/rapeweaponwar.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence in armed conflict is a violation of reproductive rights, and often leads to [[forced pregnancy]]  and [[sexually transmitted infections]]. Such sexual violations affect mostly women and girls,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00981389.2016.1240134?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=wshc20&lt;/ref&gt; but [[rape of men]] can also occur, such as in [[ Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name=Melhado&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melhado|first=L|title=Rates of Sexual Violence Are High in Democratic Republic of the Congo|journal=International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|volume=36|number=4|year=2010|p=210|jstor=41038670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Autesserre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Autesserre|first=Séverine|title=Dangerous Tales: Dominant Narratives on the Congo and their Unintended Consequences|journal=African Affairs|volume=111|issue=443|year=2012|pages=202–222|doi=10.1093/afraf/adr080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Birth control===
{{See|Forced pregnancy}}
[[Birth control]], also known as contraception and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Birth control|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=53351|work=MedicineNet|accessdate=August 9, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806234913/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=53351|archivedate=August 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Hopkins2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanson|first1=S.J.|last2=Burke|first2=Anne E.|date=December 21, 2010|chapter=Fertility control: contraception, sterilization, and abortion|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Sg5sXyiBvkC&amp;pg=PR232|editor1-last=Hurt|editor1-first=K.

All birth control methods meet opposition, especially [[religion|religious]] opposition, in some parts of the world. Opposition does not only target modern methods, but also 'traditional' ones : for example, the [[Quiverfull]] movement, a conservative Christian ideology, encourages the maximization of procreation, and opposes all forms of birth control, including [[natural family planning]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/arrows-war/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/protestant-group-advocates-leaving-fertility-in-gods-hands-no-birth-control&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
{{Further|Abortion law}}
According to a study by WHO and the Guttmacher Institute worldwide, 25 million [[unsafe abortion]]s (45% of all abortions) occurred every year between 2010 and 2014. 97% of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. By contrast, most abortions that take place in Western and Northern Europe and North America are safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/unsafe-abortions-worldwide/en/|title=Worldwide, an estimated 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states that: "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of  safe  abortion  and  post abortion  care,  forced  continuation  of pregnancy,  abuse  and mistreatment  of  women  and  girls  seeking  sexual  and  reproductive  health  information, goods and services, are forms of [[violence against women|gender based violence]] that, depending on   the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The same ''General Recommendation'' also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:
a) Provisions  that  allow,  tolerate  or  condone  forms  of  gender based  violence against women, including [...] legislation  that  criminalises  abortion".&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt;

An article from the World Health Organization calls safe, legal abortion a "[[fundamental right]] of women, irrespective of where they live" and [[unsafe abortion]] a "silent [[pandemic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|title=WHO: Unsafe Abortion - The Preventable Pandemic|accessdate=2010-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113104553/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|archivedate=2010-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article states "ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent [[public health|public-health]] and [[human-rights]] imperative." It also states "access to safe abortion improves [[women’s health]], and vice versa, as documented in [[Romania]] during the regime of President [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]" and "legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women’s health" citing that in some countries, such as India where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers. WHO’s Global Strategy on Reproductive Health, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2004, noted: “As a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the MDG on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets." &lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/hrpwork/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Preventing unsafe abortion |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), whose research concerns people's sexual and reproductive health and lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/ |title=HRP &amp;#124; World Health Organization |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four inter-related activities:&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;
* to collate, synthesize and generate scientifically sound evidence on unsafe abortion prevalence and practices;
* to develop improved technologies and implement interventions to make abortion safer;
* to translate evidence into norms, tools and guidelines;
* and to assist in the development of programmes and policies that reduce unsafe abortion and improve access to safe abortion and highquality postabortion care

The UN has estimated in 2017 that repealing anti-abortion laws would save the lives of nearly 50,000 women a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55141|title=UN News - Repealing anti-abortion laws would save the lives of nearly 50,000 women a year – UN experts|first=United Nations News Service|last=Section|date=27 September 2016|website=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsafe abortions take place primarily in countries where abortion is illegal, but also occur in countries where it is legal, but women cannot access it because of various reasons ([[conscientious objector]]s among doctors, high prices, lack of knowledge that abortion is legal). Indeed, there are countries where the law  is liberal, but in practice it is very difficult to have an abortion, due to most doctors being  conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|journal=The Guardian|first1=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|last1=Duncan|first2=Alberto|last2=Nardelli|first3=Delphine|last3=Robineau|date=11 March 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017|title=Doctors' Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia :: Balkan Insight|website=www.balkaninsight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that is some countries where abortion is legal it is ''[[de facto]]'' very difficult to have access to one is controversial; the UN in its 2017 resolution on ''Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence'' urged states to guarantee access to "safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/170|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safe and legal abortion services are often very difficult to access by women from rural areas or from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In 2008, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that "In fact, even where abortion is permitted by law, women often have severely limited access to safe abortion services because of lack of proper regulation, health services, or political will" and estimated that "Approximately 13 percent of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/women/abortion.html|title=Human Rights Watch: Women's Human Rights: Abortion|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maputo Protocol]], which was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], states at  Article 14 (Health and Reproductive Rights) that: "(2). States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to: [...] c) protect the reproductive rights of women by authorising medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/#14&lt;/ref&gt; The Maputo Protocol is the first international treaty to recognize abortion, under certain conditions, as a woman's human right.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/general-comment-two-rights-women/&lt;/ref&gt;

The  ''General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], on the right to life'', adopted by the [[Human Rights Committee]] in 2018, defines, for the first time ever, a human right to abortion - in certain circumstances (however these UN general comments are considered [[soft law]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/un-human-rights-treaty-bodies/general-comments-of-the-human-rights-committee-and-their-legitimacy/EF8328BB5B2B3EC932E44C45E192EB9B&lt;/ref&gt; and, as such, not legally binding).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although   States   parties   may  adopt measures designed to regulate voluntary terminations of pregnancy, such measures must not result in violation of the right to life of a pregnant woman or girl, or her other rights under the Covenant. Thus, restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion must not, inter alia, jeopardize their lives, subject them  to  physical  or  mental  pain  or  suffering  which violates  article  7,  discriminate  against them  or  arbitrarily  interfere  with  their  privacy.  ''States  parties  must  provide  safe,  legal  and effective  access  to  abortion where  the  life  and  health  of  the  pregnant  woman  or girl  is  at risk,  and  where  carrying a pregnancy to term  would cause  the  pregnant  woman  or  girl substantial  pain  or  suffering,  most  notably  where  the  pregnancy  is  the  result  of  rape  or incest or is not viable.'' [8] In addition, States parties may not regulate pregnancy or abortion in all other cases in a manner that runs contrary to their duty to ensure that women and girls do  not  have  to  undertake  unsafe  abortions,  and  they should  revise  their  abortion  laws accordingly.  [9]  For  example,  they  should  not  take measures  such  as  criminalizing pregnancies  by  unmarried  women  or  apply  criminal  sanctions  against  women  and  girls undergoing  abortion  [10]  or  against  medical  service providers  assisting  them  in  doing  so, since  taking  such  measures  compel  women  and  girls  to  resort  to  unsafe  abortion.

When negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], a group comprising members from 47 European countries, adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2008/04/18/index.html |title=Council of Europe Urges Member States to Decriminalize Abortion |publisher=Guttmacher.org |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term ‘reproductive health’ in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference.
For the European Union, where legislation on abortion is certainly less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council’s commitment to promote ‘reproductive health’ did not include the promotion of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): “Does the term ‘reproductive health’ include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?” - Antonione, Council: “No.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:

''“The term ‘reproductive health’ was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of ‘reproductive health’ to that given in the Programme of Action, '''which makes no reference to abortion'''.”''&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the U.S., it should be noted that, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the U.S. delegation, Vice President Al Gore, had stated for the record:

''“Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.”''&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years later, the position of the U.S. Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Ellen Sauerbrey, when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: ''“nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing  in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion”''.&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She added: ''“There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition”''.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Reuters, 28 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] states that "access to safe abortion is a matter of human rights, democracy and public health, and the denial of such access is a major cause of death and impairment, with significant costs to [international] development".&lt;ref name=IDS2009&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121649491/issue | title = Unsafe Abortion: A Development Issue | journal = Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Bulletin | volume = 39 | date = July 2009 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research highlights the inequities of access to safe abortion both globally and nationally and emphasises the importance of global and national movements for reform to address this. The shift by campaigners of reproductive rights from an issue-based agenda (the right to abortion), to safe, legal abortion not only as a human right, but bound up with democratic and citizenship rights, has been an important way of reframing the abortion debate and reproductive justice agenda.&lt;ref name=IDS2009 /&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] complicated the question even more through a landmark judgment (case of ''[[A. B. and C. v. Ireland]]''), in which it is stated that the denial of abortion for health and/or well-being reasons is an interference with an individuals right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], an interference which in some cases can be justified.

===Population control===

[[File:Ceausescu_Anul_Nou.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], Romanian communist leader, enacted one of the most infamous [[natalist]] policies of the 20th century]]

A desire to achieve certain population targets has resulted throughout history in severely abusive practices, in cases where governments ignored human rights and enacted aggressive demographic policies. In the 20th century, several authoritarian governments have sought either to increase or to decrease the births rates, often through forceful intervention. One of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies is that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people.  Ceaușescu's policy resulted in over 9,000 women who died due to [[illegal abortion]]s,&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;Kligman, Gail.

The irony of Ceaușescu's aggressive natalist policy was a generation that may not have been born would eventually lead the [[Romanian Revolution]] which would overthrow and have him [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu#Execution|executed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freakonomics|last=Levitt &amp; Dubner|first=Steven &amp; Stephen|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2005|isbn=9780141019017|location=80 Strand, London WC2R ORL England|page=107|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark opposition with Ceaușescu's natalist policy was China's [[one child policy]], in effect from 1978 to 2015, which included abuses such as [[forced abortion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-18435126 |title=China forced abortion photo sparks outrage - BBC News |journal=BBC News |date= 2012-06-14|accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has also been deemed responsible for the common practice of [[sex selective abortion]] which led to an imbalanced [[sex ratio]] in the country.&lt;ref name="Bulte, Heerink, &amp; Zhang, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulte, E., Heerink, N., &amp; Zhang, X.|title=China's one-child policy and 'the mystery of missing women': ethnic minorities and male-biased sex ratios.|journal=Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics|year=2011|volume=73|issue=1|pages=0305–9049|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00601.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s to 1980s, tension grew between women's health activists who advance women's reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach on the one hand, and population control advocates on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1984 UN World Population Conference in Mexico City population control policies came under attack from women's health advocates who argued that the policies' narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care, and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries. In the 1980s the HIV/AIDS epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries, leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility. The growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=4–5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, abortion opponents have begun to foment [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about reproductive rights advocates, accusing them of advancing a [[Racism|racist]] agenda of [[eugenics]], and of trying to reduce the [[African American]] birth rate in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Dewan&gt;{{Cite news | last = Dewan | first = Shaila | author-link = | title = To Court Blacks, Foes of Abortion Make Racial Case | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = February 26, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/us/27race.html | accessdate = 7 June 2010 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bride kidnapping]] or marriage by abduction, is the practice whereby a woman or girl is abducted for the purpose of a [[forced marriage]]. Bride kidnapping has been practiced historically in many parts of the world, and it continues to occur today in some places, especially in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]], in countries such as  Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Armenia, as well as in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kyrgyzstan-women-bride-kidnapping/one-in-five-girls-and-women-kidnapped-for-marriage-in-kyrgyzstan-study-idUSKBN1AH5GI | title=One in five girls and women kidnapped for marriage in Kyrgyzstan| journal=Reuters| date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-10913297 | title=Chechen stolen brides 'exorcised'| journal=BBC News| date=2010-08-10| last1=Ash| first1=Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/kidnapped-raped-married-the-extraordinary-rebellion-of-ethiopias-abducted-wives-1922263.html | title=Kidnapped.

Abducting of women may happen on an individual scale or on a mass scale. [[Raptio]] is a Latin term referring to the large-scale abduction of women, usually for marriage or sexual slavery, particularity during wartime.

[[Bride price]], also called bridewealth, is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family to the parents of the woman he marries. The practice of bride price sometimes leads to parents selling young daughters into marriage and to trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Human+rights+groups+ask+NWFP+Govt.+to+ban+%27bride+price%27+to+curb+women...-a0216984357 | title=Human rights groups ask NWFP Govt.

In [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of the ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', a sterilization program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | date=July 24, 2002 | accessdate=April 30, 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630062037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | archivedate=June 30, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous people]] (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented on July 28, 1995.

Forced sterilization in the United States was practiced starting with the 19th century. The United States during the [[Progressive era]], ca. 1890 to 1920, was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iredale | first1 = Rachel | year = 2000 | title = Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas C.

====Canada====
{{Main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}
Compulsory sterilization has been practiced historically in parts of Canada. Two Canadian provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]) performed compulsory sterilization programs in the 20th century with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system.  However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.

The [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir’s case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=November 9, 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kecFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C1039102 Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) named the law "one of the most draconian abortion laws in the world", and urged liberalization,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and [[Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad|Zeid bin Ra'ad]], the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated that he was "appalled that as a result of El Salvador’s absolute prohibition on abortion, women are being punished for apparent miscarriages and other obstetric emergencies, accused and convicted of having induced termination of pregnancy".&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|opponents of legalized abortion]] view the term "reproductive rights" as a [[euphemism]] to sway emotions in favor of abortion.  [[National Right to Life]] has referred to "reproductive rights" as a "fudge term" and "the code word for ''abortion'' rights."&lt;ref name=NRLC&gt;{{cite web|title=THE CHOICE "THAT DARE NOT SPEAK ITS NAME"|url=http://www.nrlc.org/news/2003/NRL02/pres.html|website=Nrlc.org|year=2003|accessdate=2017-08-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804230201/http://www.nrlc.org/news/2003/NRL02/pres.html|archivedate=2013-08-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, boys were asked the circumstances in which their first [[ejaculation]] occurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42765">The movement to start school later consists of efforts by health care professionals, sleep scientists, educators, economists, legislators, parents, students, and other concerned citizens to restore a later start to the school day. Based on a growing body of evidence that starting middle and high schools too early in the morning is unhealthy, counterproductive, and incompatible with adolescent sleep needs and patterns. During the second half of the 20th century, many public schools in the United States began shifting instructional time earlier than the more conventional bell time, thought{{By whom|date=March 2017}} to be about 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. Today it is common for American schools to begin the instructional day in the 7&amp;nbsp;a.m. hour and end about seven hours later, around 2&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = School Start 3Times for Middle School and High School Students — United States, 1738 School Year|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a1.htm?s_cid=mm6430a1_e|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most sleep research suggests that morning classes should begin no earlier than 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. for middle and high school students.&lt;ref name="Group peds.2014-1697"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = School Start Times for Adolescents|url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/08/19/peds.2014-1697|journal = Pediatrics|date = August 25, 2014|issn = 0031-4005|pmid = 25156998|pages = peds.2014-1697|doi = 10.1542/peds.2014-1697|language = en|first = Adolescent Sleep Working|last = Group|first2 = And Council on School Health|last2 = Committee on Adolescence|volume=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of a return to later school start times argue that sleep and school hours should be viewed as a public health issue, citing evidence linking early school start times to widespread [[sleep deprivation]] among teenagers as well as a wide array of acute and chronic physical, psychological, and educational problems. Not only do students consistently get significantly more sleep on school nights when their schools move to later start times, but later school hours have been consistently linked with improved school performance, reduced impulsiveness, and greater motivation, as well as with lower rates of depression, tardiness, truancy, and morning automobile accidents.&lt;ref name="Group peds.2014-1697"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = School Start Times for Middle School and High School Students — United States, 2011–12 School Year|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a1.htm?s_cid=mm6430a1_ev|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent (2011) studies suggest that early school start times disproportionately hurt economically disadvantaged students and may even negatively impact future earning potential of students, offsetting any financial savings to the school system attributed to earlier hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teensneedsleep.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/jacob-and-rockoff-organizing-schools-to-improve-student-achievement.pdf|title=Jacob &amp; Rockoff, "Organizing Schools to Improve Student Achievement: Start Times, Grade Configurations, and Teacher Assignments", Hamilton Project, Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, September 2011|website=Wordpress.com|access-date=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the early 1990s, the [[University of Minnesota]]'s landmark School Start Time Study tracked high school students from two Minneapolis-area districts – [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]], a suburban district that changed its opening hour from 7:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and the [[Minneapolis Public Schools]], which changed their opening from 7:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 8:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. Many positive benefits to students were found, including:
* Improved attendance and enrollment rates
* Less sleeping in class
* Less student-reported depression
* Fewer student visits to school counselors for behavioral and peer issues
* More even temperament at home

A longitudinal follow-up study of the Minneapolis Public Schools after five years revealed that these and other positive benefits had persisted. In 2014, a three-year project using data from more than 9,000 students attending eight high schools in three states, found that when schools switched to a start time of 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. or later, attendance, [[standardized test]] scores and academic performance improved, and tardiness, substance abuse, symptoms of depression, consumption of caffeinated drinks, and the rate of traffic accidents involving teen drivers decreased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/11299/162769/1/Impact%20of%20Later%20Start%20Time%20Final%20Report.pdf Kyla L.

Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement. Final Report. University of Minnesota, February 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s over 250 individual schools or districts in 45 states have delayed their start times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Minnesota |url=http://cehdvision2020.umn.edu/cehd-blog/later-high-school-start-times/ |title=Later high school start times benefit students│Education and Human Development |publisher=Cehdvision2020.umn.edu |access-date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wahlstrom K, Changing times: Findings from the first longitudinal study of later high school start times [[National Association of Secondary School Principals|NASSP]] Bull 2002;86(633):3-21, {{cite web |url=http://www.cehd.umn.edu/carei/publications/documents/Bulletin2002 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018012529/http://www.cehd.umn.edu/carei/publications/documents/Bulletin2002/ |archivedate=2014-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Success Stories." http://www.startschoollater.net/success-stories.html.&lt;/ref&gt; and scores of others are considering a change at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schoolstarttime.org/2011/06/12/schools-recently-delaying-start-times/ Schools Recently Delaying Start Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startschoollater.net/start-time-activity-by-state.html Start Time Activity By State]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite sporadic reform efforts on the part of educators, public health officials, legislators, and grassroots groups, however, most American middle and high schools still require students to begin instruction prior to 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.  Failure of efforts to delay start times over the years has primarily been due to pushback from community members who fear that a shift to later school hours will be prohibitively expensive and/or disrupt after-school sports and other extracurricular schedules, student jobs, daycare arrangement, teacher training, or time for homework&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = School Start Times for Middle School and High School Students — United States, 2011–12 School Year|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6430a1.htm?s_cid=mm6430a1_ev|website = www.CDC.gov|access-date = August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shifted Circadian Rhythms and Sleep Deprivation ==
Proponents of a return to later school hours cite abundant evidence that starting middle and high school before about 8:30 or 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. is incompatible with the [[biological clocks]] of teenagers and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;National Sleep Foundation. Backgrounder: Later School Start Times http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/hot-topics/backgrounder-later-school-start-times&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, a team led by [[Mary Carskadon]], PhD, of [[Brown University]] showed that changes in [[circadian]] biology during [[puberty]] drive a "sleep-phase delay," a shift in the sleep-wake patterns of adolescents that leads them to fall asleep and wake up later than younger and older people.

Schools ending early in the afternoon may also increase the risk of engaging in unhealthy, risky behaviors among sleep-deprived adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lr | first1 = McKnight-Eily | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = Relationships between hours of sleep and health-risk behaviors in US adolescent students | url = | journal = Prev Med | volume = 53 | issue = 4-5| pages = 271–273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sending children to school before sunrise also means they must wait or walk in dark, with low visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Sleep Loss and Accidents or Injury http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412558/Sleep%20Loss%20and%20Accidents%20or%20Injury&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on School Performance ==

Sleep deprivation can result in low motivation, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, slowed reaction times, lack of energy, frequent errors, forgetfulness, and impaired decision-making skills. Studies, many spearheaded by Kyla Wahlstrom and her research team at [[University of Minnesota]]'s Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement (CAREI), have tied these effects to early school start times, which, in turn, have repeatedly been linked to increased rates of tardiness, truancy, absenteeism, and dropping out.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan LA, The Effects of Sleep Deprivation on School Attendance and Dropout Rates, Sleeping Resources 2012 http://sleepingresources.com/sleep-deprivation-and-dropout-rates/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sleep Loss and Academic Achievement http://startschoollater.pbworks.com/w/page/60412535/Sleep%20Loss%20and%20Academic%20Achievement&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 a study using data from Wake County, North Carolina, showed that delaying middle school start times by one hour, from roughly 7:30 to 8:30, increases standardized test scores by at least two percentile points in math and one percentile point in reading. The effect was largest for students with below-average test scores, suggesting that later start times would narrow gaps in student achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = F | year = 2012 | title = Do schools begin too early? | url = http://educationnext.org/do-schools-begin-too-early/#.T6JrcBYJQKM.facebook | journal = Education Next | volume = 12 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equity Impact of Early School Hours ==

The impact of later start times on school performance—including reduced [[truancy]], [[absenteeism]], and increased overall academic achievement—is approximately double in economically disadvantaged students.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob BA, Rockoff JE, Organizing Schools to Improve Student Achievement: StartTimes, Grade Configurations, and
Teacher Assignments. [[The Hamilton Project]].

== Economic Impact of Early School Hours ==

A 2017 report by the [[RAND Corporation]] concluded that delaying school start times to 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. is a cost-effective, population-level strategy that would significantly impact public health and the U.S. economy, with benefits quickly outweighing any immediate costs. After just two years, the study conservatively projected a gain of $8.6 billion to the U.S. economy. After a decade, this gain would increase to $83 billion, and after 15 years to $140 billion, amounting to an average annual gain to the U.S. economy of $9.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2109.html|title=Starting School Later Would Boost the Economy|date=October 29, 2017|website=RAND.org|access-date=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier Hamilton Project Report published by the [[Brookings Institution]] concluded that starting class later can be an immediate and inexpensive way to boost health, safety, and achievement for all students. The authors, economists Brian A. Jacob and Jonah E. Rockoff, predicted that starting high schools one hour later, at about 9 a.m., would result in roughly $17,500 in increased future earnings per student in present value—a benefit:cost ratio of at least 9:1 even when changing schedules requires upfront investment to alter bus schedules and/or accommodate later after-school activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/9/organization%20jacob%20rockoff/092011_organize_jacob_rockoff_paper.pdf|title=Jacob BA, Rockoff JE, Organizing Schools to Improve Student Achievement: StartTimes, Grade Configurations, and Teacher Assignments.

The Fairfax County (Virginia) Public Schools ([[Fairfax County Public Schools|FCPS]]) Board of Education passed a resolution in April 2012 affirming their goal to find ways to start county high schools after 8 a.m. to allow students to get sufficient sleep, a resolution supported by the ''[[Washington Post]]'s'' editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Board |first=Editorial |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-04-18/opinions/35451986_1_high-schools-bell-schedule-school-buses |title=Fairfax revisits when high school classes should start - The Washington Post |publisher=Articles.washingtonpost.com |date=April 18, 2012 |access-date=2015-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213453/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-04-18/opinions/35451986_1_high-schools-bell-schedule-school-buses |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 FCPS contracted a team from the [[Children’s National Medical Center]]'s Division of Sleep Medicine to partner with Fairfax County students, parents, educators, administrators, and other community stakeholders to develop a plan to accomplish this task.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130624202115/http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/sleep-specialists-contracted-to-work-with-fairfax-county-schools-on-delaying-start-times/2013/06/16/85772934-d6cc-11e2-ab72-3f0d51ec1628_story.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; This effort led the Washington Post's editorial board to endorse later school start times as a "smarter way to start high schoolers' days" in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Board |first=Editorial |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-smarter-way-to-start-high-schoolers-days/2013/08/18/e2d24276-f49f-11e2-9434-60440856fadf_story.html |title=A smarter way to start high-schoolers’ days |publisher=The Washington Post |date=August 18, 2013 |access-date=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This editorial was tweeted by U.S. Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] along with the comment that starting high school later and letting teens sleep more was a "common sense" way "to improve student achievement that too few have implemented."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Arne (arneduncan).

In England, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s Sleep and Circadian Neurosciences Institute (SCNi) in 2015 began a study involving sleep education for teenagers in England and Wales. Professors [[Russell Foster (neuroscientist)|Russell Foster]] and [[Colin Espie]] with their project "Teensleep" will assess whether ten half-hour lessons in year 10 will improve academic performance and well-being. Taught by specially trained teachers, the lessons introduce scientific theory on the importance of sleep and the effects of sleep deprivation as well as techniques for stress management.  The study has been redesigned since it was originally announced; it was previously considerably more ambitious, including a later start time at about twenty-five schools, sleep education in others, both in some schools and neither in others. Students will be evaluated before and after the sleep education periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teensleep|url=http://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/research/sleep-circadian-neuroscience-institute/research-projects-4/teensleep|website=Sleep &amp; Circadian Neuroscience Institute|publisher=University of Oxford|access-date=21 April 2016|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grassroots Advocacy ==

Community groups have sporadically arisen in various school communities since the 1990s, sometimes prompting studies and reform proposals but often dying out as concerned, active families grew out of the system.&lt;ref name="McGeorgeDavid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snider, Terra Ziporyn Snider.

More recently, [[social media]] tools have allowed once isolated advocates to unite efforts and share resources. In fall 2011, an [[online petition]] effort galvanized a national non-profit organization, [[Start School Later]], a coalition of health professionals, sleep scientists, educators, parents, students, and other concerned citizens dedicated to increasing public awareness about the relationship between sleep and school hours and to ensuring school start times compatible with health, safety, education, and equity.

== Sleep-Friendly Schools and Districts ==
* [[Sudbury Valley School]] and other [[Sudbury School]]s – A school model with no set hours.  Students attend 5 or 6 hours during open hours (e.g. 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5 p.m.) depending only on the applicable laws for [[compulsory education]]. In some states in the United States, this statute is referred to as "Student Learning Time".

==As articles==

During the late 1970s a group of clinical epidemiologists at [[McMaster University]] including Dr. [[David Sackett]] prepared a series of articles to assist clinicians interpreting clinical research.  These articles, introducing the term "critical appraisal", appeared in the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' beginning in 1981.

In 1990 Dr. [[Gordon Guyatt]] introduced the term "evidence-based medicine" to stress the role of rigorous, systematic evidence from clinical research in conjunction with patients’ values and preferences in clinical decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Guyatt GH. Evidence-based medicine. ACP Journal Club. 1991;114:A-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of academic physicians subsequently formed the international Evidence-based Medicine Working Group and published a 1992 article announcing the "new paradigm" of evidence-based medicine.&lt;ref name=EBMWG1992&gt;{{cite journal|author=Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group|title=Evidence-Based Medicine: A New Approach to Teaching the Practice of Medicine|journal=JAMA|date=4 November 1992|volume=268|issue=17|pages=2420|doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490170092032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Evidence-based Medicine Working Group decided to build on the popular series in the ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'' by creating a more practical approach to applying the [[medical literature]] to clinical practice.  Championed by Dr. Drummond Rennie, an editor of the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', the result was the ''Users' Guides''.  The guides originally consisted of 25 topics, covered in a series of 32 articles published in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' between 1993 and 2000, describing approaches to different types of medical questions and the study designs that may answer them.&lt;ref name=jama/&gt;

==Books==

Dr. Guyatt and Dr. Rennie edited the articles and compiled them to form a book titled ''Users' Guides to the Medical Literature: A Manual for Evidence-Based Clinical Practice''.&lt;ref name=KleinbartWiliams2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleinbart|first1=Jennifer|last2=Williams |first2=Mark V.|title=Users' Guides to the Medical Literature|journal=Evidence-Based Medicine|date=March–April 2002|volume=7|issue=2|page=39|doi=10.1136/ebm.7.2.39|url=http://ebm.bmj.com/content/7/2/39.full|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The books teach a systematic approach to reading and applying the medical literature to individual patient care.  It focuses on three questions: 1. Whether new information is likely to be valid, 2. What the information says about patient care, and 3. How the information can be used.  To demonstrate the clinical relevance of the suggested approach, each section begins with a practical clinical scenario.  The chapter is then structured around identifying the best available evidence and applying the three key questions to the evidence, in the context of the clinical scenario.  Each chapter concludes with a resolution of the scenario.

Most of the book chapters are based on specific types of clinical questions, including questions of therapy, harm, diagnosis, and prognosis.  Other chapters deal with general skills that are important for all clinical questions, such as “Finding the Evidence”, “Summarizing the Evidence”, and “Moving From Evidence to Action”.

The ''Users' Guides''  come in two book versions: the ''Essentials'' introduces the concepts of evidence-based medicine (EBM), with which every practicing clinician should be familiar, while the ''Manual'' provides a more comprehensive, in-depth exploration of  EBM concepts for clinicians seeking a deeper understanding, or for those who wish to teach EBM.&lt;ref name=JMLA2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=Rebecca S.|title=Users' Guides to the Medical Literature: A Manual for Evidence-Based Clinical Practice|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association|date=October 2002|volume=90|issue=4|page=483|pmc=128970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Well-being''', '''wellbeing''', or '''wellness''' is the condition of an individual or group. A high level of well-being means that in some sense the individual's or group's condition is positive.

==Multiple factors==
According to Naci and Ioannidis,
{{quote|Wellness refers to diverse and interconnected dimensions of [[Physical fitness|physical]], mental, and social well-being that extend beyond the traditional definition of [[health]]. It includes choices and activities aimed at achieving physical vitality, mental alacrity, social satisfaction, a sense of accomplishment, and personal fulfillment.&lt;ref name=JAMA&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Huseyin Naci; John P. A. Ioannidis,|title=Evaluation of Wellness Determinants and Interventions by Citizen Scientists|journal=JAMA|date=June 11, 2015|doi=10.1001/jama.2015.6160|volume=314|pages=121|pmid=26068643}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Barry Kaufman]] sees [[well-being]] as influenced by [[happiness]] and meaning. https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-differences-between-happiness-and-meaning-in-life/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Philosophical approaches==

''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (''SEP'') entry for "well-being" identifies ways in which terms related to [[happiness]] differ. According to the ''SEP'', the terms "happy", "wellness", "satisfaction", "pleasure" or "well-being" can refer to a series of possible states:
* reflection on past events
* moment-to-moment evaluations of happiness
* by oneself, or with another person
* inferred from neuroimaging
* inferred from sensory input (pain, pleasure)
* inferred from cognitive structure (dysfunctional thinking, delusion)
* inferred from virtue (is prayer inherently instrumental to well-being?)
* duration of the experience
* effect on other factors (e.g., personal agency, power)
* repetitiveness (is pleasure derived from addiction incompatible with happiness?)
* objectivity (is "healthy eating" or "sex" always pleasurable?)
* whether the experience is altruistic or egoistic, 
*whether happiness reflects an emotional state (affect-based account)
* whether happiness reflects a cognitive judgement (life satisfaction account)

The affective and life-satisfaction views of happiness differ meaningfully when it comes to certain topics such as the relationship between income and happiness:

"''Surveying large numbers of Americans in one case, and what is claimed to be the first globally representative sample of humanity in the other, these studies found that income does indeed correlate substantially (.44 in the global sample), at all levels, with life satisfaction—strictly speaking, a “life evaluation” measure that asks respondents to rate their lives without saying whether they are satisfied. Yet the correlation of household income with the affect measures is far weaker: globally, .17 for positive affect, –.09 for negative affect; and in the United States, essentially zero above $75,000 (though quite strong at low income levels). If the results hold up, the upshot appears to be that income is pretty strongly related to life satisfaction, but weakly related to emotional well-being, at least above a certain threshold.''"&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.3 https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/#HedVerEmoSta&lt;/ref&gt;

There are weaknesses to the self-report method of elicitation for happiness: The lay conception of emotions (affect) is that they are discrete. It is typical, in everyday language, just as in research, to use research protocols that accept answers such as: "I am happy or I am sad, but not both simultaneously", or "I am 7 on a 1-10 scale of happiness (likert)".

==Scientific approaches==
Three subdisciplines in psychology are critical for the study of psychological well-being:&lt;ref name="ryff1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryff|first=Carol D.|title=Happiness is everything, or is it? Explorations on the meaning of psychological well-being.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1989|volume=57|issue=6|pages=1069–1081|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.6.1069}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Developmental psychology, in which psychological well-being may be analyzed in terms of a pattern of growth across the lifespan.
# Personality psychology, in which it is possible to apply Maslow's concept of self-actualization, Rogers' concept of the fully functioning person, Jung's concept of individuation, and Allport's concept of maturity to account for psychological well-being.&lt;ref name="ryff2"/&gt;
# Clinical psychology, in which it may be asserted that the absence of mental illness constitutes psychological well-being.

There are two approaches typically taken to understand psychological well-being:
# Distinguishing positive and negative effects, and defining optimal psychological well-being and happiness as a balance between the two.
# Emphasizes [[life satisfaction]] as the key indicator of psychological well-being.&lt;ref name="ryff2"&gt;Ryff, C. D., &amp; Keyes, C. M. (1995). The structure of psychological well-being revisited. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69(4), 719–727.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Guttman and Levy (1982) well-being is "...a special case of attitude".&lt;ref name="Guttman, Levy 1982 159"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guttman, Levy|first=Louis, Shlomit|title=On the definition and varieties of attitude and wellbeing|journal=Social Indicators Research|date=February 1982|volume=10|issue=2|pages=159–174|doi=10.1007/bf00302508}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach serves two purposes in the study of well-being: "developing and testing a [systematic] theory for the structure of [interrelationships] among varieties of well-being, and integration of well-being theory with the ongoing{{when|date=February 2015}} cumulative theory {{clarify|date=February 2015}} development in the fields of attitude of related research".&lt;ref name="Guttman, Levy 1982 159"/&gt;

==Models and components of wellbeing==

Many different models have developed.&lt;ref&gt; Measuring what matters: the role of well-being methods in development policy and practice, 2015, McGregor, Coulthard and Camfield, ODI, https://www.odi.org/publications/9657-measuring-matters-role-well-being-methods-development-policy-practice &lt;/ref&gt;

===Diener: tripartite model of subjective well-being===
{{Main|Tripartite model of subjective well-being}}

[[Ed Diener|Diener]]'s tripartite model of subjective well-being is one of the most comprehensive models of well-being in psychology. It was synthesized by Diener in 1984, positing "three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive affect, infrequent negative affect, and cognitive evaluations such as life satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Tov &amp; Diener (2013), ''Subjective Well-Being''. Research Collection School of Social Sciences. Paper 1395. {{cite web |url=http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/soss_research/1395 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605012602/http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/soss_research/1395/ |archivedate=2017-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive, affective and contextual factors contribute to subjective well-being.&lt;ref name="Galinha_Pais-Ribeiro_2011"&gt;Iolanda Costa Galinha &amp; José Luís Pais-Ribeiro (2011), ''Cognitive, affective and contextual predictors of subjective wellbeing''.  International Journal of Wellbeing, 2(1), 34–53. doi:10.5502/ijw.v2i1.3&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diener and Suh, subjective well-being is "...based on the idea that how each person thinks and feels about his or her life is important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diener, Suh|first=Ed, Eunkook|title=Culture and Subjective Well-being|year=2000|publisher=A Bradford Book|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being===
{{Main|Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being}}

[[Carol Ryff]]'s multidimensional model of psychological well-being postlated six factors which are key for well-being:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://livingmeanings.com/six-criteria-well-ryffs-multidimensional-model/ ''Carol Ryff’s Model of Psychological Well-being.

# [[Self-acceptance]]
# [[Personal growth]]
# [[Purpose in life]]
# Environmental mastery
# [[Autonomy]]
# Positive relations with others

===Corey Keyes: flourishing===
{{Main|Flourishing}}

According to [[Corey Keyes]], who collaborated with Carol Ryff, mental well-being has three components, namely emotional or subjective well-being (also called ''hedonic'' well-being),&lt;ref name="Robitschek"/&gt; psychological well-being, and social well-being (together also called ''eudaimonic'' well-being).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keyes|first=Corey L. M.|date=2002-01-01|title=The Mental Health Continuum: From Languishing to Flourishing in Life|jstor=3090197|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=43|issue=2|pages=207–222|doi=10.2307/3090197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional well-being concerns subjective aspects of well-being, in concreto, ''feeling'' well, whereas psychological and social well-being concerns skills, abilities, and psychological and social functioning.{{sfn|Joshanloo|2015}}

Keyes model of mental well-being has received extensive empirical support across cultures.{{sfn|Joshanloo|2015}}&lt;ref name="Robitschek"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robitschek|first=Christine|last2=Keyes|first2=Corey L.

===Seligman: positive psychology===
{{Main|Positive psychology}}

Well-being is a central concept in [[positive psychology]]. Positive psychology is concerned with [[eudaimonia]], "the good life", reflection about what holds the greatest value in life – the factors that contribute the most to a well-lived and fulfilling life. While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience "the good life". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to "the good life" as "using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic [[happiness]] and abundant gratification".&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2009). Authentic Happiness. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====PERMA-theory====
[[File:Flock of Seagulls (eschipul).jpg|thumb|right|Simple exercise, such as running, is cited as key to feeling happy.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,197466,00.html Best Benefit of Exercise?

In ''Flourish'' (2011) Seligman argued that "meaningful life" can be considered as 3 different categories. The resulting acronym is [[Martin Seligman#PERMA|PERMA]]: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and purpose, and Accomplishments. It is a mnemonic for the five elements of Martin Seligman's well-being theory:&lt;ref name="Sze"&gt;David Sze (2015), [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sze/the-father-of-positive-ps_b_7600226.html ''The Father of Positive Psychology and His Two Theories of Happiness''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625051421/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-sze/the-father-of-positive-ps_b_7600226.html |date=2017-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_2.html |title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011— Page 2 |publisher=Edge.org |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210015906/http://edge.org/q2011/q11_2.html |archivedate=2011-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Positive emotions'' include a wide range of feelings, not just happiness and joy.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 2011"&gt;Seligman, M. E. P. (2011). Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being. New York: Free Press. Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; Included are emotions like excitement, satisfaction, pride and awe, amongst others. These emotions are frequently seen as connected to positive outcomes, such as longer life and healthier social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/martin-seligman-positive-psychology/|title=The Pursuit of Happiness|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109130710/http://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/martin-seligman-positive-psychology/|archivedate=2015-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Engagement'' refers to involvement in activities that draws and builds upon one's interests. [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] explains true engagement as [[Flow (psychology)|flow]], a feeling of intensity that leads to a sense of ecstasy and clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en|title=Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi TED talk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208203018/http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow?language=en|archivedate=2014-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task being done needs to call upon higher skill and be a bit difficult and challenging yet still possible. Engagement involves passion for and concentration on the task at hand and is assessed subjectively as to whether the person engaged was completely absorbed, losing self-consciousness.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 2011"/&gt;
* ''Relationships'' are all important in fueling positive emotions, whether they are work-related, familial, romantic, or platonic. As [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Dr. Christopher Peterson]] puts it simply, "Other people matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-beauty-in-the-beast/201210/other-people-matter|title=Other People Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans receive, share, and spread positivity to others through relationships.  They are important not only in bad times, but good times as well. In fact, relationships can be strengthened by reacting to one another positively. It is typical that most positive things take place in the presence of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2009/06/24/using-positive-psychology-in-your-relationships|title=Using Positive Psychology in Your Relationships|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140206061426/http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2009/06/24/using-positive-psychology-in-your-relationships|archivedate=2014-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Meaning'' is also known as purpose, and prompts the question of "why". Discovering and figuring out a clear "why" puts everything into context from work to relationships to other parts of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-murphy/why-do-you-do-what-you-do_b_3873650.html|title=Why do You do What You Do?|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013074415/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-murphy/why-do-you-do-what-you-do_b_3873650.html|archivedate=2014-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding meaning is learning that there is something greater than one's self. Despite potential challenges, working with meaning drives people to continue striving for a desirable goal.
* ''Accomplishments'' are the pursuit of success and mastery.&lt;ref name="Seligman, M. E. P. 2011"/&gt; Unlike the other parts of PERMA, they are sometimes pursued even when accomplishments do not result in positive emotions, meaning, or relationships.  That being noted, accomplishments can activate the other elements of PERMA, such as pride, under positive emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awesomeculture.com/2011/09/13/the-science-of-a-happy-startup/|title=The Science of a Happy Startup|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141206020015/http://awesomeculture.com/2011/09/13/the-science-of-a-happy-startup/|archivedate=2014-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accomplishments can be individual or community-based, fun- or work-based.

===UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) definition===
The UK [[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] defines wellbeing "''as having 10 broad dimensions which have been shown to matter most to people in the UK as identified through a national debate. The dimensions are: 
*''the natural environment,'' 
*''personal well-being,'' 
*''our relationships,'' 
*''health,'' 
*''what we do,'' 
*''where we live,'' 
*''personal finance,'' 
*''the economy,'' 
*''education and skills, and'' 
*''governance.'' 
''Personal wellbeing is a particularly important dimension which we define as how satisfied we are with our lives, our sense that what we do in life is worthwhile, our day to day emotional experiences (happiness and anxiety) and our wider mental wellbeing.''"&lt;ref&gt;https://whatworkswellbeing.org/about/what-is-wellbeing/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nagel: Experience as a good in itself===
[[Thomas Nagel]] has said that "''There are elements [of living] which, if added to one's experience, make life better; there are other elements which if added to one's experience, make life worse. But what remains when these are set aside is not merely neutral: it is emphatically positive.''"&lt;ref&gt;Further; "''Therefore life is worth living even when the bad elements of experience are plentiful, and the good ones too meager to outweigh the bad ones on their own. The additional positive weight is supplied by experience itself, rather than by any of its consequences.''" 'Death' (essay), Thomas Nagel, CUP, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/the-vise-side-of-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global studies==

[[File:Eudaimonic well-being Joshanloo.jpg|thumb|Eudaimonic well-being in 166 nations based on Gallup World Poll data]]

Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligmann covers a broad range of levels and topics, including "the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life."{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} The World Happiness Report series provide annual updates on the global status of [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Happiness Report |url=http://worldhappiness.report/ |website=World Happiness Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; A global study using data from 166 nations, provided a country ranking of psycho-social well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter study showed that subjective well-being and psycho-social well-being (i.e. [[eudaimonia]]) measures capture distinct constructs and are both needed for a comprehensive understanding of mental well-being.

''Example:'' A study was conducted to examine job resources, work engagement and Finnish dairy farmers’ preferences concerning methods to enhance overall well-being while working on farms.  The results indicate that the family, working with cattle, healthy farm animals, a reasonable workload, and a sustainable farm economy have the capacity to create positive impacts on well-being among dairy farmers. Well-being on farms is a part of sustainable food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kallioniemi|first=Marja K.|last2=Kaseva|first2=Janne|last3=Lunner Kolstrup|first3=Christina|last4=Simola|first4=Ahti|last5=Kymäläinen|first5=Hanna-Riitta|date=2018-07-03|title=Job Resources and Work Engagement among Finnish Dairy Farmers|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2018.1470047|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=249–261|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1470047|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Health Imaging, Telemedicine and Informatics Alliance''' (WHITIA) is a non-profit [[global health]] technology and [[social venture]] established in 2006 by affiliates of [[Northwestern University]] near [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name="McCByDesign"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://magazine.mccormick.northwestern.edu/FA2007/Xray.html | title = McCormick students and faculty tackle health care challenge in the developing world  | publisher= Robert R.

WHITIA's vision is to facilitate the deployment of thousands of digital medical imaging systems worldwide, providing one billion people with access to diagnostic imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhealthimaging.org/ |title=Welcome to WHITIA &amp;#124; Homepage |publisher=Worldhealthimaging.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHITIA was formerly known as the World Health Imaging Alliance (WHIA) until it formally expanded its scope in June 2009.

WHITIA's first formal public launch was in April 2009 at the [[HIMSS|Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS)]] Annual Conference &amp; Exhibition in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. WHITIA announced strategic partners including [[SEDECAL]], [[Carestream Health]] and [[Merge Healthcare]], receiving extensive coverage in [[Health IT]] magazines and publications.&lt;ref name="HIMSS09"&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS111037+06-Apr-2009+BW20090406 | title = Not-for-Profit Has a Vision to Help a Billion People | publisher= Reuters | date=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoofinance1"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Merge-Healthcare-Commits-1-bw-14855801.html?x=1&amp;.v=1 | title = World Health Imaging Alliance Poised to Bring Imaging Diagnostics and Data to the Developing World | publisher= Yahoo Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 Annual  Conference of the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], WHITIA announced its partnership with [[Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine|SIIM]], which will allow both organizations to collaborate on specific initiatives.&lt;ref name="SIIM09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20090605005136/en | title = World Health Imaging Alliance (WHIA) Announces Support From The Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) | publisher= Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IE09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.imagingeconomics.com/news/2009-06-17_01.asp | title = World Health Imaging Alliance poised to bring imaging diagnostics and data to the developing world | publisher= Imaging Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHITIA was recently ranked #15 of the top 25 most influential people, institutions, and organizations in the radiology industry.&lt;ref name="rt-image"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-10-22 | url = http://www.rt-image.com/25_Most_Influential_in_Radiology_Recognizing_the_movers_and_shakers_in_the_radio/content=9004J05E48B6A084409698724488B0441 | title = 25 Most Influential in Radiology | publisher= rt Image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2009 [[Radiological Society of North America|RSNA]] Annual Meeting, WHITIA launched, '''Remi-d''', a remote-operated screening X-ray system for use in the developing world. Its strengths in these areas stem from the higher burden of [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV) and [[Tuberculosis]] (TB) co-infection, high incidences of [[Coalworker's pneumoconiosis|Black Lung disease]], or outbreaks of other infectious [[respiratory diseases]]. The teleradiology and remote-controlled features of Remi-d allow resource-limited areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America and Southeast Asia, where [[Radiologist]]s and [[Radiographer]]s are in short supply to have a functioning X-ray service.&lt;ref name="RSNA09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | url = http://www.news-medical.net/news/20091130/WHITIA-launches-digital-medical-X-ray-device-for-screening-infectious-diseases-in-developing-countries.aspx | title = WHITIA launches digital medical X-ray device for screening infectious diseases in developing countries | publisher= THE MEDICAL NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHITIA currently has [[Pilot (experiment)|pilot]] [[System integration|integrated]] [[digital X-ray]] sites in [[South Africa]] and [[Guatemala]] at established [[clinics]] in need and is expanding to new qualified sites in [[partnership]] with [[NGOs]] such as [[Rotary International]] while cooperating with the [[local government|local]] and [[Central government|national governments]].&lt;ref name="HTW09"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | url = http://www.healthtechwire.com/The-Industry-s-News-unb.146+M5a262949a06.0.html | title = SIIM to Support World Health Imaging Alliance | publisher= HealthTech Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guatemala clinics ==
The Guatemala pilot sites in urban [[Guatemala City]] and [[rural]] [[Río Hondo, Zacapa|Río Hondo]] provide essential healthcare technology to thousands of people in the communities served. They are designed to be models for the wider expansion of the WHITIA network throughout the clinics in need in urban and rural Guatemala. The system's specific design for Guatemala City is an integration of some of WHITIA's partners' strengths and generosity:

* [[SEDECAL]] provides the X-ray generator and controls
* [[Carestream Health]] donates the [[Photostimulated luminescence|computed radiography]] (CR) digital scanner and plates
* [[Kane X-ray]] donates personnel to perform installation and set up of the CR and [[Picture archiving and communication system|PACS]]

This project was largely funded by several US and Guatemalan [[Rotary International|Rotary clubs]] along with the key resource support of the Guatemalan municipal and national governments.&lt;ref name="GUATE11"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2011-01-09 | url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110104006502/en/WHITIA-Announces-Completion-Digital-X-ray-Pilot-Sites | title = WHITIA Announces the Completion of Digital X-ray Pilot Sites in Urban and Rural Guatemala | publisher= Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
