In English [[criminal law]], '''attainder''' or '''attinctura''' was the metaphorical "stain" or "corruption of blood" which arose from being condemned for a serious [[capital crime]] ([[felony]] or [[treason]]). It entailed losing not only one's life, property and [[hereditary titles]], but typically also the right to pass them on to one's [[heirs]]. Both men and women condemned of capital crimes could be attainted.

'''Attainder by confession''' resulted from a guilty plea at the bar before judges or before the [[coroner]] in [[sanctuary]]. '''Attainder by verdict''' resulted from [[Jury trial|conviction by jury]]. '''Attainder by process''' resulted from a legislative act [[outlaw]]ing a fugitive. The last form is obsolete in England (and prohibited in the United States), and the other forms have been [[Attainder#Corruption of blood|abolished]].

==Attainders of English noblemen and women in the Middle Ages and Renaissance==
[[File:Richard of York Talbot Shrewsbury Book.jpeg|thumb|[[Richard of York]], attainted by [[Margaret of Anjou]]]]
Medieval and Renaissance English monarchs used acts of attainder to deprive nobles of their lands and often their lives. Once attainted, the descendants of the noble could no longer inherit his lands or income. Attainder essentially amounted to the legal death of the attainted's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J. R. Landera1 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=52879FB5697304D27E716E4E892366E0.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3334696 |title=Cambridge Journals Online - Abstract |publisher=Journals.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monarchs typically used attainders against political enemies and those who posed potential threats to the king's position and security. The attainder eliminated any advantage the noble would have in a court of law; nobles were exempt from many of the techniques used to try [[commoners]], including [[torture]].  Likewise, in many cases of attainder, the king could coerce the parliament into approving the attainder and there would be a lower or non-existent burden of proof (evidence) than there would be in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/attainder.htm |title=Attainder, Being Attainted, Attainder Reversed - Luminarium Encyclopedia |publisher=Luminarium.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Tudors, most rulers reversed their attainders in return for promises of loyalty. For example, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] reversed all 21 attainders, [[Edward IV]] 86 of 120, and [[Richard III]] 99 of 100.&lt;ref name="sommerville"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20HVII%20policy.htm |title=Domestic and foreign policy of Henry VII |publisher=History.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053718/http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20HVII%20policy.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this changed with [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], as described below.

Regnants who used attainder include:
* [[Margaret of Anjou]]: her attainder of [[Richard of York]] compelled him to invade England and attempt to seize the throne after the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]], which led to the penultimate phases of the [[War of the Roses]].
* [[Edward IV of England]]: used attainder after killing his brother, [[George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence]] for high treason.  This allowed [[Richard III of England]] to seize the throne when he claimed that Edward IV's sons were [[illegitimate]].  
* [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]: initially attainted men after he ascended the throne.&lt;ref name="sommerville"/&gt; He used the threat of attainder as a means to keep the few nobles who survived the [[War of the Roses]] in line. Often, however, he would penalize them with exorbitant fees and fines, or force them to have bonds which would be forfeit unless they exhibited good behaviour (his goal was to reduce the number of nobles with private armies of [[Bastard feudalism|retainers]].) Henry VII attainted 138 men, of whom he reversed only 46 attainders, and some of these were conditional.
* [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]: compelled parliament to attaint many nobles during his lifetime, including magnates with major land holdings, and any magnates whom he came to mistrust. Examples include:
** [[Anne Boleyn]]: Before her execution, she was stripped of her title, and her marriage was [[annulment|annulled]].
** [[Catherine Howard]]: Henry VIII had an Act of Attainder passed against Catherine Howard, which made it [[Royal Assent by Commission Act 1541|treason]] for a woman with an [[Virginity|unchaste]] reputation to marry the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Mahoney |url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/tudor_4.htm |title=Kings and Queens of England - Henry VIII |publisher=English Monarchs |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Edward Stafford]], Duke of Buckingham, one of the wealthiest magnates in England, whom Henry had executed on flimsy charges in 1521.&lt;ref name="sommerville"/&gt;
** [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]]: One of the last surviving noble Plantagenets of senior line.
** [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]]: The poet son of [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]].
* [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]: subsequent to the failed [[impeachment]] of his former [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Sir Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], was attainted during the political crisis of 1640 -1641. The Bill of Attainder, having passed  the depleted [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] and [[House of Lords]], was enacted by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] as a concession to his political opponents. During his reign, the [[Long Parliament]] of 1641 passed an Act of Attainder against [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] who was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] in 1645.

* [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]: Although deceased by the time of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Thomas Pride]] were served with a Bill of Attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]]).

* [[William III of England|William III]]: 
** [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James, III and VIII, the Old Pretender]], 1702&lt;ref name="jamesiiiattainder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol7/p739 |title=William III, 1701: An Act for the Attainder of the pretended Prince of Wales of High Treason |publisher=British History Online |date= |accessdate=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George II of Great Britain]], following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]:
**[[Attainder of Earl of Kellie and others Act 1746]]

Once attainted, nobles were considered commoners, and as such, could be subjected to the same treatments, including [[torture]] and methods of [[execution]]. For example, commoners could be [[burned at the stake]], whereas nobles could not.

Often, nobles would refer to the act of being attainted (and then executed) as the person's "destruction".

==Passage in Parliament==
In the [[Westminster system]], a [[bill of attainder]] is a bill passed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to attaint persons who are accused of [[high treason]], or, in rare cases, a lesser crime.  A person attainted need not have been convicted of treason in a court of law; in fact, the attainder process is a method of declaring a person a [[fugitive]].

A rumour circulated that a bill of attainder against [[Thomas Jefferson]] occurred in 1774 because of his authorship of ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Meacham: ''Thomas Jefferson The Art of Power''&lt;/ref&gt;

A bill of attainder was last passed in Britain in 1798, against [[Lord Edward FitzGerald]]. Attainders by confession, verdict and process were abolished in the United Kingdom by the [[Forfeiture Act 1870]] (33 &amp; 34 Vict., c.23).

Section 9 of [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] provides that no bill of attainder or [[ex post facto law]] shall be passed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 9, ¶ 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The following section forbids states from passing them.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 10, ¶ 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption of blood==
'''Corruption of blood''' is one of the consequences of attainder. The descendants of an attainted person could not inherit either from the attainted person (whose property had been forfeited by the attainder) or from their other relatives through him. For example, if a person is executed for a crime leaving innocent children, the property of the criminal is forfeited to the crown and will not pass to the children. If the criminal's innocent father subsequently dies, the property inherited by the criminal from the father cannot be inherited by the criminal's children either: it will be distributed among other family members.{{citation needed|date = January 2014}}

The [[United States Constitution]] prohibits corruption of blood as a punishment for treason.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 3, ¶ 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[England and Wales]] corruption of blood has been [[Corruption of Blood Act 1814|abolished]].

== Examples of cases where a person's property was subject to attainder ==

* [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl of Strafford]]
* [[John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln]]
* [[Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven]]
* [[Parker Wickham]]
* [[Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel]]
* [[Thomas Cromwell]]
* [[Earl of Perth]]
* [[Viscount Strathallan]]

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2018}}
The term ''basic law'' is used in some places as an alternative to "[[constitution]]", implying it is a ''temporary but necessary measure'' without formal enactment of constitution. A basic law is either a [[codified constitution]], or in countries with [[uncodified constitution]]s, a law given to have constitution powers and effect. The name is usually used to imply an interim or transitory nature, or avoid attempting a claim to being "the highest law", often for religious reasons. In [[West Germany]] the term "[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]]" (''Grundgesetz'') was used to indicate that the Basic Law was provisional until the ultimate [[reunification of Germany]]. But in 1990 no new constitution was adopted and instead the Basic Law was adopted throughout the entire German territory. Basic law is entrenched in that it overrides ordinary 'statute law' passed by the legislature.

The [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China]], namely [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have basic laws as their constitutional documents. The basic laws are the highest authority, respectively, in the territories, while the rights of amendment and interpretation rest with the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China]].

The '''''Canada Gazette''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Gazette du Canada'''}}) is the official newspaper of the [[Government of Canada]].&lt;ref name=Collections&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Carole|title=A Glance at the Canada Gazette: Past, Present and Future|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/gazette-du-canada/035001-2000-e.html|work=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published on October 2, 1841.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deavy|first=Betty|author2=Gauld, Norma|title=The Canada Gazette|journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review|date=1994|volume=17|issue=2|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=149&amp;art=1005|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While originally it published all acts of the [[Parliament of Canada]], it later also published treaties, hearing and tribunals, proclamations and regulations, and various other official notices as required.&lt;ref name=Collections /&gt;  At one time it contained information on bankruptcies.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt; It has been administered by [[Public Works and Government Services Canada]] and the [[Queen's Printer]] since 1841. The ''Gazette'' is most often read to find new acts, regulations and proclamations.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

==Legal status==
While not always widely read by the public, publication in the ''Gazette'' is considered official notice to all Canadians. After a regulation has been approved by the [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Privy Council Office]] and then the [[Cabinet of Canada]], the regulation is published in the ''Gazette''.&lt;ref name="Can Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernhardt|first=Peter|title=Understanding the Regulation Making Process|url=http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=245&amp;param=82|work=Canadian Parliamentary Review|accessdate=7 February 2014|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a regulation has not been published in the ''Gazette'', a person cannot be convicted of the offence.&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title=Statutory Instruments Act|year=1985|section=11|subsection=2|abbr=RSO|chapter=S-22|link=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-22/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's [[provinces of Canada|provinces]] all have their own equivalents of the ''Gazette''.

==Publishing==
From inception in 1841 until 1998, the ''Gazette'' was published in print. From 1998 until 1 April 2014, it was published in print and online, with the online version having the same official status as the printed version starting in 2003.&lt;ref name=Collections /&gt; From 1 April 2014 onwards, it will only be published online to satisfy a Government of Canada requirement to make "electronic publishing its new standard for all documents".&lt;ref name="online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazette.gc.ca/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-2014-02-28-eng.html|title=Discontinuance of the Printed Copy of the Canada Gazette — Reminder|publisher=Canada Gazette Directorate|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=13 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303200747/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/news-nouvelles/news-nouvelles-2014-02-28-eng.html|archivedate=3 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/media/nr-cp/2013/0705-eng.asp|title=Government of Canada moves to e-printing|publisher=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat|date=5 July 2013|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Structurally, the ''Gazette'' is published in three parts:

===Part I===
Part I is published each Saturday. It contains public notices, official appointments and proposed regulations, as well as miscellaneous notices from the private sector that are required to be published by federal statute or by regulations. The proposed regulations are published in Part I as a way for the public to comment on them. Once the regulations are pre-published, the department that sponsored the legislation collects public comments to allow for any changes to be made to the regulation.&lt;ref name="Can Review" /&gt; Recently, Notices of Vacancies for senior positions in Government are published here too.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

===Part II===
Part II is published every second Wednesday and it contains all regulations that have been enacted as well as statutory instruments and other documents, such as orders in council, orders and proclamations. It has a consolidated index of regulations dating since January 1, 1955.

===Part III===
Part III is published with the text of any new laws immediately after they have received [[Royal Assent]] and was first published in 1974.  Starting from January 1998 all  publications other than Part III are available in [[HTML]] and are not official.  From  April 1, 2003, the [[PDF]] version is an official version, as it is marked up from the same file as the printed version. It also contains a list of the proclamations of Canada and orders in council relating to the coming into force of federal acts.

==Exemptions==
Certain types of regulations do not need to be published in the ''Gazette''. These include regulations that affect only a limited number of people, their publication would be contrary to national defense or international relations, or if their publication would violate personal privacy, such as notices of paroles and pardons.&lt;ref name="The Canada Gazette" /&gt;

In the Philippines, a certificate of public convenience (CPC) is required for private provision of public services for which no franchise, either municipal or legislative, is required by law, such as a [[common carrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batasnatin.com/law-library/mercantile-law/transportation-laws/2218-certificate-of-public-convenience-cpc.html|title=What is a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC)?|work= Philippine Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The first [[U.S. state]] statutes for certificate of public convenience (CPCN) were issued in 1870, and the [[U.S. Congress]] included a certification provision in [[U.S. federal law]] in the [[Transportation Act of 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/1121802?sid=21105515254613&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4|title=Origins of the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity: Developments in the States, 1870 - 1920|last=Jones|first=William K.|journal=[[Columbia Law Review]]|volume=79|number=3|pages=426–516|doi=10.2307/1121802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of industries requiring a CPCN from a U.S. state include the provision of [[telecommunications]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/C78F4BE884AA2FA885257687006F3964?OpenDocument|title=CPCN: Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity|publisher=[[New York State Public Service Commission]]|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; transportation of [[natural gas]] in [[Alaska]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/720a|title=15 U.S. Code § 720a - Issuance of certificate of public convenience and necessity|work=[[Legal Information Institute]]|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a range of public services in [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=022000050K8-406|title= Illinois Compiled Statutes: Sec. 8-406.

In law and government, '''de jure''' ({{IPAc-en|d|eɪ|_|ˈ|dʒ|ʊər|i|,_|d|i|-}}; {{lang-la|de iure|lit=in law}} {{IPA-la|deː juːre}}) describes practices that are legally recognised, whether or not the practice exist in reality.&lt;ref name=Dictionary.cm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Dictionary.com/browse/de-jure|title=de jure|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC.|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, {{no wrap|''[[de facto]]''}} ("in fact" or "in practice") describes situations that exist in reality, even if not legally recognised.&lt;ref name="OxfordDF2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of 'de facto' adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|url=http://www.OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com/definition/english/de-facto_2|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are often used to contrast different scenarios: for a colloquial example, "I know that, de jure, this is supposed to be a parking lot, but now that the flood has left four feet of water here, it's a de facto swimming pool".&lt;ref name="WashULaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal English: "De Facture/De Jure"|url=https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/legal-english-de-factode-jure/|publisher=Washington University School of Law|website=@WashULaw|date=28 December 2012|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To further explain, even if the signs around the flooded parking lot say "Parking Lot" (the signs effectively being the "law" determining what it is) it is "in fact" a swimming pool (with the water, the current practical circumstances, determining what it is).

==Examples==
It is possible to have multiple simultaneous conflicting (''de jure'') legalities, possibly none of which is in force (''de facto'').  After seizing power in 1526, [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] made his brother, [[Umar Din]], the lawful (''de jure'') [[Sultan]] of [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]].  Ahmad, however, was in practice (''de facto'') the actual Sultan, and his brother was a figurehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aḥmad Grāñ - Somalian Muslim leader|url=https://www.Britannica.com/biography/Ahmad-Gran|work=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1805 and 1914, the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|ruling dynasty]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]] ruled as ''de jure'' [[viceroy]]s of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but acted as ''de facto'' independent rulers who maintained a [[polite fiction]] of Ottoman [[suzerainty]].  However, from about 1882, the rulers had only ''de jure'' rule over Egypt, as it had by then become a British [[puppet state]].  Thus, Egypt was by Ottoman law ''de jure'' a province of the Ottoman Empire, but ''de facto'' was part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cfJC1zLvBhQC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijoK6thuzWAhXJExoKHTYvBTE4ChDoAQgnMAA&amp;q=veiled%20protectorate|title=The British in Egypt: Community, Crime and Crises 1882-1922|last=Mak|first=Lanver|date=2012-03-15|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848857094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Law of the United States|American law]], particularly after ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), the difference between ''de facto'' segregation (segregation that existed because of the voluntary associations and neighborhoods) and ''de jure'' segregation (segregation that existed because of local laws that mandated the segregation) became important distinctions for court-mandated remedial purposes.&lt;ref name="AndersonByrne2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Anderson|author2=Dara N.

A liability insurance company's '''duty to settle''' is defined as an implied obligation to by the insurer to a policyholder and to a claimant to attempt "in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{sm|Cal. Ins. Code}} [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ins&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=790-790.15 § 790.03(h)(5)].&lt;/ref&gt; To the surprise of many, a typical liability insurance policy makes no express contractual promise to settle.&lt;ref&gt;Typical language is: "We may, at our discretion, investigate any ‘occurrence' and settle any claim or 'suit' that may result." {{sm|Peter J. Kalis et al., Policyholder's Guide to the Law of Insurance Coverage}} F-15 (Aspen Publishers Online 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In California, "an insurer, who wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13974532515441078311&amp;q=comunale&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Comunale v. Traders &amp; Gen. Ins. Co.], 50 Cal. 2d 654, 659–61 (1958) (ellipses omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; A rationale for this duty is that "[w]hen an offer is made to settle a claim in excess of policy limits for an amount within policy limits, a genuine and immediate conflict of interest arises between carrier and assured."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11597490784555170138&amp;q=merritt+reserve&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Merritt v. Reserve Ins. Co.], 34 Cal. App. 3d 858, 870 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; "An insurer who denies coverage does so at its own risk. Such factors as a belief that the policy does not provide coverage, should not affect a decision as to whether the settlement offer in question is a reasonable one."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12701738578718788769&amp;q=johansen+cal&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Johansen v. California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau], 15 Cal. 3d 9, 15-16 (1975) (citations and ellipses omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; "It is the duty of the insurer to keep the insured informed of settlement offers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12734399634269452649&amp;q=kinder+western&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Kinder v. Western Pioneer Ins. Co.], 231 Cal. App. 2d 894, 901 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; "[A]n insurer potentially can be liable for unreasonably coercing an insured to contribute to a settlement fund."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14859133972975123124&amp;q=aguerre&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,5 Aguerre, Inc. v. American Guar. &amp; Liab. Ins. Co.], 59 Cal. App. 4th 6, 15 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

An insurer may not "discriminate in its claims settlement practices based upon" certain protected classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{sm|Cal. Code Regs}} [http://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/130-laws-regs-hearings/05-CCR/fair-claims-regs.cfm § 2695.7].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">'''Expert determination''' is a historically accepted form of [[dispute resolution]] invoked when there is not a ''formulated dispute'' in which the parties have defined positions that need to be subjected to [[arbitration]], but rather both parties are in agreement that there is a need for an evaluation. Expert determination is a procedure by which the parties to a dispute appoint an independent and neutral expert to determine the dispute in private. Like arbitration, it allows trade secrets and other sensitive information to be kept out of the public domain. The expert will be a person with specialist or technical knowledge relevant to the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.bwbllp.com/Files/Publications/GuideToExpertDetermination.pdf Bates Wells &amp; Braithewaite's Guide to Expert Determination Advocates for International Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice itself is well established where complex legal institutions either have not developed, or are unavailable, such as tribal societies and criminal organisations.

In the context of modern jurisprudence, the word "expert" appears first in ''Bottomley v Ambler'' 1878 38 LT 545, this was however used ambiguously also referring to arbitrators having the qualification of expert. The first mention that distinguishes specifically against the practise of arbitration, and introduces the formula "''as an expert and not as an arbitrator''" was in ''Dean v. Prince'' 1953 Ch. 590 at 591 (misquoted) and subsequently on appeal in the year 1954 1 Ch. 409 at 415. In [[Contract Law]], the [[party (law)|parties]] are free to include a [[forum selection clause]] appointing a [[special referee]] to resolve specialised but disputed factual issues between them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9901">'''Free warren'''&amp;mdash;often simply ''warren''&amp;mdash;refers to a type of [[Exclusive right|franchise]] or [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] conveyed by a [[sovereign]] in [[medieval]] [[England]] to an English subject, promising to hold them harmless for killing [[game (hunting)|game]] of certain species within a stipulated area, usually a [[Woodland|wood]] or small [[forest]].  The sovereign involved might be either the [[monarch]] or a [[Marcher Lords|marcher lord]].

==Law==
The grant of free warren could be as a gift, or in exchange for consideration, and might be later alienated by the grantee.  The stipulated area might be coextensive with the [[frank-tenement]] of the grantee, or it might be discontinuous or even at a considerable remove from the grantee's holdings.  The right of free warren did not extend automatically to the [[Fee simple|freeholder]] of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |ref=harv|last=Craies
|first=William Feilden |year=1911a |wstitle=Game Laws |volume=11 |pages=440–441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the rights of free warren are usually discussed in the context of [[Royal forest#Forest law|forest law]], the only law which applied within the warren was [[common law]].  Thus, even though the warrant ultimately derived from the sovereign, the only statutes applied to [[poaching|poachers]] in a warren were the common-law crimes of [[theft]] and [[trespass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/McKechnie0323/HTMLs/0032_Pt02_Text.html Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John, with and Historical Introduction, by William Sharp McKechnie (Glasgow: Maclehose, 1914).]&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege of free warren was a [[Mutual assent|reciprocal]] relationship.  The grantee of the warren was granted an exemption from the law (under which all game in the realm was property of the sovereign), but the grantee owed the sovereign the stewardship and protection of the game from all others who might wish to hunt it.

==Etymology==
Modern [[English language|English]] ''warren'' ← [[Middle English|ME]] ''warrene'', ''warreine'' ← [[Old Norman|ONF]]  ''warrenne'' ← [[Germanic language|Germanic]] present participle of *''warian''  "to take care; to cause to care (for)" ← causative of *''waran'' "to care" ← ''*war'' "care".  Doublet of ''[[guarantor]]''.  Related to [[Old High German|OHG]] ''werien'' (i.e. ''*wärian'') "to defend, protect", and also to English "a-ware, wary".
&lt;ref&gt;A [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] etymology for ''warren'' has been proposed, based on the notion of "post → enclosure"; but this ignores the documented evolution of the term from the [[Germanic language|Germanic]], as well as being semantically inappropriate for an unenclosed [[woodland]].[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=warren&amp;searchmode=none]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free warren and domestic warren==
The original use of ''free warren'' was as a legal term.  However, as the franchise defined both a set of species and a geographic extent, the natural semantic extensions arose, namely for the individual animals as a group, or for the land they inhabited.  As it became pragmatically necessary for [[Fee simple|freeholders]] not holding a free warren to enclose their breeding establishments, these "closed warrens" or '''[[Warren (domestic)|domestic warren]]s''' began also to be designated simply as "warrens" (use recorded in 1378; [[OED]]). In 1649 the metaphoric use as "cluster of densely populated living spaces" is recorded.

==Warren and warden==
The [[Mediaeval Latin]] form of the word ''warenna'' was used in legal documents such as [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/Library/magnacharta.htm Magna Charta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the office of warden is used for the overseer of a warren:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(5) But the warden, as long as he hath the custody of the lands, shall keep up and maintain the houses, parks, warrens, ponds, mills, and other things belonging to them, our of their issues;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The warden of a [[Royal forest]] was often the [[castellan]] or [[constable]] of the nearest royal castle; over time the less exalted title of ''warrener'' evolved for the custodian of the lowest of the hunting franchises, the warren.

==Warren and warrant==
The adjective ''free'' in ''free warren'' does not refer to the lack of enclosure surrounding the precincts of the warren, but rather to the fact the "liberty" of hunting derives from a [[warrant (law)|warrant of the sovereign]]. That is,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |last=Craies |first=William Feilden |year=1911b |wstitle=Warrant |volume=28 |pages=327–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term "warrant" occurs very early in constitutional documents: it is found in the Assize of Clarendon and the Assize of the Forest, both in the reign of Henry II., but in neither case in its modern meaning. The original meaning seems to have been more akin to guarantee (q.v.), warranty or security; and to some extent the term implies something in the nature of a guarantee or representation by the person issuing the warrant that the person who acts on it can do so without incurring any legal penalty.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All of the terms ''warrant'', ''warrantor'', and ''warranty'' are used in [[Henry II of England]]'s [[Assize of the Forest]] (a.k.a. [[Assize of Woodstock]]) in 1184:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uFA0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA25 ''The Assize of the Forest (Woodstock) 1184 Henry II'']&lt;/ref&gt;

:Article 2. Item, he has commanded that no one shall have bows, arrows, dogs, or hounds in his forests, unless [such person] has the '''warrant''' of the king or of some other man who can [lawfully] be his '''warrantor'''.

:Article 9. Item, the king forbids all clergymen to commit any offences touching his venison or his forests. He strictly orders his foresters that, if they find such men committing offences, they shall not hesitate to lay hands on those men in order to hold them and put them under attachment; he himself will give full '''warranty'''.

==Beasts of warren==
The permission to take game was limited to certain types of animals.  Generally, the killing of [[vermin]] (defined as [[predator]]s and other beasts not fit for the table) was not regulated.  This definition was flexible, however, depending on whether the animal was thought to provide good sport, as wolves, foxes, badgers, or bears.  In practice, vermin could only be killed on the [[commons]] or waste, since none but the grantee was permitted to have instruments of the hunt within the warren.

===Manwood===
The most cited authority on [[Royal forest#Forest law|Forest Law]], [[John Manwood]], cites these beasts of warren:&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/calhounabode/josh/TheText.htm Treatise, I:3]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The beasts and fouls of Warren are these, The Hare, the Cony, the Pheasant, and the Partridge, and none other are accompted beasts or fouls of Warren."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Manwood is mistaken in his assignments, since the [[roe deer]] was transferred to "beast of warren" from "beast of the forest" in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The roe ceased to be a beast of forest in the fourteenth century owing to a decision in the Court of King's Bench, 13 Edw. III, which decided that it was a beast of warren on the ground that it drove away the other deer (Turner, Select Pleas of the Forest (Selden Soc.),  xxi). [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22180. 'Sport, ancient and modern: Introduction', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 2: General; Ashford,  East Bedfont with Hatton, Feltham, Hampton with Hampton Wick, Hanworth, Laleham, Littleton (1911), pp. 253-58, Note 20.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Roe deer are still found within woodlands named "Warren" in contemporary England.  The [[1911 Encyclopedia]] adds roe, woodcock, quail, and rail to Manwood's list.&lt;ref&gt;"Beasts of (free) warren are roe, hare, rabbit, partridge, pheasant, woodcock, quail, rail and heron" {{harv|Craies|1911a|p=441}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, [[grouse]] are not birds of warren.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animallaw.info/historical/articles/arukbacongame1856.htm] Matthew Bacon’s ''[[Bacon's Abridgement|A New Abridgment of the Law]]'', (1778): Devonshire v. Lodge, 7 Barn. &amp; C. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fox, wolf, cat, badger, and squirrel are sometimes also added.&lt;ref&gt;//www.hants.org.uk/newforest/history/history1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes domestic swine are mistakenly thought to be beasts of warren, due the right of [[pannage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/beeton/isabella/household//chapter17.html The Book of Household Management, by Isabella Beeton (chapter17)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''French National School for the Judiciary''' ([[French language|French]]: ''École nationale de la magistrature'' or ENM) is a French post-graduate school, where French judges and [[public prosecutor]]s are trained. The institution was created by ordinance of 22 December 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{Légifrance|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000339259|texte=Ordinance No. 58-1270 of 22 December 1958 for an organic law regarding the status of the judiciary}}, article 14 in its original version: « Il est institué un centre national d’études judiciaires »&lt;/ref&gt; as the "National Centre for Judicial Studies" (French: ''Centre national d'études judiciaires''). It became the French National School for the Judiciary in 1972. It is located in [[Bordeaux]] and has premises in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;French National School for the Judiciary web site, [http://www.enm.justice.fr/anglais/home.php Presentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512155549/http://www.enm.justice.fr/anglais/home.php |date=2009-05-12 }}. Consulted on May 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial training ==
The aim of the training provided by the ENM is to form a corps of judges and public prosecutors who are suitable for all posts on the bench as well as in the public prosecution service in first instance courts. 
The judicial functions are :
*''Tribunal de Grande Instance'' judge
*''Instance'' (small claims) Court judge
*Investigating judge
*Juvenile Court judge
*Probation judge
*Deputy Public Prosecutor

A prospective judge or deputy public prosecutor must complete a Bachelor in Law (which requires three years of study) and a Master in Law (which requires two years of study) before entering the National School for the Judiciary.  Admission is made through an entrance examination, which people generally take after completing dedicated studies in post-graduate preparatory class (''Institut d'études judiciaires'').{{cn|date=October 2012}}

In 2013, 2280 people were candidates; among them, 324 were invited to oral examinations, and 214 were admitted.{{cn|date=March 2014}} [[French citizenship]] is required for admission to the French National School for the Judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr-icon}} "''Pour s’y présenter, il faut être .. de nationalité française''", in French National School for the Judiciary web site, [http://www.enm.justice.fr/_uses/lib/5778/fiche_recrut_1er_concours_300409.pdf Magistrat, Les recrutements sur concours], page 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="942">'''Hard law''' refers to actual binding legal instruments and laws. In contrast with [[soft law]], hard law gives States and international actors actual binding responsibilities as well as rights. The term is common in [[international law]] where there are no sovereign governing bodies.

Hard law means binding laws. To constitute law, a rule, instrument or decision must be authoritative and prescriptive. In international law, hard law includes self-executing treaties or international agreements, as well as customary laws. These instruments result in legally enforceable commitments for countries (states) and other international subjects.

The phrase '''Her Majesty's Government''' (''His Majesty's Government'' during the reign of a male monarch) is a formal term referring to the [[government]] of a [[Commonwealth realm]] or one of constituent provinces, states or territories. In use since at least the height of the [[British Empire]], the phrase has been inherited and integrated into the countries that emerged from that polity.

==History==
In the [[British Empire]], the term ''His (or Her) Majesty's Government'' was originally only used by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|imperial government]] in [[London]]. As the Empire developed into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the former [[Dominion]]s came to be seen as realms of the sovereign equal in status to the [[United Kingdom]], and, from the 1920s and 1930s, the form ''His Majesty's Government in...'' began to be used by the United Kingdom and Dominion governments to differentiate between independent jurisdictions, such as [[His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State]].&lt;ref name=Walshe&gt;{{Citation| last=Walshe| first=Joseph P.| author-link=Joe Walshe| title=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy &gt; Despatch from Joseph P. Walshe (for Patrick McGilligan) to L.S. Amery (London) (D.5507) (Confidential) (Copy)| publisher=Royal Irish Academy| date=29 August 1927| url=http://www.difp.ie/docs/Volume3/1927/831.htm| accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial, state, and provincial governments, on the other hand, continued to use the lesser title ''Government of [region/territory]'', and eventually the phrase used in the former Dominions altered to mirror that of the UK, becoming, for example, ''Her Majesty's Australian Government''.

==Usage==

The term is employed in order to signify that the government of a Commonwealth realm or,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speech.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1367 |last=Government of Canada |authorlink=Government of Canada |title=Speech From the Throne &gt; Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |accessdate=4 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309072021/http://www.speech.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1367 |archivedate=9 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; less commonly, a division thereof, belongs to the reigning sovereign, and not to the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] or [[prime minister]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Cox| first=Noel| title=Black v Chrétien: Suing a Minister of the Crown for Abuse of Power, Misfeasance in Public Office and Negligence| journal=Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law| volume=9| issue=3| page=12| publisher=Murdoch University| location=Perth| date=September 2002| url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v9n3/cox93.html| accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neitsch |first=Alfred Thomas |title=A Tradition of Vigilance: The Role of Lieutenant Governor in Alberta |journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=23 |publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association |location=Ottawa |date=2008 |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf |accessdate=22 May 2009 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; though individual governments (also known as [[Ministry (collective executive)|ministries]]) may be identified by reference to the prime minister who chairs the cabinet at the time; the ''[[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] government'' or ''[[Michael Manley|Manley]] government'', for example.

Today, however, most Commonwealth realm governments, other than that of the UK (where the abbreviation ''HMG'' is frequently used), have reverted to predominantly using the form ''Government of [region]'', with ''Her Majesty's Government'' being typically employed in formal circumstances. Within federations, such as [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], disambiguation between federal, provincial, or state governments is sometimes required—for instance, a 1989 [[Supreme Court of Canada|Canadian Supreme Court]] decision refers to "Her Majesty's Government for the Province of [[Nova Scotia]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court| url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1989/1989rcs2-796/1989rcs2-796.html| litigants=Mackeigan v. Hickman| vol=2| reporter=S.C.R.| opinion=796| court=Supreme Court of Canada| date=5 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;—while in foreign affairs a national qualifier can be employed to differentiate between the governments of different monarchies; ''Her Britannic Majesty's Government'' for example.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">The '''International Institute for the Sociology of Law (IISL)''' in [[Oñati]] is the only international establishment  which is entirely devoted to teaching and promoting the [[sociology of law]], [[Sociology of law|socio-legal studies]], and [[Sociology of law|law and society]] research.

The IISL is a joint venture of the [http://rcsl.iscte.pt/ Research Committee on Sociology of Law] (also known as RC12 of the International Sociological Association) and the government of the Basque autonomous region in Spain. It is situated (since 1989) in the [[University of Oñati]] (the Ancient University of the Basque Country) in Oñati. The founding director of the IISL, André-Jean Arnaud, had bronze plaques put on the walls of the renaissance building with the names of some of the forefathers of modern sociology of law: [[Montesquieu]], [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], [[Henri Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Achille Loria]], [[Leon Petrażycki]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]], [[Karl Renner]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]], [[Nicholas Timasheff|Nicholas S. Timasheff]].

The IISL has four "official languages": [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Basque language|Basque]]. It houses a famous library/documentation centre covering socio-legal literature in all major and many minor languages. The Institute organises socio-legal workshops and an international Master's Program in the Sociology of Law, including student scholarships. Publications from the workshops are regularly produced in both an English- and Spanish language series, including the Institute's own online peer-reviewed journal (Onati Socio-Legal Series). The IISL is also the host of the World Consortium of Law and Society associations. Applications to host a workshop, residence grants for visitors wishing to use the library, and to study on the Masters programmes are usually due mid-February.

[[Image:Johann Jakob Moser.jpg|thumb|Johann Jacob Moser, after a painting by Johann Georg Oechslin (1775).]]

'''Johann Jakob Moser''' (18 January 1701 – 30 September 1785) was a German jurist, publicist and researcher, whose work earned him the title "The Father of German [[Constitutional Law]]" and whose political commitment to the principles of Liberalism caused him to lose academic positions and spend years as a [[political prisoner]].

==Early life==
Johann Jacob Moser was a member of the Moser family of Filseck, an old and respectable Württemberg family. They were devout Protestants with a history of service as civil servants to the Duchy of Württemberg. Moser's father was Johann Jacob Moser of Filseck (born 1660 in Stuttgart, died 1716), and his mother was Helene Catharine ''née'' Misler (born 1672 in Stade, died 1741 in Stuttgart).

Moser was born and died in [[Stuttgart]]. He had six brothers and sisters but his parents managed to fund his pursuit of an academic career. After attending [[Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Wojak | first =Irmtrud | title =Fritz Bauer 1903–1968: eine Biographie | publisher=C.H.Beck | year =2009 | location =Munich | pages =54 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jP0uMZLuN0wC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Berthold+Auerbach%22+Eberhard-Ludwigs-gymnasium| isbn =978-3-406-58154-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Moser studied state journalism at the [[University of Tübingen]]. He was mostly self-taught and at 18 years of age he became a professor of the law faculty. However he found his income insufficient, and he so that it had to look around for other possibilities. he studied at the [[University of Tübingen]], and was brilliant enough to be already at the age of 19 appointed a professor of Law in the same university.

In 1721 Moser married Friederike Rosine Vischer, daughter of a Württembergian Upper Council President. Their oldest son, [[Friedrich Karl von Moser]], was born on 18 December 1723 in Stuttgart, and became a jurist, political writer and a statesman.

From 1721-1726 he worked in Vienna. In 1724 he became an adviser to the state vice-chancellor Count Schönborn. Moser was not able to pursue a career in the imperial service, because he refused to convert to Catholicism. Soon afterwards he entered the civil service of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was appointed as a "state adviser" in the Imperial Court. In 1726 Moser returned to Stuttgart as a government advisor. In 1727 he was appointed professor at the Tübingen Collegium. The job conflicted with his role as a government advisor and he quit (which job?) in 1732. He held a long series of administrative appointments, giving him a thorough knowledge of political and constitutional issues.

In 1736 he was called to head the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Frankfurt (Oder)]], but had to leave after three years due to his thoroughly Liberal ideas which were disliked by King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]]. Between 1739 and 1751, he had various jobs.

He spent the years 1739 to 1747 at [[Ebersdorf, Saalburg-Ebersdorf|Ebersdorf]], mainly concerned with completing the monumental 53 volumes of his ''Deutsches Staatsrecht'' ("German Constitutional Law"), a pioneering research analysing the named subject matter more systematically than ever done before, and based on a through study of the sources.

In 1751 Moser became a consultant on land reform to the [[Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg]]. He came into conflict with the Duke by opposing the Duke's [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] tendencies. In July 1759 he was arrested and imprisoned without judicial procedure in solitary confinement in the fortress [[Hohentwiel]], on the charge of authoring subversive writings. He completed his five-year detention with his mental and physical health and his faith in god unbroken. In order to meet his desire to write, without writing materials, he wrote religious songs on the walls with soot from the fireplace on the walls. In 1764, aged 63, he was released, in part due to the intercession of Friedrich the Great of Prussia, and was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles.

In 1764 he was released, due in part to the intercession of [[Friedrich the Great]] of Prussia (son of the king who had hounded Moser in 1739). He was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles. He retired on 16 July 1770 aged 69. During the next 15 years, he wrote many books. Over his entire life he wrote 500-600 books. This prolific output led sometimes to careless representations of the facts in his works.

==Legacy==
Johann Jacob Moser wrote the first description of the German state based not on abstract principles but on concrete legal rules and judicial decisions. He collected material and organised it systematically. Thus he argued against the deductive systems of natural law advocated by [[Christian Thomasius]] (1655-1728) and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679-1754). He gave the same treatment to international law, describing how it was actually practiced, rather than attempting to derive it from nature. Moser is considered as laying the foundations for the modern German state and positive international law. He defended the traditional order by defending actual legal rules.

Apart from his work on state law, he was also interested in the local law of the numerous territories of the state. However, because of their great variety, he was not able to describe them with the same comprehensiveness.

Among his important later works can be mentioned ''Neues deutsches Staatsrecht'', ("New German Constitutional Law"), published in 24 volumes between 1766 and 1782. His overall ouvre includes about 500 works, on law as well as [[theology]].

'''Judicial activism''' refers to [[judiciary|judicial]] rulings that are suspected of being based on personal opinion, rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of [[judicial restraint]].&lt;ref name="cwolfe"&gt;{{cite book|first = Christopher |last = Wolfe|title = Judicial activism|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn = 0-8476-8531-4|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OtQu8dnH9coC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=0-8476-8531-4&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KePXbURFud&amp;sig=rMU-TMUfzmUXC6L3MWGKOkIqECk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD3Z_2vZXcAhUPbKwKHXjZD_QQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=0-8476-8531-4&amp;f=false|date = 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of judicial activism and the specific decisions that are activist are controversial political issues. The question of judicial activism is closely related to [[judicial interpretation|constitutional interpretation]], [[statutory construction]], and [[separation of powers]].

==Etymology==
[[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] introduced the term "judicial activism" in a January 1947 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article titled "The Supreme Court: 1947".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kmiec|first=Keenan D.|title=The Origin and Current Meanings of 'Judicial Activism'|journal=Cal. L. Rev.|year=2004|volume=92|pages=1441, 1447|quote=Schlesinger's article profiled all nine Supreme Court justices on the Court at that time and explained the alliances and divisions among them. The article characterized Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]], [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]], and [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]] as the 'Judicial Activists' and Justices [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]], [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], and [[Harold Hitz Burton|Burton]] as the 'Champions of Self Restraint.' Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Reed]] and Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Vinson]] comprised a middle group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has been controversial since its beginning. An article by Craig Green, "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism," is critical of Schlesinger's use of the term; "Schlesinger's original introduction of judicial activism was doubly blurred: not only did he fail to explain what counts as activism, he also declined to say whether activism is good or bad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=roger_craig_green "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism"] Craig Green, August 2008, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before this phrase was first used, the general concept already existed. For example, [[Thomas Jefferson]] referred to the "despotic behaviour" of [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] federal judges, in particular Chief Justice [[John Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qWlMgSqhRv4C&amp;pg=PA254 Haines &amp; Sherwood, ''The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government and Politics: 1789–1835'', 1944, p.209]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines judicial activism as a "philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in "Takings Clause Jurisprudence: Muddled, Perhaps; Judicial Activism, No" DF O'Scannlain, ''Geo. JL &amp; Pub. Pol'y'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science professor Bradley Canon has posited six dimensions along which judge courts may be perceived as activist:&lt;ref&gt;Bradley C. Canon – "Defining the Dimensions of Judicial Activism," ''Judicature'', 66.6, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; majoritarianism, interpretive stability, interpretive fidelity, substance/democratic process, specificity of policy, and availability of an alternate policymaker. David A. Strauss has argued that judicial activism can be narrowly defined as one or more of three possible actions: overturning laws as unconstitutional, overturning [[case law|judicial precedent]], and ruling against a preferred interpretation of the constitution.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2015}}

Others have been less confident of the term's meaning, finding it instead to be little more than a rhetorical shorthand. [[Kermit Roosevelt III]] has argued that "in practice 'activist' turns out to be little more than a rhetorically charged shorthand for decisions the speaker disagrees with";&lt;ref name=roosevelt&gt;Kermit Roosevelt, III, ''The Myth of Judicial Activism: Making Sense of Supreme Court Decisions'', Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-12691-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12691-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]] under [[George W. Bush]], [[Theodore Olson]], said in an interview on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', in regards to [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger|a case for same-sex marriage he had successfully litigated]], that "most people use the term 'judicial activism' to explain decisions that they don't like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/ted-olson-debate-over-judicial-activism-and-same-sex-marriage|title=Ted Olson on Debate Over Judicial Activism and Same-Sex Marriage|work=Fox News Sunday|first=Chris|last=Wallace|first2=Theodore|last2=Olson|date=August 8, 2010|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] has said that, "An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don't like."&lt;ref name="flewis"&gt;Frederick P. Lewis, ''The context of judicial activism: the endurance of the Warren Court legacy in a conservative age'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield: 1999, {{ISBN|0-8476-8992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Sedensky, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20100605163057/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iWhwP-GmuptNw-uw8t8Z_lb1YV2QD9FMQKRG0 Justice questions way court nominees are grilled]," Associated Press, May 14, 2010, accessed May 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

Detractors of judicial activism charge that it usurps the power of the elected branches of government or appointed agencies, damaging the rule of law and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissent in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1039.ZD.html Romer, ''Governor of Colorado, et al. v. Evans et al.'' (94-1039), 517 U.S. 620 (1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defenders of judicial activism say that in many cases it is a legitimate form of [[judicial review]], and that the interpretation of the law must change with changing times.

A third view is that so-called "objective" interpretation of the law does not exist. According to law professor Brian Z. Tamanaha, "Throughout the so-called formalist age, it turns out, many prominent judges and jurists acknowledged that there were gaps and uncertainties in the law and that judges must sometimes make choices."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Z. Tamanaha, ''Beyond the Formalist-Realist Divide: The Role of Politics in Judging'', Princeton University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under this view, any judge's use of [[judicial discretion]] will necessarily be shaped by that judge's personal and professional experience and his or her views on a wide range of matters, from legal and juridical philosophy to morals and ethics. This implies a tension between granting flexibility (to enable the dispensing of justice) and placing bounds on that flexibility (to hold judges to ruling from legal grounds rather than extralegal ones).

Some proponents of a stronger judiciary argue that the judiciary helps provide checks and balances and should grant itself an expanded role to counterbalance the effects of transient [[majoritarianism]], i.e., there should be an increase in the powers of a branch of government which is not directly subject to the electorate, so that the majority cannot dominate or oppress any particular minority through its elective powers.&lt;ref&gt;John Hart Ely, ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, chapters 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars have proposed that judicial activism is most appropriate when it restrains the tendency of democratic majorities to act out of passion and prejudice rather than after reasoned deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Zoldan, "Targeted Judicial Activism," 16 Green Bag 2d 465-66 (2014) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2310915]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, they argue that the judiciary strikes down both elected and unelected official action, in some instances acts of legislative bodies reflecting the view the transient majority may have had at the moment of passage and not necessarily the view the same legislative body may have at the time the legislation is struck down. Also, the judges that are appointed are usually appointed by previously elected executive officials so that their philosophy should reflect that of those who nominated them, that an independent judiciary is a great asset to civil society since special interests are unable to dictate their version of constitutional interpretation with threat of stopping political donations.

{{LGBT rights}}
'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ('''LGBT''') '''rights in Asia''' are limited in comparison to many other areas of the world. Same-sex sexual activity is outlawed in at least twenty Asian countries. While at least eight countries have enacted protections for LGBT people, only [[Israel]] and [[Taiwan]] provide a wider range of [[LGBT rights]] - including same-sex relationship recognition.

In [[Afghanistan]], [[Brunei]], [[Iran]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Yemen]], homosexual activity is punished with the death penalty.&lt;ref name="ILGA"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Sponsored Homophobia 2016: A world survey of sexual orientation laws: criminalisation, protection and recognition|url=http://ilga.org/downloads/02_ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2016_ENG_WEB_150516.pdf|work=[[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]]|accessdate=19 May 2016|date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="10Countries"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/13/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death-2/ |title=Here are the 10 countries where homosexuality may be punished by death |publisher=The Washington Post |date=16 June 2016 |accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal punishment for sodomy has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe [[capital punishment]]; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment such as [[imprisonment]]. In some relatively secular Muslim-majority countries such as [[Azerbaijan]], [[Jordan]], and [[Turkey]], homosexuality is legal, but usually socially unacceptable.

Egalitarian relationships modeled on the Western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare.&lt;ref name="10Countries" /&gt;&lt;ref name="http://muslimvillage.com/author/mv-media/ MV Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimvillage.com/2014/04/20/52563/brunei-sultan-institutes-death-penalty-for-homosexuality/|title=Brunei: Sultan institutes death penalty for homosexuality|author=[http://muslimvillage.com/author/mv-media/ MV Media]|publisher=Muslim Village|date=20 April 2014|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 |title=7 countries still put people to death for same-sex acts |publisher=ILGA |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029185853/http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1111&amp;ZoneID=7&amp;FileCategory=50 |archivedate=2009-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambodia]], [[East Timor]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], the [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Cyprus]] (excluding Northern Cyprus) are viewed as the most open to the LGBT community in Asia. Japan, Israel, Thailand, Taiwan and Nepal are the major players in legislation. {{as of|2018}}, only the [[British Overseas Territories]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] and the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] have legalized [[same-sex marriage]].

In a 2011 [[LGBT rights at the United Nations|UN General Assembly declaration for LGBT rights]], state parties were given a chance to express their support or opposition on the topic. Only [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Thailand]], and [[East Timor]] expressed their support. They were later joined by Vietnam and the Philippines. State parties who expressed opposition were [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], the [[Maldives]], [[North Korea]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Jordan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tajikistan]]. Other Asian parties did not show support or opposition.

The first and only LGBT political party in the world, [[Ladlad]], was established in the Philippines in 2003.

In 2016, during an African-led coalition to dislodge the recently established UN expert on LGBT issues, the majority of Asian nations backed to retain the role of the UN LGBT expert, with only Muslim nations, with the addition of China and Singapore, declaring their opposition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8779">'''Law Against Rehabilitation of Nazism''' is a Russian [[Memory laws|memory law]] of 2014. It also known as Yarovaya Law, after a Russian politician ([[Irina Yarovaya]]) who was instrumental in passing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0-w0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293|title=Law and Memory: Towards Legal Governance of History|last=Belavusau|first=Uladzislau|last2=Gliszczyńska-Grabias|first2=Aleksandra|date=2017-10-19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107188754|location=|pages=293|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was originally proposed in 2009. It was approved by the [[Russian parliament]] in April 2014, and signed into law by [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] in May that year.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurilla|first=Ivan|date=August 2014|title=The Implications of Russia’s Law against the "Rehabilitation of Nazism"|url=http://www.ponarseurasia.org/sites/default/files/policy-memos-pdf/Pepm331_Kurilla_August2014_0.pdf|journal=PONARS Eurasia Policy Memo No. 331|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Contents==
The law introduced Article 354.1 to the [[Criminal Code of the Russian Federation]], making it a criminal offense "to deny facts recognized by the international military tribunal that judged and punished the major war criminals of the European Axis countries [this refers to the [[Nuremberg trials]]], to approve of the crimes this tribunal judged, and to spread intentionally false information about the Soviet Union’s activities during World War II" as well as "the spreading of information on military and memorial commemorative dates related to Russia’s defense that is clearly disrespectful of society, and to publicly desecrate symbols of Russia’s military glory".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The penalty incurred for violating this law is a fine of up to 500,000 rubles (about USD$8,200 as of April 19, 2018) or a prison terms of up to five years, with a ban from certain posts and professions for another three years, and/or up to one year of community service.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/154332-russia-nazi-rehabilitation-ban/|title=Duma passes bill criminalizing rehabilitation of Nazism|work=RT International|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The law has been the subject of domestic and international criticism, due to fears of its impact on [[free speech]] and historical research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A BBC report in 2017 noted that the law has "curbed...the public discussion of WW2 history".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  [[Human Rights Watch]] report in 2017 noted that "[the law's] selective implementation has so far led to several unjust sentences".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/18/online-and-all-fronts/russias-assault-freedom-expression|title=Online and On All Fronts {{!}} Russia’s Assault on Freedom of Expression|date=2017-07-18|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Russian government officials have dismissed these objections, noting that the law is similar to many other laws known as [[laws against Holocaust denial]], particularly common in Europe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Historian Ivan Kurilla addressed that, saying that while the first European memory laws "were propagated by left-wing political forces aiming to preserve the memory of oppressed groups and the crimes of their states", newer laws, such as the Russian one, are increasingly "backed by pro-state right-wing politicians that seek to create a heroic national narrative and legislate away any doubt about the state’s historical righteousness".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Historian [[Nikolay Koposov]] wrote that the main goal of the law is "to promote the cult of the Russian state, whose primary incarnation rests in the celebration of the heroic memory of World War II".&lt;ref name="Koposov2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikolay Koposov|title=Memory Laws, Memory Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S42DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207|date=12 October 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-41972-7|pages=207–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after its passage, the law was used to convict Russian blogger Vladimir Luzgin, who compared the September 1939 [[German invasion of Poland]] to the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] and referred to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], writing on Russian social media platform [[VKontakte]] that "communism and Nazism closely collaborated". Prosecutors accused him of knowingly posting material that may worsen people's view of the Soviet Union, and the court agreed, stating that he had falsified history by stating "that the communists and Germany jointly attacked Poland, unleashing World War Two, or in other words, that Communism and Nazism co-operated honestly".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://meduza.io/en/news/2016/07/01/russian-court-convicts-man-of-falsifying-history-for-saying-the-ussr-shares-responsibility-for-starting-wwii|title=Russian court convicts man of ‘falsifying history’ for saying the USSR shares responsibility for starting WWII|work=Meduza|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Luzgin was fined 200 thousand rubles (roughly equivalent to USD$5,000 in 2014) for "circulation of false information about the activities of the USSR during the years of World War II", though, as was noted by human rights expert [[Jacob Mchangama]], this claim was "essentially, factually correct". &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/02/first-they-came-for-the-holocaust-deniers-and-i-did-not-speak-out/|title=First They Came for the Holocaust Deniers, and I Did Not Speak Out|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1467327913|title=Russian fined for reposting that the USSR &amp; Nazi Germany invaded Poland|work=Human Rights in Ukraine|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Lugzin appealed his case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rightsinrussia.info/legal-case-of-the-week/vladimirluzgin-1|title=Legal Case of the Week: Vladimir Luzgin|website=www.rightsinrussia.info|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Russian journalist Polina Petruseva was fined 1,000 rubles (USD$16) for posting on the social media platform VKontakte a historical picture showing German Nazi troops in Russia, a picture otherwise available from, among others, [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/russia-steps-up-war-on-nazi-imagery-46582|title=Russia Steps Up War on Nazi Imagery|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/08/vladimir-putin-great-patriotic-purge-victory-day-nazi/|title=Putin's Great Patriotic Purge|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, a number of Russian bookstores stopped selling the anti-Nazi graphic novel ''[[Maus]]'' because of a swastika appearing on its cover design.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A toy store selling toy soldiers in wartime German uniforms was also investigated, and a museum displaying anti-Nazi Soviet posters, showing for example crushed swastikas, decided to censor all swastikas on its exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-anti-swastika-crusade/26987440.html|title=Russia's Anti-Swastika Crusade Hits Toy Stores, Bookstores, And Museums|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

Jersey's [[List of national legal systems|legal system]] is 'mixed' or '[[Legal pluralism|pluralistic]]', and sources of law are in French and English languages, although since the 1950s the main [[working language]] of the legal system is English.

== Sources of law ==

=== Legislation adopted by the States of Jersey ===
Jersey's legislature, the [[States of Jersey|States Assembly]] makes [[legislation]] affecting most areas of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |publisher=Institute of Law |title=Study Guide for Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law, chapter 8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Laws ====
[[File:1771 onwards Jersey Recueil des Lois.jpg|thumb|''Recueil de Lois de Jersey'' from 1771]]
The highest form of legislation made by the States is 'Laws'. If a proposed Law is likely to be controversial, the general desirability of having new legislation on the topic may be debated before the Law drafted. The procedure for making Laws is set out in the Standing Orders of the States of Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/lawsinforce/consolidated/16/16.800.15_StandingOrdersoftheStatesofJersey_RevisedEdition_1January2011.pdf|title=Standing Orders of the States of Jersey|date=1 January 2011}}; {{cite web|first=Lucy|last=Marsh-Smith|title=The Production of Legislation in the Crown Dependencies|year=2010|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb10/JLR1002_Marsh-Smith.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221553/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb10/JLR1002_Marsh-Smith.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Law is in draft from, it starts the legislative process as a ''projet de loi'', which may be introduced to the States by a [[Cabinet of Jersey|Minister]], any States Member, a [[scrutiny panel]] or the Comité des [[Connétable (Jersey and Guernsey)|Connétables]]. At the stage known as 'first reading', the title of the projet is read out and the projet is 'lodged [[Greffier|au Greffe]]' providing a two to six week breathing space for Members to read the draft Law. Under Article 16 of the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000,&lt;ref name="HRLaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2000%2FJersey_Law_19-2000.htm|title=Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110631/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CLawFiles%5C2000%2FJersey_Law_19-2000.htm|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Minister or other person lodging the projet au Greffe must make a written statement that the provisions of the projet are compatible with [[ECHR|Convention rights]] or 'make a statement that although [he or she] is unable to make a statement of compatibility, [he or she] nevertheless wants the States to proceed with the projet'. At the next 'second reading' stage, there is a formal debate in the States chamber during which members consider the principle of the projet and then scrutinise the draft in detail. At 'third reading' stage there is an opportunity for minor drafting errors to be corrected. Finally, members vote to adopt the law.

The Law is then submitted via the [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey|Lieutenant Governor]]'s office for transmission to London, where [[Politics of Jersey#Relations with the United Kingdom|officials]] in the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] examine the Law. In 2010, the [[House of Commons Justice Committee]] was highly critical of the UK Government's approach, finding that 'The Islands are more than adequately advised by their own Law Officers and Parliamentary Counsel. It seems a strange use of Ministry of Justice resources ... to engage in a kind of legislative oversight which does not restrict itself to the constitutional grounds for scrutiny'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=House of Commons Justice Committee|title=Crown Dependencies, 8th Report of 2009-10, HC 56-1, para 62|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/56/5607.htm#a6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process may take several months. In an unusual move in 2011, campaigners against a Law that sought to reduce the number of Senators in the States petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse Royal Assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save Senators plea reaches Privy Council|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=7 June 2011|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/06/07/save-senators-plea-reaches-privy-council/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once official scrutiny is complete in London, the Law is formally presented to Her Majesty for [[Royal Assent]] at a meeting of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], usually held at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle.

After a Law receives Royal Assent, the final step is for it be registered with the [[Royal Court of Jersey]]. At this point it is 'passed'. The Law is then brought into force at a date decided by the relevant Jersey minister. There may be a considerable delay between a Law being passed and it becoming legally effective if, for example, civil servants need to be trained, computer systems put in place or money found to pay for the new scheme.

Laws adopted and passed are published in print as ''Recueil de Lois'' de Jersey and online by the [[Jersey Legal Information Board]] on the Jersey Law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/LawsInForce/default.aspx|title=Laws in Force|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928234724/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/LawsInForce/default.aspx|archivedate=2012-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; website.

==== Other types of legislation ====
In Jersey, there are other types of legislation in addition to Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Law | title = Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law | chapter = 8 | publisher = Institute of Law | year = 2011 | location = Jersey | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | isbn = 978-1-908716-00-2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314235510/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Regulations''': these are used where a Law delegates to the States Assembly power to make legally binding rules to implement a named Law.
* '''Triennial Regulations''': since the 18th century, the States of Jersey has had power to make provisional regulations of up to three years' duration.
* '''Orders and Rules''': these are generally made by a Minister, within the scope of powers set out in a Law.

=== Customary law ===
Custom is a source of law in the Jersey legal system. It has been described as "the product of generally accepted usage and practice. It has no formal sanction or authority behind it other than the general consensus of opinion within the community".&lt;ref&gt;Snell v Beadle [2001] UKPC 5 at [16] http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/2001/5.html&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from [[English common law]] where rules stated by a judge of a senior court are binding law ''because'' they are stated by a judge. In customary law, the role of the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary]] is to look for evidence of what is "generally accepted usage and practice".

Many rules of customary law have crystallised to such an extent (through repeated acknowledgment by the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] and in the way people conduct their affairs) that everyone accepts them as binding without discussion. The boundaries of the [[Parishes of Jersey|Parishes]], the existence of the office of [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)#Bailiff of Jersey|Bailiff]] and various rules relating to possession of land and inheritance fall into this category. Many rules of customary law are to be found discussed in the texts of the "Commentators" and the case law of the Jersey courts.  Where the works of the commentators do not deal with situation, the Jersey courts look at factual evidence to work out is the "generally accepted usage and practice".&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Moran v Deputy Registrar for the Parish of St Helier'' [2007] JRC 151 http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnReportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2007/07-08-02_Moran_and_Kemp_and_The_Deputy_Registrar_for_St_Helier_151.htm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113055727/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnReportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2007%2F07-08-02_Moran_and_Kemp_and_The_Deputy_Registrar_for_St_Helier_151.htm |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The customary law of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] is particularly influential as a source of law in Jersey, even though Jersey ceased to part of Normandy in 1204. Norman law developed in two main epochs–the "Ancienne coutume" (1199–1538) and the "Coutume reformée" (1538–1804).

The northern and western regions of Medieval Europe "were a patchwork of territorial areas in which the main source of law was customs, usages and practices which had become relatively fixed and settled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Institute of Law | title = Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law | chapter = Chapter 2 | publisher = Institute of Law | year = 2011 | location = Jersey | url = http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | accessdate = 2012-03-27 | isbn = 978-1-908716-00-2 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314235510/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/downloads/2011.10.20%20Jersey%20Legal%20System%20-%20FINAL%20with%20ISBN.pdf | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman law was based on oral tradition and repeated practices in [[Feudal]] society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

When in 1309 [[Edward II of England]] sent Justices to Jersey, the people of Jersey were "asked by what law they claimed to be governed, the law of England, of Normandy, or by some special customs of their own? They answered 'By the law of Normandy, and referred the Justices to the ''Summa of Malcael'' [the Jersey name for the Grand Coutumier], where the Norman laws are well embodied'... But they added, and this a clause that caused much trouble later, 'except that we have certain customs used in this island from time immemorial".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In the 16th century, two commentaries on the Grand Coutumier, written in Normandy, have been influential in Jersey law. [[:fr:Guillaume Le Rouillé|Guillaume Rouillé of Alençon]] (also known as Le Rouillé) was the author of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-xCAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=intitle%3ALe%20intitle%3AGrant%20intitle%3ACoustumier&amp;pg=PT3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Le Grant Coustumier du pays &amp; duché de Normendie : tres utile &amp; profitable a tous practiciens]'' (1534; 1539). He also produced commentary on the neighbouring province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] (pictured).

Guillaume Terrien's ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xYaA_5KCB04C&amp;dq=Commentaires%20du%20droit%20civil%20tant%20public%20que%20priv%C3%A9%20observ%C3%A9%20au%20pays%20et%20Duch%C3%A9%20de%20Normandie&amp;pg=PP3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commentaires du droit civil, tant public que privé, observé au pays et Duché de Normandie]'' was first published in 1574. Dawes explains: "Terrien’s own work comprised the selecting of texts from the ''Grand Coutumier'', putting them into an order which suited his scheme (even to the point of cutting and pasting quite disparate texts) and then commenting on the resulting amalgam. To this commentary a further author added notes headed 'Additio', more often than not in Latin".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Dawes| first =Gordon| authorlink =| title =A note on Guillaume Terrien and his work| journal =Jersey and Guernsey Law Review| volume =| issue =| pages =| publisher =Jersey and Guernsey Law Review Ltd| location =| year =2007| language =| url =http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Dawes.aspx| jstor =| issn =| doi =| id =| mr =| zbl =| jfm =| accessdate =27 August 2011| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120113055355/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/feb07/JLR0702_Dawes.aspx| archivedate =13 January 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two modern versions of the text of the Grand Coutumier have been produced. The first was by [[Jurat]] William Laurence de Gruchy entitled ''L’Ancienne Coutume de Normandie: Réimpression, éditée avec de légères annotations'' (1881), based on Le Rouillé’s 1539 edition, using a double-column format setting out the Latin and French texts side by side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==== Coutume Reformée of Normandy ====
[[File:Berault_Coutume_Reformée_3rd_edn_1620.jpg|thumb|Berault's 1620 commentary]]
The second period in the development of Norman custom was between 1583 and 1804 and is known as the ''Coutume reformée'' (the reformed custom). In 1453, [[Charles VII of France]] issued orders that all the customary laws of France should be "redacted", in other words set out systematically and approved under royal authority. The [[Duchy of Normandy]] was the last part of France to comply with this order but the new text was eventually prepared and received royal approval in 1585 by [[Henry III of France]].

There are two reasons why the Coutume reformée might be thought to have little relevance to [[Jersey]]: it was created 380 years after Jersey had ceased formally to be part of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] and it was a text sanctioned by the king of France. Nonetheless, Jersey lawyers and courts made frequent references to the Coutume reformée and by virtue of its assimilation into Jersey law over the centuries it is regarded as a source of the island's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Within France, customary law was abolished in 1804 with the introduction of uniform [[Napoleonic code|codes]] of civil and criminal law across the whole of France.

==== Jersey commentators on custom ====
As well as relying on commentaries produced in France, Jersey has an indigenous legal literature on custom. In the 17th century, [[Jean Poingdestre]] (1609–1691) and [[Philippe Le Geyt]] (1635–1716) wrote several works. Some chapters of [[Charles Sydney Le Gros|C.S. Le Gros]]' 20th century work, ''Traité du Droit Coutumier d l'Ile de Jersey'' also remain relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=C.S.|last=Le Gros|title=Traité du Droit Coutumier d l'Ile de Jersey|location=St Helier|publisher=Jersey and Guernsey Law Review Ltd|year=1943|ISBN=978-0-9557611-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legislative reforms of custom ====
Many rules of customary law have been amended or abolished by legislation in the later 19th and 20th centuries. Examples of this include:
* “Any rule of customary law, that a contract passed before the Royal Court for the transfer of immovable property may be annulled, at the instance of the heirs or devisees, as the case may be, of the transferor, if he or she dies within 40 days of the passing of the contract, is abolished” (Customary Law Amendment (No. 2) (Jersey) Law 1984).
* In customary law, the age of majority was 20 years; the Age of Majority (Jersey) Law 1999 reduces this to 18 years.
* “The rule under customary law that all gifts to a concubine are null is hereby abolished” (Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993).
* Customary law did not permit a cause of action for/against a person to survive the person’s death against/for the benefit of the person’s estate; Customary Law Amendment (Jersey) Law 1948 reversed this situation.
* The ''année de jouissance'' (the right of an executor to have the income arising during the administration of a moveable estate for a year and a day) was abolished by the Wills and Successions (Jersey) Law 1993.

=== Influence of English and French law ===
Some fields of Jersey, such as negligence and administrative law, are heavily influenced by [[English common law#Common law|English common law]]. In other branches of law, notably contract, Jersey courts may have regard to [[French civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Jersey Law Commission |title=Consultation Paper No. 5: The Jersey Law of Contract |date=October 2002 |url=http://www.lawcomm.gov.je/Contract.htm }}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Institute of Law |title=Study Guide on Jersey Contract Law |url=http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228104105/http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/default.asp?contentID=629 |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights ===
The Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000,&lt;ref name="HRLaw"/&gt; based closely on the United Kingdom's [[Human Rights Act 1998]], requires Jersey courts so far as possible to interpret legislation so that it is compatible with rights and freedoms guaranteed by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Jersey public bodies are required to act in conformity with Convention rights.

In January 2012, Jersey introduced laws to recognise same-sex civil partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-16536572 | work=BBC News | title=Jersey recognises civil partnerships | date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language of Jersey law ==
During the 20th century, the main working language of the Jersey legal system changed from French to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Timothy|last=Hanson|title=The Language of Law: the importance of French|year=2005|publisher=Jersey Law Review|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Hanson.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221249/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Publications/jerseylawreview/june05/JLR0506_Hanson.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1930s, almost all legislation passed by the States Assembly was in French. Since then, French is used only where new legislation makes amendments to legislation originally drafted in French.&lt;ref&gt;All legislation is available on the [http://www.jerseylaw.je/ Jersey Law] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precedent and law reporting==
[[File:Tables des Décisions de La Cour Royale de Jersey.jpg|thumb|''Tables de Décisions de la Cour Royal de Jersey'' 1885-1978]] The Jersey legal system does not follow the strict rules of [[binding precedent]] that exist in common law jurisdictions such as [[English law|England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;''Qatar v Al Thani'' 1999 Jersey Law Reports 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]] is not bound by its own previous decisions on a point of law but it will generally follow them unless persuaded that the earlier decision was wrongly decided. A similar approach is taken by the [[Courts of Jersey#Appeal courts|Court of Appeal]]. All Jersey courts are, however, bound by points of law decided by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in previous Jersey appeals to that court.

During the 19th and 20th centuries a series of improvements to the system of writing and reporting judgments was put in place. In 1885, the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] began to publish the ''Tables des Décisions de la Cour Royal de Jersey''–a subject index to decided cases, prepared by the [[Greffier]].&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Law, Jersey, ''Jersey Legal System and Constitutional Law'' (2011), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Charles Thomas Le Quesne]] [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] returned to Jersey from practice at the [[Barristers in England and Wales|English Bar]] and was appointed [[Lieutenant Bailiff of Jersey|Lieutenant Bailiff]]. Up to this point, the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]]'s judgments were in the French style of ''jugements motivés'',{{French spelling}} written in French by the [[Greffier]] rather than the judge, and expressing the reasons for the court's decision only very briefly. Le Quesne changed the language of judgments to English and adopted the [[common law]] style of judgments, where the judge gives detailed reasons for accepting or rejecting the rival submissions made at trial by [[counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General v Weston'' 1979 Jersey Judgments 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1984, the Royal Court published its and the Court of Appeal judgments in a series of [[law reports]] known as the ''Jersey Judgments'' (eleven volumes in total). From 1984, judgments have been published a new series of [[law reports]] known as the ''Jersey Law Reports''.&lt;ref&gt;Law Reports International Ltd {{cite web |url=http://www.lawreports.com/jersey.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123022208/http://www.lawreports.com/jersey.htm |archivedate=2012-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judiciary ==
The head of the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|judiciary in Jersey]] is the [[Bailiff of Jersey|Bailiff]], who as well as performing the judicial functions of a [[chief justice]] is also the President ([[Speaker (politics)|presiding officer]]) of the [[legislature|States of Jersey]] and has certain civic, ceremonial and executive functions. The Bailiff's functions may be exercised by the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]].

=== Judicial appointments processes ===
The posts of Bailiff and [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]] are Crown appointments, formally made by Her Majesty the Queen, on [[Politics of Jersey#The Crown|advice]] of the UK government's [[Secretary of State for Justice]].

[[File:Juges Jour d'la Libéthâtion 2009 a.jpg|thumb|The Bailiff and Jurats outside the Royal Court in 2009]]An appointment process has developed in recent years, without a legislative basis, for vacancies for the [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Deputy Bailiffs of Jersey|Deputy Bailiff]], Attorney General for Jersey and Solicitor General for Jersey. This involves advertising for candidates and the preparation of a shortlist by a selection panel consisting of the Bailiff (in the chair), the senior [[Jurat]] and the chairman of the [[Jersey Appointments Commission]]. A process of consultation is then carried out, including the Jurats, the [[States Consultative Panel]] (which includes the [[Chief Minister of Jersey|Chief Minister]]), a number of elected members of the States, senior lawyers (the [[Bâtonnier]], the President of the Law Society, the former President of the [[Law Society of Jersey]] and the President of the [[Chambre des Ecrivains]]), the other Crown Officers and the local [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)#Commissioners|Commissioner]] of the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]]. All candidates on the shortlist are then interviewed by the selection panel. A single name is then sent by the Lieutenant Governor to the Secretary of State for Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|pages=5–15|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process has not been used for appointment to the office of Bailiff on the basis that "The Secretary of State has accepted that the position of Deputy Bailiff is a training ground for the position of Bailiff, and that, therefore, all things being equal, you would expect to move up, assuming of course that you have performed to everyone's satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|page=14|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jurat]]s are elected by an [[electoral college]] consisting of the Bailiff, the Jurats, the [[Constable#Channel Islands|Connétables]], the elected members of the states, advocates and solicitors of the Royal Court.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLaw"&gt;Article 4 of the {{cite web|title=Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785111|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221620/http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785111|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting is by secret ballot.

Commissioners of the Royal Court are appointed by the Bailiff for the hearing of a specified cause or matter or a specified term.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLawII"&gt;Part II of the {{cite web|title=Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785122|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221620/http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.770_RoyalCourtLaw1948_RevisedEdition_1January2011.htm#Toc268785122|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailiff appoints the [[Courts of Jersey#Magistrate's Court|Magistrate]] and the Assistant Magistrate (who hold full-time salaried posts) and part-time Relief Magistrates (legal practitioners who carry out duties on a daily fee-paid basis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Loi (1864) concernant la charge de Juge d’Instruction|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.525_Loi%281864%29ConcernantLaChargeDeJugeD%2527Instruction_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|publisher=JerseyLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now normal for the Bailiff to convene a panel to advise on salaried appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evidence of Mr M Birt (Bailiff), public hearing 4 May 2010|pages=17–18|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20Bailiff%20Transcript%2020100504%20WM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal from office===
The Bailiff, Deputy Bailiff and members of the [[Jersey Court of Appeal]] 'hold office during good behaviour'.&lt;ref&gt;In relation to the Court of Appeal: {{cite web|title=Court of Appeal (Jersey) Law 1961|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.245_CourtofAppealLaw1961_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm#Toc249951726|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221706/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2F07%2F07.245_CourtofAppealLaw1961_RevisedEdition_1January2010.htm#Toc249951726|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas senior judges in England and Wales who are appointed by Crown may only be removed from office with the consent of both Houses of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior Courts Act (previously known as the Supreme Court Act) 1981, section 11(3)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/54/section/11|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-in-detail/jud-acc-ind/judges-and-parliament|title=Judges and parliament|publisher=Judiciary of England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom [[Secretary of State for Justice]] may dismiss a Jersey judge appointed by the Crown without the agreement [[States of Jersey]]. This happened in 1992, when the then Deputy Bailiff [[Vernon Tomes]] was dismissed from office by the [[Home Secretary]] (the UK minister who at the time was responsible for the [[Crown Dependencies]]) on grounds of his delays in producing written judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=House of Commons|title=Debates vol 208 cc93-4W|date=19 May 1992|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1992/may/19/jersey-bailiff-dismissal#S6CV0208P0_19920519_CWA_184}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|last=Dyer|title='Dismissal of "slow" Judge angers Jersey|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 1992}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cohen|title=Jersey in revolt after Clarke sacks judge|newspaper=The Independent|date=13 May 1992}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Cohen|title=Jersey to review constitutional links with UK|newspaper=The Independent|date=14 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurats hold office up to the age of 72 years. A Jurat who 'in the opinion of the Court, is permanently unable, through physical or mental incapacity, or for any other reason, efficiently to carry out the duties of the office, may be called upon by the Court to resign'. A Jurat who refuses to resign may be removed from office by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the petition of the Superior Number (the Bailiff and five or more Jurats) of the [[Courts of Jersey#Royal Court|Royal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 9 of the Royal Court (Jersey) Law 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bailiff may if he 'thinks fit, terminate the appointment of a Commissioner on the ground of incapacity or misbehaviour'.&lt;ref name="RoyalCourtLawII"/&gt;

The Magistrates, who are also appointed by the Bailiff not the Crown, may not be removed from office 'except by virtue of an Order of Her Majesty in Council'.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2(3) of the {{cite web|title=Loi (1864) concernant la charge de Juge d’Instruction|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.525_Loi%281864%29ConcernantLaChargeDeJugeD%2527Instruction_RevisedEdition_1January2012.htm|publisher=JerseyLaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the Chief Minister informed the [[States of Jersey]] that the Magistrate-Designate, Ian Christmas, has 'agreed not to sit as a judge following a discussion with the former Bailiff as a result of a criminal investigation into an alleged [[fraud]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyQuestions/2009/3%20Deputy%20of%20St%20Martin%20to%20CM%20re%20suspension%20of%20Magistrate%20designate.pdf|title=Extract from States of Jersey Hansard|year=2009|publisher=States of Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=States of Jersey|title=Official Report ('Hansard')|date=8 June 2010|url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=30cbb644c43134fba74ddd68c3b4e9e6_StatesAssembly#_Toc264536235|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111039/http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/Pages/Hansard.aspx?docid=30cbb644c43134fba74ddd68c3b4e9e6_StatesAssembly#_Toc264536235|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|title=Further delay in fraud case|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=15 March 2011|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2011/03/15/further-delay-in-fraud-case/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Christmas was subsequently convicted of one count of fraud and sentenced to fifteen months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/judgments/unreportedjudgments/documents/display.aspx?url=2012%2f12-10-05_AG-v-Lewis_Christmas_Foot_and_Cameron_177.htm|title=Attorney General v Lewis, Christmas, Foot and Cameron (2012) JRC 177|publisher=JerseyLaw|date=5 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224110638/http://www.jerseylaw.je/judgments/unreportedjudgments/documents/display.aspx?url=2012%2F12-10-05_AG-v-Lewis_Christmas_Foot_and_Cameron_177.htm|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the Bailiff's Office has asked the United Kingdom [[Ministry of Justice]] to arrange for a UK judge to undertake a disciplinary investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/07/27/what-next-for-fraud-judge/|title=What next for fraud judge?|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2012/09/25/christmas/|title=New inquiry to decide whether Christmas retains his position|date=25 September 2012|publisher=Jersey Evening Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonymusings.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/ian-christmas-legal-background.html|title=Ian Christmas: the Legal Background|publisher=Tony's musings|date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial independence in Jersey===

====Code of Conduct====
All judges in Jersey are bound by a [http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/BailiffsChambers/Pages/CodeConduct.aspx code of conduct] promulgated by the [[Jersey Judicial Association]] in 2007. This requires judges to 'uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary and perform their duties with competence, diligence and dedication'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of conduct for members of the judiciary of Jersey, paragraph 1|year=2007|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/BailiffsChambers/Pages/CodeConduct.aspx|publisher=Jersey Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ECHR Article 6====
All courts in Jersey are required under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] to be 'independent and impartial'.&lt;ref name="HRLaw"/&gt; In 2000, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] held in ''McGonnell v United Kingdom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2000/62.html|title=McGonnell v United Kingdom (2000) ECHR 62|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was a breach of Article 6 in ''Guernsey'' where the Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff sat as President of the [[States of Guernsey]] when proposed legislation was being debated and then subsequently sat as a judge of the [[Royal Court of Guernsey]] in a case where that legislation was relevant. The Court, noting that there was no suggestion that the Bailiff 'was subjectively biased', stated that the 'mere fact' that this happened was capable of casting doubt on the Bailiff's impartiality. A Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff in Jersey is able to avoid a ''McGonnell'' situation simply by not sitting in the [[Royal Court of Jersey|Royal Court]] in cases concerned with legislation that was debated when he presided in the [[States of Jersey|States]]. The current Bailiff, Mr [[Michael Birt (Bailiff of Jersey)|Michael Birt]] has conceded that 'we probably need to improve our systems to be very compliant with ''McGonnell'' and that one probably ought to keep a running list of those statutes where I have presided so at least I could invite the parties to consider whether they wanted to object or not'.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 46-47, Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers, Public Hearing 4 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent review chaired by [[Lord Carswell]], set up by the [[States of Jersey]], a legal opinion was commissioned from [[Rabinder Singh (Barrister)|Rabinder Singh]] QC in which he expressed the view that 'there is no reason in law why the present constitutional arrangements in respect of the Bailiff should be altered. However, the trend suggests that the tide of history is in favour of reform and that the legal position will be different in 10 years time'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/Pages/StatesReports.aspx?ReportID=491|title=Report into Review of Crown Officers|publisher=Jersey Government|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of Lord Carswell's inquiry concluded that Mr Singh's opinion 'provides an additional reason why the Bailiff should cease to be the President of the States'.&lt;ref&gt;Para 5.16 of Report into Review of Crown Officers&lt;/ref&gt; The [[States of Jersey]] have not accepted this aspect of the Carswell report. Many prominent islanders do not believe that any change is necessary or desirable.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{cite web|first=Reg|last=Jeune|title=Let's not throw out 800 years of history and good governance|publisher=Jersey Evening Post|date=20 December 2010|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2010/12/20/lets-not-throw-out-800-years-of-history-and-good-governance/}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/HowGovernmentWorks/ReviewCrownOfficers/Pages/WrittenSubmissions.aspx|title=Written submissions on role of Crown Officers|publisher=Review of the Roles of the Crown Officers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stuart Syvret litigation====
In recent years, a former [[States of Jersey|State's]] member Mr [[Stuart Syvret]] has argued in legal proceedings in England and Jersey that all members of [[Judiciary of Jersey (list)|the Jersey judiciary]] lack the appearance of independence and impartiality. In March 2009, the High Court in London refused him permission to commence a judicial review claim against [[Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/jersey/7946988.stm |title=Jersey abuse case review rejected |first= |last=Anon|work=[[BBC News]] |date=17 March 2009 |publisher=[[BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=5 September 2011}}; {{cite web |url= http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_jerseynews/displayarticle.asp?id=400612 |title=Syvret loses High Court bid |first= |last=Anon |work=channelonline.tv |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jersey, subsequent proceedings related to a criminal prosecution for a data protection offence (he named a former nurse on his [[blog]], who he said was guilty of murdering patients), judicial reviews and appeals relating to that criminal case, and a separate civil action brought by Syvret against fellow politicians and Law Officers in connection with his removal from office as minister for health.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example:&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Nursing a grievance in Jersey|newspaper=Private Eye (no 1288)|date=13 May 2011|page=30}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Jersey senator jailed over data-breach blog|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2010|page=11}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Hemming shields man|newspaper=Birmingham Evening Mail|date=26 October 2009|page=8}} (referring to Liberal Democrat MP [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]]'s assistance to Syvret)&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Hough|title=Jersey senator to claim asylum at Commons|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 October 2009|page=16}}&lt;BR&gt;{{cite news|title=Charge against senator in abuse cover-up claim|newspaper=The Times|date=20 July 2009|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syvret argues that he cannot have a fair trial in the island and there is a lack of appearance of independence and impartiality because judges are appointed by the [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] and the other judges have attended social events with the Bailiff. Syvret's arguments relating to lack of independence and impartiality have been rejected by the Royal Court and Court of Appeal in Jersey on a number of occasions between 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment of Sir Richard Tucker (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2009) JRC 165 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009/09-08-18_Syvret-v-AG_165.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=18 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105155/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009%2F09-08-18_Syvret-v-AG_165.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgement of Clare Montgomery QC (sitting as a judge of the Court of Appeal) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2009) JCA 181 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009/09-09-04_Syvret-v-AG_JCA181.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=4 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111432/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2009%2F09-09-04_Syvret-v-AG_JCA181.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of Mr Julian Clyde-Smith (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Attorney General (2010) JRC 179 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2010/10-10-08_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_179.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=6 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111747/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2010%2F10-10-08_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_179.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of Jonathan Sumption QC (sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v Chief Minister and others (2011) JRC 116 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-06-20_Syvret-v-Chief_Minister_and_Others_116.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=20 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103945/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-06-20_Syvret-v-Chief_Minister_and_Others_116.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of MS Jones QC (sitting in the Jersey Court of Appeal) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v HM Attorney General (2011) JCA 130 |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-07-05_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA130.htm |publisher=JerseyLaw |date=5 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224095020/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-07-05_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA130.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;BR&gt;Judgment of the Court of Appeal (Michael Beloff QC, Clare Montgomery QC and Christopher Nugee QC) in {{cite web|title=Syvret v HM Attorney General (2011) JCA 146 |publisher=JerseyLaw |url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011/11-07-28_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA146.htm |date=28 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224112152/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Judgments/UnreportedJudgments/Documents/Display.aspx?url=2011%2F11-07-28_Syvret-v-AG_and_Connetable_of_Grouville_JCA146.htm |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jersey legal profession ==
[[File:Institute of Law, St Helier, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Institute of Law, Seale Street, St Helier|upright]]The Jersey legal profession has three types of Jersey-qualified lawyers - Advocates, Solicitors and [[Public notary#United Kingdom|Notaries Public]].&lt;ref name="1997Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.070_AdvocatesandSolicitorsLaw1997_RevisedEdition_1January2009.htm#Toc203181030|title=Advocates and Solicitors Law 1997|publisher=JerseyLaw|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316221753/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2fconsolidated%2f07%2f07.070_AdvocatesandSolicitorsLaw1997_RevisedEdition_1January2009.htm#Toc203181030|archivedate=2012-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/6-7/90|title=Public Notaries Act 1843}} (United Kingdom), section 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advocate#Advocates in the Channel Islands|Advocates]] have rights of audience to represent clients in all courts. Jersey solicitors have no general rights of audience. Notaries have no rights of audience. The Law Society of Jersey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/ Law Society of Jersey ]&lt;/ref&gt; is the professional body responsible for professional conduct. Notaries are regulated by the Faculty Office of the Archbishop of Canterbury through the [[Dean of the Arches]], referred to as the [[Master of the Faculties]], who is normally an English [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facultyoffice.org.uk|title=Faculty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some law firms focus on legal practice relating to Jersey's [[Economy of Jersey#Financial .26 legal services|finance industry]], the largest being: [[Appleby Spurling Hunter|Appleby]]; Bedell Cristin; [[Carey Olsen]]; [[Mourant Ozannes]]; and [[Ogier (law firm)|Ogier]], all of which are regarded as part of the "[[offshore magic circle]]". Smaller firms and sole practitioners also provide a wide range of legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/lawfirms.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613012913/http://www.jerseylawsociety.je/lawfirms.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-06-13|title=Law Firms|publisher=Law Society of Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several law firms now have offices in both Jersey and [[Guernsey]] but the legal professions of the two islands are separate, as they are separate from those in England, Wales and Scotland. Most notaries in Jersey are employed by, or are partners in, local firms of Jersey Advocates or Solicitors, although some are in English solicitors firms or practising purely as notaries, independent of the general legal profession. There is a local Jersey Notaries Society.

The Law Officers of the Crown are responsible for criminal prosecution work and for providing legal advice to the Crown, ministers and other members of the Assembly of the [[States of Jersey]]. The Attorney General and his deputy, the Solicitor General, are non-voting members of the States Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/NonexecLegal/LawOfficers/Pages/index.aspx|title=Law Officers|publisher=Jersey Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of qualifying as a Jersey lawyer is regulated by the Advocates and Solicitors (Jersey) Law 1997&lt;ref name="1997Law"/&gt; and is similar for both advocates and solicitors. Since 2009, candidates for the [[Jersey law]] examinations are required to enrol on the Jersey Law Course run by the Institute of Law, Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawinstitute.ac.je/ Institute of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; They are required to take five compulsory papers: (i) Jersey legal system and constitutional Law; (ii) Law of contract and the law relating to security on moveable property and bankruptcy; (iii) testate and intestate succession; law of immoveable property and conveyancing; and civil and criminal procedure. In addition, candidates must take one of three option papers: (i) company law; (ii) trusts law; or (iii) family law.

The admission of lawyers as Notaries in Jersey is governed by an order of the [[Master of the Faculties]]. It is necessary to show that a prospective Notary has been in actual practise in Jersey as a Jersey-qualified Advocate or Solicitor for a period of 5 years and is required to pass an examination in Notarial Practice.

The Jersey Law Commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcomm.gov.je/ Jersey Law Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; was established by the [[States of Jersey]] in 1996 to keep Jersey [[Law commission|law under review]] and bring forward proposals for law reform.

A '''legal debate''' is a discussion between [[lawyers]], [[legal academics]], [[jurists]], [[politicians]], and others who might have an interest or expertise in the [[law]], about a particular legal issue.

== Overview ==
Legal debates can take many forms, and do not necessarily need to be face-to-face debates.  Most legal debates take place on paper—judges within a court, for example, might debate each other most effectively when the court publishes a decision.  Legal debates include (but are not limited to) the following:

*'''Debates between judges.'''  These debates, as well, will often occur face to face during judicial conferences, but they find their most prominent voice in written opinions.  Splintered U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions present a prominent example.  [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissents with the majority epitomize the nature of judicial legal debate—a debate that often centers around the proper means of interpreting federal statutes or the Constitution.
*'''Debate between politicians.'''  An example of this debate is that between the [[President of the United States]] and the [[United States Congress]] over the ability of the executive power to issue clandestine wiretaps without seeking a warrant.  The legal debate at issue is the scope of executive power vis-a-vis the other branches of government.
*'''General debate within society.'''  Societies always debate the legal order.  The process of electing politicians and lobbying is a form of legal debate: the majority tends to become part of a coalition that agrees on the laws that will be implemented.

== Contemporary issues in legal debates ==
Debates in Western societies often follow broad themes, including

*The balance between state power and civil liberties
*The proper breadth of civil liberties relative to social norms and moral expectations

In the United States, legal debates over the past decade have concerned the following important topics:

*The [[right to privacy]], including the right to have an [[abortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Editors |title= The Abortion Debate: Finding a Forum |journal=Policy Today  |date=2006-06-01 |url=http://www.policytoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=2 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The balance between civil rights and the need for greater security after September 11, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Godoy |first=Maria |title=NSA Wiretapping: The Legal Debate |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2008-02-23 |url=https://www.npr.org/news/specials/nsawiretap/legality.html |accessdate= 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The proper method of interpreting the Constitution
*[[Affirmative Action]]
*[[Welfare reform]]#
*The right to a child

In general, the variety of debates—ranging from basic social policy to grander theory about constitutional design and democratic theory—suggests that legal debates overlap with several other social institutions and expectations.

'''Legal mobilisation''' is a tool available to paralegal and [[advocacy]] groups, to achieve [[Empowerment#Legal empowerment|legal empowerment]] by supporting a marginalized issues of a stakeholder, in negotiating with the other concerned agencies and other stakeholders, by strategic combined use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] along with [[advocacy]], media engagement and social mobilisation.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date= 1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Frances Kahen Zemans (1983) '' the Legal mobilisation is "a desire or want, which is translated into a demand as an assertion of one's rights".'' &lt;ref name=Zemans&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zemans|first1=Frances|title=Legal Mobilization: The Neglected Role of the Law in the Political System|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=Sep 1983|publisher=American Political Science Association|location=USA|volume= 77|issue=3|jstor=1957268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''legal process school''' (sometimes "legal process theory") was a movement within American law that attempted to chart a third way between [[legal formalism]] and [[legal realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Dripps, ''Justice Harlan on Criminal Procedure: Two Cheers for the Legal Process School'', [http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/osjcl/Articles/Volume3_1/Symposium/Dripps_3-1.pdf 3 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 125], 126 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing its name from Hart &amp; Sacks' textbook ''[[The Legal Process (book)|The Legal Process]]'' (along with Hart &amp; Wechsler's textbook ''[[The Federal Courts and the Federal System]]'' considered a primary canonical text of the school), it is associated with scholars such as [[Herbert Wechsler]], [[Henry Hart (lawyer)|Henry Hart]], [[Albert Sacks]] and [[Lon Fuller]], and their students such as [[John Hart Ely]] and [[Alexander Bickel]]. The school grew in the 1950s and 1960s. To this day, the school's influence remains broad.

==Basic precepts==
*'''"Institutional Settlement."''' As the name suggests, the legal process school was deeply interested in the processes by which law is made, and particularly in a federal system, how authority to answer various questions is distributed vertically (as between state and federal governments) and horizontally (as between branches of government) and how this impacts on the legitimacy of decisions. The principle of institutional settlement looks at how society decided: "that law should allocate decisionmaking to the institutions best suited to decide particular questions, and that the decisions arrived at by those institutions must then be respected by other actors in the system, even if those actors would have reached a different conclusion"&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Ernest Young, ''Institutional Settlement in a Globalizing Judicial System'', 54 Duke L. J. 1143, 1150 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Rule of Law.''' Although courts should be aware and respectful of this institutional settlement, courts have an important role to play, and the rule of law "requires the availability of judicial remedies sufficient to vindicate fundamental legal principles."&lt;ref name="fallon"&gt;Richard H. Fallon, Jr., ''Reflections on the Hart and Wechsler Paradigm'', 47 Vand. L. Rev. 953, 964-6 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; "The role of courts in the Legal Process tradition is often similar to that of a point guard on a basketball team: the court takes provisional responsibility for a dispute, but may well decide to pass it off to other actors in the system
*'''"Reasoned Elaboration."''' The legal process school recognized the claims of legal realists that judges do, in fact, make law, and that adjudication is not merely the mechanical deduction from precedent and statutory texts claimed by formalists. Unlike the realists, however, legal process claims that, as Fallon puts it, "while the judicial role is irreducibly creative in some respects, it is limited to the reasoned elaboration of principles and policies that are ultimately traceable to more democratically legitimate decisionmakers." Judges should reason from the totality of the legal materials at issue to reach their conclusions, and while "raw judicial will" sometimes happens, as a matter of observable reality, it is deprecated.&lt;ref name="fallon" /&gt;
*'''"What ''are'' legal materials? The 'anti-positivist' principle."''' Legal process generally, but Hart &amp; Sacks particularly, suggest that the legal materials from which the aforementioned reasoned elaboration must take place are not limited to precedent and statutory text. Rather, as Wells puts it, legal process "permit[s]," and may even "require" that legal materials include "general ethical principles and widely shared social goals ... [because] 'the law rests upon a body of hard-won and deeply-embedded principles and policies.'"&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;Michael Wells, ''Behind the Parity Debate: the Decline of the Legal Process Tradition in the Law of Federal Courts'', 71 B.U.L. Rev. 609 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Hart &amp; Sacks stressed that this did not mean that judges were authorized to impute their own preferences into law, but rather, that there are broad legal authorities embedded in and assumed by narrower texts. This leads legal process to look at purpose and structure as well as text (for example, "federalism," "separation of powers" nor "judicial review" are not explicitly stated in the Constitution, but are eminently clear from the general structure of government delineated therein). "Any particular legal directive must be seen and interpreted in light of the whole body of law."&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;
*'''Neutral principles.''' Courts must reason from legal materials using principles that "in their generality and their neutrality transcend any immediate result that is involved."&lt;ref name="wechsler"&gt;Herbert Wechsler, ''Toward Neutral Principles of Constitutional Law'', 73 Harv. L Rev. 1 (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; A judge must decide a case on reasoning "that he would be willing to follow in other situations to which it applies," which is to say that a principled decision must announce that the case being decided is "an instance of a more inclusive class of cases" and is being "treated in a certain manner because it is held to be proper to treat cases of its type in a certain manner."&lt;ref name="greenawalt"&gt;Kent Greenawalt, ''The Enduring Significance of Neutral Principles'', 78 Colum. L. Rev. 982 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;  When a case or class of cases present questions that cannot be adjudicated through application of neutral principles, courts should refuse to decide such questions: "[t]hey should decline to impose substantive judicial judgments on disputes not capable of resolution through the application of neutral principles to sharply defined sets of facts."&lt;ref name="fallon" /&gt;  In the legal process concept, "the integrity of the judicial process may be compromised if ... [cases are decided on] arguments that extend no further than the case at hand. ... Only by insisting on a level of generality, some distance between the reasons and the facts of the case at hand, can one be certain that judges are actually reasoning from legal materials rather than indulging their own preferences."&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt; When a judge "adopt[s] a general rule, and say[s], 'This is the basis of our decision,' [they] not only constrain lower courts, [they] constrain [themselves] as well. If the next case should have such different facts that [their] political or policy preferences regarding the outcome are quite the opposite, [they] will be unable to indulge those preferences ... hav[ing] committed [themselves] to the governing principle."&lt;ref name="scalia"&gt;[[Antonin Scalia]], ''The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules'', 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Traditional dispute resolution.''' Similar to the directive that courts should not hear disputes that cannot be resolved through neutral principles (i.e. [[political questions]]) is the notion that courts in the American system of government are institutionally limited to resolving the kinds of disputes courts traditionally resolved: "'bipolar' disputes in which each of two contending parties introduces arguments making a claim of right or an accusation of guilt, and in which the judge's task is to choose between them on a reasoned basis."&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt;

Although legal process is no longer popular by name, particularly in the academy, it can be seen as harmonizing with both major modern schools of judicial thought, [[textualism]] and [[purposivism]], depending on which of the foregoing assumptions are emphasized.

'''[[Law]] in [[Asia]]''' is undergoing rapid change and modernisation{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, especially given the economic growth in [[China]] and [[India]]. Asian countries share a substantial heritage with European law{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}, whilst keeping their own distinct identity.

==History==
[[Image:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[preamble]] of the '''Constitution of India''']]
[[History of China|Ancient China]] and [[History of India|ancient India]] had historically independent schools of legal theory and practice such as the ''[[Manusmriti|Laws of Manu]]'' or the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' in India and [[traditional Chinese law]] in China. Because [[Germany]] was a rising power in the late 19th century, and codified [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] is more 'exportable' than large bodies of common law jurisprudence, the German Civil Code has been highly influential for most oriental legal systems, and forms the basis of civil law in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In [[China]], the German Civil Code was introduced in the later years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and formed the basis of the law of the [[Republic of China]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} which remains in force in [[Taiwan]]. The current legal infrastructure in the [[People's Republic of China]] reflects influences from the German-based civil law, English-based common law in Hong Kong, Soviet-influenced [[Socialist law]], United States-style banking and securities law, and [[traditional Chinese law]]. In India, and other previous members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], English common law forms the basis of private law.

Legal Tech companies are generally [[startup companies|startups]] founded with the purpose of [[disruptive innovation|disrupting]] the traditionally conservative legal market.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Bob|title=Four Areas of Legal Ripe for Disruption by Smart Startups|url=http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/12/smart-startups/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Law Technology Today|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[TechCrunch]], as of December 2014, "legal technology is booming, with companies attempting to disrupt the legal space at every level and from every angle"&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Legal Tech Startups Have A Short History And A Bright Future|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/06/legal-tech-startups-have-a-short-history-and-a-bright-future/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=TechCrunch|date=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forbes]] noted in February 2015 that there were “hundreds of legal startups popping up all over the US and Europe”.&lt;ref name="Forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Juetten|first1=Mary|title=The Future Of Legal Tech: It's Not As Scary As Lawyers Think|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjuetten/2015/02/19/legal-tech-or-tech-legal/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Legal technology traditionally referred to the application of technology and software to help law firms with [[legal matter management|practice management]], [[document management system|document storage]], [[invoicing|billing]], [[accounting]] and [[electronic discovery]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hibnick|first1=Eva|title=What is Legal Tech?|url=http://www.thelawinsider.com/insider-news/what-is-legal-tech|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=The Law Insider|date=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011, Legal Tech has evolved to be associated more with technology startups disrupting the [[practice of law]] by giving people access to online software that reduces or in some cases eliminates the need to consult a lawyer, or by connecting people with lawyers more efficiently through online marketplaces and lawyer-matching websites.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt;

==Industry context==
The legal industry is widely seen to be conservative and traditional, with Law Technology Today noting that "in 50 years, the customer experience at most law firms has barely changed".&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  Reasons for this include the fact law firms face weaker cost-cutting incentives than other professions (since they pass disbursements directly to their client) and are seen to be risk averse (as a minor technological error could have significant financial consequences for a client).&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;

However, the growth of the hiring by businesses of in-house counsel and their increasing sophistication, together with the development of email, has led to clients placing increasing cost and time pressure on their lawyers.&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"/&gt;  In addition, there are increasing incentives for lawyers to become technologically competent, with the [[American Bar Association]] voting in August 2012 to amend the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] to require lawyers to keep abreast of "the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Client-Lawyer Relationship, Rule 1.1 Competence - Comment|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/comment_on_rule_1_1.html|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambrogi|first1=Robert|title=The Cloud Has Landed: 10 Legal Tech Innovations and What They Mean|url=http://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=88&amp;Issue=4&amp;ArticleID=23997|website=Wisconsin Lawyer|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the saturation of the market leading many lawyers to look for cutting-edge ways to compete.  &lt;ref name="TechCrunch1"/&gt; The exponential growth in the volume of documents (mostly email) that must be reviewed for litigation cases has greatly accelerated the adoption of technology used in eDiscovery, with elements of machine language and artificial intelligence being incorporated and cloud-based services being adopted by law firms.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Investment in Legal Tech is predominantly focused in the United States with more than $254 million invested in 2014 in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaltransformationinstitute.com/blog/2014/3/10/legal-startup-funding-2014-so-far |title=Legal Startup Funding &amp;#124; 2014 So Far [Update 10/24/14&amp;#93; — LTI |website=Legaltransformationinstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; however there is significant growth worldwide.&lt;ref name="Forbes2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Basha|title=Is The Legal Tech Boom Over?

[[Stanford Law School]] has started CodeX, the Center for Legal Informatics, an interdisciplinary research center, which also incubates companies started by law students and computer scientists. Some companies that have come out of the program include [[Lex Machina]] and [[Legal.io]].&lt;ref name="lawinsider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stanford Law School |url=https://www.law.stanford.edu/organizations/programs-and-centers/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics |title=CodeX - Programs and Centers - Stanford Law School |website=Law.stanford.edu |date=2016-11-27 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[legal code]] was a common feature of the legal systems of the ancient Middle East. The Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100-2050 BC), then the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi (c. 1760 BC), are amongst the earliest originating in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. In the Roman empire, a number of codifications were developed, such as the Twelve Tables of Roman law (first compiled in 450 BC) and the Corpus Juris Civilis of Justinian, also known as the Justinian Code (429 - 534 CE). In ancient China, the first comprehensive criminal code was the Tang Code, created in 624 CE in the Tang Dynasty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9692">[[File:Multinetworks.PNG|500px|thumb|right|Table of multidiciplinary networks from websites.]]
'''Multidisciplinary professional services networks''' are organizations formed by law, accounting and other professional services firms to offer clients new [[multidisciplinary approach]]es  solving increasingly complex issues.  They are a type of [[Professional services networks|professional services network]] which operates to provide services to their members. They operate in the same way as [[Accounting networks and associations|accounting firm networks and associations]] and [[law firm network]]s. They do not practice a profession such as law or accounting but provide services to members so they can serve clients needs.Aim is to provide members involved in doing business internationally with access to experienced, tried and tested, reliable, and responsive professional advisers who know their local jurisdiction intimately as well as the intricacies of cross border business.

There are 10 multidisciplinary networks. The largest are: [[Alliott Group]], MSI Global Alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msiglobal.org/|title=MSI|author=|date=|work=MSIGlobal.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morison International,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morisoninternational.com/|title=Morison KSi - Morison International and KS International have merged to form Morison KSi|author=|date=|work=MorisonInternational.com|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geneva Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ggi.com/|title=Home|author=|date=3 December 2015|work=GGI.com|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Practice Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipg-online.org/NL/Home.aspx/|title=404|author=|date=|work=IPG-online.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WSG - World Services Group]] and Russell Bedford International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russellbedford.com/|title=Russell Bedford global accounting network - CPA firm association - Audit - Tax - Consulting|author=|date=|work=RussellBedford.com|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These networks have more than 100 member firms in as many as 90 countries in hundreds of offices. The members employ thousands of professionals.

== History ==
Multidisciplinary networks are not new but found in a number of professions.  They became important during the end of the 1990s when the accounting firms began to expand to the legal profession. The history is well documented.&lt;ref&gt;Mijares, A H, The SEC’s ban on Legal serves by Audit firms: Amendments to Rule 2.01 of Regulations S-X under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. 36 U.S. F. L. Rev 209–236 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[American Bar Association]] Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice refers to five multidisciplinary models.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Bar Association]] Commission on Multidisciplinary Practices, Final Report, Appendix C, Reporter’s notes, July 2000&lt;/ref&gt; They are the cooperative, [[command and control]], ancillary practice, network and multidisciplinary partnership models.

=== Big Six accounting firms – multidisciplinary practices ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}The [[multidisciplinary]] issues first arose in the 1940s but was dealt with by the [[American Bar Association]] prohibiting lawyers working for accounting firms to represent clients before the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]].&lt;ref&gt;ABA Information Op. 269 (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of multidisciplinary practice began when the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big 4 accounting firms]]  reached their natural growth limits. Accounting, auditing and tax services could generate only a finite amount of revenue for the Big 6. The Big 4’s concept was simple: use the extensive list of clients to market non-traditional accounting services such as legal, recruitment, [[risk management]], technology consulting, etc. The objective was to bring these non-traditional services “in-house” using the time-tested network model. 

Having reached their natural limit on growth the Big 4 branched out to become multidisciplinary in legal, technology, and employment services. Since the essential infrastructure was in place, it was thought to be relatively simple to incorporate other services into the existing network. The expansion could easily be financed using revenue from the traditional services. As a network, it was natural to create independent entities in these other professions which themselves could be part of the network. The method and structures varied from firm to firm but the fundamental premise was the sharing of revenue between lawyers and accountants.

The accounting firms were initially very successful in creating these alternative businesses. Soon a number of Big 6 firms had multi-billion dollar technology consulting businesses. Other services were more difficult to bring in-house. Some, like legal services, demanded a different approach because of ethical considerations. The key factor among such different approaches is an internal control system within a firm.

=== Reaction of the legal profession===
The initial to expand to legal services focus was on the United States which represented the largest potential market for these services. In Europe and South America the bar rules were not as developed as in the United States, and therefore did not restrict the sharing of revenues. The basis for this expansion was the law firm network that  established under the umbrella of the Big Six.&lt;ref&gt;These networks had names like the E&amp;Y Legal Network, Andersen Legal Network and Landwell. Only Landwell remains with 6 member firms. [http://www.landwellglobal.com/gx/eng/aboutus/countries/au_gx_eng_count_index.html Countries in the Landwell network]&lt;/ref&gt;  The issues were sharing profits with accountants and other professionals and the possible conflicts of interest.

When the Big 6 began its expansion to the legal profession, it was met with fierce opposition from law firms and bar associations.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, “Accounting Firms Covert Forbidden Fruit: Piece of the U.S. Legal Market, Wall Street Journal,” p.B1 (May 31, 2000), Poe, “Multidisciplinary Practice,” Defense Counsel J. 245 (Apr. 2000), Cannon, “The Big Six Moves In” 50 Int’l Fin. L. Rev. 49 (October 1997), “Andersen’s Giant Step Towards World Law” Australian Fin. Rev. 33 (Jan. 1998), Rubenstein, (Accounting Firm Legal Practices Expand Rapidly. How the Big Six Firms Are Practicing Law in Europe: Europe First and then the World?” Corp. Legal Times 1 (Nov 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers saw that the accounting profession would subsume the legal profession with its vast resources.&lt;ref&gt;In 2011, the UK [[House of Lords]] completed an inquiry into the financial crisis, and called for an [[Office of Fair Trading]] investigation into the dominance of the Big Four. Adam Jones, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/358b366e-59fa-11e0-ba8d-00144feab49a.html Auditors criticized for role in financial crisis], ''Financial Times'', 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Commissions, panels and committees were established by legal and accounting firms to argue their positions. The American Bar Association established committees and taskforces to address the issue, but the problem spread outside of the United States, first to Europe but then to other countries where lawyers were not protected from this new foreign competition.&lt;ref&gt;McGarry, S. Multidisciplinary Practices and Partnerships, American Lawyer Media Publishing, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Government agencies were enlisted. For more than five (5) years the debate escalated.  

This movement ended abruptly with the fall of [[Arthur Andersen]] as a result of its association with [[Enron]]. [[Sarbanes Oxley]] followed, which effectively ended this trend of multisdisciplinary networks established by the Big 5.

=== Enron and Sarbanes–Oxley ===
There was, however, a fatal flaw in the multidisciplinary network concepts of the Big 6.  The raison d’etre of the Big 6 was to audit public companies. Each service which is provided to an audited client contained an inherent conflict of interest. This conflict was illustrated by the perfect storm created by [[Enron]]. The additional services that Arthur Anderson was offering created a conflict in their role as the auditor. Multidisciplinary networks by the accounting firms were DOA. The final nail in the coffin was [[Sarbanes Oxley]] which meant that the accounting firms had to divest their consulting practices.&lt;ref&gt;Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multidisciplinary networks today ==
The multidisciplinary network model was not dead but transformed to account for the issues. If the member firms were themselves independent, there was no prohibition on having a multidisciplinary network. This was recognized by the ABA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/commission_multidisciplinary_practice.html/|title=Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice  - The Center for Professional Responsibility|author=|date=|work=AmericanBar.org|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are at least eleven networks. The largest are in the legal and accounting professions.  A few of the legal and accounting networks include [[investment banking]]. The primary networks are focused on tax, employment, intellectual property, insurance and immigration.

'''''Natural Law and Natural Rights''''' is a 1980 book by the philosopher [[John Finnis]]. A restatement of [[natural law]] doctrine, it is considered a seminal contribution to the [[philosophy of law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oxf20|Oxford University Press 2013]].&lt;/ref&gt; The work was commissioned by [[H. L. A. Hart]] for the Clarendon Law Series.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;[[#Geo05|George 2005]]. p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Finnis argues that social theory cannot be value free and that Humean ethics, unlike genuine (as opposed to neo-scholastic) Thomist ethics, commits a [[naturalistic fallacy]]. He bases his radically rearticulated Aristotelian political and legal theory on dialectically defended first principles of [[practical reason]] and methodological principles of practical reasonableness (morality).&lt;ref name="George" /&gt; He defends the following basic human goods: life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability (friendship), practical reasonableness, and religion, defined as "all those beliefs that can be called matters of ultimate concern; questions about the point of human existence."&lt;ref name="Buckle"&gt;[[#Buc97|Buckle 1997]]. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosophy lecturer Stephen Buckle sees Finnis's list of proposed basic goods as plausible, but notes that Finnis's account of the basic requirements of practical reasonableness is more controversial. Buckle sees Finnis's requirement of "respect for every basic value in every act" as intended both to rule out [[consequentialism]] in ethics and also to support the moral viewpoint of the [[Catholic Church]] on a range of contentious issues, including [[contraception]] and [[masturbation]], which in his view undermines its plausibility.&lt;ref name="Buckle" /&gt;

{{distinguish|negative liberties|positive liberties}}
'''Negative and positive rights''' are [[rights]] that oblige either action (''positive rights'') or inaction (''negative rights''). These obligations may be of either a [[natural and legal rights|legal or moral]] character. The notion of positive and negative rights may also be applied to [[liberty rights]].

To take an example involving [[Party (law)|two parties in a court of law]]: Adrian has a ''negative right to x'' against Clay [[if and only if]] Clay is ''prohibited'' from acting upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. In contrast, Adrian has a ''positive right to x'' against Clay if and only if Clay is obliged to act upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. A case in point, if Adrian has a ''negative right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to refrain from killing Adrian; while if Adrian has a ''positive right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of Adrian.

Rights considered ''negative rights'' may include [[civil and political rights]] such as [[freedom of speech]], life, [[property (ownership right)|private property]], freedom from [[violent crime]], [[freedom of religion]], ''[[habeas corpus]]'', a [[fair trial]], and freedom from [[slavery]].

Rights considered ''positive rights'', as initially proposed in 1979 by the Czech jurist [[Karel Vasak]], may include other civil and political rights such as [[police]] protection of person and property and the [[right to counsel]], as well as [[economic, social and cultural rights]] such as [[right to food|food]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[public education]], [[employment]], [[national security]], [[military]], [[right to health|health care]], [[social security]], [[right to internet access|internet access]], and a minimum [[right to an adequate standard of living|standard of living]]. In the [[three generations of human rights|"three generations"]] account of human rights, negative rights are often associated with the first generation of rights, while positive rights are associated with the second and third generations.

Some philosophers (see criticisms) disagree that the negative-positive rights distinction is useful or valid.

==Overview==
Under the theory of positive and negative rights, a negative right is a right ''not to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group—a government, for example—usually in the form of abuse or [[coercion]].  As such, negative rights exist unless someone acts to ''negate'' them. A positive right is a right ''to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group.  In other words, for a positive right to be exercised, someone else's actions must be ''added'' to the equation. In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the right holder, while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the right holder. In the framework of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[categorical imperative]], negative rights can be associated with [[Categorical imperative#Perfect duty|perfect duties]] while positive rights can be connected to [[Categorical imperative#Imperfect duty|imperfect duties]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Belief in a distinction between positive and negative rights is usually maintained, or emphasized, by [[libertarianism|libertarian]]s, who believe that positive rights do not exist until they are created by contract. The [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] lists both positive and negative rights (but does not identify them as such). The constitutions of most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] guarantee negative rights, but not all include positive rights. Nevertheless, positive rights are often guaranteed by other laws, and the majority of liberal democracies provide their citizens with publicly funded education, health care, social security and [[unemployment benefit]]s.

==When they conflict==

{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}

Rights are often spoken of as [[natural rights|inalienable]] and sometimes even [[moral absolutism|absolute]]. However, in practice this is often taken as [[graded absolutism]]; rights are ranked by degree of importance, and violations of lesser ones are accepted in the course of preventing violations of greater ones. Thus, even if the right not to be killed is inalienable, the corresponding obligation on others to refrain from killing is generally understood to have at least one exception: [[right of self-defense|self-defense]]. Certain widely accepted negative obligations (such as the obligations to refrain from theft, murder, etc.) are often considered [[prima facie]], meaning that the legitimacy of the obligation is accepted "on its face"; but even if not questioned, such obligations may still be ranked for ethical analysis.

Thus a thief may have a negative obligation not to steal, and a [[police officer]] may have a negative obligation not to tackle people&amp;mdash;but a police officer tackling the thief easily meets the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that he acted justifiably, since his was a breach of a lesser obligation and negated the breach of a greater obligation. Likewise a shopkeeper or other passerby may also meet this burden of proof when tackling the thief. But if any of those individuals pulled a gun and shot the (unarmed) thief for stealing, most modern societies would not accept that the burden of proof had been met. The obligation not to kill&amp;mdash;being universally regarded as one of the highest, if not the highest obligation&amp;mdash;is so much greater than the obligation not to steal that a breach of the latter does not justify a breach of the former. Most modern societies insist that other, very serious ethical questions need come into play before stealing could justify killing.

Positive obligations confer duty. But as we see with the police officer, exercising a duty may violate negative obligations (e.g. not to overreact and kill). For this reason, in ethics positive obligations are almost never considered ''[[prima facie]]''. The greatest negative obligation may have just one exception&amp;mdash;one higher obligation of self-defense&amp;mdash;but even the greatest positive obligations generally require more complex ethical analysis. For example, one could easily justify failing to help, not just one, but a great many injured children quite ethically in the case of [[triage]] after a disaster. This consideration has led ethicists to agree in a general way that positive obligations are usually junior to negative obligations because they are not reliably ''prima facie''. Some critics of positive rights implicitly suggest that because positive obligations are not reliably ''prima facie'' they must always be agreed to through contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html "Individual rights"], ''Ayn Rand Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century philosopher [[Frédéric Bastiat]] summarized the conflict between these negative and positive rights by saying:
{{quote|M. de Lamartine wrote me one day: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first half." And, in fact, it is quite impossible for me to separate the word "fraternity" from the word "voluntary." It is quite impossible for me to conceive of fraternity as legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice being legally trampled underfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to [[Jan Narveson]], the view of some that there is no distinction between negative and positive rights on the ground that negative rights require police and courts for their enforcement is "mistaken". He says that the question between what one has a right to do and who if anybody enforces it are separate issues. If rights are only negative then it simply means no one has a duty to enforce them, although individuals have a right to use any non-forcible means to gain the cooperation of others in protecting those rights. Therefore, he says "the distinction between negative and positive is quite robust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Narveson - Libertarianism: A Philosophical Introduction|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210122955/http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|url=http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|author=Narveson, Jan|work=Against Politics|archivedate=February 10, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libertarians]] hold that positive rights, which would include a right to be protected, do not exist until they are created by contract. However, those who hold this view do not mean that police, for example, are not obligated to protect the rights of citizens. Since they contract with their employers to defend citizens from violence, then they have created that obligation to their employer. A negative right to life allows an individual to defend his life from others trying to kill him, or obtain voluntary assistance from others to defend his life&amp;mdash;but he may not force others to defend him, because he has no natural right to be provided with defense. To force a person to defend one's own negative rights, or the negative rights of a third party, would be to violate that person's negative rights.

Other advocates of the view that there is a distinction between negative and positive rights argue that the presence of a police force or army is not due to any positive right to these services that citizens claim, but rather because they are [[natural monopolies]] or [[public goods]]&amp;mdash;features of any human society that arise naturally, even while adhering to the concept of negative rights only. [[Robert Nozick]] discusses this idea at length in his book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.{{ref|nozick}}

===In medicine===
In the field of [[medicine]], positive rights of [[patient]]s often conflict with negative rights of [[physician]]s.  In controversial areas such as [[abortion]] and [[assisted suicide]], medical professionals may not wish to offer certain services for moral or philosophical reasons. If enough practitioners opt out as a result of conscience, a right granted by [[conscience clause]] statutes in many jurisdictions, patients may not have any means of having their own positive rights fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/do-we-need-a-pro-choice-l_b_178456.html|title=Do We Need a Pro-Choice Litmus Test for Obstetricians?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case of [[Janet Murdock]], a Montana woman who could not find any physician to assist her suicide in 2009.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/big-sky-dilemma-must-doct_b_275034.html|title=Big Sky Dilemma: Must Doctors Help Their Patients Die?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy over positive and negative rights in medicine has become a focal point in the ongoing public debate between conservative ethicist [[Wesley J. Smith]] and bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel]].&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley J.|url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/secondhandsmoke/2009/09/03/right-to-die-means-a-physician-duty-to-kill/|title=The 'Right to Die' Means a Physician Duty to Kill?|date=3 September 2009|website=First Things|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing ''[[Baxter v. Montana]]'', Appel has written:
{{quote|Medical licenses are a limited commodity, reflecting an artificial shortage created by a partnership between Congress and organizations representing physicians&amp;mdash;with medical school seats and residency positions effectively allotted by the government, much like radio frequencies. Physicians benefit from this arrangement in that a smaller number of physicians inevitably leads to increased rates of reimbursement. There's nothing inherently wrong with this arrangement. However, it belies any claim that doctors should have the same right to choose their customers as barbers or babysitters. Much as the government has been willing to impose duties on radio stations (e.g., indecency codes, equal time rules) that would be impermissible if applied to newspapers, Montana might reasonably consider requiring physicians, in return for the privilege of a medical license, to prescribe medication to the dying without regard to the patient's intent.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;}}

Smith replies that this is "taking the duty to die and transforming it into a duty to kill", which he argues "reflects a profound misunderstanding of the government’s role".&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Aid Pakistan Truck.jpeg|thumb|right|180px|A right to adequate nutrition requires duties to avoid stealing, but also duties to act in ways that protect or repair the delivery of the supplies. The right cannot be fully guaranteed by only positive, or else only negative duties; it needs both.]]
Presumably, if a person has positive rights it implies that other people have positive duties (to take certain actions); whereas negative rights imply that others have negative duties (to avoid certain other actions). Philosopher [[Henry Shue]] is skeptical; he believes that all rights (regardless of whether they seem more "negative" or "positive") requires both kinds of duties at once. In other words, Shue says that honouring a right will require avoidance (a "negative" duty) but also protective or reparative actions ("positive" duties). The negative positive distinction may be a matter of emphasis; it is therefore unhelpful to describe ''any right'' as though it requires only one of the two types of duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights/&gt;

To Shue, rights can always be understood as confronting "standard threats" against humanity. Dealing with standard threats requires all kinds of duties, which may be divided across time (e.g. "if avoiding the harmful behaviour fails, begin to repair the damages"), but also divided across people. The point is that every right provokes all 3 types of behaviour (avoidance, protection, repair) to some degree. Dealing with a threat like murder, for instance, will require one individual to practice avoidance (e.g. the potential murderer must stay calm), others to protect (e.g. the police officer, who must stop the attack, or the bystander, who may be obligated to call the police), and others to repair (e.g. the doctor who must resuscitate a person who has been attacked). Thus, even the negative right not to be killed can only be guaranteed with the help of some positive duties. Shue goes further, and maintains that the negative and positive rights distinction can be harmful, because it may result in the neglect of necessary duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights&gt;Shue, Henry (1980). Chapters 1-2 of ''[[Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and U.S. Foreign Policy]]''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

James P. Sterba makes similar criticisms. He holds that any right can be made to appear either positive or negative depending on the language used to define it. He writes:
{{quote|What is at stake is the liberty of the poor not to be interfered with in ''taking from the surplus possessions of the rich'' what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs. Needless to say, libertarians would want to deny that the poor have this liberty. But how could they justify such a denial? As this liberty of the poor has been specified, it is not a positive right to receive something, but a negative right of non-interference.(emphasis added){{ref|sterba}}}}
Sterba has rephrased the traditional "positive right" to provisions, and put it in the form of a sort of "negative right" ''not to be prevented'' from taking the resources on their own.. Thus, all rights may not only require both "positive" and "negative" duties, but it seems that rights that do not involve forced labor can be phrased positively or negatively at will.{{ref|sterba}} The distinction between positive and negative may not be very useful, or justified, as rights requiring the provision of labor can be rephrased from "[[right to education]]" or "[[right to health|right to health care]]" to "right to take surplus money to pay teachers" or "right to take surplus money to pay doctors".

A '''pocket part''' is a special document located inside the back cover of certain hardcover legal [[reference work|reference books]].&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=Kent C.|title=Legal Information: How to Find It, How to Use It|date=1999|publisher=The Oryx Press|location=Phoenix|isbn=9780897749633|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BP5C6os40ToC&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legal research]]ers consult it to ensure that the most current law is examined.  

A legal reference book designed to be used with a pocket part subscription comes in the form of a sturdy hardcover book with a large pocket built into the back cover.  At regular intervals (either annually or quarterly), the publisher sends out a new pocket part, which is a [[Saddle stitch stapler|saddle-stapled]] [[pamphlet]] printed on cheap [[newsprint]].  The part comes with a thick card stapled or glued to one cover, and that card is inserted into the pocket to hold the pocket part inside the book which it updates.  The task of regularly replacing pocket parts is one of the major chores of operating a [[law library]].  

At the time of publication, the book is organized into numbered sections which are usually several paragraphs in length.  A reader of the book would first identify and consult the section in which they are interested, then consult the pocket part to ensure that the section has not been amended, deleted, or superseded in the years since the hardcover book was printed.  If the relevant section is omitted from the pocket part, then the reader may safely assume that the version of the section in the book itself is still current (at least as far as the author, editor and/or publisher are aware).  

Since the law is always changing, a pocket part may eventually grow into a separate softcover booklet to be shelved next to its hardcover counterpart.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;  Eventually, when a pocket part becomes nearly as big as its parent book (because most of the parent book's sections have changed since it was originally released), the publisher sends out a new hardcover volume with all the intervening changes incorporated, and directs subscribers to discard the old volume and pocket part.&lt;ref name="Olson" /&gt;  Then the process starts again.  

This tedious method of updating and using legal books made sense in the days when each page of a hardcover book was [[typesetting|typeset]] by hand from raw copy.  It was easier to typeset a small 30-page pamphlet every year, rather than an entire 300-page book. 

Today, many legal reference books are now maintained in real time on legal databases as "living" [[electronic documents]] with all amendments continuously merged in.  Modern [[imagesetter]]s, [[platesetter]]s, [[desktop publishing]] software, and [[offset printing]] have almost completely automated the process of typesetting such books. 

Therefore, many newer legal books are now simply republished every year (or every other year) in the form of easily recyclable paperback books; the [[Oregon Revised Statutes]] are an example of this newer practice.

{{Sociology}}
'''Positivism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] stating that certain ("positive") knowledge is based on [[natural phenomena]] and their properties and relations. Thus, information derived from [[sensory experience]], interpreted through [[reason]] and [[logic]], forms the exclusive source of all certain knowledge.&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"/&gt; Positivism holds that valid knowledge (certitude or [[truth]]) is found only in this [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'' knowledge]].

Verified data (positive facts) received from the senses are known as [[empirical evidence]]; thus positivism is based on [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"&gt;John J. Macionis, Linda M. Gerber, ''Sociology'', Seventh Canadian Edition, [[Pearson Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism also holds that [[society]], like the physical world, operates according to general [[Scientific law|laws]]. [[Introspection|Introspective]] and [[intuitive knowledge]] is rejected, as are [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] because metaphysical and theological claims cannot be verified by sense experience. Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Manion et al." &gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Louis |year=2007 |title=Research Methods In Education |pages=9 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8527.2007.00388_4.x |journal=British Journal of Educational Studies |volume=55 |last2=Maldonado |first2=Antonio |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issue=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the modern sense of the approach was formulated by the philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.sociologyguide.com/thinkers/Auguste-Comte.php |title=Auguste Comte | encyclopedia = Sociology Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte argued that, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws, so does society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed positivism into a ''[[Religion of Humanity]]''.

==Etymology==
The English noun ''positivism'' was re-imported in the 19th century from the French word ''positivisme'', derived from ''positif'' in its philosophical sense of 'imposed on the mind by experience'. The corresponding adjective (lat. ''positīvus'') has been used in a similar sense to discuss law ([[positive law]] compared to [[natural law]]) since the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le petit Robert'' s. v. ''positivisme''; ''OED'' s. v. ''positive''&lt;/ref&gt;''

Positivism is part of a more general ancient quarrel between [[philosophy]] and [[poetry]], notably laid out by [[Plato]] and later reformulated as a quarrel between the sciences and the [[humanities]],&lt;ref name="Egan1997p114"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Egan |first1=Kieran |author-link1=Kieran Egan (educationist) |year=1997 |title=The Educated Mind |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=115–116 |isbn=978-0-226-19036-5|quote=Positivism is marked by the final recognition that science provides the only valid form of knowledge and that facts are the only possible objects of knowledge; philosophy is thus recognized as essentially no different from science [...] Ethics, politics, social interactions, and all other forms of human life about which knowledge was possible would eventually be drawn into the orbit of science [...] The positivists' program for mapping the inexorable and immutable laws of matter and society seemed to allow no greater role for the contribution of poets than had Plato.

J. ''Introduction to Ion.'' London: [[Penguin Books]], 1987, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911) popularized the distinction between [[Geisteswissenschaft]] (humanities) and Naturwissenschaften ([[natural science|natural sciences]]).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA27 p.27]&lt;/ref&gt;

The consideration that laws in physics may not be absolute but relative, and, if so, this might be more true of social sciences,&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; was stated, in different terms, by [[G. B. Vico]] in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista Vico, ''Principi di scienza nuova'', ''Opere'', ed. Fausto Nicolini (Milan: R. Ricciardi, 1953), p. 365–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico, in contrast to the positivist movement, asserted the superiority of the science of the human mind (the humanities, in other words), on the grounds that natural sciences tell us nothing about the inward aspects of things.&lt;ref name="MoreraEsteve1990p13"&gt;Morera, Esteve (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I44OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p.13 ''Gramsci's Historicism: A Realist Interpretation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positivists===
Positivism asserts that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific.&lt;ref name="Larrain1979p197"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larrain |first1=Jorge |year=1979 |title=The Concept of Ideology |location=London |publisher=Hutchinson |page=197 |quote=one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) and [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) believed the [[scientific method]], the circular dependence of theory and observation, must replace [[metaphysics]] in the [[history]] of thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) reformulated sociological positivism as a foundation of [[social research]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"&gt;{{cite book |author=Craig J. Calhoun|title=Classical Sociological Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA103 |year=2002|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-0-631-21348-2|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911), in contrast, fought strenuously against the assumption that only explanations derived from science are valid.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; He reprised the argument, already found in Vico, that scientific explanations do not reach the inner nature of phenomena&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; and it is humanistic [[knowledge]] that gives us insight into thoughts, feelings and desires.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; Dilthey was in part influenced by the [[Historism|historicism]] of [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt;

===Antipositivism===
{{main article|Antipositivism}}
At the turn of the 20th century the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], rejected the doctrine, thus founding the antipositivist tradition in sociology. Later antipositivists and [[critical theorist]]s have associated positivism with "[[scientism]]"; science ''as [[ideology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas]], ''Technik und Wissenschaft als Ideologie'', Frankfurt am Main: [[Suhrkamp]], 1968, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his career (1969),&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg (1969) ''[[The Part and The Whole]]''&lt;/ref&gt; German theoretical physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]], Nobel laureate for pioneering work in [[quantum mechanics]], distanced himself from positivism by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The positivists have a simple solution: the world must be divided into that which we can say clearly and the rest, which we had better pass over in silence. But can any one conceive of a more pointless philosophy, seeing that what we can say clearly amounts to next to nothing? If we omitted all that is unclear we would probably be left with completely uninteresting and trivial tautologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=Werner|authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|editor=Ruth Nanda Nanshen|others=Translator: [[Arnold J. Pomerans]]|title=Werner Heisenberg - Physics and Beyond - Encounters and Conversations|series=World Perspectives|volume=42|year=1971|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York|page=213|chapter=Positivism, Metaphysics and Religion|lccn=78095963|oclc=15379872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Logical positivism and postpositivism===
{{main article|Logical positivism|Postpositivism}}
In the early 20th century, logical positivism—a descendant of Comte's basic thesis but an independent movement—sprang up in [[Vienna Circle|Vienna]] and grew to become one of the dominant schools in Anglo-American philosophy and the [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition. Logical positivists (or 'neopositivists') rejected metaphysical speculation and attempted to reduce statements and propositions to pure [[logic]]. Strong critiques of this approach by philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] have been highly influential, and led to the development of [[postpositivism]].

===In historiography===
In [[historiography]] the debate on positivism has been characterized by the quarrel between positivism and [[historicism]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; (Historicism is also sometimes termed ''[[historism]]'' in the German tradition.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Boudon]] and [[François Bourricaud]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=O9ae9kWCtHkC&amp;pg=PA198 ''A Critical Dictionary of Sociology''], [[Routledge]], 1989: "Historicism", p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against positivist approaches in historiography include that [[history]] differs from sciences like [[physics]] and [[ethology]] in [[Theory|subject matter]] and [[Methodology|method]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"/&gt; That much of what history studies is nonquantifiable, and therefore to quantify is to lose in precision. Experimental methods and mathematical models do not generally apply to history, and it is not possible to formulate general (quasi-absolute) laws in history.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA28 p.28]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other fields===
Positivism in the social sciences is usually characterized by [[quantitative approach]]es and the proposition of quasi-absolute laws. A significant exception to this trend is represented by [[cultural anthropology]], which tends naturally toward [[qualitative research|qualitative]] approaches.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"&gt;Wallace, Edwin R.  and Gach, John (2008) ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology: With an Epilogue on Psychiatry and the Mind-Body Relation.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA14 p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]] the positivist movement was influential in the development of [[operationalism]]. The 1927 philosophy of science book ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' in particular, which was originally intended for physicists, coined the term [[operational definition]], which went on to dominate psychological method for the whole century.&lt;ref name="Koch1992p275"&gt;Koch, Sigmund (1992) ''Psychology's Bridgman vs. Bridgman's Bridgman: An Essay in Reconstruction.'', in ''Theory and Psychology'' vol. 2 no. 3  (1992) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], practising researchers tend to emulate the methodological assumptions of classical positivism, but only in a ''de facto'' fashion: the majority of economists do not explicitly concern themselves with matters of epistemology.&lt;ref name="Boland2012"&gt;[http://positivists.org/blog/economic-positivism Lawrence A. Boland, ''Economic Positivism'' positivists.org 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic thinker Friedrich Hayek (see  "Law, Legislation and Liberty") rejected positivism in the social sciences as hopelessly limited in comparison to evolved and divided knowledge. For example, much (positivist) legislation falls short in contrast to pre-literate or incompletely defined common or evolved law. In [[jurisprudence]], "[[legal positivism]]" essentially refers to the rejection of [[natural law]]; thus its common meaning with philosophical positivism is somewhat attenuated and in recent generations generally emphasizes the authority of human political structures as opposed to a "scientific" view of law.

In the early 1970s, urbanists of the positivist-quantitative school like [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] started to question the positivist approach itself, saying that the arsenal of scientific theories and methods developed so far in their camp were "incapable of saying anything of depth and profundity" on the real problems of contemporary cities.&lt;ref name="Portugali2012p51"&gt;Portugali, Juval and Han Meyer, Egbert Stolk (2012) ''Complexity Theories of Cities Have Come of Age'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2VZCQhvfBpIC&amp;pg=PA51 p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 20th century sociology===
In contemporary social science, strong accounts of positivism have long since fallen out of favour. Practitioners of positivism today acknowledge in far greater detail [[observer bias]] and structural limitations. Modern positivists generally eschew metaphysical concerns in favour of methodological debates concerning clarity, [[replicability]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]].&lt;ref name="Gartell"&gt;Gartell, David, and Gartell, John. 1996. "Positivism in sociological practice: 1967-1990". ''Canadian Review of Sociology'', Vol. 33 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This positivism is generally equated with "[[quantitative research]]" and thus carries no explicit theoretical or philosophical commitments. The institutionalization of this kind of sociology is often credited to [[Paul Lazarsfeld]],&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analyzing them. This approach lends itself to what [[Robert K. Merton]] called [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]]: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.&lt;ref name="Boudon"&gt;Boudon, Raymond.  1991.  "Review: What Middle-Range Theories are".  Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 20 Num. 4 pp 519-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 21st century sociology===
Other new movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged to reconcile the overarching aims of social science with postmodern critiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis|first=John|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|isbn=978-0-13-800270-1|pages=688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Straker|first=David|title=Positivism|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/philosophies/positivism.htm|publisher=changingminds.org|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now at least twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"&gt;Halfpenny, Peter. ''Positivism and Sociology: Explaining Social Life.'' London:Allen and Unwin, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological positivism==

===Comte's positivism===
[[File:Buste Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Auguste Comte]]]]
[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1844 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in French 1848, English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasized the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Auguste Comte] in [[Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His ''View of Positivism'' therefore set out to define the empirical goals of sociological method.

{{quotation|"The most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand—not how they can be made to stand, but how they must stand, irrespective of the wishes of any one. ... This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called "positivity," which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This, as may be readily seen, is also a measure of their relative complexity, since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is, moreover, that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration, and therefore mathematics, which is not itself a concrete science, is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus, Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these he gave the names astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology."|[[Lester F. Ward]], ''The Outlines of Sociology'' (1898)|&lt;ref name="DinW"/&gt;}}

Comte offered an [[social evolutionism|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general "[[law of three stages]]". The idea bears some similarity to [[Marx]]'s belief that human society would progress toward a [[communist]] peak (see [[dialectical materialism]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} This is perhaps unsurprising as both were profoundly influenced by the early [[Utopian socialist]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was at one time Comte's mentor. Comte intended to develop a secular-scientific ideology in the wake of European [[secularisation]].

Comte's stages were (1) the ''[[theological]]'', (2) the ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; The theological phase of man was based on whole-hearted belief in all things with reference to [[God]]. God, Comte says, had reigned supreme over human existence pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Humanity's place in society was governed by its association with the divine presences and with the church. The theological phase deals with humankind's accepting the doctrines of the church (or place of worship) rather than relying on its rational powers to explore basic questions about existence. It dealt with the restrictions put in place by the religious organization at the time and the total acceptance of any "fact" adduced for society to believe.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'' 3&lt;/ref&gt; Comte describes the metaphysical phase of humanity as the time since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a time steeped in logical [[rationalism]], to the time right after the [[French Revolution]]. This second phase states that the universal rights of humanity are most important. The central idea is that humanity is invested with certain rights that must be respected. In this phase, democracies and dictators rose and fell in attempts to maintain the innate rights of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard von Mises]], ''Positivism: A Study In Human Understanding'', 5 (Paperback, [[Dover Books]], 1968 {{ISBN|0-486-21867-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stage of the trilogy of Comte's universal law is the scientific, or positive, stage. The central idea of this phase is that individual rights are more important than the rule of any one person. Comte stated that the idea of humanity's ability to govern itself makes this stage inherently different from the rest. There is no higher power governing the masses and the intrigue of any one person can achieve anything based on that individual's free will. The third principle is most important in the positive stage.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; Comte calls these three phases the universal rule in relation to society and its development. Neither the second nor the third phase can be reached without the completion and understanding of the preceding stage. All stages must be completed in progress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte believed that the appreciation of the past and the ability to build on it towards the future was key in transitioning from the theological and metaphysical phases. The idea of progress was central to Comte's new science, sociology. Sociology would "lead to the historical consideration of every science" because "the history of one science, including pure political history, would make no sense unless it was attached to the study of the general progress of all of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 622&lt;/ref&gt; As Comte would say: "from science comes prediction; from prediction comes action."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 566&lt;/ref&gt; It is a philosophy of human intellectual development that culminated in science. The irony of this series of phases is that though Comte attempted to prove that human development has to go through these three stages, it seems that the positivist stage is far from becoming a realization. This is due to two truths: The positivist phase requires having a complete understanding of the universe and world around us and requires that society should never know if it is in this positivist phase. [[Anthony Giddens]] argues that since humanity constantly uses science to discover and research new things, humanity never progresses beyond the second metaphysical phase.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre.JPG|thumb|right|Positivist temple in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil]]
Comte's fame today owes in part to [[Emile Littré]], who founded ''The Positivist Review'' in 1867. As an approach to the [[philosophy of history]], positivism was appropriated by historians such as [[Hippolyte Taine]]. Many of Comte's writings were translated into English by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] writer, [[Harriet Martineau]], regarded by some as the first female sociologist. Debates continue to rage as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, Saint-Simon.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Mary (1993) ''Auguste Comte: an intellectual biography'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 192&lt;/ref&gt; He was nevertheless influential: Brazilian thinkers turned to Comte's ideas about training a scientific elite in order to flourish in the industrialization process. [[Brazil]]'s national [[motto]], ''Ordem e Progresso'' ("Order and Progress") was taken from the positivism motto, "Love as principle, order as the basis, progress as the goal", which was also influential in [[Positivism in Poland|Poland]].

In later life, Comte developed a '[[religion of humanity]]' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the '[[positivist calendar]]'. For close associate [[John Stuart Mill]], it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the ''Course in Positive Philosophy'') and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious ''system'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; The ''system'' was unsuccessful but met with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' to influence the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour autrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)" According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms.

===Proletarian positivism===
[[Fabien Magnin]] was the first working class adherent to Comte's ideas. Comte appointed him as his successor as president of the Positive Society in the event of Comte's death. Magnin filled this role from 1857 to 1880, when he resigned.&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickering|first1=Mary|title=Auguste Comte: Volume 3: An Intellectual Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnin was in touch with the English positivists [[Richard Congreve]] and [[Edward Spencer Beesly]]. He established the [[Cercle des prolétaires positivistes]] in 1863 which was affiliated to the [[First International]]. [[Eugène Sémérie]] was a psychiatrist who was also involved in the Positivist movement, setting up a positivist club in Paris after the foundation of the [[French Third Republic]] in 1870. "Positivism is not only a philosophical doctrine, it is also a political party which claims to reconcile order – the necessary basis for all social activity – with Progress, which is its goal." he wrote.&lt;ref name="FPC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sémérie|first1=Eugène|title=Founding of a Positivist Club|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/comte/1870/semerie.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Durkheim's positivism===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
The modern academic discipline of sociology began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the details of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text he argued: "[o]ur main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism."&lt;ref name="DinW"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1895.  ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]''.  Cited in Wacquant (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''[[sui generis]]'' "[[social facts]]" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies, he posited, sociology would be able to determine whether a given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social [[anomie]]". Durkheim described sociology as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashley Ornstein has alleged, in a consumer textbook published by [[Pearson Education]], that accounts of Durkheim's positivism are possibly exaggerated and oversimplified; Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in exactly the same way as natural science, whereas Durkheim saw a far greater need for a distinctly sociological scientific methodology. His lifework was fundamental in the establishment of practical [[social research]] as we know it today—techniques which continue beyond sociology and form the methodological basis of other [[social sciences]], such as [[political science]], as well of [[market research]] and other fields.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements11"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |pages=94–98, 100–104|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antipositivism and critical theory===
{{Main article|Antipositivism|Critical theory}}
At the turn of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists formally introduced methodological antipositivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbols]], and social processes viewed from a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective. [[Max Weber]] argued that sociology may be loosely described as a 'science' as it is able to identify causal relationships—especially among [[ideal type]]s, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |pages=239–240 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nonpositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. Weber regarded sociology as the study of [[social action]], using critical analysis and [[verstehen]] techniques. The sociologists [[Georg Simmel]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and [[Charles Cooley]] were also influential in the development of sociological antipositivism, whilst [[neo-Kantian]] philosophy, [[hermeneutics]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] facilitated the movement in general.

[[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] theory of [[historical materialism]] and critical analysis drew upon positivism,&lt;ref&gt;"Main Currents of Marxism" by Leszek Kolakowski page 331, 327,&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition which would continue in the development of [[critical theory]]. However, following in the tradition of both [[Max Weber|Weber]] and [[Marx]], the critical theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] (in its relation to the cultural [[rationalisation (sociology)|"rationalisation"]] of the modern West) as meaning that scientific thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself. Positivism may be espoused by "[[Technocracy|technocrats]]" who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt; New movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged in order to reconcile postpositivist aims with various so-called '[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]' perspectives on the social acquisition of knowledge.

===Contemporary positivism===
In the original Comtean usage, the term "positivism" roughly meant the use of scientific methods to uncover the laws according to which both physical and human events occur, while "sociology" was the overarching science that would synthesize all such knowledge for the betterment of society. "Positivism is a way of understanding based on science"; people don't rely on the faith of God but instead of the science behind humanity. "Antipositivism" formally dates back to the start of the twentieth century, and is based on the belief that natural and human sciences are ontologically and epistemologically distinct. Neither of these terms is used any longer in this sense.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"&gt;Wacquant, Loic.  1992.  "Positivism." In Bottomore, Tom and William Outhwaite, ed., ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; There are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"/&gt;  Many of these approaches do not self-identify as "positivist", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical [[empiricism]]. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also become broad, with many philosophies broadly rejecting the scientifically based social epistemology and other ones only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science.  However, positivism (understood as the use of scientific methods for studying society) remains the dominant approach to both the research and the theory construction in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;

The majority of articles published in leading American sociology and political science journals today are positivist (at least to the extent of being [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] rather than [[qualitative research|qualitative]]).&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"&gt;Brett, Paul. 1994. "A genre analysis of the results section of sociology articles". ''English For Specific Purposes''. Vol 13, Num 1:47–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity may be because research utilizing positivist quantitative methodologies holds a greater prestige{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in the social sciences than qualitative work; quantitative work is easier to justify, as data can be manipulated to answer any question.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Linda |last1=Grant |first2=Kathryn B. |last2=Ward |author3=Xue Lan Rong |title=Is There An Association between Gender and Methods in Sociological Research? |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=52 |issue=6 |year=1987 |pages=856–862 |jstor=2095839|doi=10.2307/2095839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}} Such research is generally perceived as being more scientific and more trustworthy, and thus has a greater impact on policy and public opinion (though such judgments are frequently contested by scholars doing non-positivist work).&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}}

===The role of science in social change===
The contestation over positivism is reflected in older (see the [[Positivism dispute]]) and current debates over the proper role of science in the public sphere. [[Public sociology]]—especially as described by [[Michael Burawoy]]—argues that sociologists should use empirical evidence to display the problems of society so they might be changed.&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael: [http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/PS/ASA%20Presidential%20Address.pdf "For Public Sociology"] ([[American Sociological Review]], February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. Sociological Spectrum. 36 (3): 183–190.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that critical theory—public sociology in particular—relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologists assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.

==Logical positivism==
{{Main article|Logical positivism}}
[[File:Schlick sitting.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Moritz Schlick]], the founding father of logical positivism and the [[Vienna Circle]].]]
[[Logical positivism]] (later and more accurately called logical empiricism) is a school of philosophy that combines [[empiricism]], the idea that observational evidence is indispensable for knowledge of the world, with a version of [[rationalism]], the idea that our knowledge includes a component that is not derived from observation.

Logical positivism grew from the discussions of a group called the "First Vienna Circle" which gathered at the [[Café Central]] before [[World War I]]. After the war [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], a member of that early group, helped bring [[Moritz Schlick]] to Vienna. Schlick's [[Vienna Circle]], along with [[Hans Reichenbach]]'s [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]], propagated the new doctrines more widely in the 1920s and early 1930s.

It was [[Otto Neurath]]'s advocacy that made the movement self-conscious and more widely known. A 1929 pamphlet written by Neurath, Hahn, and [[Rudolf Carnap]] summarized the doctrines of the Vienna Circle at that time. These included: the opposition to all [[metaphysics]], especially [[ontology]] and [[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']] propositions; the rejection of metaphysics not as wrong but as meaningless (i.e., not empirically verifiable); a criterion of meaning based on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early work (which he himself later set out to refute){{citation needed|date=August 2016}}; the idea that all knowledge should be codifiable in a single standard language of science; and above all the project of "rational reconstruction," in which ordinary-language concepts were gradually to be replaced by more precise equivalents in that standard language. However, the project is widely considered to have failed.&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M. A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300066067 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of Ptolemy, Hume, d'Alembert, Compte, Mill, and Mach. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—neo-Thomisism, neo-Kantianism, intuitionism, dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and existentialism. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C. [Verifiability Criterion]—but for no defensible reason—or admitting that the V.C. requires a background language, etc., which opens the door to relativism, etc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107230818/http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |archivedate=7 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to the United States, Carnap proposed a replacement for the earlier doctrines in his ''Logical Syntax of Language''. This change of direction, and the somewhat differing beliefs of Reichenbach and others, led to a consensus that the English name for the shared doctrinal platform, in its American exile from the late 1930s, should be "logical empiricism."{{cn|date=February 2018}} While the logical positivism movement is now considered dead, it has continued to influence philosophy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanfling|first=Oswald|chapter=Logical Positivism|title=Routledge History of Philosophy|volume=IX|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical positivism==
Historical positivism is the [[historiography|historiographical]] view that historical evidence requires no interpretation, the work of the historian being to compile the primary sources, “letting them speak for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://colegiomoz.blogspot.com/2017/11/historiografia-positivista.html?m=1 | title=Historiografia positivista - Colégio-moz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its tenets were later contradicted by [[Postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the Holocaust, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further thinkers&lt;!--'Popper legend' redirects here--&gt;==
Within years of the publication of  [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s book ''A General View of Positivism'' (1848), other scientific and philosophical thinkers began creating their own definitions for positivism. They included [[Émile Zola]], [[Emile Hennequin]], [[Wilhelm Scherer]], and [[Dimitri Pisarev]]. Émile Zola was an influential French [[novelist]], the most important example of the literary school of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], and a major figure in the political liberalization of [[France]].

Emile Hennequin was a Parisian publisher and writer who wrote theoretical and critical pieces. He "exemplified the tension between the positivist drive to systematize literary criticism and the unfettered imagination inherent in literature." He was one of the few thinkers who disagreed with the notion that subjectivity invalidates observation, judgment and prediction. Unlike many positivist thinkers before him, he believed that [[subjectivity]] does play a role in science and society. His contribution to positivism pertains not to science and its objectivity, but rather to the subjectivity of art and the way artists, their work, and audiences interrelate. Hennequin tried to analyse positivism strictly on the predictions, and the mechanical processes, but was perplexed due to the contradictions of the reactions of patrons to artwork that showed no scientific inclinations.

Wilhelm Scherer was a German [[Philology|philologist]], a university professor, and a popular literary historian. He was known as a positivist because he based much of his work on "hypotheses on detailed historical research, and rooted every literary phenomenon in 'objective' historical or philological facts". His positivism is different due to his involvement with his nationalist goals. His major contribution to the movement was his speculation that culture cycled in a six-hundred-year period.

Dimitri Pisarev was a Russian critic who showed the greatest contradictions with his belief in positivism. His ideas incorporated imagination and style though he did not believe in romantic ideas because they reminded him of the oppressive tsarist government under which he lived. His basic beliefs were "an extreme anti-aesthetic scientistic position." He focused his efforts on defining the relation between literature and the environment.

[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Stephen Hawking]]]]
[[Stephen Hawking]] was a recent high-profile advocate of positivism, at least in the physical sciences. In ''[[The Universe in a Nutshell]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;31) he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any sound scientific theory, whether of time or of any other concept, should in my opinion be based on the most workable philosophy of science: the positivist approach put forward by [[Karl Popper]] and others. According to this way of thinking, a scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple postulates and will make definite predictions that can be tested. ... If one takes the positivist position, as I do, one cannot say what time actually is. All one can do is describe what has been found to be a very good mathematical model for time and say what predictions it makes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the claim that Popper was a positivist is a common misunderstanding that Popper himself termed the "'''Popper legend'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Stadler]], ''The Vienna Circle: Studies in the Origins, Development, and Influence of Logical Empiricism'', Springer, 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he developed his beliefs in stark opposition to and as a criticism of positivism and held that scientific theories talk about how the world really is, not, as positivists claim, about phenomena or observations experienced by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', 1934, 1959 (1st English ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] like [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] regarded Popper as a positivist because of his alleged devotion to a [[unified science]]. However, this was also part of the "Popper legend"; Popper had in fact been the foremost critic of this doctrine of the Vienna Circle, critiquing it, for instance, in his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', p256 [[Routledge]], London, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science today==
{{See also|Constructive empiricism}}
The key features of positivism as of the 1950s, as defined in the "received view",&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, I. (ed.) 1981. Scientific revolutions. - Oxford Univ. Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; are:
# A focus on science as a product, a linguistic or numerical set of statements;
# A concern with [[axiomatization]], that is, with demonstrating the logical structure and coherence of these statements;
# An insistence on at least some of these statements being testable; that is, amenable to being verified, confirmed, or shown to be false by the empirical observation of reality.  Statements that would, by their nature, be regarded as untestable included the [[teleology|teleological]]; thus positivism rejects much of classical metaphysics.
# The belief that science is markedly cumulative;
# The belief that science is predominantly [[Trans-cultural diffusion|transcultural]];
# The belief that science rests on specific results that are dissociated from the personality and social position of the investigator;
# The belief that science contains theories or research traditions that are largely commensurable;
# The belief that science sometimes incorporates new ideas that are discontinuous from old ones;
# The belief that science involves the idea of the unity of science, that there is, underlying the various scientific disciplines, basically one science about one real world.
# The belief that science is nature and nature is science; and out of this duality, all theories and postulates are created, interpreted, evolve, and are applied.

Positivism is elsewhere{{Non sequitur|date=February 2018}}{{where|date=February 2018}} defined{{by who|date=February 2018}} as the belief that all true knowledge is scientific,&lt;ref name="bullock"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]] and [[Stephen Trombley]], [Eds] ''The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', London: [[Harper-Collins]], 1999, pp. 669–737&lt;/ref&gt; and that all things are ultimately measurable. Positivism is closely related to [[reductionism]], in that both involve the belief that "entities of one kind... are reducible to entities of another,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; such as societies to configurations of individuals, or mental events to neural phenomena. It also involves the contention that "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; and even that "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; or that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

While most social scientists today are not explicit about their epistemological commitments, articles in top American sociology and political science journals generally follow a positivist logic of argument.&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;Holmes, Richard.  1997. "Genre analysis, and the social sciences: An investigation of the structure of research article discussion sections in three disciplines". ''English For Specific Purposes'', vol. 16, num. 4:321–337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"/&gt;  It can be thus argued that "natural science and social science [research articles] can therefore be regarded with a good deal of confidence as members of the same genre".&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Positivism dispute}}
Historically, positivism has been criticized for its [[reductionism]], i.e., for contending that all "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events," "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals," and that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

[[Max Horkheimer]] criticized the classic formulation of positivism on two grounds. First, he claimed that it falsely represented human social action.&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Theodor Adorno (1903-1969)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/adorno/|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first criticism argued that positivism systematically failed to appreciate the extent to which the so-called social facts it yielded did not exist 'out there', in the objective world, but were themselves a product of socially and historically mediated human consciousness.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism ignored the role of the 'observer' in the constitution of social reality and thereby failed to consider the historical and social conditions affecting the representation of social ideas.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism falsely represented the object of study by [[Reification (fallacy)|reifying]] social reality as existing objectively and independently and labour actually produced those conditions.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Secondly, he argued, representation of social reality produced by positivism was inherently and artificially conservative, helping to support the status quo, rather than challenging it.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; This character may also explain the popularity of positivism in certain political circles. Horkheimer argued, in contrast, that critical theory possessed a reflexive element lacking in the positivistic traditional theory.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt;

Some scholars today hold the beliefs critiqued in Horkheimer's work, but since the time of his writing critiques of positivism, especially from philosophy of science, have led to the development of [[postpositivism]]. This philosophy greatly relaxes the epistemological commitments of logical positivism and no longer claims a separation between the knower and the known. Rather than dismissing the scientific project outright, postpositivists seek to transform and amend it, though the exact extent of their affinity for science varies vastly. For example, some postpositivists accept the critique that observation is always value-laden, but argue that the best values to adopt for sociological observation are those of science: skepticism, rigor, and modesty. Just as some critical theorists see their position as a moral commitment to egalitarian values, these postpositivists see their methods as driven by a moral commitment to these scientific values. Such scholars may see themselves as either positivists or antipositivists.&lt;ref name="tittle"&gt;Tittle, Charles. 2004. "The Arrogance of Public Sociology". ''Social Forces'', June 2004, 82(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism has also come under fire on religious and philosophical grounds, whose proponents state that truth begins in [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], but does not end there. Positivism fails to prove that there are not abstract ideas, laws, and principles, beyond particular observable facts and relationships and necessary principles, or that we cannot know them. Nor does it prove that material and corporeal things constitute the whole order of existing beings, and that our knowledge is limited to them. According to positivism, our abstract concepts or general ideas are mere collective representations of the experimental order—for example; the idea of "man" is a kind of blended image of all the men observed in our experience. This runs contrary to a [[Platonism|Platonic]] or [[Christian]] ideal, where an idea can be abstracted from any concrete determination, and may be applied identically to an indefinite number of objects of the same class {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} From the idea's perspective, Platonism is more precise. Defining an idea as a sum of collective images is imprecise and more or less confused, and becomes more so as the collection represented increases. An idea defined explicitly always remains clear.

[[Experientialism]], which arose with second generation cognitive science, asserts that knowledge begins and ends with experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F. J., Thompson, E. T., &amp; Rosch, E. (1991). ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G., &amp; Johnson, M. (1999). ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought''. Basic books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoes of the "positivist" and "antipositivist" debate persist today, though this conflict is hard to define. Authors writing in different epistemological perspectives do not phrase their disagreements in the same terms and rarely actually speak directly to each other.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;Hanson, Barbara. 2008. "Wither Qualitative/Quantitative?: Grounds for Methodological Convergence." ''Quality and Quantity'' 42:97–111.&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate the issues further, few practicing scholars explicitly state their epistemological commitments, and their epistemological position thus has to be guessed from other sources such as choice of methodology or theory. However, no perfect correspondence between these categories exists, and many scholars critiqued as "positivists" are actually postpositivists.&lt;ref name="Bryman"&gt;Bryman, Alan. 1984. "The Debate about Quantitative and Qualitative Research: A Question of Method or Epistemology?." ''The British Journal of Sociology'' 35:75–92.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar has described this debate in terms of the social construction of the "other", with each side defining the other by what it is ''not'' rather than what it ''is'', and then proceeding to attribute far greater homogeneity to their opponents than actually exists.&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt; Thus, it is better to understand this not as a debate but as two different arguments: the "antipositivist" articulation of a social [[meta-theory]] which includes a philosophical critique of [[scientism]], and "positivist" development of a scientific research methodology for sociology with accompanying critiques of the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of work that they see as violating such standards.

{{Monarchism|Concepts}}

'''Primogeniture''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|p|r|aɪ|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ᵻ|tʃ|ər}}) is the right, by law or custom, of the paternally acknowledged, [[wikt:firstborn|firstborn]] son to [[inheritance|inherit]] his parent's entire or main [[estate (law)|estate]], in preference to daughters, elder illegitimate sons, [[cadet branch|younger sons]] and collateral relatives; in some cases the estate may instead be the inheritance of [[#Absolute primogeniture|the firstborn child]] or occasionally [[#Matrilineal primogeniture|the firstborn daughter]]. The descendant (often the son) of a deceased elder sibling (typically elder brother) inherits before a living younger sibling by right of substitution for the deceased heir. In the absence of any children, brothers succeed, individually, to the inheritance by seniority of age (subject to substitution). Among siblings, sons usually inherit before daughters. In the absence of male descendants in the male-line, there are variations of primogeniture which allocate the inheritance to a daughter or a brother or, in the absence of either, to another collateral relative, in a specified order (e.g. male-preference primogeniture, Salic primogeniture, semi-Salic primogeniture).

The principle has applied in history to inheritance of real property (land) as well as inherited titles and offices, most notably monarchies, continuing until modified or abolished.

Variations on primogeniture modify the right of the first-born son to the entirety of a family's inheritance (see [[appanage]]) or, in the West since World War II, eliminate the preference for males over females (absolute primogeniture). Most [[monarchies in Europe|monarchies in Western Europe]] have eliminated male preference in succession: [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Monarchy of Norway|Norway]], [[Monarchy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].

Some monarchies have succession rules contrasting greatly with primogeniture. Currently, [[succession to the Saudi Arabian throne]] uses a form of lateral [[agnatic seniority]], as did the [[Kievan Rus']] (see [[Rota system]]), the early [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (see [[Tanistry]]), the [[Mongol Empire]] (see [[Order of succession#Lateral succession|lateral succession]]) or the later [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Line of succession to the former Ottoman throne#Succession practices|succession practices]]).

===Absolute primogeniture===
&lt;!-- This section is forward referenced and linked from [[Westeros]] and [[Hundred Years' War]]--&gt;
''Absolute'', ''equal'', or ''lineal primogeniture'' is a form of primogeniture in which sex is irrelevant for inheritance. No modern monarchy before 1980 practiced this form of primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Poumarede (1972), the [[Basque people|Basques]] of the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] transmitted title and property to the firstborn regardless of sex.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W4H-4H5DYN9-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1113676711&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=4ae9185f30a93cc3f5c45dbfcec3b167 |title=Succession strategies in the Pyrenees in the 19th century: The Basque case |doi=10.1016/j.hisfam.2005.03.002 |volume=10 |journal=The History of the Family |pages=271–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher [[nobility]] and free families of the [[early middle ages|early]] and [[high middle ages]] followed this custom.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt; The Navarrese monarchy, however, was inherited by dynasties from outside of [[Navarre]], which followed different successional laws, usually male preference primogeniture. Eventually only the Basque lower nobility and free families of the Basque country and other regions continued to follow this custom, which persisted as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="aînesse intégrale" /&gt;

An ancient and alternative way in which women succeeded to power, especially without displacing the direct male line descendants of the first monarchs, is the historical consortium or [[coregency]] between husband, and wife or other relatives. The most notable of these are the Egyptian cases of [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Thutmose III]], and the monarchs of the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]].

In 1980, [[Sweden]] amended its [[constitution]] to adopt royal succession by absolute primogeniture, displacing King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]]'s infant son, [[Prince Carl Philip]], in favor of his elder daughter, [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria]], in the process. Several monarchies have since followed suit: the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, [[Luxembourg]] in 2011, and the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realms]] in 2015.

[[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] also deviated from traditional primogeniture in the late 20th or early 21st century by restricting succession to the crown to relatives within a specified degree of [[kinship]] to the most recent monarch.

Recently, other monarchies have changed or considered changing to absolute primogeniture:

* With the birth of [[Infanta Leonor of Spain]] on 31 October 2005 to the then heir apparent [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe, Prince of Asturias]] and [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Princess Letizia]], the Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] reaffirmed the intention of the government to institute, by amendment of the Spanish constitution, absolute primogeniture. Zapatero's proposal was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative ''[[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]]'', making its passage probable. However, Zapatero's administration ended before an amendment was drafted, and the succeeding government has not pursued it. The Prince counseled reformers that there was plenty of time before any constitutional amendment would need to be enacted because the expectation was to leave him next in line to succeed his father despite his elder sisters' continued status as [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]]; equal primogeniture was expected to apply first to his children. Felipe succeeded to the throne as Felipe VI upon his father's abdication in 2014, by which time he had two daughters. Felipe VI has no son that would, absent the constitutional amendment, displace Leonor as heir apparent.
* In July 2006, the [[Nepal]]ese government proposed adopting absolute primogeniture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newkerala.com/news3.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=31256 |title=New Kerala}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the monarchy was abolished in 2008 before the change could be effected.
* In 2011, the governments of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s which have a common monarch announced the [[Perth Agreement]], a plan to legislate changes to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |title=Royal equality act will end succession of firstborn male –  rather than older sister |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/28/commonwealth-royalty-succession-change}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was implemented when the necessary legislation came into effect on 26 March 2015.
* In [[Japan]], it has been debated whether or not to adopt absolute primogeniture, as [[Princess Aiko]] is the only child of [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Crown Prince Naruhito]]. However, the birth in 2006 of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]], a son of [[Prince Akishino]] (the younger brother of Crown Prince Naruhito, and next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne following Naruhito) has suspended the debate.

===Agnatic primogeniture===
Under agnatic primogeniture, or patrilineal primogeniture, the degree of kinship (of males and females) is determined by tracing shared descent from the nearest common ancestor through male ancestors.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Murphy |first=Michael Dean |title=A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm |accessdate=5 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who share agnatic kinship are termed "agnates"; those who share descent from a common ancestor through males and females or through females only are "cognates".

There were different types of succession based on agnatic primogeniture, all sharing the principle that inheritance is according to seniority of birth among siblings (compare to [[ultimogeniture]]) and seniority of lineage among the agnatic kin, firstly, among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male-line issue inheriting before brothers and their issue. Females and female-line descendants are excluded from succession.

===Male-preference primogeniture===
Male-preference primogeniture accords succession to the throne to a female member of a [[dynasty]] if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. A [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]]'s sons and their lines of descent all come before that dynast's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.

It was practiced in the succession to the once-separate thrones of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] (until their union under [[James VI and I]]) and then the [[United Kingdom]] until 2015, when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] changed it to absolute primogeniture. The rule change also applies to all [[Commonwealth realm]]s that have the British monarch as their head of state.

Male-preference primogeniture is currently practiced in succession to the thrones of [[Monaco]]{{since when?|date=November 2018}} and [[Spain]] (before 1700 and since [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|1830]]).

With respect to [[hereditary title]]s, it is usually the rule for Scotland and [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|baronies by writ]] in the United Kingdom, but baronies by writ go into [[abeyance]] when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder.

==Salic law==
An [[agnatic seniority]] primogeniture system that excludes any female from inheritance of a monarch's principal possessions is generally known in western Europe as an application of the "[[Salic law]]" (see ''[[Terra salica]]''). This rule of succession developed in the course of a series of successions in France in the later Middle Ages. In 1316, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]], the only surviving child of [[Louis X of France]] was debarred from the throne in favor of her uncle, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]]. After this it was declared that women could not inherit the French throne. Then in 1328, after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]] (Charles IV's paternal cousin) became king, notwithstanding the claims of [[Edward III of England]]. By [[proximity of blood]], Edward was the closest relative to the dead king, as he was the son of the king's sister [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris resolved that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded.  This ruling became a key point of contention in the subsequent [[Hundred Years War]]. Over the following century, French jurists adopted a clause from the 6th century ''[[Salic law|Pactus Legis Salicae]]'', which asserted that no female or her descendants could inherit the French throne, as a governing rule for the French succession.

By the start of the 19th century, the royal houses of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] ([[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Bourbon Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Sicily]] and [[Bourbon-Parma|Parma]]) and [[House of Savoy|Savoy]] ([[Kingdom of Sardinia]]), had adopted this system of exclusively male hereditary succession. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s conquests subsequently nudged the adoption of the law in [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]] ([[House of Bernadotte|beginning in 1810]]) and in princely states of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. Other states adopted strict agnatic primogeniture as well, including [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] ([[Frederick VII of Denmark#Succession crisis|beginning in 1853]]) and the new kingdoms of [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)|Albania]], [[Kingdom of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. During this era, Spain (in the [[Carlist Wars|Carlist conflicts]]) fought a [[civil war]] which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of the ruling dynasty against one another for possession of the crown.

A variation of Salic primogeniture allowed the sons of women to inherit, but not women themselves, an example being the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] succession to the throne of Spain that was applied in 1947&amp;ndash;1978.

Most British and French titles of nobility descend to the senior male by primogeniture, to the exclusion of females, and agnatic [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] may bear [[courtesy titles|courtesy]] or [[subsidiary title|subsidiary]] titles.  Notable exceptions in England include the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], which is merged with the [[British Crown]] (which has included women in inheritance since the 16th century), and the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukedom of Marlborough]], which has included women in inheritance since its establishment in 1702.

==Semi-Salic law==
{{for|a clearer explanation of the differences between Salic, Semi-Salic laws and male-preference primogeniture|Salic law}}

Another variation on agnatic primogeniture is the so-called semi-Salic law, or "agnatic-cognatic primogeniture", which allows women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line.&lt;ref&gt;Nordisk familjebok, ''Tronföljd'', 1920; SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd''.&lt;/ref&gt; Such were the cases of [[Bourbon Spain]] until 1833 and the dominions of [[Austria-Hungary]], as well as most realms within the former [[Holy Roman Empire]], i.e. most German monarchies. This was also the law of [[Russia]] under the [[Pauline Laws]] of 1797 and of [[Luxembourg]] until equal primogeniture was introduced on 20 June 2011.

There are various versions of semi-Salic law also, although in all forms women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female agnate of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture. Among sisters (and the lines of descendants issuing from them), the elder are preferred to the younger. In reckoning [[consanguinity]] or [[proximity of blood]] the dynasty's [[house law]] defines who among female relatives is "nearest" to the last male.

===Uterine primogeniture===
Under ''uterine primogeniture'', succession to the throne or other property is passed to the male most closely related to the previous titleholder through female kinship.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; A male may also inherit a right of succession through a female ancestor or spouse, to the exclusion of any female relative who might be older or of nearer proximity of blood (see above for Spain's mid-twentieth century dynastic succession law). In such cases, inheritance depends on uterine kinship,&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; so a king would typically be succeeded by his sister's son. This particular system of inheritance applied to the thrones of the [[Picts]] of Northern Britain and the [[Etruscans]] of Italy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Some kingdoms and ethnic groups in [[Africa]] follow the same practice. This usage may stem in part from the certainty of the relationship to the previous king and kings: sons and daughters of a sister are his relations ([[mater semper certa est]]), even if they do not have the same father.

====Matrilineal primogeniture====
''Matrilineal primogeniture'', or ''female-preference uterine primogeniture'', is a form of succession practised in some societies in which the eldest female child inherits the throne, to the total exclusion of males. The order of succession to the position of the [[Rain Queen]] is an example in an [[Africa]]n culture of [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] primogeniture: not only is [[dynasty|dynastic]] descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.

==History==
In Christian Europe, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] originally had a monopoly on the authority to sanction marriage. It forbade polygamy and taught that divorce was an impossibility ''per se'', as it still does. Consequently, in Europe, it was very difficult to ensure succession solely by direct male descendants or even direct male or female progeny. In [[Islam]]ic and Asian cultures, religious officials and customs either sanctioned [[polygyny]], use of consorts, or both, or they had no authority of marriage; monarchs could consequently ensure sufficient numbers of male offspring to assure succession. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare.

===Biblical===
{{Main|Bechor}}
[[File:Figures Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving|''Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils'', a 1728 engraving by [[Gerard Hoet]].]]
The earliest account of primogeniture to be known widely in modern times is that of [[Isaac]]'s sons [[Esau]], who was born first,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacob]], who was born second.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esau was entitled to the "birthright" (''bekhorah'' בְּכוֹרָה), but he sold the right to Jacob for a [[mess of pottage]], i. e. a small amount of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the veracity of this account is not corroborated by other sources, its widespread acceptance {{by whom|date=July 2017}} demonstrates that primogeniture was sufficiently common in the [[Middle East]] for the account to seem plausible to the people living there prior to the [[Roman Empire]].

===Roman law===
During the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman law]] governed much of Europe, and the laws pertaining to inheritance made no distinction between the oldest or youngest, male or female, if the decedent died [[Intestacy|intestate]].&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu"&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam, (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2006, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Although admission to the two highest ''[[Roman Empire#ordines|ordines]]'' (orders), i. e. the [[Roman Senate|senators]] and [[equestrian order|equestrians]], potentially brought lifelong privileges that the next generation could inherit, the principle of inherited rank in general was little used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Millar |first1=Fergus |authorlink=Fergus Millar |year=1983 |title=Empire and City, Augustus to Julian: Obligations, Excuses and Status |url= |journal=[[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=73 |issue= |pages=87–88 |doi=10.2307/300073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and a Roman family could not maintain its position in the ''ordines'' merely by hereditary succession or title to land.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Keith (2000). "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," in ''The Dynamics of Ancient Empires: State Power from Assyria to Byzantium'' ([[Oxford University Press]]), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the eldest son typically carried [[Roman naming conventions|his father's name]] in some form, he was expected to construct his own [[cursus honorum|career]] based on competence as an [[legatus|administrator or general]] and on remaining in favor with the emperor and his council at court.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, ''The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,'' p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than meeting requirements for personal wealth, the qualifications for belonging to the senatorial or equestrian orders varied from generation to generation, and in the later Empire, the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' ("esteem") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with additional titles, such as ''[[vir illustris]],'' that were not inherited.&lt;ref&gt;Millar. "Empire and City". p. 90, calls them "status-appellations".&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Roman emperor]]s indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] heir, and the presumption that the eldest or even a natural son would inherit was not enshrined. The death of an emperor led to a critical period of uncertainty and crisis. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or the [[Praetorian Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Winterling, Aloys. ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome''. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, originally published 1988 in German). p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, neither an emperor nor his heir had an inherent "right" to rule, and did so through military power and the Senate's symbolic consent.

===Reemergence in medieval and modern times===
The law of primogeniture in Europe has its origins in [[Medieval Europe]]; which due to the [[feudal system]] necessitated that the [[Fiefdom|estates]] of land-owning feudal lords be kept as large and united as possible to maintain social stability as well as the wealth, power and social standing of their families.&lt;ref name="www2.hn.psu.edu" /&gt;

[[Adam Smith]], in his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', explains the origin of primogeniture in Europe in the following way:

{{quote|[W]hen land was considered as the means, not of subsistence merely, but of power and protection, it was thought better that it should descend undivided to one. In those disorderly times, every great landlord was a sort of petty prince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge, and in some respects their legislator in peace and their leader in war. He made war according to his own discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed estate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it, depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not immediately indeed, but in process of time, in the succession of landed estates, for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that of monarchies, though not always at their first institution.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 312–313.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Historical examples===
A case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the [[France|French]] royal ''milieu'', where the [[Salic Law]] (attributed to the [[Salian Franks]]) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line. This rule was adopted to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1316|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of [[John I of France]], the short-lived son of deceased [[Louis X of France]] in favour of [[Philip V of France]] (brother of Louis and uncle of John) over [[Joan II of Navarre]] (daughter of Louis and sister of John), the {{Interlanguage link multi|Estates-General of 1317|fr|3=États généraux de 1317}} ruling that "''Women do not succeed the kingdom of France''". In 1328, it was further elaborated, with the statement that "''Women cannot transmit a right which they do not possess''", to solve the [[Salic law#The succession in 1328|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of Philip V's brother [[Charles IV of France]] ([[Edward III of England]] or [[Philip VI of France]]), though the former would have a stronger claim should [[proximity of blood]] be considered, which had never been the case in France since 987, instead as well of both agnatic-cognatic primogeniture or male-preference cognatic primogeniture and the resulting heirs. This dispute was among the factors behind the [[Hundred Years' War]], which broke out in 1337.

Conflict between the Salic law and the male-preferred system was also the genesis of [[Carlism]] in [[Spain]].

The crowns of [[Hanover]] and [[Great Britain]], which had been in [[personal union]] since 1714, were separated in 1837 upon the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]: his niece [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] inherited the British crown under male-preference primogeniture but, because of semi-Salic law, was not the heir to that of Hanover, which passed to William's eldest surviving brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]].

The divergence in the late 19th century of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both ruled by semi-Salic law, resulted from the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than did the Dutch line. The Luxembourg succession was set by the [[Nassau Family Pact|Nassau House Treaty of 1783]], which declared each prince of the [[House of Nassau]] to be a potential heir to the territories of every branch of the dynasty. Insofar as the succession is concerned, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-)[[Nassau-Dietz]], which was given in exchange to [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange]] in 1813. Succession to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was recognised by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as belonging exclusively to the descendants of Prince William VI, who became [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I of the Netherlands]]. In 1890, William I's agnatic line of male descendants died out, leaving the Netherlands to his female descendant [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], whereas Luxembourg still had an agnatic heir from a distant branch of the dynasty left to succeed; ex-[[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Duke Adolf of Nassau]], who became reigning Grand Duke, thus ending the [[personal union]] of the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Since the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived.

Common in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on a form of primogeniture: A [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, assuming his wife's title (''[[jure uxoris]]'').

In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood]] and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture.
* The [[Philip I of Burgundy|Burgundian succession]] in 1361 was resolved in favor of [[John II of France|King John II]], son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of the elder daughter and son of [[Joan II of Navarre|Jeanne]]. John was only one generation of consanguinity removed from the late duke instead of two for Charles.
* In dispute over the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Scottish succession]], 1290–92, the [[Bruce]] family pleaded [[tanistry]] and [[proximity of blood]], whereas [[John of Scotland|Balliol]] argued his claim based on primogeniture. The arbiter, [[Edward I of England]], decided in favor of primogeniture. But later, the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Independence Wars]] reverted the situation in favor of the Bruce, due to political exigency.
* The [[Earl of Gloucester|Earldom of Gloucester]] (in the beginning of 14th century) went to full sisters of the dead earl, not to his half-sisters, though they were elder, having been born of the father's first marriage, while the earl himself was from second marriage. Full siblings were considered higher in proximity than half-siblings.

However, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries.

Later, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, ''agnatic primogeniture'' (practically the same as [[Salic Law]]) became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.

Some countries, however, accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter. For example, in 1632 [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]] succeeded to the throne after the death of her father, King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]].

In England, primogeniture was mandatory for inheritance of land. Until the [[Statute of Wills]] was passed in 1540, a will could control only the inheritance of personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant  [[by operation of law]]. The statute added a provision that a landowner could "devise" land by the use of a new device called a "testament". The rule of primogeniture in England was not changed until the [[Administration of Estates Act]] in 1925.
In law, primogeniture is the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son. Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see [[knight]]). The effect of this rule was to keep the father's land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England, consequently, there was enacted the Statute of Wills (1540), which permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, still customary in England.

====United States and Canada====
In the United States, the colonies followed English primogeniture laws. Carole Shammas argues that issues of primogeniture, dower, curtesy, strict family settlements in equity, collateral kin, and unilateral division of real and personal property were fully developed in the colonial courts.

When [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] met at Placentia Bay in August 1941, FDR said he couldn’t understand the British aristocracy’s concept of primogeniture, and he intended to divide his estate equally between his five children; Churchill explained that an equal distribution was nicknamed the “Spanish Curse” by the British upper classes: ''“We give everything to the eldest and the others strive to duplicate it and found empires. While the oldest, having it all, marries for beauty. Which accounts, Mr President, for my good looks”''. But as Churchill’s father was a younger son, there may have been more modesty than mock-vanity than FDR realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roberts | first = Andrew  | authorlink = Andrew Roberts (historian) | title = Masters and Commanders: The Military Geniuses who Led the West to Victory in World War II | publisher = Penguin | date = 2009 | location = London | page = 53 | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-141-02926-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noble titles==
===Spain===
In 2006, King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] decreed a reform of the succession to noble titles from male-preference primogeniture to absolute primogeniture.&lt;ref name="Spanish Nobility and Grandee Titles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |title=Nobility and Grandee Titles |work=Spanish Ministry of Justice |accessdate=May 31, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803062402/http://esede.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite/en/1215197183446/Tramite_C/1215326462418/Detalle.html |archivedate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the Spanish Ministry of Justice, the default custom of succession is absolute primogeniture, but the titleholder may designate his or her successor or distribute titles among children, provided that the eldest inherits the highest title unless he waives that right.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote
 | The order of succession for all noble dignities is determined in accordance with the title of concession and, if there is none, with that traditionally applied in these cases. When the order of succession to the title is not specified in the nobility title creation charter, the following rules apply:
* Absolute preference is given to the direct descending line over the collateral and ascending line, and, within the same line, the closest degree takes precedence over the more remote and, within the same degree, the elder over the younger, combined with the principles of firstborn and representation.
* Men and women have an equal right of succession to [[grandee]]ship and to titles of nobility in [[Spain]], and no person may be given preference in the normal order of succession for reasons of gender.

===United Kingdom===
Since 2013, there has been a revived movement to reform hereditary peerage inheritance law for equal primogeniture. The [[Equality (Titles) Bill]] and its successive legislation have been referred to as the "Downton law" in reference to the British television drama ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' where the Earl's eldest daughter is unable to inherit the family seat because it is [[Fee tail|entailed]] and can be passed only to a male heir.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Georgia|title=Ladies who could soon be a leaping|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10540898/Ladies-who-could-soon-be-a-leaping.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reasonable doubt''' is a term used in [[jurisdiction]] of [[common law]] countries. Evidence that is beyond reasonable doubt is the [[Legal burden of proof|standard of evidence]] required to validate a criminal conviction in most [[adversarial system|adversarial legal systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Grechenig, Nicklisch &amp; Thoeni, Punishment Despite Reasonable Doubt - A Public Goods Experiment with Sanctions under Uncertainty, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies (JELS) 2010, vol. 7 (4), p. 847-867 [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1733792 (ssrn).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, prosecutors bear the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] and are required to prove their version of events to this standard. This means that the proposition being presented by the prosecution must be proven to the extent that there could be no "reasonable doubt" in the mind of a "[[reasonable person]]" that the defendant is guilty. There can still be a doubt, but only to the extent that it would ''not'' affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether or not the defendant is guilty.  Beyond "the shadow of a doubt" is sometimes used interchangeably with beyond reasonable doubt, but this extends beyond the latter, to the extent that it may be considered an impossible standard. The term "reasonable doubt" is therefore used.

If doubt ''does'' affect a "reasonable person's" belief that the defendant is guilty, the jury is not satisfied beyond "reasonable doubt".  The precise meaning of words such as "reasonable" and "doubt" are usually defined within [[jurisprudence]] of the applicable country.  A related idea is [[Blackstone's formulation]] "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer".

Beyond a reasonable doubt is the highest burden of proof in any court in the United States. Criminal cases must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

==By jurisdiction==

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
In English common law prior to the "reasonable doubt" standard, passing judgment in criminal trials had severe religious repercussions for jurors.  According to judicial law prior to the 1780s: "the Juryman who finds any other person guilty, is liable to the Vengeance of God upon his Family and Trade, Body and Soul, in this world and that to come."&lt;ref name="What Are the Origins"&gt;James Q. Whitman [http://hnn.us/articles/47018.html ''What Are the Origins of Reasonable Doubt?''], History News Network, George Mason University, February 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also believed "In every case of doubt, where one's salvation is in peril, one must always take the safer way....A judge who is in doubt must refuse to judge."&lt;ref name="What Are the Origins"/&gt;  It was in reaction to these "religious fears"&lt;ref name="What Are the Origins"/&gt; that "reasonable doubt" was introduced in the late 18th century to English common law, thereby allowing jurors to more easily convict.  Therefore, the original use of the "reasonable doubt" standard was opposite to its modern use of limiting a juror's ability to convict.

However, juries in criminal courts in England are no longer customarily directed to consider whether there is "reasonable doubt" about a defendant's guilt.  Indeed, a 2008 conviction was appealed after the judge had said to the jury "You must be satisfied of guilt beyond all reasonable doubt." The conviction was upheld but the [[Appeal Court]] made clear their unhappiness with the judge's remark, indicating that the judge should instead have said to the jury simply that before they can return a verdict of guilty, they "must be sure that the defendant is guilty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2009/2563.html R v Majid] [2009] EWCA Crim 2563 (12 October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of 'beyond reasonable doubt' was expounded in ''Woolmington v DPP [1935] UKHL 1'':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1935/1.html Woolmington v DPP] [1935] UKHL 1 (23 May 1935)''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Juries are always told that, if conviction there is to be, the prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. This statement cannot mean that in order to be acquitted the prisoner must "satisfy" the jury. This is the law as laid down in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Davies 29 Times LR 350; 8 Cr App R 211, the headnote of which correctly states that where intent is an ingredient of a crime there is no onus on the defendant to prove that the act alleged was accidental. '''Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt''' subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the expression "beyond a reasonable doubt" requires clarification for the benefit of the jury.&lt;ref name=Brydon&gt;{{Cite court

  |url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1997/1997canlii319/1997canlii319.html
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading decision is ''[[R. v. Lifchus]]'',&lt;ref name=Lifchus/&gt; where the Supreme Court discussed the proper elements of a [[jury instructions|charge to the jury]] on the concept of "reasonable doubt" and noted that "[t]he correct explanation of the requisite burden of proof is essential to ensure a fair criminal trial." While the Court did not prescribe any specific wording that a trial judge must use to explain the concept, it recommended certain elements that should be included in a jury charge, as well as pointing out comments that should be avoided.

The Supreme Court suggested that the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt should be explained to juries as follows:&lt;ref name=Lifchus/&gt;
* The standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably intertwined with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the [[presumption of innocence]].
* The burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts to the accused.
* A reasonable doubt is not a doubt based upon sympathy or prejudice, and instead, is based on reason and common sense.
* Reasonable doubt is logically connected to the evidence or absence of evidence.
* Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not involve proof to an absolute certainty. It is not proof beyond any doubt, nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt. 
* More is required than proof that the accused is probably guilty. A jury which concludes only that the accused is probably guilty must acquit.

The Court also warned trial judges that they should avoid explaining the concept in the following ways:&lt;ref name=Lifchus/&gt; 
* By describing the term "reasonable doubt" as an ordinary expression which has no special meaning in the criminal law context.
* By inviting jurors to apply to the task before them the same standard of proof that they apply to important, or even the most important, decisions in their own lives.
* By equating proof "beyond a reasonable doubt" to proof "to a moral certainty".
* By qualifying the word "doubt" with adjectives other than "reasonable", such as "serious",  "substantial", or "haunting", which may mislead the jury.
* By instructing jurors that they may convict if they are "sure" that the accused is guilty, before providing them with a proper definition as to the meaning of the words "beyond a reasonable doubt".

The Supreme Court of Canada has since emphasized in ''[[R. v. Starr]]''&lt;ref name=Starr&gt;{{Cite court

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that an effective way to explain the concept is to tell the jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt "falls much closer to absolute certainty than to proof on a balance of probabilities."

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, jurors are typically told throughout a trial that the offence must be proved "beyond reasonable doubt", and judges usually include this in the summing-up.&lt;ref name=Juries1999/&gt; There is no absolute prescription as to how judges should explain reasonable doubt to juries. Judges usually tell jurors that they will be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt if they "feel sure" or "are sure" that the defendant is guilty.&lt;ref name=CrimLR665/&gt; In line with appellate court direction, judges do little to elaborate on this or to explain what it means.&lt;ref name=Juries1999&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Warren |last2=Cameron |first2=Neil |author3=Tinsley, Yvette |title=Juries in Criminal Trials: Part Two |url=http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/1999/11/Publication_76_159_PP37Vol2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=14 April 2012 |series=Preliminary Paper 37 |volume=2 |date=November 1999 |publisher=Law Commission |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=1-877187-42-9 |page=54 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209183448/http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/1999/11/Publication_76_159_PP37Vol2.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CrimLR665&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=William |authorlink1=William Young (judge) |year=2003 |title=Summing-up to juries in criminal cases – what jury research says about current rules and practice |journal=Crim LR |volume=665 |pages=674 |url=http://www.canberra.edu.au/ncf/events/williamyoung.pdf |accessdate=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103091947/http://www.canberra.edu.au/ncf/events/williamyoung.pdf |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 1999 found that many jurors were uncertain what "beyond reasonable doubt" meant. "They generally thought in terms of percentages, and debated and disagreed with each other about the percentage certainty required for 'beyond reasonable doubt', variously interpreting it as 100 per cent, 95 per cent, 75 per cent and even 50 per cent. Occasionally this produced profound misunderstandings about the standard of proof."&lt;ref name=Juries1999/&gt;

In ''[[R v Wanhalla]]'', President [[William Young (judge)|Young]] of the Court of Appeal set out a model jury direction on the standard of proof required for a criminal conviction.

===United States===
In the United States, juries must be [[jury instructions|instructed]] to apply the reasonable doubt standard when determining the guilt or innocence of a criminal defendant, but there is much disagreement as to whether the jury should be given a definition of "reasonable doubt."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Reasonable doubt: to define, or not to define |first=H. A. |last=Diamond |journal=[[Columbia Law Review]] |year=1990 |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=1716–1736 |doi=10.2307/1122751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Victor v. Nebraska]]'' (1994), the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] expressed disapproval of the unclear reasonable doubt instructions at issue, but stopped short of setting forth an exemplary jury instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Victor v. Nebraska, {{ussc|511|1|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Supreme Court first discusses the term in ''[[Miles v. United States]]'' (1880): "The evidence upon which a jury is justified in returning a verdict of guilty must be sufficient to produce a conviction of guilt, to the exclusion of all reasonable doubt."  ''[[In re Winship]]'' (1970) establishes that the doctrine also applies to juvenile criminal proceedings, and indeed to all the essential facts necessary to prove the crime:  "[W]e explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged."

===Japan===
Since 1945, Japan has also operated by a "reasonable doubt" standard, including the doctrine of ''[[in dubio pro reo]]'', which was instituted by the Supreme Court during a controversial murder trial in 1975 (the Shiratori case brought before the Supreme Court of Japan, see for example notes on [[Shigemitsu Dandō]]). However, this is not considered an essential standard in Japan and lower level judges sometimes disregard it.&lt;ref name="Goodman2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Carl F|title=Rule of Law in Japan : A Comparative Analysis - What You See May Not Be What You Get|date=2003|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041189035|page=253&lt;!--|accessdate=1 September 2016--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18409">A '''reception statute''' is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent by which the new nation adopts, or receives, the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] before its independence to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, as well as the [[precedent]]s originating from it, as the default law because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state.

All [[US states]] have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the [[common law]] by judicial opinion, but there is [[Reception statute#United States|a special case of partial reception for Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reception of English common law into new colonies and adoption of common law on decolonization==
In ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] described the process by which [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] followed English colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them [[terra nullius|desert and uncultivated]], and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by [[conquest (military)|conquest]], or ceded to us by [[treaty|treaties]]. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of nations. But there is a difference between these two species of colonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by English subjects, all the English laws then in being, which are the birthright of every subject, are immediately there in force.... But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the [[List of British monarchs|king]] may indeed alter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the law of God, as in the case of an infidel country.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, if an "uninhabited" or "infidel" territory is colonised by Britain, the English law automatically applies in the territory from the moment of colonisation, but if the colonised territory has a pre-existing legal system, the native law would apply (effectively, a form of [[indirect rule]]) until it is formally superseded by the English law by [[Royal Prerogative]], subjected to the [[Westminster Parliament]].

As colonies gained independence from Britain, the newly-independent countries usually adopted [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] [[precedent]] as of the date of independence as the default law to carry forward into the new nation, to the extent that was not explicitly rejected by the founding documents or government.

In some cases, the carry-forward was simply understood, with no express provision in either the new independence constitution or legislation. In other cases, the new legislature preferred to state redundantly but safely that [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] had been received during the colonial period. Examples of both patterns are described below.

== United States ==
After the 1776 [[American Revolution]], one of the first legislative acts undertaken by each of the newly-independent states was to adopt a "reception statute" that gave legal effect to the existing body of [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] to the extent that the legislation or the [[constitution]] had not explicitly rejected English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Michigan High Court Ruling Offers Positive Guidance on Challenges to Tort Reform Laws | last1 = Lammi | first1 = Glenn G. | last2 = Chang | first2 = James | date = December 17, 2004 | journal = Legal Backgrounder | publisher = [[Washington Legal Foundation]] | volume = 19 | issue = 46 | issn=1056-3059|url = http://www.wlf.org/upload/121704LBChang.pdf | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states enacted reception statutes as legislative statutes, but other states received the English common law by provisions of their constitution or by court decision. British traditions such as the [[monarchy]] were rejected by the [[US Constitution]], but many English common law traditions such as [[habeas corpus]], [[jury trials]], and various other [[civil liberties]] were adopted in the United States. Significant elements of English common law prior to 1776 still remain in effect in many jurisdictions in the United States because they have never been rejected by American courts or legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;''Milestones! 200 Years of American Law: Milestones in Our Legal History''. By Jethro Koller Lieberman. Published by West, 1976. Original from the University of California. Digitized Jun 11, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-519881-2}}, p. 16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=i_2wAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the New York Constitution of 1777&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/ny01.htm New York Constitution of 1777] via Avalon Project at [[Yale]] Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; provides that:
{{quote|[S]uch parts of the common law of England, and of the statute law of England and Great Britain, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together did form the law of the said colony on the 19th day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, shall be and continue the law of this State, subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature of this State shall, from time to time, make concerning the same.}}

[[Alexander Hamilton]] emphasized in the [[Federalist Papers]] that the New York constitutional provision expressly made the common law subject "to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa84.htm Federalist 84] (1788).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when reception was effected by a constitution, the common law was still subject to alteration by a legislature's statute.

The [[Northwest Ordinance]], which was approved by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1787, guaranteed "judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law." [[Nathan Dane]], the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, viewed that provision as a default mechanism if federal or territorial statutes were silent about a particular matter. Hr wrote that if "a statute makes an offence, and is silent as to the mode of trial, it shall be by jury, according to the course of the common law."&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Dane, 6 ''General Abridgment and Digest of American Law'' §182, art. 5, 230 (Cummings, Hilliard &amp; Co. 1823).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the provision operated as a reception statute, giving legal authority to the established common law in the vast territories in which no states had yet been established.

Over time, as new states were formed from federal territories, the territorial reception statutes became obsolete and were re-enacted as state law. For example, a reception statute enacted by legislation in the state of Washington states, "The common law, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or of the state of Washington nor incompatible with the institutions and condition of society in this state, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of this state."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington'', [http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/getcase/9th/case/9835154&amp;exact=1 271 F.3d 835] (9th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In that way, the common law was eventually incorporated into the legal systems of every state (except for the [[law of Louisiana]] for which some areas of law were received as [[common law]] and others were adopted from French and Spanish sources).

Certain anomalies exist within certain US states because of the effective branching of the law in different directions. For example, the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] adopted the [[English common law]] upon becoming independent but before [[England]] abolished [[trial by combat]]. Thus, it has been argued that the right to request trial by combat theoretically still exists in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/trial-by-combat-in-the-united-states-2013-11&lt;/ref&gt; at least as far as a [[form of action]] under which the common law had authorized trial by combat would be available in Virginia.

==Canada==
The Canadian colonies received the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] and English statutes under Blackstone's principles for the establishment of the legal system of a new colony. In five of the ten Canadian provinces, English law was received automatically, under the principle of a settled colony inheriting English law. In the other provinces and in the three territories, reception was governed by reception statutes. The reception of English law occurred long before Canada became fully independent and so reception statutes in Canada were not part of the decolonisation process.

When Canada achieved formal independence with the passage of the [[Canada Act 1982]], no reception statutes were necessary for the decolonialisation process.  English law had already been received in all the various Canadian provinces and territories by legislation and judicial decisions over the previous two centuries.

=== Atlantic provinces ===
In the four Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador), the reception of English law was automatic, under the principle set out by Blackstone relating to settled colonies. British colonists were considered to have brought English common law and the applicable English statutes with them and so no reception statute was necessary.

The reception date for New Brunswick is 1660, for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island 1758, and for Newfoundland and Labrador 1825.

=== Quebec ===
Quebec was settled as a French colony and originally operated under the French civil law system by using the ''Coûtume de Paris''. Upon the transfer of the colony to British control, the British government issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which imposed English common law on the colony under the principle set out in Blackstone relating to captured colonies. However, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]], which restored the French civil law for matters of private law (matters such as contracts, property, and successions (wills)) but kept the English common law as the basis for public law in the colony, notably the criminal law.

With the passage of the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]] in 1866, Quebec's civil law became entirely statute-based and used the civil law system for matters within provincial jurisdiction.

Public law in Quebec continues to have its origin in the common law, but even then, civil law plays a strong role. If federal legislation requires interpretation, judges must look to the Civil Code of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific (1976), [1977] 2 S.C.R 1054; St-Hilaire v. Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 63, [2001] 4 FC 289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontario ===
The territory now forming Ontario was originally part of Quebec and so was under the civil law. When Quebec was divided into the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada by the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the first Act passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada was to adopt the law of England for all purposes, replacing the civil law.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to repeal certain parts of an Act passed in the Fourteenth Year of His Majesty's Reign, intituled an Act for making more effectual Provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec in North America;  and to introduce the English Law, as the Rule of Decision in all matters of controversy relative to Property and Civil Rights'', S.U.C. 1792 (32 Geo. III), c. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; That statute adopted both the English common law and English statute law. The foundation for the operation of the common law in Ontario traces back to that reception statute.

=== North-West Territories, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta ===
The new Dominion of Canada acquired the territories of  [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1870. Those territories were considered to have been settled by British colonists and so the reception of English law was automatic. However, the long history of control by the Hudson's Bay Company caused some uncertainty as to the date of reception. To resolve the uncertainty, various statutes were passed to set the date of reception to July 15, 1870, the date of the transfer of those two territories to Canada. The Province of Manitoba set that date for the reception of English law for matters coming within provincial jurisdiction. The Legislature of the North-West Territories passed an ordinance, adopting the same date for matters coming within territorial jurisdiction.

The federal Parliament eventually enacted a provision adopting that date for all matters in the North-West Territories.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/NWT.pdf The North-West Territories Act]'', R.S.C.1885, c. 50, s. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; That provision was carried forward in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan when they were created by the [[Alberta Act]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/aa_1905.html Alberta Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 3, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Saskatchewan Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/SK%20Act.pdf Saskatchewan Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 42, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same provision is the basis for the reception date of English law in the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.

=== British Columbia ===
British Columbia was considered to be a settled colony and so received English law automatically, under the principle set out by Blackstone.

==Hong Kong==

Hong Kong was ceded (in case of the [[New Territories]], leased) to the United Kingdom by [[Qing dynasty]] of China by a series of treaties, starting with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842. As a ceded or leased territory with its own set of laws, the [[Great Qing Legal Code]] remained in force for the local Chinese population. Until the late 19th century, a Chinese man convicted of [[murder]] would be executed by [[decapitation]], but an Englishman convicted of the same crime would be sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. It was not until 1971, nearly six decades after the fall of the Qing dynasty, that the of the Qing Code was completely abolished in Hong Kong. Even then, some vestiges of it remain. For example, before the Marriage Reform Ordinance 1970 (Cap. 178) came into force on 7 October 1971, a man could practice [[polygamy]] by virtue of the Qing Code. The courts still refer to the Qing Code on the inheritance rights of surviving [[concubinage|concubines]] married before 1971 and that of their children.

When Hong Kong was handed over to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997, Hong Kong retained the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] in a reception statute in Chapter I, Article 8, of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html |title=Chapter I, Section 8 of Hong Kong Basic Law |publisher=Basiclaw.gov.hk |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.}}

==Republic of Ireland==

The 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] stated that pre-existing laws would remain in force except if repugnant to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution of the Irish Free State|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 73 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] does likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article50_1|title=Constitution of Ireland|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 50.1 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither explicitly stated whether that meant only the statute law or, more broadly, the common law and [[equity (law)|equity]] as well. The [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] has generally taken the broader view.&lt;ref name="Keane2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keane|first=Ronan|title=Equity and the Law of Trusts in the Republic of Ireland|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=16 July 2016|year=2011|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847667021|pages=22–23, sec.2.39|chapter=The Historical Background}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other British colonies==
The pattern was repeated in many other former British colonies as they gained independence from the United Kingdom. [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Belize]] and various Caribbean and African nations have adopted English common law by reception statutes although they do not inevitably continue to copy English common law; later cases can often draw on decisions in other common law jurisdictions. The colony of [[New South Wales]] formally received the English common law in 1828, and each of the other Australian colonies received the common law of New South Wales upon its founding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4680">'''Research Committee on Sociology of Law''' (RCSL) was established in 1962 by [[William M. Evan]] ([[University of Pennsylvania]]) and [[Adam Podgórecki]] ([[University of Warsaw]]), with the support of [[Renato Treves]] ([[University of Milan]]) during the Congress of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA), which was held in Weshington D. C. Treves was elected as the first president of the RCSL, Podgórecki as the vice-president and Evan as the Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The RCSL aimed at "opening up a broader
range of opportunities for the participation of individual members in the activities of
the Association in the field of [[sociology of law]]".&lt;ref&gt;The RCSL Statutes (as modified in July 2009) are available at http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_Statutes_2009.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCSL was initially formed as a largely informal forum to encourage and facilitate exchanges between sociologists of law from different countries. A Board was created in 1968, formal by-laws were adopted in 1973, and regular election were organised once every fourth year.&lt;ref&gt;The RCSL Statutes (as modified in July 2009) are available at http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_Statutes_2009.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The RCSL also holds annual meetings, occasionally together with other similar associations such as the Law and Society Associations or the Socio-Legal Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;See the editoria by Johannes Feest, on the 40th anniversary of RCSL in RCSL Newsletter, Summer Issue 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual meetings are often devoted to specific theoretical and methodological themes, but space is reserved for organising sessions on general topics. The selection of themes and the call for papers are the responsibility of the RCSL Board and is carried out in cooperation with the local organising committee. The RCSL Board encourages countries not represented by its Board members to participate and to submit suggestions for organising its annual meetings.

Since the late 1960s, RCSL has supported the formation of permanent Working Groups, which focus on various research areas such as Comparative Studies of Legal Professions, Social and Legal Systems, Comparative Legal Cultures, Gender, Law and Politics, Law and Urban Space, Family and Human Rights, in order to promote research in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;For a complete list of Working Groups see: http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_wg.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 1988, the RCSL signed an agreement with Government of the Basque Country creating the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]] in [[Oñati]] which is located in the province of [[Guipúzcoa]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in the north of [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;See RCSL, ''30 Years for the Sociology of Law'', Oñati, IISL, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:University Onate.JPG|right|thumb|The University of Oñati which houses the International Institute for the Sociology of Law.]]

Since its establishment in 1962, the RCSL has contributed to the development of the [[Sociology of law]] by systematically promoting social scientific research about law, legal institutions and legal systems. For more information see the section on [[Sociology of law]] and the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;For a worldwide overview of socio-legal scholarship, produced in the late 1980s, see Ferrari, Vincenzo (ed.), ''Developing Sociology of Law. A World-Wide Documentary Enquiry'', Milano, Giuffré, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masayuki Murayama (Japan) is currently the President of the RCSL. Previous Presidents include Vittorio Olgiati (Italy), Anne Boigeol (France), [[Lawrence Friedman]] (Stanford, USA), Johannes Feest (Bremen, Germany), Rogelio Perez Perdomo (IESA, Caracas, Venezuela), Mavis Maclean (Oxford, UK), Vincenzo Ferrari (Degli Studi Milano, Italy), Jean van Houtte (Belgian), Jan Glastra Van Loon (the Netherlands) and Renato Treves (Italy).

'''Adam Podgórecki Prize'''

"In honour and memory of the lifetime achievements of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his place in the history of RCSL, the Board of RCSL established the annual RCSL Adam Podgórecki Prize at its meeting in 2004. The Prize is awarded for outstanding achievements in socio-legal research, either in the form of distinguished and outstanding lifetime achievements in one year or in the form of outstanding scholarship of a socio-legal researcher at an earlier stage of his or her career, in the next year of the award."&lt;ref&gt;For more information see ee http://www.isa-sociology.org/rc12_prize.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

A '''retainer agreement''' is a [[work for hire]] [[contract]]. It falls between a [[one-off]] contract and [[permanent employment]], which may be [[full-time]] or [[part-time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waters|first1=Erika|title=How to Do a Retainer Agreement|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/retainer-agreement-43296.html|website=Texas Chronicle|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC]]|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinguishing feature is that the client or [[customer]] pays in advance for [[professional]] work to be specified later. The purpose of a retainer fee is to ensure payment for future services or work to be rendered.

A retainer agreement may incorporate other contractual provisions regarding the performance of services, or the parties may potentially enter into additional contracts that define the other terms of their working relationship. A retainer fee may be paid on a fixed, pre-negotiated rate or on a variable hourly rate depending on the nature of retainer and also, the practice of the professional being retained.

==Legal services==
It is common for a person seeking the services of a [[lawyer]] (attorney) to pay a retainer ("retainer fee") to the lawyer, to see a case through to its conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retainer|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/retainer|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A retainer can be a single advance payment or a recurring (e.g. monthly) payment.&lt;ref name="ell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Lawyer Fee Agreements and Retainers|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer-protection/lawyer-fee-agreements-and-retainers|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=26 September 2017|date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absent an agreement to the contrary, a retainer fee is refundable if the work is not performed.&lt;ref name="ell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lane|first1=Mary|title=Retaining the professional retainer when the client is in financial distress|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=df17b6c0-5d8e-462c-a138-accf76dcaaf8|website=Lexology|accessdate=26 September 2017|date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The retainer agreement may serve as the basis of authority for a legal advocate. It may limit a lawyer's authority to specific tasks or services, as opposed to providing authority for general purposes. For example, if a lawyer is hired for purposes of litigation, during litigation the advocate will normally be authorized by the client to accept service of documents for which personal service upon the client is not required. In addition to being formally described in a retainer agreement, a client's grant of authority to an attorney may be implied, apparent or usual through the normal practice of the legal professional in providing representation to a client.&lt;ref&gt;See Watts v The Official Solicitor 1936 1 All ER 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}

'''Rights''' are [[law|legal]], social, or [[ethics|ethical]] [[principle]]s of [[Liberty|freedom]] or [[entitlement]]; that is, rights are the fundamental [[normative]] rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt; Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as [[law]] and [[ethics]], especially theories of [[justice]] and [[deontology]].
 
Rights are often considered fundamental to [[civilization]], for they are regarded as established pillars of [[society]] and [[culture]],&lt;ref&gt;UN [[UDHR]] Preamble: "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of [[social conflict]]s can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "rights structure the form of [[government]]s, the content of [[laws]], and the shape of [[morality]] as it is currently perceived".&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;

==Definitional issues==
[[File:RNC 04 protest 89.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street protest scene; people deliberately lying down on a busy city street, surrounded by onlookers and police|Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it was advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].]]
There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.

One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done.
|publisher = ''Stanford University''
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:
{{cquote|''Who'' is alleged to have the right: Children's rights, animal rights, workers' rights, states' rights, the rights of peoples. ''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;}}
There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].

===Natural versus legal===
[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]
{{Main|Natural and legal rights}}
* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are "natural" in the sense of "not artificial, not man-made", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.
* '''Legal rights''', in contrast, are based on a society's customs, laws, [[statute]]s or actions by [[legislature]]s. An example of a legal right is the ''right to vote'' of citizens. [[Citizenship]], itself, is often considered as the basis for having legal rights, and has been defined as the "right to have rights". Legal rights are sometimes called ''[[civil rights]]'' or ''statutory rights'' and are culturally and politically [[moral relativism|relative]] since they depend on a specific societal context to have meaning.

Some thinkers see rights in only one sense while others accept that both senses have a measure of validity. There has been considerable philosophical debate about these senses throughout history. For example, [[Jeremy Bentham]] believed that legal rights were the essence of rights, and he denied the existence of natural rights; whereas [[Thomas Aquinas]] held that rights purported by [[positive law]] but not grounded in [[natural law]] were not properly rights at all, but only a facade or pretense of rights.

===Claim versus liberty===
[[File:Chorin deed 1273.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a deed which has hand-written writing on a yellowed piece of paper with three gold tassles at the bottom|A [[deed]] is an example of a ''claim right'' in the sense that it asserts a ''right'' to own land. This particular deed dates back to 1273.]]
{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}
* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;Fagan, Andrew. "Human Rights". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b&lt;/ref&gt; In logic, this idea can be expressed as: "Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something." Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like "life, liberty, and property"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt; This can be expressed in logic as: "Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something." For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.

===Positive versus negative===
{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}
In one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:
* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported "right to welfare."&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf/&gt;
* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass "privileges" and "powers") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass "claims" and "immunities").

===Individual versus group===
{{Main|Individual and group rights}}
The general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].&lt;ref name=tws18decafafa&gt;{{cite news
|author = Ayn Rand
|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights
|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]
|publisher = ''The Ayn Rand Lexicon''
|date = 2009-12-18
|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html
|accessdate = 2009-12-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''. Accordingly:
* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.
[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]
* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a "right" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term "group" as well as by the term "group rights."{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed "individual rights" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the "group rights" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.

The [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].

===Other senses===
Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.

==Politics==
[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their "Miranda rights". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]
Rights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.

Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.

Some examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],&lt;ref name=tws21decghnnb&gt;{{cite news

Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as "rights" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a "right to medical care" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the "right to a fair trial".

Further, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of "rights" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].&lt;ref name=tws21dece563e&gt;{{cite news
|author = John E. Roemer
|title = Roemer on equality of opportunity
|quote = Equality of opportunity is to be contrasted with equality of outcome. While advocacy of the latter has been traditionally associated with a left-wing political philosophy, the former has been championed by conservative political philosophy. Equality of outcome fails to hold individuals responsible for imprudent actions that may, absent redress, reduce the values of the outcomes they enjoy, or for wise actions that would raise the value of the outcomes above the levels of others’. Equality of opportunity, in contrast, ‘levels the playing field,’ so that all have the potential to achieve the same outcomes; whether or not, in the event, they do, depends upon individual choice.

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], [[meta-ethics]] is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].

While normative ethics addresses such questions as "What should one do?", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as "What ''is'' goodness?" and "How can we tell what is good from what is bad?", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

Rights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).
Rights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:
* Duties ([[deontology]])
* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])
* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])
* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])

Rights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.

===Criticism===
Some philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them "nonsense upon stilts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85–88 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - rihte.jpg|thumb|"rihte," an Old English word for 'right']]
The [[Modern English]] word ''right'' derives from [[Old English]] ''riht'' or ''reht'', in turn from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*riχtaz'' meaning "right" or "direct", and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*reg-to-'' meaning "having moved in a straight line", in turn from ''*(o)reg'(a)-'' meaning "to straighten or direct".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:right]]&lt;/ref&gt; In several different [[Indo-European languages]], a single word derived from the same root means both "right" and "law", such as French ''droit'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:droit]]&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish ''derecho'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:derecho]]&lt;/ref&gt; German ''Recht'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:recht]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian ''diritto''.

Many other words related to normative or regulatory concepts derive from this same root, including ''correct'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:correct]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''regulate'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regulate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''rex''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rex#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning "king"), whence ''regal''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and thence ''royal''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:royal]]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise many more geometric terms derive from this same root, such as ''erect'' (as in "upright"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:erect]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''rectangle'' (literally "[[right angle]]"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rectangle]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''straight''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:straight]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''stretch''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:stretch]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''right'', the English words ''rule''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rule]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ruler'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ruler]]&lt;/ref&gt; deriving still from the same root, have both normative or regulatory and geometric meanings (e.g. a ruler as in a king, or a ruler as in a straightedge).

Several other roots have similar normative and geometric descendants, such as Latin ''norma'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norma#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; whence ''[[norm (philosophy)|norm]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norm]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''normal'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''normative''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normative]]&lt;/ref&gt; itself, and also geometric concepts such as ''[[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]''; and likewise Greek ''ortho''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ortho]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin ''ordo'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordo]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning either "right" or "correct" (as in ''orthodox'', meaning "correct opinion"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthodox]]&lt;/ref&gt;) or "straight" or "perpendicular" (as in ''orthogonal'', meaning "perpendicular angle"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthogonal]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and thence ''order'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:order]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''ordinary'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordinary]]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

==History==
{{see also|History of human rights}}
[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Magna Carta]]'' or "Great Charter" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights. It reduced the power of the monarch.]]

The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.

Historically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to respected from his son did not indicate a right from the son to receive a return from that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave a lot of room for many rights for the subjects themselves.&lt;ref name=tws21decfrre&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1432">The '''''Scholia Sinaitica''''' are fragments of a work of [[Roman law]] written in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], dating between 438 and 529 AD, containing comments to the books 35-38 of [[Ulpian]]'s ''ad Sabinum'' treatise.

The papyrus fragments that show parts of the work were discovered by the Greek scholar [[Gregorios Bernardakis]] in the 19th century in a [[Mount Sinai]] convent.

The scroll is not the work of a single author, but of different authors at different times who are generally thought to be of Eastern origin. The literature suggests that the authors were connected to the [[Law School of Beirut]], they cite numerous works of Roman jurists, texts from imperial constitutions and also the ''[[Codex Gregorianus]]'', the ''[[Codex Hermogenianus]]'' and the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]],'' demonstrating knowledge and availability of legal texts of Roman law broader than that demonstrated by contemporary authors of the [[Western Roman Empire|western part]] of the empire.&lt;ref name="rec"&gt;{{cite book | title=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society | publisher=American Philosophical Society | year=1953 | isbn= 9780871694324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11570">The '''state of defence''' (in German: '''Verteidigungsfall''' or '''V-Fall''') is the constitutional [[state of emergency]] in Germany if the country is "under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115a Article 115a GG]&lt;/ref&gt; Established by a [[German Emergency Acts|constitutional amendment]] in 1968 during the [[Cold War]], this state of emergency gives the [[Politics of Germany|federal government]] extraordinary powers in wartime. It is laid down in the articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G13 115a to 115l] (title Xa) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]]. As of October 2018, Germany has never been in the state of defence.

==Declaration==
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115a 115a] of the German Constitution, the State of Defence shall be declared if "the federal territory [of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]] is under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack".

The normal procedure is that, upon request of the [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government]], the [[Bundestag]] determines that the conditions of the State of Defence exist. That means that the Bundestag does not actually declare the State of Defence; instead, it just decides whether it exists or not. (If, for example, a foreign army invaded Germany, the Bundestag would determine that the action is an "attack by armed force", as described in article 115a, and so Germany is in the State of Defence.) The determination requires at least two thirds of the votes of the Bundestag present at that time (at least half of the members being the [[quorum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/btgo_1980/__45.html section 45 of the Rules of Procedure of the German Bundestag] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;). It also has to be approved by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] with more than half of its members, which, according to general Bundesrat protocol, is given in bundled form by each Land.

If the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or not able to reach a quorum, the ''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee]]'' decides on their behalf.

If Germany is under attack by armed force and the Bundestag, the Bundesrat and the Joint Committee are not able to determine the State of Defence immediately, "the determination shall be deemed to have been made and promulgated at the time the attack began". If, for example, an invasion started on January 4 at 4:17&amp;nbsp;a.m., Germany would be in the State of Defence from that time, and the government could react immediately.)

==Consequences==
===Commander-in-chief===
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115b 115b] [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|GG]], the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Federal Chancellor]] becomes [[Commander-in-chief#Germany|Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Bundeswehr|armed forces]]. (Normally, the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]] holds that post.)

===Extension of federal legislative powers===
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115c 115c] GG, the federal government has extended legislative powers:

*The federal government may pass laws with respect to any matter even if it would normally be under exclusive legislative power of the [[Länder]].
*Temporary provisions concerning the compensation for [[expropriations]] may differ from [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P14 those] laid down in the constitution.
*A law may rule that people arrested by police may be held in custody for four days before being brought before a judge (instead of "no later than the day following his arrest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P104 article 104 GG]&lt;/ref&gt;) However, that applies only if no judge has been able to act in the normal time limit.
*Laws concerning financial matters may differ from the requirements laid down in the titles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G9 VIII], ''(The Execution of Federal Laws and the Federal Administration)'' [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G10 VIIIa] ''(Joint Tasks)'' and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G12 X] ''(Finance)'' of the constitution.

==Legislative procedure==
The normal legislative procedure is replaced by a faster one:
*According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115d 115d] GG, bills are discussed "without delay" and adopted by the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, in a single joint session.

===Joint Committee===
The ''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee]]'' (Gemeinsamer Ausschuss) consists of members of the [[Bundestag]] and members of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Two thirds of the committee members are provided by the Bundestag, one third provided by the Bundesrat. The committee members of the Bundestag are designated by the Bundestag "in proportion to the relative strength of the various parliamentary groups". Every Land is represented by a Bundesrat member. The committee members of the Bundestag must not be members of the Cabinet, and the committee members of the Bundesrat are exceptionally "not bound by instructions". There are thus 16 members of the Bundesrat (one for each Land), and 32 members of the Bundestag (twice the number of Bundesrat members), giving it a total number of 48 members. The members of the Joint Committee and their deputies are already designated during peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/plenum/gemeinsamer_ausschuss/mitglieder.html current members of the Joint Committee] (January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee takes over the tasks of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat if, during the State of Defence, it determines, with a two-thirds majority of its vote, that either the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or reach a [[quorum]]. That majority must include at least a majority of all committee members (at least 25 members). For example, if only 30 committee members could be reached, 20 votes would be a two-thirds majority, but at least 25 votes would be required for the determination. If the Joint Committee is not able to reach full strength (48 members), the Bundestag (in case of missing or dead Bundestag committee members) and/or the state governments (in case of missing or dead Bundesrat committee members) designate new committee members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gemausgo/__1.html section 1 of the Rules of Procedure of the Joint Committee] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee takes over any task normally dealt by the Bundestag and/or the Bundesrat. All decisions which would normally be made by the either the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat, or both of them, is made by the entire Joint Committee. However, there are some limitations to the power of the Joint Committee (when compared to Bundestag and Bundesrat):
*It may not amend, abrogate or suspend the constitution, in whole or in part.
*It may not enact laws pursuant to Articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P23 23] ''(European Union - Protection of basic rights - Principle of subsidiarity)'', [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P24 24] ''(Transfer of sovereign powers - System of collective security)'', or [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P29 29] ''(New delimitation of the federal territory)'' of the constitution.
*A [[constructive vote of no confidence]] by the Joint Committee requires a two-thirds majority (instead of just the majority of the votes needed for a vote of no confidence by the Bundestag).
*Laws enacted by the Joint Committee may be repealed at any time by the Bundestag, with the consent of the Bundesrat.

The Joint Committee is based on Articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0249 53a] ''(Composition - Rules of procedure)'' and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0694 115e] ''(Joint Committee)'' of the constitution, as well as on own [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gemausgo/BJNR111020969.html rules of procedure].

===Use of Federal Border Guard===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115f 115f], paragraph (1), clause 1 GG, the Federal Government may employ the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|Federal Border Guard]] throughout the federal territory, everywhere in Germany. By law a [[Compulsory Border Guard Service]] is still in force, but will only be executed in the state of defence or if there are not enough volunteers joining the federal police.

When the Emergency Acts were passed, the Federal Border Guard was a [[paramilitary]] police force responsible only for the protection of [[West Germany]]'s external land and sea borders. Over the decades, however, the role of the Federal Border Guard and even its name have changed to [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]]. The Federal Police is also responsible for the security of the [[rail transport in Germany|railway network]], [[airport security]] and the protection of federal buildings. However, as the entire title [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G13 Xa] has not been changed after it had been passed in 1968, the term ''Federal Border Guard'' is still used in the constitution.

===Extended powers of instruction===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115f 115f], paragraph (1), clause 2 GG, the federal government may issue instructions to state governments and state authorities. (Normally, state governments act on their own, and Land authorities receive their orders only from the Land government.)

===Extended electoral terms===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115h 115h] GG, electoral terms that would expire during the State of Defence are extended:
*The electoral term of the [[Bundestag]] or a [[Landtag#Modern legislatures|state parliament]] ends six months after the end of the State of Defence.
*The term of office of the [[President of Germany|President]] ends nine months after the end of the State of Defence.

===Conscription===
In 2011, the German Conscription Act was changed to abolish peacetime conscription. From July 1, conscripts may not be drafted except during a State of Tension or a State of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wehrpflg/__2.html section 2 of the Conscription Act] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115l 115l] GG, the State of Defence ends when it is ended by the Bundestag "if the conditions for determining it no longer exist", such as after a [[peace treaty]] is signed.

'''The Fund for American Studies''' is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]] Founded in 1967, the organization's stated goal is "to change the world by developing leaders for a free society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.tfas.org/Page.aspx?pid=1912|publisher=The Fund For American Studies|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; TFAS is a conservative organization specializing in the free market. It has professional associations with conservative organisations like the State Policy Network and Charles Koch Institute&lt;ref&gt;https://www.charleskochinstitute.org/professional-education/partner-organizations/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://spn.org/directory/&lt;/ref&gt; and receives regular donations.&lt;ref&gt;http://conservativetransparency.org/top/?recipient=848&amp;yr=&amp;yr1=1987&amp;yr2=2014&amp;submit=&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Fund for American Studies headquarters.JPG|thumb|The Fund for American Studies headquarters located in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In 1967, [[Charles Edison]] took the first steps toward establishing the institution that is known today as The Fund for American Studies. Edison was a former governor of New Jersey, Secretary of the Navy and son of inventor [[Thomas Alva Edison]].

Concerned about an eroding confidence in the American system of government, Edison recruited [[Walter H. Judd]], David R. Jones, [[Marvin Liebman]], and [[William F. Buckley,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], to build a program that would educate college students about American government, politics, and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frohnen|first1=Bruce|last2=Beer|first2=Jeremy|last3=Jeffrey|first3=Nelson|title=American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia|date=2014|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=9781497651579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 1967, the group incorporated the Charles Edison Youth Fund. In 1969 Governor Edison died suddenly. To honor him and carry on his mission, the organization was renamed the Charles Edison Memorial Youth Fund. In 1985 the organization was renamed again to its present-day title, The Fund for American Studies. In the summer of 1970, the Edison Fund organized the inaugural Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems. Fifty-seven students attended the first Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Messer-Davidow|first1=Ellen|title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse|date=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822383581|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Fund for American Studies sponsors 11 collegiate academic programs. Nine Institutes are held each summer in Washington, D.C., the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Hong Kong]]. A tenth Institute is held during the fall and spring semesters in Washington, D.C., and an eleventh Institute is held in [[Santiago, Chile]], in January. The institutes combine lectures, coursework, internships, evening lectures, and site briefings at key institutions of national government.

In addition to its summer and semester Institutes, TFAS sponsors other educational programs and conferences for professors and students throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs|url=http://www.tfas.org/Page.aspx?pid=221|publisher=The Fund For American Studies|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engalitcheff Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems (ICPES) ===

Since it was established in 1970, over 4,000 students have attended ICPES. This Institute is intended primarily for students interested in careers in government, international affairs, public policy and academia. Students study the American political system and market economics and hold internships with places of political and economic interest such as [[Capitol Hill]], federal agencies, think tanks, political groups, or international affairs organizations.

The Institute was named in 1994 in honor of entrepreneur John Engalitcheff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Featured Supporter: John Engalitcheff|url=https://www.tfas.org/featured-supporter-john-engalitcheff|publisher=The Fund For American Studies|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute on Political Journalism (IPJ)===
IPJ was established in 1985 to educate future journalists about ethical reporting and covering issues involving economic concepts.

The competitive program accepts a limited number of undergraduate journalism students to attend the Institute each summer. Program participants attend classes in economics and ethics and intern with major news organizations. The students also attend events at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] and regular briefings at principal news sites such as Congress, the [[U.S. State Department]] and the Federal Reserve Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Document.Doc?&amp;id=21|title=TFAS 2006 Annual Report Page 11|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute on Business and Government Affairs (IBGA)===

Established in 1990, IBGA explores the practical and theoretical questions surrounding the dynamic business-government relationship. Students examine the economic and political issues that shape how business and government interact as well as the importance of representing the interests of business before Congress. Accepted students earn course credit, intern with corporate governmental affairs office and trade associations and attend panel discussions with leaders in the profession.

The Institute was established in 1990 and was named in honor of [[Bryce Harlow]] until 2006 when it was renamed the Institute on Business and Government Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tfas.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=244|title=TFAS Website |accessdate=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute on Philanthropy and Voluntary Service (IPVS)===

IPVS was established in 1999 as an academic and internship program for college students involved in volunteer activities and interested in a professional career in the nonprofit sector.  The program curriculum includes service projects, an internship matched to the student’s interest and course credit.&lt;ref name="TFAS U.S. Programs Page"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=244&amp;srcid=221|title=TFAS U.S. Programs Page|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Document.Doc?&amp;id=21|title=TFAS 2006 Annual Report Page 19|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institute on Economics and International Affairs (IEIA)===

Approximately 60 undergraduate leaders attend the Institute on Economics and International Affairs (IEIA) in order to gain real-world experience in the nation's capital interning on Capitol Hill, federal agencies, think tanks, foreign policy groups, embassies, or international affairs organizations. Academic study is focused on current foreign policy issues, political trends and the economics of the free market.&lt;ref name="TFAS U.S. Programs"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tfas.org/Page.aspx?pid=244|title=TFAS U.S. Programs Page|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital Semester (CS)===

Capital Semester is a 15-week academic and internship program offered each fall and spring in Washington, D.C. Participants of the program are enrolled as full-time students, placed with an internship in their area of interest and housed in furnished apartments on Capitol Hill. Students also attend briefings at the White House, State Department, and Capitol Hill as well as guest lectures from government officials and policy makers.  In 2007 CS added a political journalism component for students interested in print or broadcast journalism, politics or public relations.&lt;ref name="TFAS U.S. Programs Page"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Document.Doc?&amp;id=21|title=TFAS 2006 Annual Report Page 23|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal Studies Institute (LSI)===
LSI was established in the summer of 2007. The ten-week program combines legal clerkships, academic coursework for credit, networking opportunities, and career development activities. Participants of the program interact with leaders of the legal profession and visit points of judicial and executive interest in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tfas.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=847&amp;srcid=244|title=TFAS Programs: Legal Studies Page|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trial advocacy''' is the branch of knowledge concerned with making attorneys and other advocates more effective in trial proceedings.  Trial advocacy is taught in primary, secondary, and undergraduate schools (usually associated with a [[mock trial]] elective).&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, John E. ''Law for Business and Personal Use'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  It is taught as an essential trade skill for litigators in [[law school]]s and in [[continuing legal education]] programs.

The skills of trial advocacy can be broken into two categories: skills that accomplish individual tasks ([[Tactic (method)|tactical skills]]) such as selecting jurors, delivering opening statements and closing arguments, and examining witnesses, and those skills that integrate the individual actions to achieve greater effects and to drive unfolding events toward the advocate’s desired outcome ([[litigation strategy|strategy]]) .&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S., ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[law school]] trial advocacy courses focus on tactical skills, though some integrate basic methods of strategic planning.  Some academics have expressed disfavor with advanced strategic techniques because of the imbalance they create, especially against attorneys who are unaware of them.  Proponents of advanced strategic techniques argue that these methods are the only effective means to counter the already-existing imbalances in the system, as between [[indigent]] defendants and the state, and between working-class [[plaintiff]]s and well-resourced, [[wealth]]y [[Conglomerate (company)|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advocacyteaching.blogspot.com/2013/01/trial-advocacy-professors-tell-me-that.html Selby-Dreier Debate on ''Advocacy Teaching'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like most legal skills, trial advocacy evolved through the apprenticeship and practice of attorneys.  Even after 1900 (when the education of attorneys shifted to [[law schools]]&lt;ref&gt;Harno, Albert James (2004), ''Legal Education in the United States'' p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;) most law schools offered little education in advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Kutcher, Edward A.; Lee, Robert B. (1962) ''The Deterioration of Trial Advocacy-Are the Laws Schools Responsible?''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Bar Association (1967) ''The Law School Curriculum and Advocacy Training''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969, in response to criticism within the judicial system that law schools were not properly preparing attorneys for trial practice, a group of lawyers and law professors combined to form the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]] (NITA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nita.org/About#History NITA website]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many law schools have added or improved their instruction in trial advocacy, and numerous [[Continuing Legal Education]] organizations have offered classes surveying the subject area, and on specific topics within the field.  Currently nearly one dozen law schools in the United States offer [[Master of Law]] (LL.M.) degrees in trial advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Eric, Princeton Review (2013) ''The Best 168 Law Schools''&lt;/ref&gt;
Trial advocacy originally focused on individual actions within the trial, proposing methods for improved selection of jurors, delivery of argument, and direct and cross examination.  However, in the 1970s, NITA advanced the concepts of theme and theory as methods of integrating the various components into a cohesive whole.&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven (2004) ''Modern Trial Advocacy''&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, [[Litigation Strategy|litigation strategy]] has blossomed with the importation of concepts from economic [[game theory]], [[Complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[Gestalt psychology]], and the application of [[maneuver warfare]] as a means not only of integrating the various actions within the trial into a comprehensive case, but also as a means of gaining a decisive advantage over opposing counsel.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics in trial advocacy==
The topics commonly encompassed within Trial Advocacy are:

===Jury selection or ''voir dire''===
{{Main|Jury selection|Voir dire}}
The selection of jurors that will be receptive to the argument the attorney intends to make.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 529 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening statement===
{{Main|Opening statement}}
Presenting a non-argumentative overview of what the jury will see, often in the context of the attorney’s theme, theory and story.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 8 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct examination===
{{Main|Direct examination}}
Eliciting evidence from one’s own witnesses through non-[[leading question]]s.  Because studies have shown that people best remember the first and the most recent (last) information heard (methods referred to as [[Serial position effect|primacy and recency]]), the preferred method is to start with an engaging and favorable topic, move through more mundane matters, and to finish on a strong, favorable point.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 45 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross examination===
{{Main|Cross examination}}
Working with witnesses offered by the opposing party who may be [[hostile witness|hostile]] or uncooperative.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 83 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closing argument===
{{Main|Closing argument}} 
Using [[argument]] to create within the jurors a perception of what they have seen and heard that influences them to find in favor of the attorney’s client.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 467 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persuasion===
{{Main|Persuasion}}
The general principles that enable an advocate to make the jurors more receptive to his claims.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Lubet, p. 16, 32 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mock trial===
{{Main|Mock trial}}
In mock trial, students take responsibility for the [[prosecution]]/[[plaintiff]] or [[defense counsel|defense]] case in a trial presented using fabricated evidence, and role-players as witnesses and faculty or volunteers as judge or jury.  It evaluates the participants’ skills in argument, evidence handling, and examination of witnesses, but omits jury selection and strategic matters.  Mock trial differs from [[moot court]] in that moot court practices appellate argument, and so involves no handling of witnesses or evidence, but rather is an exercise in legal research and oral advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Korzen, John (2010) ''Make Your Argument: Succeeding in Moot Court and Mock Trial''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing a case into a clear and complete presentation.
* Case Diagrams: In which the attorney charts the elements he / she intends to prove (or attack) and the evidence that will support each. These ensures the case is comprehensively addressed.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g. Indiana Law School web site [http://www.law.indiana.edu/instruction/tanford/web/reference/basictactics.html], accessed March 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theme and Theory: The theme is a sound bite that captures the emotional appeal of the case, and the theory is an explanation of events.  These serve as strategic focal points, allowing individual actions (opening, examination of each witness, etc.) to be united with a common focus, and in a way that clarifies and reinforces the perception of the case the attorney wants the jury or judge to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Lubet, p. 411 et. Seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced trial strategy===
{{Main|Litigation strategy}}
The means of organizing the case to maximize the combined impact of every element, and to overwhelm or outmaneuver the opposing counsel while presenting a clear, decisive argument to the jury (or judge, in the case of bench trials).&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S. (2012) ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win'' pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced strategic skills, based upon [[psychology]] and [[maneuver warfare|military maneuver philosophy]], are generally learned outside the classroom, as few law schools teach them.  In fact, [[academic]]s have criticized advanced strategic techniques for tipping [[verdict]]s through means unrelated to the [[merit (law)|merits of the case]].  For example, these techniques may be used to cause an advocate unfamiliar with them to take actions that unwittingly undermine his client’s interests.  There is particular concern regarding the use of advanced strategic techniques by [[prosecutor]]s, who already wield the substantial power of the State against often poorly resourced defendants.

The counterargument is that strategy can correct already-existing imbalances in the justice system, such as when inexperienced advocates must face highly experienced ones, when [[law firm|small firms]] oppose large ones, and when poor clients must litigate their rights against wealthy ones.  Under the current system, without a well-developed strategy, a small firm with a poor client stands almost no chance of success against a large firm with its greater resources, regardless of the merits of the case.
* [[Litigation strategy|Maneuver strategy]] An alternative to arguing the evidence or the law, maneuver strategies pursue solutions such as redirecting the focus of the trial, reshaping the way events are perceived, or disrupting or surprising the opposing counsel, rendering him ineffective at responding to unfolding events.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  While these methods are practiced widely, even by advocates not educated in strategy, some object to this as improper even when practiced ethically, as it subordinates the importance of the evidence and the law in determining a trial's outcome.  One proponent of maneuver strategy, however, has noted that regardless of whether the attorney intends to leverage the tools of maneuver strategy, the attorney must understand the methods or she will be ill-equipped to identify and counter them.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, pp. 86–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gestalt psychology]] This branch of psychology focuses on how things are perceived in whole as opposed to how individual components appear.  It aids in ensuring the jury (or judge, in bench trials) perceives events as the attorney desires, and it offers a means of shaping the way witnesses and opposing counsel will perceive the problems an attorney raises for them during trial.  When coupled with game theory, shaping perception allows an attorney to influence or shape the actions the hostile witness or counsel take.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 37–40, 83–4&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Game theory]] Game theory offers models of how people make decisions.  In trial practice, game theory is useful in predicting the likely actions witnesses will take when presented with a decision.  Because decisions are framed according to how they perceive a situation, when game theory is coupled with Gestalt psychology, attorneys can present problems to witnesses or opposing counsel in a way that increases the likelihood of them making decisions about their responses that improve the attorney's strategic position.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 62–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Litigation strategy|Lines of effort]] In the way a case diagram matches evidence to elements, the line of effort matches actions to specific effects the attorney intends to the various results that achieve her or his goal.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier pp. 47–65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Legal education in the United States}}
'''Trial practice''' is an upper level course offered in most American [[law school]]s designed to teach future [[litigation|litigators]] the fine points of presenting a case to a [[judge]] and [[jury]]. Unlike most law school courses, a trial practice class has very little discussion of [[substantive law]], and is focused on the practical application of [[public speaking]], [[narrative]], and using [[body language]] to communicate a particular set of events to the triers of fact. Trial practice also contains elements of [[strategy]], teaching students how to decide the order in which witnesses should testify, when exhibits should be introduced, and how to trap opposing witnesses into giving testimony that damages their side.

[[evidence (law)|Evidence]] is the area of substantive law most reinforced by a trial practice course, with students learning how to apply evidence law in a real-life setting, including learning when they can object to questions asked of witnesses, what objections to raise, and how to effectively present objections.

Trial practice courses may have a classroom component.  Also, trial practice courses will usually have an ongoing "lab" component where an attorney will instruct a small group of students on trial skills and assist them in honing their craft. Often, students practice against one another in [[mock trial]]s throughout the course; for example, students may be divided into groups of 4, with each group containing two teams who practice against one another in mock trials. 

Rather than a [[final exam]], the course may culminate in a mock trial with volunteer "witnesses".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18959">The '''Uniform Task-Based Management System''' ('''UTBMS''') is a set of codes designed to standardize categorization and facilitate analysis of legal work and expenses. UTBMS was produced through a collaborative effort among the [[American Bar Association]] Section of Litigation, the [[American Corporate Counsel Association]], and a group of major [[corporation|corporate]] clients and [[law firm]]s coordinated and supported by Price Waterhouse LLP (now [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]).  UTBMS codes are now maintained and developed by the [[Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard]] (LEDES) Oversight Committee.

==Background==
UTBMS coding is reflected in legal bills sent from a [[law firm]] to its [[corporation|corporate]] clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Uniform Task-Based Management System |publisher=American Bar Association |url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/resources/uniform_task_based_management_system.html |accessdate=27 Feb 2016 | quote=The Uniform Task-Based Management System enables lawyers to budget and bill by litigation task, aiding client and counsel in understanding, managing and conducting litigations. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law firms will usually use coding on time and expenses only for those clients who explicitly request it. Most clients who use UTBMS also require electronic billing, usually with an invoice in a LEDES e-billing format.

Fees, which are charges for [[Lawyer|attorney]] and [[paralegal|legal assistant]] time, are coded with task and activity codes. There are four sets of task codes: [[Litigation]], Counseling, Project and [[Bankruptcy]]. The set used for a given matter (i.e., case or transaction) depends upon the nature of that matter. Tasks may be summarized into phases. Tasks are often reported without reporting the phase, as this can be deduced from the task. The phase/task hierarchy is uniform in the Litigation and Bankruptcy task code sets. In the Project set, only the second phase contains multiple tasks. The Counseling set has only a single level. (In such situations, a code may be considered both a phase and a task, and it may be necessary to program the time and billing software this way.) There is a single set of activity codes, which is used in conjunction with each of the four task code sets. There is also a single set of expense codes, which are independent of phase, task and activity codes.

The codes themselves are composed of a letter (the first letter of the task code set), followed by a three-digit number. Tasks sharing the same letter and first digit belong to the same phase.

From time-to-time, the LEDES Oversight Committee, the administrative body which oversees these codes, adds and changes codes. In 2011, a set of "eDiscovery" codes were ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Roach |first=Michael |date=20 Sep 2012 |title=LEDES Adds Activity, Expense to E-Discovery Billing Codes | work=EDD Update |publisher=ALM | url= http://www.eddupdate.com/2012/09/ledes-adds-activity-expense-to-e-discovery-billing-codes-.html | accessdate=27 Feb 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=UTBMS eDiscovery Code Set |publisher=EDRM |publication-place= |page= |url=http://www.edrm.net/projects/metrics/utbms |accessdate=27 Feb 2016 | quote=The LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC) Uniform Task Based Management System (UTBMS) eDiscovery Code Set, ratified in 2011, is based on the EDRM Metrics Code set. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, the LOC ratified a set of Governance, Risk and Compliance codes based on the Open Compliance &amp; Ethics Group (OCEG) GRC Capability Model.
