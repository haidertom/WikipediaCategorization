      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20217">'''The 10 Essential Public Health Services''' is a US government document which codifies the responsibilities of [[public health]] agencies and institutions in the United States.&lt;ref name="i"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP): 10 Essential Public Health Services." Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/essentialservices.html. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Organized according to the "three fundamental purposes of public health" — assessment, policy development, and assurance — the essential services include the following:

===Assessment===
*Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems.
*Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community.

===Policy development===
*Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues.
*Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems.
*Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts.

===Assurance===
*Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety.
*Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable.
*Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce.
*Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services.
*Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems.

==History==
In 1988, the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) released an assessment of the U.S. public health system titled, ''The Future of Public Health''. The report described the network of county, state, and national public health agencies as being in "disarray" and prompted a national discussion about the state of public health in the country. Questioning the ability of existing public health systems to provide essential services, the report sought to establish a comprehensive framework delineating the "three fundamental purposes of public health." These purposes included "assessment, policy development, and assurance."&lt;ref name="iii"&gt;Institute of Medicine. Committee for the Study of the Future of Public Health. (1988). The future of public health. Washington DC: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though health policy academicians identified with and understood the IOM framework, policy makers found its highly conceptual language difficult to apply. Therefore, as part of President Clinton’s 1994 healthcare reform efforts, a federal working-group was tasked with reviewing and supplementing the framework. Under the auspices of both the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s]] (CDC) Public Health Practice Program Office and the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the group sought to
#explain what public health is,
#clarify the role of public health within the larger healthcare system, and
#provide accountability by linking public health performance to health outcomes.

These efforts culminated in the publication of ''The Essential Services of Public Health'' in late 1994.&lt;ref name="iv"&gt;Harrell JA, Baker EL. The essential services of public health. Leadership Public Health. 1994;3(3): 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;
Public Health Units
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/common/system/services/phu/locations.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
The report was well received. Public health agencies and professional organizations began to align guidelines and employ self-assessment tools in support of the ten Essential Services.&lt;ref name="v"&gt;Scutchfield, F. D., Mays, G. P., &amp; Lurie, N. (2009). Applying Health Services Research to Public Health Practice: An Emerging Priority. Health Services Research, 44(5p2), 1775–1787. {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-6773.2009.01007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC launched a number of research projects aimed at developing strategies for measuring how well public health agencies provided the services. Many of these studies were the first of their kind and ushered in an era of health agency monitoring and assessment.&lt;ref name="vi"&gt;Miller, C. A., K. S. Moore, T. B. Richards, and C. McKaig. 1994. "A Screening Survey to Assess Local Public Health Performance." Public Health Report 109 (5): 659–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vii"&gt;Turnock, B. J., and A. S. Handler. 1997. "From Measuring to Improving Public Health Practice." Annual Review of Public Health 18: 261–282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="viii"&gt;Handler, A. S., B. J. Turnock, W. Hall, S. Potsic, J. Munson, R. Nalluri, and E. H. Vaughn. 1995. "A Strategy for Measuring Local Public Health Practice." American Journal of Preventive Medicine 11 (6 Suppl): 29–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the CDC and several national public health associations launched the [https://www.cdc.gov/nphpsp/ National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP)]. With the goal of developing a consensus-based set of performance standards for state and local public health delivery systems, the NPHPSP adopted the Essential Public Health Services as "the fundamental framework" underpinning its assessment strategy. The NPHPSP consists of three instruments — The State Public Health System Assessment, The Local Public Health System Assessment, and The Local Public Health Governance Assessment — and covers the gamut of public health action as described by the Essential Public Health Services.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

==List of services==

===Monitor and evaluate health status to identify community health problems===
It is essential for public health organizations to monitor and evaluate the health status of populations in order to identify trends and to target health resources. Components of this service include: utilization of appropriate tools to interpret and disseminate data to audiences of interest; collaboration in integrating and managing public health; and accurate and periodic assessment of the community’s health status.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Specifically, public health organizations can monitor and evaluate the health status of their populations by creating a disease reporting system, community health profiles, and health surveys. For example, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health completes a Los Angeles County Health Survey (LACHS) every two to four years to obtain population-based data.&lt;ref name="ix"&gt;County of Los Angeles Public Health. "Frequently Asked Questions About The Los Angeles County Health Survey" Retrieved from http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/ha/LAC HS_FAQs.htm. Accessed on 2/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt; This information is used for public health assessment and planning and for evaluating changes in health over time in Los Angeles County.

===Diagnose and investigate health problems and health hazards in the community===
In order to appropriately allocate public health resources, it is essential to diagnose and investigate health problems and hazards in the community. Components in this service include: population-based screening of diseases; access to public health laboratories capable of completing rapid screening and high volume testing; and epidemiologic investigations of disease outbreaks and patterns of disease.&lt;ref name="i"/&gt; The Los Angeles County Health and Examination Survey (LA HANES) was piloted in 2011 and aims to establish a profile description of health outcomes of residents of Los Angeles County (e.g. adult obesity and cardiovascular disease is monitored via collection of physical measurements such as blood pressure and body mass index). These survey results will inform public education and chronic disease prevention efforts. Emergency preparedness is also an essential component of public health organizations. Teams must be available and prepared to combat natural disasters, severe weather, outbreaks, [[bioterrorism]], mass casualties and chemical emergencies.

===Inform, educate, and empower people about health issues===
Once public health priorities have been established through monitoring and investigation of health problems in the community, educational activities that promote improved health should be disseminated. Components in this service include: both the availability of health information and educational resources and the presence of health education and health promotion programs.&lt;ref name="i"/&gt; This can be achieved through media advocacy and social marketing. An example of this is the Eat Less, Weigh Less campaign executed by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Public Health]] that aims to increase awareness about appropriate portion sizes using advertisements on buses, billboards and social media.&lt;ref name="x"&gt;Choose Health LA. "Eat Healthy." Retrieved from http://www.choosehealthLA.com/eat-healthy/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217055003/http://www.choosehealthla.com/eat-healthy/ |date=2013-02-17 }}. Accessed on 2/4/13.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also essential to establish health education and health promotion program partnerships with organizations in the community, such as schools, churches and employment facilities.

===Mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems===
Public health organizations on the local, state and national level can mobilize community partnerships to identify and solve health problems. Components of this service include: building coalitions to utilize the full range of available resources; convening and facilitating partnerships that will undertake defined health improvement projects; and provide assistance to partners and communities to solve health problems.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Of particular importance is identification of potential stakeholders who will contribute to or benefit from public health activities. [[First 5 LA]] is a community partner who supports targeted programs that address the needs of Los Angeles County children ages zero to five and their families.&lt;ref name="xi"&gt;[[First 5 LA]]. "Champions of Our Children." Retrieved from http://www.first5la.org/About-Us. Accessed on 2/5/13.&lt;/ref&gt; They work closely with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health to improve the physical and emotional health of this population. It is important to note that many of these stakeholders may not be considered to be health-related at first glance. For example, organizations involved in urban planning may be influential in improving the health of its residents. This could include increasing the walkability of a community or the number of parks or bike trails in a neighborhood.

===Develop policies and plans that support individual and community health efforts===
Policies can be effective in modifying human behavior and reducing negative health outcomes. Components in this service include: development of policy to guide the practice of public health; alignment of resources and strategies for community health efforts; and systematic health planning strategies to guide community health improvement.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; In response to increasing rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease, the New York City Board of Health passed a ban on the sale of sodas and other sugary drinks larger than 16&amp;nbsp;ounces at restaurants, street carts and movie theaters.&lt;ref name="xii"&gt;The New York Times. "New York Plans to Ban Sale of Big Sizes of Sugary". Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/nyregion/bloomberg-plans-a-ban-on-large-sugared-drinks.html?pagewanted=all. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to policies that can support health efforts, laws can reduce negative health outcomes. For example, dram shop liability is a law that holds the owner or server at a bar or restaurant where a patron consumed their last alcoholic beverage responsible for injuries or deaths caused as a result of alcohol-related incidents. A systematic review completed by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services, found strong evidence of the effectiveness of this law in reducing alcohol-related harms.&lt;ref name="xiii"&gt;Rammohan, V, et al. "Effects of Dram Shop Liability and Enhanced Overservice Law Enforcement Initiatives on Excessive Alcohol Consumption and Related Harms: Two Community Guide Systematic Reviews." Am J Prev Med 2011;41(3):334 –343.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforce laws and regulations that protect and ensure public health and safety===
It is important that individuals and organizations comply with existing laws and regulations in order to ensure the overall health and safety of the general public. Components of this service include: reviewing, evaluating, and revising laws and regulations put in place to protect the health and safety of the public; educating persons and organizations about these laws and regulations to improve compliance and encourage enforcement of them; and enforcing actions that protect the health of the public (e.g., protection of drinking water; enforcement of clean air standards; enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic and tobacco products to minors, of laws concerning the use of seat belts and child safety seats; mandating childhood immunizations; facilitating timely follow-ups in the event of hazards and outbreaks of exposure-related diseases; monitoring quality of health services; conducting the timely review of new drugs, biologics, and medical devices; ensuring food safety; and enforcing housing and sanitation codes).&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

===Link people to needed personal health services and assure the provision of health care when otherwise unavailable===
Having access to care when it is needed is important in helping individuals prevent and avoid unfavorable health outcomes and medical costs. At the local level, components of this service include: identifying populations that face barriers to accessing health services and addressing their personal health needs, assuring the linkage of these populations to appropriate health services by coordinating provider services, and developing and implementing interventions that address the barriers they face in attempting to access care. At the state and governance levels, components of this service include: assessing access to and availability of state health services; partnering with public, private, and non-profit sectors to provide a coordinated system of health care; assuring access to this coordinated health care system by using outreach efforts that link individuals to the health services they need; developing and implementing a continuous improvement process to assure the equitable distribution of resources for those in greatest need of these services.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) employs this service idea as one of the action steps for achieving increased access to care and improved health outcomes for people living with HIV.&lt;ref name="xiv"&gt;The White House. "Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Overview of the Agency Operational Plans." Retrieved from http://aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-operational-plan-overview.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213232017/http://aids.gov/federal-resources/national-hiv-aids-strategy/nhas-operational-plan-overview.pdf |date=2013-02-13 }}. Accessed on 2/6/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assure a competent public and personal health care workforce===
Health care workers and staff who are competent (i.e., skilled in the core principles of public health practice) are more likely to provide care and other services more effectively and efficiently compared to those who are not. Components of this service include: making sure that the workforce meets the health needs of the population, maintaining public health workforce standards by developing and implementing efficient licensure and credentialing processes and incorporating core public health competencies into personnel systems, and adopting continuous quality improvement methods and long-term learning opportunities for public health workforce members.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; In two 2002 reports, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended instituting a certification examination as a way of ensuring minimum competence in public health.&lt;ref name="xv"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). "The Future of the Public’s Health in the 21st Century." Retrieved from http://iom.edu/Reports/2002/The-Future-of-the-Publics-Health-in-the-21st-Century.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811070844/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/The-Future-of-the-Publics-Health-in-the-21st-Century.aspx |date=2010-08-11 }}. Accessed on 2/7/13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xvi"&gt;Institute of Medicine (IOM). "Who Will Keep the Public Healthy: Educating Public Health Professionals for the 21st Century." Retrieved from http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Who-Will-Keep-the-Public-Healthy-Educating-Public-Health-Professionals-for-the-21st-Century.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131227130612/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Who-Will-Keep-the-Public-Healthy-Educating-Public-Health-Professionals-for-the-21st-Century.aspx |date=2013-12-27 }}. Accessed on 2/7/13&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based training strategies may be useful in providing the long-term learning opportunities that many current and upcoming public health workers need in order to serve as well-informed advocates of public health and safety.&lt;ref name="xvii"&gt;Ballew, P. et al. "Developing web-based training for public health practitioners: what can we learn from a review of five disciplines?" Health Education Research. 2012;1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluate effectiveness, accessibility, and quality of personal and population-based health services ===
Given scarce resources, it is important to keep track of whether or not programs and/or policies end up producing intended outcomes. Components of this service include: assessing the accessibility, quality and effectiveness of services and programs delivered; providing policymakers with the information they need in order to make well-informed decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources; tracking efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of services analyzing data on health status and service utilization; and striving to improve the public health system’s capacity to well serve the population.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt; Cost-effectiveness analysis has been proposed as one possible strategy for informing policymakers on how best to allocate health care resources.&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;Eichler, H, Kong, SX, Gerth, WC, and Mavros, P. "Use of cost-effectiveness analysis in health-care resource allocation decision-making: how are cost-effectiveness thresholds expected to emerge." Value in Health. 2004;7(5): 518-528.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research for new insights and innovative solutions to health problems ===
Through research, the health and health care problems that individuals face can be better understood, and therefore be better and more appropriately addressed given the evidence provided by such research efforts. Components of this service include: fostering the development of a continuum of innovative solutions for health programming in terms of both practical field-based efforts as well as academic efforts, establishing a consortium of research institutions and other institutions of higher learning to encourage more collaborative and cross-cutting efforts, and ensuring the public health system’s capacity to perform timely epidemiological and health policy analyses.&lt;ref name="i" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5639">'''Acceptable daily intake''' or '''ADI''' is a measure of the amount of a specific substance (originally applied for a [[food additive]], later also for a residue of a veterinary drug or pesticide) in [[food]] or [[drinking water]] that can be ingested (orally) on a daily basis over a lifetime without an appreciable health risk.&lt;ref name=WHO1987&gt;{{Cite journal | last = WHO | title = Principles for the safety assessment of food additives and contaminants in food | journal = Environmental Health Criteria 70. | year = 1987 | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc70.htm | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

== History ==
This concept was first introduced in 1961 by the [[Council of Europe]] and later, the [[Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives]] (JECFA), a committee maintained by two United Nations bodies: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref name="Lu" /&gt;

== Concept ==
An ADI value is based on current research, with long-term studies on animals and observations of humans. First, a [[no-observed-adverse-effect level]] (NOAEL),&lt;ref name=Faustman/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-8247-9691-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fennema, Owen R. |title=Food chemistry |edition= |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=1996 |isbn=0-8247-9691-8 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0Xx8-8_5EcC&amp;pg=PA828&amp;dq=%22Acceptable+Daily+Intake%22+%22No+Observable%22|page= 828}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amount of a substance that shows no toxic effects, is determined. Usually the studies are performed with several doses including high doses. In the case of several studies on different effects, the lowest NOAEL is usually taken.  Then, the NOAEL (or another point of departure such as a benchmark dose level (BMDL)) is divided by a safety factor, conventionally 100, to account for the differences between test animals and humans (factor of 10) and possible differences in sensitivity between humans (another factor of 10).&lt;ref name=Faustman/&gt; safety factors with values other than 100 may be used if information on uncertainty about the value of the point of departure (NOAEL or BMDL) justify it. For instance, if the ADI is based on data from humans the safety factor is usually 10 instead of 100. The ADI is usually given in mg per kg body weight.&lt;ref name="isbn0-415-24865-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mackey, Maureen A. |author2=Kotsonis, Frank N. |title=Nutritional toxicology |edition= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Washington, DC |year=2002 |isbn=0-415-24865-5 |oclc= |doi= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SBiWo6_RCJ8C&amp;pg=PA258&amp;dq=%22Acceptable+Daily+Intake%22+%22No+Observable%22#PPA258,M1|accessdate=|page= 258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADI is considered a safe intake level for a healthy adult of normal weight who consumes an average daily amount of the substance in question. Increased safety factors for infants have been discussed, but are not needed, because elimination of chemicals is in fact often more rapid in children and as children generally suffer higher illness rates than adults, adverse effects caused by food additives can easily be disguised as any number of things children usually suffer with. It would be far more difficult to argue the case with a healthy adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02652039809374612 |title=Toxicokinetics in infants and children in relation to the ADI and TDI |year=1998 |last1=Renwick |first1=A. G. |journal=Food Additives and Contaminants |volume=15 |pages=17–35 |pmid=9602909}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADI does not take into account allergic reactions that are individual responses rather than dose-dependent phenomena.

The higher the ADI, the larger amounts of a compound are safe for regular ingestion. The concept of [[tolerable daily intake]] is often used for unwanted contaminants or other chemicals.

The ADI concept can be understood as a measure to indicate the toxicity from long-term exposure  to repeated ingestion of chemical compounds in foods (present and/or added), as opposed to acute toxicity.

The [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) of a chemical substance is a level to which it is believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effects.

{{Occupational hazards}}
[[File:DIN 4844-2 D-P009.svg|alt=A red no symbol over a hand reaching towards a bolt of electricity symbol|thumb|This [[Electric shock|electrical hazard]] [[warning sign]] used in Germany is an example of an administrative control.]]

'''Administrative controls''' are training, procedure, policy, or shift designs that lessen the threat of a hazard to an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-125/pdfs/2009-125.pdf|title=Approaches to Safe Nanotechnology|last=|first=|date=March 2009|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|publisher=|access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative controls typically change the behavior of people (e.g., factory workers) rather than removing the actual hazard or providing [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE).

Administrative controls are fourth in larger [[hierarchy of hazard controls]], which ranks the effectiveness and efficiency of hazard controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=July 2016|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=CDC|language=en-us|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative controls are more effective than PPE because they involve some manner of prior planning and avoidance, whereas PPE only serves only as a final barrier between the hazard and worker. Administrative controls are second lowest because they require workers or employers to actively think or comply with regulations and do not offer permanent solutions to problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/grant_materials/fy10/sh-20839-10/hierarchy_of_controls.pdf|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|publisher=|access-date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, administrative controls are cheaper to begin, but they may become more expensive over time as higher failure rates and the need for constant training or re-certification eclipse the initial investments of the three more desirable hazard controls in the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-102/|title=Nanomaterial Production and Downstream Handling Processes|last=|first=|date=November 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] recommends administrative controls when hazards cannot be [[Hazard elimination|removed]] or [[Hazard substitution|changed]], and [[engineering controls]] are not practical.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some common examples of administrative controls include work practice controls such as prohibiting mouth [[pipette|pipetting]] and recapping of needles, as well as rotating [[Shift work|worker shifts]] in coal mines to prevent hearing loss.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2017-100/pdf/2017-100.pdf|title=NIOSH Chemical Carcinogen Policy|last=|first=|date=December 2016|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dllr.state.md.us/labor/bbp/bbpwpcon.shtml|title=Guidelines and Instructions for Developing a Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan|last=|first=|date=March 2010|website=[[Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation]]|access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/s&amp;hinfo/noisetoolboxes/Administrative%20Controls.ppt|title=Administrative Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]|access-date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/BuildQyr.asp?s1=20030605&amp;PageNo=1&amp;RecNo=1&amp;View=f&amp;|title=Administrative controls for reducing worker noise exposures|last=Bauer|first=ER|last2=Babich|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include [[hours of service]] regulations for commercial vehicle operators,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/administrativecontrols.html|title=Administrative Controls|last=|first=|date=25 July 2016|website=Interactive Learning Paradigms Incorporated|access-date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warning sign|warning signage]] for hazards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ehs.iu.edu/docs/LCSP-Part-06---2.0-Control-Measures.pdf|title=Control Measures|last=|first=|date=|website=Environmental Health and Safety – Bloomington [[Indiana University]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215075131/http://ehs.iu.edu/docs/LCSP-Part-06---2.0-Control-Measures.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regular maintenance of equipment. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/hazard_control.html|title=Hazard Control|last=|first=|date=17 March 2017|website=[[Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety]]|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Society for Nutrition''' (ASN) is an American society for professional researchers and practitioners in the field of [[nutrition]]. ASN publishes four journals in the field of nutrition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nutrition.org/publications/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been criticized for its financial ties to the food and beverage industry.&lt;ref name="EatDrink Politics"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eng&gt;{{Cite web| last = Eng| first = Monica| title = Should Coke sponsor nutrition research?| work = WBEZ| accessdate = 2018-08-23| url = https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/do-big-food-companies-have-too-much-sway-over-nutrition-research/43df1b4d-259b-4d15-a85f-59b77232068d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1928 a group of United States biochemists and physiologists grouped together to form the first scientific society focused on nutrition, the American Institute for Nutrition. The Society held its first meeting at the [[Cornell Medical School]] in 1934.   The society was renamed the American Society for Nutritional Sciences in 1996.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt University Medical Center"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/diglib/sc_diglib/americansociety/index.html | title=The Nutrition Society Celebrates Its 75th Anniversary | publisher=Vanderbilt University Medical Center | accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the American Society for Nutritional Sciences, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition (established 1961);  and the Society for International Nutrition (established 1996) merged to form The American Society for Nutrition (ASN).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

ASN currently (2015) has a membership of about 5,000.  It is one of the constituent societies comprising the  [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology]], a non-profit organization that is the principal umbrella organization of U.S. societies in the field of biological and medical research.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt University Medical Center"/&gt;

In October 2010, the [[American College of Nutrition]] and American Society for Nutrition proposed to merge.&lt;sup&gt;[[American College of Nutrition#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;{{Update inline|date=August 2018}}

==="Smart Choices" program===
The ASN administered the "[[Nutritional rating systems#Smart Choices Program|Smart Choices"]] food labelling program,&lt;ref name"smart choice"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = MacVean| first = Mary| title = 'Smart Choice' food label: a sign of nutrition or marketing?| work = Los Angeles Times| date = 2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was suspended in 2009 after criticism.&lt;ref name=suspended&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Neuman| first = William| title = ‘Smart Choices’ Food Labeling Loses Support| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-08-24| date = 2009-10-23| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/24food.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
ASN publishes four academic journals. Both publisher and some editorial staff accept funding from food industry organizations.&lt;ref name="EatDrink Politics"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eng/&gt;

== Corporate relationship concerns ==
The ASN has [[conflicts of interest|conflicting interests]] in taking funding from food industry marketing groups while providing unbiassed information on nutrition; these conflicting interests have caused criticism and concerns of bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = O’Connor| first = Anahad| title = Coca-Cola Funds Scientists Who Shift Blame for Obesity Away From Bad Diets| work = Well| accessdate = 2018-03-24| date = 2015-08-09| url = https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/coca-cola-funds-scientists-who-shift-blame-for-obesity-away-from-bad-diets/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mustain_2015&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.nutres.2016.10.006| issn = 0271-5317| volume = 36| issue = 11| pages = 1183–1192| last1 = Rucker| first1 = Robert B.| last2 = Rucker| first2 = Michael R.| title = Nutrition: ethical issues and challenges| journal = Nutrition Research| accessdate = 2018-03-31|date=November 2016| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0271531716302081}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASN actions have also been criticized for being better-aligned with the nutritional advice of sponsors than the advice of the [[World Health Organization]] and other public health, public interest, and government organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Bellatti| first = Andy| title = OPINION: Industry-funded nutrition groups shouldn’t dictate health policy| accessdate = 2018-03-31| date = 2015-06-24| url = http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/6/industry-funded-nutrition-groups-shouldnt-dictate-health-policy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Mustain| first1 = Patrick| last2 = Mustain| first2 = Patrick| title = Science for Sale: Big Food's Influence on Top Nutrition Research Org| work = Scientific American Blog Network| date = June 15, 2015 |accessdate = 2018-03-31| url = https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/food-matters/science-for-sale-big-food-s-influence-on-top-nutrition-research-org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Anthrax''' is an infection caused by the bacterium ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Bas&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Information What is anthrax?|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=14 May 2016|date=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517175036/http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/index.html|archivedate=17 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur in four forms: skin, lungs, intestinal, and injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Anthrax|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/types/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=14 May 2016|date=21 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511091519/http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/types/index.html|archivedate=11 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms begin between one day and two months after the infection is contracted.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Sym/&gt; The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless [[skin ulcer|ulcer]] with a black center.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Sym/&gt; The inhalation form presents with fever, chest pain, and [[shortness of breath]].&lt;ref name=CDC2014Sym/&gt; The intestinal form presents with diarrhea which may contain blood, abdominal pains, and nausea and vomiting.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Sym/&gt; The injection form presents with fever and an [[abscess]] at the site of [[intravenous drug use|drug injection]].&lt;ref name=CDC2014Sym&gt;{{cite web|title=Symptoms|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/symptoms.html|website=CDC|accessdate=14 May 2016|date=23 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511071331/http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/symptoms.html|archivedate=11 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==

=== Skin ===
[[Image:Skin reaction to anthrax.jpg|thumb|Skin lesion from anthrax]]
[[File:Cutaneous anthrax lesion on the neck. PHIL 1934 lores.jpg|thumb|Skin anthrax lesion on the neck]]
Cutaneous anthrax, also known as Hide porter's disease, is when anthrax occurs on the skin. It is the most common form (&gt;90% of anthrax cases). It is also the least dangerous form of anthrax (low mortality with treatment, 20% mortality without).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cutaneous Anthrax|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/types/cutaneous.html|website=CDC|accessdate=16 February 2018|language=en-us|date=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutaneous anthrax presents as a [[boil]]-like [[skin lesion]] that eventually forms an [[ulcer]] with a black center ([[eschar]]). The black eschar often shows up as a large, painless, [[necrotic]] ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Unlike [[bruise]]s or most other lesions, cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen, and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a few weeks. Complete recovery may take longer.&lt;ref name="CDC-Anthrax"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthrax Q &amp; A: Signs and Symptoms |work=Emergency Preparedness and Response |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2003 |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/signs.asp |accessdate=19 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405150014/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/signs.asp |archivedate=5 April 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when ''B. anthracis'' spores enter through cuts on the skin. This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products.

Cutaneous anthrax is rarely fatal if treated,&lt;ref name="bravata" /&gt; because the infection area is limited to the skin, preventing the [[Anthrax lethal factor endopeptidase|lethal factor]], [[edema]] factor, and protective [[antigen]] from entering and destroying a [[vital organ]]. Without treatment, about 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to [[Bacteremia|toxemia]] and death.

=== Lungs ===
Respiratory infection in humans is relatively rare and presents as two stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inhalation Anthrax|url=https://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/inhalation-anthrax/overview.html|accessdate=14 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807075026/http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/inhalation-anthrax/overview.html|archivedate=7 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It infects the lymph nodes in the chest first, rather than the lungs themselves, a condition called hemorrhagic [[mediastinitis]], causing bloody fluid to accumulate in the chest cavity, therefore causing shortness of breath. The first stage causes cold and flu-like symptoms. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, and chills. This can last hours to days. Often, many fatalities from inhalational anthrax are when the first stage is mistaken for the cold or flu and the victim does not seek treatment until the second stage, which is 90% fatal. The second (pneumonia) stage occurs when the infection spreads from the lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms of the second stage develop suddenly after hours or days of the first stage. Symptoms include high fever, extreme shortness of breath, shock, and rapid death within 48 hours in fatal cases. Historical mortality rates were over 85%,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%207th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202011.pdf|title = USAMRIID's Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook|last = [[USAMRIID]]|date = 2011|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |isbn = 9780160900150|edition = 7th|publisher = [[US Government Printing Office]]|quote = For the attacks of 2001, CFR was only 45%, while before this time CFRs for IA were &gt;85% (Page 37)|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209044622/http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%207th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202011.pdf|archivedate = 9 February 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when treated early (seen in the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]), observed case fatality rate dropped to 45%.&lt;ref name="bravata"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bravata |first=DM |last2=Holty |first2=JE |last3=Liu |first3=H |last4=McDonald |first4=KM |last5=Olshen |first5=RA |last6=Owens |first6=DK |title=Systematic review: a century of inhalational anthrax cases from 1900 to 2005 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=144 |issue=4 |pages=270–80 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16490913 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-144-4-200602210-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Distinguishing pulmonary anthrax from more common causes of respiratory illness is essential to avoiding delays in diagnosis and thereby improving outcomes.

=== Gastrointestinal ===
[[Human gastrointestinal tract|Gastrointestinal]] (GI) infection is most often caused by consuming anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by diarrhea, potentially with blood, abdominal pains, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/types/gastrointestinal.html | title=Gastrointestinal Anthrax | work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date=23 August 2013 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211034003/http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/types/gastrointestinal.html | archivedate=11 February 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional [[hematemesis|vomiting of blood]] can occur.  Lesions have been found in the intestines and in the mouth and throat. After the bacterium invades the gastrointestinal system, it spreads to the bloodstream and throughout the body, while continuing to make toxins. GI infections can be treated, but usually result in fatality rates of 25% to 60%, depending upon how soon treatment commences. This form of anthrax is the rarest form.

[[Image:Bacillus anthracis Gram.jpg|thumb|[[Photomicrograph]] of a [[Gram stain]] of the bacterium ''Bacillus anthracis'', the cause of the anthrax disease]]
{{Main|Bacillus anthracis}}
''Bacillus anthracis'' is a rod-shaped, [[Gram-positive]], aerobic bacterium about 1 by 9&amp;nbsp;μm in size.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Bas /&gt; It was shown to cause disease by [[Robert Koch]] in 1876 when he took a blood sample from an infected cow, isolated the bacteria, and put them into a mouse.&lt;ref name="pages 277-310"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=R |title=Untersuchungen über Bakterien: V.

The etiology of anthrax, based on the ontogenesis of ''Bacillus anthracis''], Cohns&lt;/ref&gt; The bacterium normally rests in spore form in the soil, and can survive for decades in this state. Herbivores are often infected whilst grazing, especially when eating rough, irritant, or spiky vegetation; the vegetation has been hypothesized to cause wounds within the [[Gut (anatomy)|gastrointestinal tract]] permitting entry of the bacterial spores into the tissues, though this has not been proven. Once ingested or placed in an open wound, the bacteria begin multiplying inside the animal or human and typically kill the host within a few days or weeks. The spores germinate at the site of entry into the tissues and then spread by the circulation to the lymphatics, where the bacteria multiply.

The production of two powerful exotoxins and lethal toxin by the bacteria causes death. Veterinarians can often tell a possible anthrax-induced death by its sudden occurrence, and by the dark, nonclotting blood that oozes from the body orifices. Most anthrax bacteria inside the body after death are outcompeted and destroyed by anaerobic bacteria within minutes to hours ''post mortem''. However, anthrax vegetative bacteria that escape the body via oozing blood or through the opening of the carcass may form hardy spores. These vegetative bacteria are not contagious.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jb.asm.org/content/186/1/164.full.pdf |title=Formation and Composition of the ''Bacillus anthracis'' Endospore |author1=Hongbin Liu |author2=Nicholas H.

The triggers for spore formation are not yet known, though oxygen tension and lack of nutrients may play roles. Once formed, these spores are very hard to eradicate.

The infection of herbivores (and occasionally humans) by the inhalational route normally proceeds as follows: Once the spores are inhaled, they are transported through the air passages into the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The spores are then picked up by scavenger cells ([[macrophage]]s) in the lungs and are transported through small vessels ([[lymphatic system|lymphatics]]) to the [[lymph nodes]] in the central chest cavity ([[mediastinum]]). Damage caused by the anthrax spores and bacilli to the central chest cavity can cause chest pain and difficulty in breathing. Once in the lymph nodes, the spores germinate into active bacilli that multiply and eventually burst the macrophages, releasing many more bacilli into the bloodstream to be transferred to the entire body. Once in the blood stream, these bacilli release three proteins named [[Anthrax lethal factor endopeptidase|lethal factor]], edema factor, and protective antigen. The three are not toxic by themselves, but their combination is incredibly lethal to humans.&lt;ref name=Pimental04&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pimental |first=RA |last2=Christensen |first2=KA |last3=Krantz |first3=BA |last4=Collier |first4=RJ |title=Anthrax toxin complexes: heptameric protective antigen can bind lethal factor and edema factor simultaneously |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=322 |issue=1 |pages=258–62 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15313199 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-291X(04)01621-3 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protective antigen combines with these other two factors to form lethal toxin and edema toxin, respectively. These toxins are the primary agents of tissue destruction, bleeding, and death of the host. If antibiotics are administered too late, even if the antibiotics eradicate the bacteria, some hosts still die of toxemia because the toxins produced by the bacilli remain in their system at lethal dose levels.

Occupational exposure to infected animals or their products (such as skin, wool, and meat) is the usual pathway of exposure for humans. Workers who are exposed to dead animals and animal products are at the highest risk, especially in countries where anthrax is more common. Anthrax in [[livestock]] grazing on open range where they mix with wild animals still occasionally occurs in the United States and elsewhere. Many workers who deal with wool and animal hides are routinely exposed to low levels of anthrax spores, but most exposure levels are not sufficient to develop anthrax infections. A lethal infection is reported to result from inhalation of about 10,000–20,000 spores, though this dose varies among host species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18812&amp;page=2 |title=Anthrax, Then and Now |publisher=MedicineNet.com |accessdate=13 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520040609/http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18812&amp;page=2 |archivedate=20 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Little documented evidence is available to verify the exact or average number of spores needed for infection.

Historically, inhalational anthrax was called woolsorters' disease because it was an occupational hazard for [[wool classing|people who sorted wool]]. Today, this form of infection is extremely rare in advanced nations, as almost no infected animals remain.

=== Mode of infection ===
[[File:Anthrax - inhalational.jpg|thumb|Inhalational anthrax, [[mediastinum|mediastinal]] widening]]
Anthrax can enter the human body through the intestines (ingestion), lungs (inhalation), or skin (cutaneous) and causes distinct clinical symptoms based on its site of entry. In general, an infected human will be quarantined. However, anthrax does not usually spread from an infected human to a noninfected human.&lt;ref name=NCZVED&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/anthrax/technical.html |title=Anthrax |date=26 August 2009 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226203133/https://www.cdc.gov/nczved/divisions/dfbmd/diseases/anthrax/technical.html |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, if the disease is fatal to the person's body, its mass of anthrax bacilli becomes a potential source of infection to others and special precautions should be used to prevent further contamination. Inhalational anthrax, if left untreated until obvious symptoms occur, is usually fatal.&lt;ref name=NCZVED /&gt;

== Mechanism ==
The lethality of the anthrax disease is due to the bacterium's two principal virulence factors: the [[polyglutamic acid|poly-D-glutamic acid capsule]], which protects the bacterium from phagocytosis by host neutrophils, and the tripartite protein toxin, called [[anthrax toxin]]. Anthrax toxin is a mixture of three [[proteins|protein]] components: protective [[antigen]] (PA), [[edema]] factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF).&lt;ref name=toxin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/anthrax/ |title=Molecular Basis for Anthrax Intoxication |author=Mu Gao |date=27 April 2006 |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226202812/http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/anthrax/ |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; PA plus LF produces lethal toxin, and PA plus EF produces edema toxin. These toxins cause death and tissue swelling ([[edema]]), respectively.

To enter the cells, the edema and lethal factors use another protein produced by ''B. anthracis'' called protective antigen, which binds to two surface receptors on the host cell. A cell [[protease]] then cleaves PA into two fragments: PA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; and PA&lt;sub&gt;63&lt;/sub&gt;. PA&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; dissociates into the extracellular medium, playing no further role in the toxic cycle. PA&lt;sub&gt;63&lt;/sub&gt; then oligomerizes with six other PA&lt;sub&gt;63&lt;/sub&gt; fragments forming a heptameric ring-shaped structure named a prepore. Once in this shape, the complex can competitively bind up to three EFs or LFs, forming a resistant complex.&lt;ref name="Pimental04"/&gt; Receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs next, providing the newly formed toxic complex access to the interior of the host cell. The acidified environment within the endosome triggers the heptamer to release the LF and/or EF into the cytosol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chvyrkova |first=I |last2=Zhang |first2=XC |last3=Terzyan |first3=S |title=Lethal Factor of Anthrax Toxin Binds Monomeric Form of Protective Antigen |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=360 |issue=3 |pages=690–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17617379 |pmc=1986636 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-291X(07)01388-5 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.06.124}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how exactly the complex results in the death of the cell.

Edema factor is a [[calmodulin]]-dependent [[adenylate cyclase]]. Adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP into [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) and [[pyrophosphate]]. The complexation of adenylate cyclase with [[calmodulin]] removes calmodulin from stimulating calcium-triggered signaling, thus inhibiting the immune response.&lt;ref name="Pimental04"/&gt; To be specific, LF inactivates [[neutrophil]]s (a type of phagocytic cell) by the process just described so they cannot phagocytose bacteria. Throughout history, lethal factor was presumed to cause macrophages to make [[TNF-alpha]] and [[IL1B|interleukin 1, beta]] (IL1B). TNF-alpha is a [[cytokine]] whose primary role is to regulate immune cells, as well as to induce inflammation and [[apoptosis]] or programmed cell death. Interleukin 1, beta is another cytokine that also regulates inflammation and apoptosis. The overproduction of TNF-alpha and IL1B ultimately leads to [[septic shock]] and death. However, recent evidence indicates anthrax also targets endothelial cells that line serous cavities such as the [[pericardial cavity]], [[pleural cavity]], and [[peritoneal cavity]], lymph vessels, and blood vessels, causing vascular leakage of fluid and cells, and ultimately [[hypovolemic shock]] and septic shock.

== Diagnosis ==
Various techniques may be used for the direct identification of ''B. anthracis'' in clinical material. Firstly, specimens may be [[Gram stain]]ed. ''Bacillus'' spp. are quite large in size (3 to 4&amp;nbsp;μm long), they may grow in long chains, and they stain Gram-positive. To confirm the organism is ''B. anthracis'', rapid diagnostic techniques such as [[polymerase chain reaction]]-based assays and [[Immunofluorescence|immunofluorescence microscopy]] may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levinson |first=W. |title=Review of Medical Microbiology and Immunology |year=2010 |edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All ''Bacillus'' species grow well on 5% sheep blood agar and other routine culture media. Polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate can be used to isolate ''B. anthracis'' from contaminated specimens, and bicarbonate agar is used as an identification method to induce capsule formation. ''Bacillus'' spp. usually grow within 24 hours of incubation at 35&amp;nbsp;°C, in ambient air (room temperature) or in 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If bicarbonate agar is used for identification, then the medium must be incubated in 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. ''B. anthracis'' colonies are medium-large, gray, flat, and irregular with swirling projections, often referred to as having a "[[Medusa|medusa head]]" appearance, and are not hemolytic on 5% sheep blood agar. The bacteria are not motile, susceptible to penicillin, and produce a wide zone of lecithinase on egg yolk agar. Confirmatory testing to identify ''B. anthracis'' includes gamma bacteriophage testing, indirect hemagglutination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=B. A. |title=Bailey &amp; Scott's Diagnostic Microbiology |year=2002 |edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best confirmatory precipitation test for anthrax is the [[Alberto Ascoli|Ascoli]] test.

If a person is suspected as having died from anthrax, precautions should be taken to avoid skin contact with the potentially contaminated body and fluids exuded through natural body openings. The body should be put in strict quarantine. A blood sample should then be collected and sealed in a container and analyzed in an approved laboratory to ascertain if anthrax is the cause of death. Then, the body should be incinerated. Microscopic visualization of the encapsulated bacilli, usually in very large numbers, in a blood smear stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFadyean stain) is fully diagnostic, though culture of the organism is still the gold standard for diagnosis. Full isolation of the body is important to prevent possible contamination of others. Protective, impermeable clothing and equipment such as [[rubber glove]]s, rubber apron, and rubber boots with no perforations should be used when handling the body. No skin, especially if it has any wounds or scratches, should be exposed. Disposable personal protective equipment is preferable, but if not available, decontamination can be achieved by autoclaving. Disposable personal protective equipment and filters should be autoclaved, and/or burned and buried.  Anyone working with anthrax in a suspected or confirmed person should wear respiratory equipment capable of filtering particles of their size or smaller. The US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] – and [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]-approved high-efficiency respirator, such as a half-face disposable respirator with a high-efficiency particulate air filter, is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/default.html Respirators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731101026/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/default.html |date=31 July 2017 }}. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 30 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; All possibly contaminated bedding or clothing should be isolated in double plastic bags and treated as possible biohazard waste. The body of an infected person should be sealed in an airtight body bag. Dead people who are opened and not burned provide an ideal source of anthrax spores. Cremating people is the preferred way of handling body disposal. No embalming or autopsy should be attempted without a fully equipped biohazard laboratory and trained, knowledgeable personnel.

=== Vaccines ===
{{Main|Anthrax vaccines}}
Vaccines against anthrax for use in livestock and humans have had a prominent place in the history of medicine. The French scientist [[Louis Pasteur]] developed the first effective [[Anthrax vaccines|vaccine]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/library/ekstrom/special/pasteur/cohn.html|accessdate=13 August 2008|title=Life and Times of Louis Pasteur|date=11 February 1996|author=David V.

The current FDA-approved US vaccine was formulated in the 1960s.

Currently administered human anthrax vaccines include [[acellular vaccine|acellular]] (United States) and [[live vaccine]] (Russia) varieties. All currently used anthrax vaccines show considerable local and general [[reactogenicity]] ([[erythema]], [[induration]], [[soreness]], [[fever]]) and serious adverse reactions occur in about 1% of recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Splino M, et al.

In the 20th century the use of a modern product ([[BioThrax]]) to protect American troops against the use of anthrax in [[biological warfare]] was controversial.&lt;ref name=anthraxmilitary&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/23/nation/na-anthrax23 |title=Military to Halt Anthrax Shots |author=Esther Schrader |date=23 December 2003 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226203911/http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/23/nation/na-anthrax23 |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antibiotics ===
Preventative antibiotics are recommended in those who have been exposed.&lt;ref name=Hend2014/&gt; Early detection of sources of anthrax infection can allow preventive measures to be taken. In response to the anthrax attacks of October 2001, the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) installed biodetection systems (BDSs) in their large-scale mail processing facilities. BDS response plans were formulated by the USPS in conjunction with local responders including fire, police, hospitals and public health. Employees of these facilities have been educated about anthrax, response actions, and [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] medication. Because of the time delay inherent in getting final verification that anthrax has been used, prophylactic antibiotic treatment of possibly exposed personnel must be started as soon as possible.

== Treatment ==
{{howto|section|date= February 2018}}
[[File:Anthrax and Antibiotics - Anthrax is Deadly, Antibiotics Could Save Your Life.webm|thumb|Anthrax and antibiotics]]
Anthrax cannot be spread directly from person to person, but a person's clothing and body may be contaminated with anthrax spores. Effective decontamination of people can be accomplished by a thorough wash-down with [[antimicrobial]] soap and water. Waste water should be treated with bleach or another antimicrobial agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/anthrax/decon.html |title=How should I decontaminate during response actions? |publisher=Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226204204/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/anthrax/decon.html |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective decontamination of articles can be accomplished by boiling them in water for 30 minutes or longer. Chlorine bleach is ineffective in destroying spores and vegetative cells on surfaces, though [[formaldehyde]] is effective. Burning clothing is very effective in destroying spores. After decontamination, there is no need to immunize, treat, or isolate contacts of persons ill with anthrax unless they were also exposed to the same source of infection.

=== Antibiotics ===
Early antibiotic treatment of anthrax is essential; delay significantly lessens chances for survival.

Treatment for anthrax infection and other bacterial infections includes large doses of intravenous and oral antibiotics, such as [[fluoroquinolone]]s ([[ciprofloxacin]]), [[doxycycline]], [[erythromycin]], [[vancomycin]], or [[penicillin]]. FDA-approved agents include ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and penicillin.&lt;ref name="urlCDC Anthrax Q &amp; A: Treatment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/treatment.asp|title=CDC Anthrax Q &amp; A: Treatment|accessdate=4 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505191339/http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/treatment.asp|archivedate=5 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In possible cases of pulmonary anthrax, early [[prophylaxis|antibiotic prophylaxis]] treatment is crucial to prevent possible death.

In recent years, many attempts have been made to develop new drugs against anthrax, but existing drugs are effective if treatment is started soon enough.

=== Monoclonal antibodies ===
In May 2009, [[Human Genome Sciences]] submitted a [[biologic license application]] (BLA, permission to market) for its new drug, [[raxibacumab]] (brand name ABthrax) intended for emergency treatment of inhaled anthrax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HGSI asks for FDA approval of anthrax drug ABthrax |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=Forbes |date=21 May 2009 |url=http://www.pharmpro.com/news/2009/05/hgsi-asks-fda-approval-anthrax-drug-abthrax |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018235213/http://www.pharmpro.com/news/2009/05/hgsi-asks-fda-approval-anthrax-drug-abthrax |archivedate=18 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved raxibacumab injection to treat inhalational anthrax.

== Epidemiology ==
Globally, at least 2,000 cases occur a year.&lt;ref name=Glob2016/&gt;

=== United States ===
The last fatal case of natural inhalational anthrax in the United States occurred in California in 1976, when a home weaver died after working with infected wool imported from Pakistan. To minimize the chance of spreading the disease, the deceased was transported to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in a sealed plastic body bag within a sealed metal container for autopsy.&lt;ref name="Suffin1978"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Suffin |first=S.

Gastrointestinal anthrax is exceedingly rare in the United States, with two cases on record, the first was reported in 1942, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Sarah Schweitzer |date=4 January 2010 |title=Drummer's anthrax case spurs a public health hunt |newspaper=The Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/01/04/nh_anthrax_case_linked_to_animal_skinned_drums/ |accessdate=19 October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214142749/http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/01/04/nh_anthrax_case_linked_to_animal_skinned_drums/ |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During December 2009, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services confirmed a case of gastrointestinal anthrax in an adult female. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] investigated the source and the possibility that it was contracted from an African drum recently used by the woman taking part in a [[drum circle]].&lt;ref name="promedmail.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.promedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400:1001:747000751311471::NO::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID:1000,80634 |title=PROMED: Anthrax, Human – USA: (New Hampshire) 26 December 2009 |publisher=Promedmail.org |date= |accessdate=17 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927141758/http://www.promedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400%3A1001%3A747000751311471%3A%3ANO%3A%3AF2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE%2CF2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID%3A1000%2C80634 |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman apparently inhaled anthrax [in spore form] from the hide of the drum. She became critically ill, but with gastrointestinal anthrax rather than inhaled anthrax, which made her unique in American medical history. The building where the infection took place was cleaned and reopened to the public and the woman recovered. Jodie Dionne-Odom, New Hampshire state epidemiologist, stated, "It is a mystery. We really don't know why it happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.promedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400:1001:130058575417351::NO::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID:1000,82333 |title=PROMED: Anthrax, Human – USA: (New Hampshire) 18 April 2010 |publisher=Promedmail.org |date= |accessdate=17 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927142617/http://www.promedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400%3A1001%3A130058575417351%3A%3ANO%3A%3AF2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE%2CF2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID%3A1000%2C82333 |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|List of anthrax outbreaks}}

=== Etymology ===
The English name comes from ''anthrax'' ({{lang|grc|ἄνθραξ}}), the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for coal,&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/nqrac|ἄνθραξ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anthrax}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly having [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] etymology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV3dCQAAQBAJ|title=Wool Economy in the Ancient Near East|first1=Catherine|last1=Breniquet|first2=Cécile|last2=Michel|date=31 July 2014|publisher=Oxbow Books|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827170707/https://books.google.com/books?id=fV3dCQAAQBAJ|archivedate=27 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the characteristic black skin [[lesion]]s developed by victims with a cutaneous anthrax infection. The central, black [[eschar]], surrounded by vivid red skin has long been recognised as typical of the disease. The first recorded use of the word "anthrax" in English is in a 1398 translation of [[Bartholomaeus Anglicus]]' work ''{{lang|la|De proprietatibus rerum}}'' (''On the Properties of Things'', 1240).&lt;ref name="de Trevisa 1398"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Trevisa|first1=John|title=Bartholomaeus Anglicus' De Proprietatibus Rerum|date=1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthrax has been known by a wide variety of names, indicating its symptoms, location and groups considered most vulnerable to infection. These include Siberian plague, [[Cumberland County, New South Wales|Cumberland disease]], charbon, splenic fever, malignant edema, woolsorter's disease, and even ''{{lang|fr|[[Bradford|la maladie de Bradford]]}}''.&lt;ref name="Stark 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stark|first1=James|title=The Making of Modern Anthrax, 1875-1920: Uniting Local, National and Global Histories of Disease|date=2013|publisher=Pickering &amp; Chatto|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery ===
[[Robert Koch]], a German physician and scientist, first identified the bacterium that caused the anthrax disease in 1875 in [[Wolsztyn]] (now part of Poland).&lt;ref name="pages 277-310"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brock"&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Madigan |editor-first=M. |editor-last2=Martinko |editor-first2=J. |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms |edition=11th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |isbn=0-13-144329-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pioneering work in the late 19th century was one of the first demonstrations that diseases could be caused by microbes. In a groundbreaking series of experiments, he uncovered the lifecycle and means of transmission of anthrax. His experiments not only helped create an understanding of anthrax, but also helped elucidate the role of microbes in causing illness at a time when debates still took place over [[spontaneous generation#Spontaneous generation|spontaneous generation]] versus [[cell theory]]. Koch went on to study the mechanisms of other diseases and won the 1905 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery of the bacterium causing tuberculosis.

Although Koch arguably made the greatest theoretical contribution to our understanding of anthrax, other researchers were more concerned with the practical questions of how to prevent the disease. In Britain, where anthrax affected workers in the wool, [[worsted]], [[hide (skin)|hide]]s and [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] industries, it was viewed with fear. [[John Henry Bell]], a doctor based in [[Bradford]], first made the link between the mysterious and deadly "woolsorter's disease" and anthrax, showing in 1878 that they were one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M|first1=J|title=John Henry Bell, M.D., M.R.C.S|journal=British Medical Journal|date=22 September 1906|pages=735–6|pmc=2382239|volume=2|issue=2386|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2386.735}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century, [[Friederich Wilhelm Eurich]], the [[Germans|German]] [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] who settled in Bradford with his family as a child, carried out important research for the local Anthrax Investigation Board. Eurich also made valuable contributions to a [[Home Office]] Departmental Committee of Inquiry, established in 1913 to address the continuing problem of industrial anthrax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Industrial Infection by Anthrax|journal=British Medical Journal|date=15 November 1913|page=1338|pmc=2346352|volume=2|issue=2759}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work in this capacity, much of it collaboration with the factory inspector [[G. Elmhirst Duckering]], led directly to the [[Anthrax Prevention Act]] (1919).

=== First vaccination ===

[[File:Pasteur inoculating sheep against anthrax. Wellcome L0003758.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis Pasteur inoculating sheep against anthrax]]

Anthrax posed a major economic challenge in [[France]] and elsewhere during the nineteenth century. Horses, cattle and sheep were particularly vulnerable, and national funds were set aside to investigate the production of a [[vaccine]]. The noted French scientist [[Louis Pasteur]] was charged with the production of a vaccine, following his successful work in developing methods which helped to protect the important wine and silk industries.&lt;ref name="Jones 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Susan|title=Death in a Small Package: A Short History of Anthrax|date=2010|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1881, [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]] – in collaboration with his assistants [[Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint|Jean-Joseph Henri Toussaint]], [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux|Émile Roux]] and others – performed a public experiment at [[Pouilly-le-Fort]] to demonstrate his concept of vaccination. He prepared two groups of 25 [[sheep]], one [[goat]], and several [[cow]]s. The animals of one group were injected with an anthrax [[vaccine]] prepared by Pasteur twice, at an interval of 15 days; the control group was left unvaccinated. Thirty days after the first injection, both groups were injected with a culture of live anthrax bacteria. All the animals in the unvaccinated group died, while all of the animals in the vaccinated group survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Decker |first=Janet |title=Deadly Diseases and Epidemics, Anthrax |publisher=Chelesa House Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=0-7910-7302-5 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this apparent triumph, which was widely reported in the local, national and international press, [[Pasteur]] made strenuous efforts to export the vaccine beyond France. He used his celebrity status to establish Pasteur Institutes across Europe and Asia, and his nephew, [[Adrien Loir]], travelled to [[Australia]] in 1888 to try and introduce the vaccine to combat anthrax in [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name="Geison 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geison|first1=Gerald|title=The Private Science of Louis Pasteur|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the vaccine was unsuccessful in the challenging climate of rural [[Australia]], and it was soon superseded by a more robust version developed by local researchers [[John Gunn (researcher)|John Gunn]] and [[John McGarvie Smith]].&lt;ref name="Stark 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stark|first1=James|title=Anthrax and Australia in a Global Context: The International Exchange of Theories and Practices with Britain and France, c.1850–1920|journal=Health and History|date=2012|volume=14|issue=2|pages=1–25 |doi=10.5401/healthhist.14.2.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anthrax vaccine adsorbed|human vaccine for anthrax]] became available in 1954. This was a cell-free vaccine instead of the live-cell Pasteur-style vaccine used for veterinary purposes. An improved cell-free vaccine became available in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/anthrax/downloads/ed-vpd2006-anthrax.ppt Anthrax and Anthrax Vaccine – Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824060412/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/anthrax/downloads/ed-vpd2006-anthrax.ppt |date=24 August 2012}}", National Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, January 2006.

=== Engineered strains ===
{{expand list|date=April 2018}}
*The ''Sterne strain'' of anthrax, named after the [[Trieste]]-born immunologist [[Max Sterne]], is an attenuated strain used as a vaccine, which contains only the [[anthrax toxin]] virulence plasmid and not the polyglutamic acid capsule expressing plasmid.
*''[[Strain 836]]'', created by the Soviet bio-weapons program in the 1980s, was later hailed by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as "the most virulent and vicious strain of anthrax known to man".&lt;ref&gt;[[David Willman|Willman, David]] (2007), [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/01/nation/na-alibek1 "Selling the Threat of Bioterrorism"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', 1 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Annie Jacobsen|Jacobsen, Annie]] (2015), ''The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top Secret Military Research Agency''; New York: [[Little, Brown and Company]], pg 293.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The virulent ''[[Ames strain]]'', which was used in the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States has received the most news coverage of any anthrax outbreak. The Ames strain contains two virulence [[plasmids]], which separately encode for a three-protein toxin, called [[anthrax toxin]], and a polyglutamic acid [[bacterial capsule|capsule]].
*Nonetheless, the ''[[Vollum strain]]'', developed but never used as a [[biological weapon]] during the [[Second World War]], is much more dangerous. The Vollum (also incorrectly referred to as Vellum) strain was isolated in 1935 from a cow in [[Oxfordshire]]. This same strain was used during the [[Gruinard Island|Gruinard]] bioweapons trials. A variation of Vollum, known as "Vollum 1B", was used during the 1960s in the US and UK bioweapon programs. Vollum 1B is widely believed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url         = http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/armyanthraxvictimsblood.html |accessdate  = 6 August 2009 |title       = Army harvested victims' blood to boost anthrax |date        = 23 December 2001 |author      = Scott Shane |work        = Boston Sun |publisher   = UCLA Dept. of Epidemiology site |deadurl     = no |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091229122543/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/armyanthraxvictimsblood.html |archivedate = 29 December 2009 |df          = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have been isolated from William A. Boyles, a 46-year-old scientist at the [[United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories|US Army Biological Warfare Laboratories]] at [[Fort Detrick|Camp (later Fort) Detrick]], [[Maryland]], who died in 1951 after being accidentally infected with the Vollum strain.

To speed the process, trace amounts of a nontoxic [[catalyst]] composed of iron and tetroamido macrocyclic [[ligand]]s are combined with [[sodium carbonate]] and [[bicarbonate]] and converted into a spray. The spray formula is applied to an infested area and is followed by another spray containing [[tert-butyl hydroperoxide]].&lt;ref name="Pesticide Disposal Goes Green"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/5581/title/Pesticide_Disposal_Goes_Green |publisher=Science News |title=Pesticide Disposal Goes Green |accessdate=8 June 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629214707/http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/5581/title/Pesticide_Disposal_Goes_Green |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the catalyst method, a complete destruction of all anthrax spores can be achieved in under 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="Pesticide Disposal Goes Green" /&gt; A standard catalyst-free spray destroys fewer than half the spores in the same amount of time.

Cleanup of anthrax-contaminated areas on ranches and in the wild is much more problematic. Carcasses may be burned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/01/us/anthrax-expert-faces-fine-for-burning-infected-carcasses.html |title=Anthrax Expert Faces Fine for Burning Infected Carcasses |author=William J.

Carcasses may also be buried, though the burying of large animals deeply enough to prevent resurfacing of spores requires much manpower and expensive tools. Carcasses have been soaked in formaldehyde to kill  spores, though this has environmental contamination issues. Block burning of vegetation in large areas enclosing an anthrax outbreak has been tried; this, while environmentally destructive, causes healthy animals to move away from an area with carcasses in search of fresh grass. Some wildlife workers have experimented with covering fresh anthrax carcasses with shadecloth and heavy objects. This prevents some scavengers from opening the carcasses, thus allowing the putrefactive bacteria within the carcass to kill the vegetative ''B. anthracis'' cells and preventing sporulation. This method also has drawbacks, as scavengers such as hyenas are capable of infiltrating almost any exclosure.

The experimental site at [[Gruinard Island]] is said to have been decontaminated with a mixture of formaldehyde and seawater by the Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/scotland/1457035.stm |title=Britain's 'Anthrax Island' |date=25 July 2001 |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226205629/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/scotland/1457035.stm |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether similar treatments had been applied to US test sites.

=== Biological warfare ===
[[File:Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg|thumb|[[Colin Powell]] giving a presentation to the [[United Nations Security Council]], holding a model vial of anthrax]]
Anthrax spores have been used as a [[biological warfare]] weapon. Its first modern incidence occurred when Nordic rebels, supplied by the German General Staff, used anthrax with unknown results against the Imperial Russian Army in Finland in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Bisher, Jamie, "During World War I, Terrorists Schemed to Use Anthrax in the Cause of Finnish Independence", ''Military History'', August 2003, pp. 17–22.

[https://www.webcitation.org/5knILODnE?url=http://www.geocities.com/jamie_bisher/anthrax.htm Archived] 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthrax was first tested as a biological warfare agent by [[Unit 731]] of the Japanese Kwantung Army in [[Manchuria]] during the 1930s; some of this testing involved intentional infection of prisoners of war, thousands of whom died. Anthrax, designated at the time as Agent N, was also investigated by the Allies in the 1940s.

A long history of practical [[bioweapons]] research exists in this area. For example, in 1942, British bioweapons trials severely contaminated [[Gruinard Island]] in Scotland with anthrax spores of the [[vollum strain|Vollum-14578 strain]], making it a no-go area until it was decontaminated in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cole|first=Leonard A.|title=Clouds of Secrecy: The Army's Germ Warfare Tests Over Populated Areas|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=1990|isbn=0-8226-3001-X|url=http://leonardcole.com/otherworks.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122010352/http://www.leonardcole.com/otherworks.htm|archivedate=22 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saddam's germ war plot is traced back to one Oxford cow |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1726745,00.html |first=David |last=Robertson |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225102048/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1726745,00.html |archivedate=25 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gruinard trials involved testing the effectiveness of a [[submunition]] of an "N-bomb"{{snd}} a biological weapon containing dried anthrax spores. Additionally, five million "cattle cakes" (animal feed pellets impregnated with anthrax spores) were prepared and stored at [[Porton Down]] for "[[Operation Vegetarian]]"{{snd}} antilivestock attacks against Germany to be made by the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=UK planned to wipe out Germany with anthrax|work=Sunday Herald|location=Glasgow|date=14 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was for anthrax-based biological weapons to be dropped on Germany in 1944. However, the edible cattle cakes and the bomb were not used; the cattle cakes were incinerated in late 1945.

Weaponized anthrax was part of the US stockpile prior to 1972, when the United States signed the [[Biological Weapons Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Eric |last1=Croddy |first2=James J. |last2=Wirtz |title=Weapons of mass destruction: an encyclopedia of worldwide policy, technology, and history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&amp;pg=PA21 |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-85109-490-5 |page=21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222225432/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&amp;pg=PA21 |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] ordered the dismantling of US biowarfare programs in 1969 and the destruction of all existing stockpiles of bioweapons.

==== Sverdlovsk incident (2 April 1979) ====
{{Main|Sverdlovsk anthrax leak}}
Despite signing the 1972 agreement to end bioweapon production, the government of the Soviet Union had an active bioweapons program that included the production of hundreds of tons of weapons-grade anthrax after this period. On 2 April 1979, some of the over one million people living in Sverdlovsk (now called [[Ekaterinburg, Russia]]), about {{convert|850|mi|km}} east of Moscow, were exposed to an [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak|accidental release of anthrax]] from a biological weapons complex located near there. At least 94 people were infected, of whom at least 68 died. One victim died four days after the release, 10 over an eight-day period at the peak of the deaths, and the last six weeks later. Extensive cleanup, vaccinations, and medical interventions managed to save about 30 of the victims.&lt;ref name=Guillemin_1999_275&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillemin |first=Jeanne |title=ANTHRAX, the investigation of a Deadly Outbreak |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-520-22917-7|pp=275–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive cover-ups and destruction of records by the [[KGB]] continued from 1979 until Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] admitted this anthrax accident in 1992.

Nearly all of the night-shift workers of a ceramics plant directly across the street from the biological facility (compound 19) became infected, and most died.

They also ordered all [[stray dog]]s to be shot and people not have contact with sick animals. Also, a voluntary evacuation and anthrax vaccination program was established for people from 18–55.&lt;ref name="Meselson"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Meselson |first1=M. |year=1994 |title=The Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak of 1979 |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5188 |pages=1202–1208 |doi=10.1126/science.7973702 |pmid=7973702 |first2=J. |last2=Guillemin |last3=Hugh-Jones |first3=M. |last4=Langmuir |first4=A. |last5=Popova |first5=I. |last6=Shelokov |first6=A. |last7=Yampolskaya |first7=O. |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To support the [[cover-up]] story, Soviet medical and legal journals published articles about an outbreak in livestock that caused GI anthrax in people having consumed infected meat, and cutaneous anthrax in people having come into contact with the animals. All medical and public health records were confiscated by the KGB.&lt;ref name="Meselson" /&gt; In addition to the medical problems the outbreak caused, it also prompted Western countries to be more suspicious of a covert Soviet bioweapons program and to increase their surveillance of suspected sites.

The Soviet Union, like the US and UK, had agreed to submit information to the UN about their bioweapons programs, but omitted known facilities and never acknowledged their weapons program.&lt;ref name="Alibek" /&gt;

To make large amounts of an [[aerosol]] form of anthrax suitable for biological warfare requires extensive practical knowledge, training, and highly advanced equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1590859.stm |accessdate=16 April 2016 |title=Anthrax as a biological weapon |date=10 October 2001 |publisher=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505140938/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1590859.stm |archivedate=5 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrated anthrax spores were used for bioterrorism in the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the United States, delivered by mailing postal letters containing the spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cole|first=Leonard A.|title=The Anthrax Letters: A Bioterrorism Expert Investigates the Attacks That Shocked America—Case Closed?|publisher=SkyhorsePublishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60239-715-6|url=http://leonardcole.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203000100/http://www.leonardcole.com/|archivedate=3 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were sent to several news media offices and two Democratic senators: [[Tom Daschle]] of South Dakota and [[Patrick Leahy]] of Vermont. As a result, 22 were infected and five died.&lt;ref name="Pimental04"/&gt; Only a few grams of material were used in these attacks and in August 2008, the US Department of Justice announced they believed that [[Bruce Edwards Ivins|Dr. Bruce Ivins]], a senior biodefense researcher employed by the United States government, was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bohn | first = Kevin | title = U.S. officials declare researcher is anthrax killer | publisher=CNN | date = 6 August 2008 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/08/06/anthrax.case/index.html | accessdate =7 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080808213014/http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/08/06/anthrax.case/index.html| archivedate= 8 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events also spawned many [[anthrax hoaxes]].

Due to these events, the US Postal Service installed [[Autonomous Detection System|biohazard detection systems]] at its major distribution centers to actively scan for anthrax being transported through the mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title       = Cepheid, Northrop Grumman Enter Into Agreement for the Purchase of Anthrax Test Cartridges |publisher   = Security Products |date        = 16 August 2007 |url         = http://secprodonline.com/articles/2007/08/16/cepheid-northrop-grumman.aspx |accessdate  = 26 March 2009 |deadurl     = no |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716031354/http://secprodonline.com/articles/2007/08/16/cepheid-northrop-grumman.aspx |archivedate = 16 July 2011 |df          = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Decontaminating mail ====
In response to the postal anthrax attacks and hoaxes, the United States Postal Service sterilized some mail using gamma [[irradiation]] and treatment with a proprietary [[enzyme]] formula supplied by Sipco Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.com/news/facts/lfu_021202.htm|accessdate=13 August 2008|title=Latest Facts Update |date=12 February 2002|publisher=USPS|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509204939/http://www.usps.com/news/facts/lfu_021202.htm |archivedate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scientific experiment performed by a high school student, later published in ''The Journal of Medical Toxicology'', suggested a domestic [[ironing|electric iron]] at its hottest setting (at least {{convert|400|°F|°C}}) used for at least 5 minutes should destroy all anthrax spores in a common postal envelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seventeen-year-old devises anthrax deactivator |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11522143/ns/msnbc-the_ed_show/t/seventeen-year-old-devises-anthrax-deactivator |publisher=[[NBC News]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007082027/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11522143/ns/msnbc-the_ed_show/t/seventeen-year-old-devises-anthrax-deactivator/ |archivedate=7 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other animals ==
Anthrax is especially rare in dogs and cats, as is evidenced by a single reported case in the United States in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dogsinthenews.com/issues/0110/articles/011030a.htm Can Dogs Get Anthrax?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406205603/http://dogsinthenews.com/issues/0110/articles/011030a.htm |date=6 April 2012}}" ''Canine Nation'', 30 October 2001.

Russian researchers estimate arctic [[permafrost]] contains around 1.5 million anthrax-infected reindeer carcasses, and the spores may survive in the permafrost for 105 years.&lt;ref name="RevichPodolnaya2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Revich|first1=Boris A.|last2=Podolnaya|first2=Marina A.|title=Thawing of permafrost may disturb historic cattle burial grounds in East Siberia|journal=Global Health Action|volume=4|issue=0|year=2011|issn=1654-9880|doi=10.3402/gha.v4i0.8482|pmc=3222928|pmid=22114567}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a risk that [[global warming in the Arctic]] can thaw the permafrost, releasing anthrax spores in the carcasses.

'''Body image law''' is the  developing area of law that,  according to Dr Marilyn Bromberg of the [[University of Western Australia]] Law School and Cindy Halliwell, a law student at [[Deakin University]], "encompasses the bills, laws and government actions (such as establishing parliamentary inquiries and creating policies) that may help to improve the [[body image]] of the general public, and particularly of young people".&lt;ref name="mb/ch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bromberg|first1=Marilyn|last2=Halliwell|first2=Cindy|title=All About That Bass’ and Photoshopping a Model’s Waist: Introducing Body Image Law|journal=The University of Notre Dame Australia Law Review|date=2016|volume=18|url=http://researchonline.nd.edu.au/undalr/vol18/iss1/1/|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for implementing law in this area is to prevent the images of unhealthily thin women causing poor body image which can, along with other factors, lead to an [[eating disorder]].&lt;ref name="mb/ch" /&gt;

== Laws ==
The [[Israeli system of government|Israeli government]] passed a body image law in 2012 which became operational the following year. The law requires models to have a minimum [[body mass index]] to work and if an image was photoshopped to make the model appear thinner, it must have a warning. The warning must state that the image was modified and it must take up at least seven percent of the image. Breaches can result in a civil lawsuit.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel: Restrictions on Depiction of Underweight Models in Commercials|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/israel-restrictions-on-depiction-of-underweight-models-in-commercials/|website=www.loc.gov|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en|date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[French Government]]  passed a similar law in 2015 which came into effect in 2017. This law requires that models provide their employers with a "medical certificate, valid for up to two years, confirming their general physical well-being and the fact that they are not excessively underweight." &lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/fashion/france-laws-thin-models.html|title=A New Age in French — Modeling|last=Friedman|first=Vanessa|date=2017-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMI of models older than 16 will also be taken into consideration, when determining their overall health.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; 

In contrast to the Israeli law, breaching it attracts criminal sanctions.&lt;ref name="vf"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Vanessa|title=A New Age in French — Modeling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/fashion/france-laws-thin-models.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, any photo that has been digitally altered must be labeled as such; failure to label these photos will result in a "fine of 37,500 euros, or more than $41,000," and hiring a model without the verified medical certificate and requirements "carries a fine of €75,000 and six months in jail." &lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; The law dictates that digitally altered images must be labeled "applies only to advertising, not to editorial images in magazines or newspapers." &lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt;

The [[Greater London Authority]] banned advertisements that promote unhealthy body image on [[Transport for London]] public transport in 2016.&lt;ref name="ap/mo"&gt;{{cite news|title=London mayor bans Tube ads that promote unhealthy body image|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3640626/London-mayor-takes-aim-body-shaming-advertising-Tube.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[Mail Online]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Trondheim]] in Norway banned advertisements that promote unhealthy body image in public places in 2017.&lt;ref name="gs"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Samuels|first1=Gabriel|title=Norwegian city bans adverts featuring semi-nude models|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-trondheim-ban-adverts-semi-naked-models-negative-body-image-a7026421.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]'s position in this area is that it is up to industry to solve the problem of poor body image.&lt;ref name="jw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Jessica|title=Skinny models: Australia welcomes Paris ban|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/skinny-models-australia-welcomes-paris-ban-20150319-1m36t7.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the previous Labor Government created a non-binding Voluntary Industry Code of Conduct on Body Image.&lt;ref name="apo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntary industry code of conduct on body image|url=http://apo.org.au/node/21888|publisher=Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States spends much more money on healthcare than Canada, on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP.&lt;ref name="OECD Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/33/38979719.pdf |title=OECD Health Data 2008: How Does Canada Compare |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628131552/http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/BriefingNoteCANADA2012.pdf|archivedate=June 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US$3,678; in the U.S., US$6,714. The U.S. spent 15.3% of GDP on healthcare in that year; Canada spent 10.0%.&lt;ref name="OECD Canada"/&gt; In 2006, 70% of healthcare spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States. Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on healthcare was 23% higher than Canadian government spending, and U.S. government expenditure on healthcare was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private) though these statistics don't take into account population differences.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select_process.cfm?strISO3_select=ALL&amp;strIndicator_select=nha&amp;intYear_select=latest&amp;fixed=country&amp;language=english Core Health Indicators]. U.S. government spending was US$2724 vs. US$2214 on a [[purchasing power parity]] basis ($2724 and $2121 on a non-adjusted basis); total U.S. spending was US$6096 vs. US$3137 (PPP) ($6096 and $3038 on a non-adjusted basis).&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending. A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that "health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent."&lt;ref name="Open Medicine"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guyatt G.H. | year = 2007 | title = A systematic review of studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the United States | url = http://www.openmedicine.ca/article/view/8/1 | journal = Open Medicine | volume = 1 | page = 1 | display-authors = etal | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070705032644/http://www.openmedicine.ca/article/view/8/1 | archivedate = July 5, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the noted differences were a higher life expectancy in Canada, as well as a lower infant mortality rate than the United States.

One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization's ratings of "overall health service performance", which used a "composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution", ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations.  This study rated the US "responsiveness", or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment, as 1st, compared with 7th for Canada.  However, the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/annex01_en.pdf |title=Health system attainment and performance in all Member States, ranked by eight measures, estimates for 1997 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO's study methods were criticized by some analyses.
While life-expectancy and infant mortality are commonly used in comparing nationwide health care, they are in fact affected by many factors other than the quality of a nation's health care system, including individual behavior and population makeup.&lt;ref name="NBER 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first=June E. |last=O'Neill |first2=Dave M. |last2=O'Neill |title=Health Status, Health Care and Inequality: Canada vs. the U.S. |journal=Forum for Health Economics &amp; Policy |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages= |doi=10.2202/1558-9544.1094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 report by the [[Congressional Research Service]] carefully summarizes some recent data and noted the "difficult research issues" facing international comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Research Service, [http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34175_20070917.pdf "U.S. Health Care Spending: Comparison with Other OECD Countries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126203047/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34175_20070917.pdf |date=January 26, 2011 }}, September 17, 2007.  Order Code RL34175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government involvement==
In 2004, government funding of healthcare in Canada was equivalent to $1,893 per person.  In the US, government spending per person was $2,728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34175_20070917.pdf |title=Comparison with Other OECD Countries |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126203047/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34175_20070917.pdf |archivedate=January 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian healthcare system is composed of at least 10 mostly autonomous provincial healthcare systems that report to their provincial governments, and a federal system which covers the military and [[First Nations]]. This causes a significant degree of variation in funding and coverage within the country.

===History===
Canada and the US had similar healthcare systems in the early 1960s,&lt;ref name="Szick"/&gt; but now have a different mix of funding mechanisms. Canada's universal [[single-payer healthcare]] system covers about 70% of expenditures, and the [[Canada Health Act]] requires that all insured persons be fully insured, without co-payments or user fees, for all medically necessary hospital and physician care.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}  About 91% of hospital expenditures and 99% of total physician services are financed by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/944-e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, with its mixed public-private system, 16% or 45 million American residents are uninsured at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nchc.org/facts/coverage.shtml The National Coalition on Health Care, Facts About Healthcare – Health Insurance Coverage.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822142929/http://www.nchc.org/facts/coverage.shtml |date=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. is one of two [[OECD]] countries not to have some form of universal health coverage, the other being Turkey. Mexico established a universal healthcare program by November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecdwash.org/PDFILES/health2003_wash.pdf |title=Reforming Health Systems in OECD Countries |accessdate=2007-07-11 |last=Docteur |first=Elizabeth |date=2003-06-23 |format=PDF |work=Presentation, OECD Breakfast Series in Partnership with NABE. |publisher=OECD |page=20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929011836/http://www.oecdwash.org/PDFILES/health2003_wash.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health insurance===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
The governments of both nations are closely involved in healthcare. The central structural difference between the two is in [[health insurance]]. In Canada, the federal government is committed to providing funding support to its provincial governments for healthcare expenditures as long as the province in question abides by accessibility guarantees as set out in the [[Canada Health Act]], which explicitly prohibits billing end users for procedures that are covered by [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} While some label Canada's system as "socialized medicine", health economists do not use that term.  Unlike systems with public delivery, such as the UK, the Canadian system provides public coverage for a combination of public and private delivery. Princeton University health economist Uwe E. Reinhardt says that single-payer systems are not "socialized medicine" but "social insurance" systems, since providers (such as doctors) are largely in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, U.E. ''et al.'' [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118411829790962883 Letters: For Children's Sake, This 'Schip' Needs to Be Relaunched.] ''Wall Street Journal'', July 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Canadian hospitals are controlled by private boards or regional health authorities, rather than being part of government.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the US, direct government funding of health care is limited to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), which cover eligible senior citizens, the very poor, disabled persons, and children. The federal government also runs the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], which provides care directly to retired or disabled veterans, their families, and survivors through medical centers and clinics.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The U.S. government also runs the [[Military Health System]]. In fiscal year 2007, the MHS had a total budget of $39.4 billion and served approximately 9.1 million beneficiaries, including active-duty personnel and their families, and retirees and their families. The MHS includes 133,000 personnel, 86,000 military and 47,000 civilian, working at more than 1,000 locations worldwide, including 70 inpatient facilities and 1,085 medical, dental, and veterans' clinics.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

One study estimates that about 25 percent of the uninsured in the U.S. are eligible for these programs but remain unenrolled; however, extending coverage to all who are eligible remains a fiscal and political challenge.&lt;ref name="Kaiser Uninsured"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/7613.pdf |title=Characteristics of the Uninsured: Who is Eligible for Public Coverage and Who Needs Help Affording Coverage?  |accessdate=2007-07-19 |format=PDF |work=Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For everyone else, health insurance must be paid for privately. Some 59% of U.S. residents have access to health care insurance through employers, although this figure is decreasing, and coverages as well as workers' expected contributions vary widely.&lt;ref name="Census 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf| title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-26 | format=PDF |work=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those whose employers do not offer health insurance, as well as those who are self-employed or unemployed, must purchase it on their own. Nearly 27 million of the 45 million uninsured U.S. residents worked at least part-time in 2007, and more than a third were in households that earned $50,000 or more per year.&lt;ref name="Census 2007" /&gt;

===Funding===
Despite the greater role of private business in the US, federal and state agencies are increasingly involved, paying about 45% of the $2.2 trillion the nation spent on medical care in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julie |last=Appleby |title=Universal care appeals to USA |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2006-10-15-universal-usat_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2007-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government spends more on healthcare than on Social Security and national defense combined, according to the [[Brookings Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opportunity08.org/Files/FD.ashx?guid=98a417e5-5972-4031-b361-e11e00981f55 |title=Meeting the Dilemma of Health Care Access |accessdate=2007-06-21 |format=PDF |work=Opportunity 08: A Project of the Brookings Institution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211359/http://www.opportunity08.org/Files/FD.ashx?guid=98a417e5-5972-4031-b361-e11e00981f55 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its direct spending, the US government is also highly involved in healthcare through regulation and legislation. For example, the [[Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]] provided grants and loans to subsidize [[Health Maintenance Organizations]] and contained provisions to stimulate their popularity. HMOs had been declining before the law; by 2002 there were 500 such plans enrolling 76 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/6225.php |title=Health Care Expenditures in the USA |accessdate=2007-07-18 |work=National Center for Health Statistics | publisher=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian system has been 69–75% [[publicly funded healthcare|publicly funded]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/36/38979632.xls |title=OECD Health Data 2007 – Frequently Requested Data |accessdate=2007-08-27 |format=Excel |work=OECD }}&lt;/ref&gt; though most services are delivered by private providers, including physicians (although they may derive their revenue primarily from government billings). Although some doctors work on a purely fee-for-service basis (usually family physicians), some family physicians and most specialists are paid through a combination of fee-for-service and fixed contracts with hospitals or health service management organizations.

Canada's universal health plans do not cover certain services.  Non-cosmetic [[Dentistry|dental care]] is covered for children up to age 14 in some provinces.  Outpatient prescription drugs are not required to be covered, but some provinces have drug cost programs that cover most drug costs for certain populations.  In every province, seniors receiving the [[Guaranteed Income Supplement]] have significant additional coverage; some provinces expand forms of drug coverage to all seniors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coverme.com/LH/CoverMe/miniWhy/English/NotCovered/A_NS.html |title=CoverMe Government Health Insurance Coverage |publisher=Coverme.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; low-income families,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coverme.com/LH/CoverMe/miniWhy/English/NotCovered/A_SK.html |title=CoverMe Government Health Insurance Coverage |publisher=Coverme.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; those on social assistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coverme.com/LH/CoverMe/miniWhy/English/NotCovered/A_NF.html |title=CoverMe Government Health Insurance Coverage |publisher=Coverme.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or those with certain medical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0212/intro-e.asp |title=Health – Prescription Drug Program |publisher=Gnb.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some provinces cover all drug prescriptions over a certain portion of a family's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/pharmacare/index.html |title=Manitoba Pharmacare Program Information: 2007–2008 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |work=Province of Manitoba }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drug prices are also regulated, so brand-name prescription drugs are often significantly cheaper than in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aarp.org/bulletin/prescription/Articles/a2003-08-12-whydrugs.html |title=Why Drugs Cost Less Up North: Important Differences in American, Canadian Systems Produce Big Price Disparities |date=June 2003 | accessdate=2007-07-02 |work=AARP Bulletin }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Optometry]] is only covered in some provinces and is sometimes only covered for children under a certain age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/index.html#insuredmedicalbenefits |title=Manitoba Health Benefits |publisher=Gov.mb.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visits to non-physician specialists may require an additional fee. Also, some procedures are only covered under certain circumstances. For example, [[circumcision]] is not covered, and a fee is usually charged when a parent requests the procedure; however, if an infection or [[medical necessity]] arises, the procedure would be covered.

According to Dr. Albert Schumacher, former president of the Canadian Medical Association, an estimated 75 percent of Canadian healthcare services are delivered privately, but funded publicly.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Frontline practitioners whether they're GPs or specialists by and large are not salaried. They're small hardware stores. Same thing with labs and radiology clinics ... The situation we are seeing now are more services around not being funded publicly but people having to pay for them, or their insurance companies. We have sort of a passive privatization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/public_vs_private.html Public vs. private health care.] ''CBC'', December 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Coverage and access==
In both Canada and the United States, access can be a problem. Studies suggest that 40% of U.S. citizens do not have adequate health insurance, if any at all. In Canada, 5% of Canadian citizens have not been able to find a regular doctor, with a further 9% having never looked for one.  Yet, even if some cannot find a family doctor, every Canadian citizen is covered by the national health care system.  The U.S. data is evidenced in a 2007 Consumer Reports study on the U.S. health care system which showed that the underinsured account for 24% of the U.S. population and live with skeletal health insurance that barely covers their medical needs and leaves them unprepared to pay for major medical expenses.  When added to the population of uninsured (approximately 16% of the U.S. population), a total of 40% of Americans ages 18–64 have inadequate access to healthcare, according to the Consumer Reports study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/08/cu_insurance.html Consumer Reports Study on the Uninsured], 08-07-06&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian data comes from the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey,&lt;ref name="Statcan"&gt;[http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/040615/d040615b.htm Canadian Community Health Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231215220/http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/040615/d040615b.htm |date=December 31, 2006 }}, 04-06-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the federal government does not guarantee [[universal healthcare]] to all its citizens, but [[publicly funded healthcare]] programs help to provide for the elderly, disabled, the poor, and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov |title=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] or EMTALA also ensures public access to [[emergency services]]. The EMTALA law forces emergency healthcare providers to stabilize an emergency health crisis and cannot withhold treatment for lack of evidence of insurance coverage or other evidence of the ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/ |title=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services: Emergency Medical Treatment &amp; Labor Act |publisher=Cms.hhs.gov |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMTALA does not absolve the person receiving emergency care of the obligation to meet the cost of emergency healthcare not paid for at the time and it is still within the right of the hospital to pursue any debtor for the cost of emergency care provided. In Canada, emergency room treatment for legal Canadian residents is not charged to the patient at time of service but is met by the government.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], 59.3% of U.S. citizens have [[health insurance]] related to employment, 27.8% have government-provided health-insurance; nearly 9% purchase health insurance directly (there is some overlap in these figures), and 15.3% (45.7 million) were uninsured in 2007.&lt;ref name="Census 2007"/&gt; An estimated 25 percent of the uninsured are eligible for government programs but unenrolled.&lt;ref name="Kaiser Uninsured" /&gt; About a third of the uninsured are in households earning more than $50,000 annually.&lt;ref name="Census 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour, J.A.

A number of [[free clinic|clinics]] provide free or low-cost non-emergency care to poor, uninsured patients. The National Association of Free Clinics claims that its member clinics provide $3 billion in services to some 3.5 million patients annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freeclinics.us/AboutUs/tabid/54/Default.aspx |title=National Association of Free Clinics: About Us |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A peer-reviewed comparison study of healthcare access in the two countries published in 2006 concluded that U.S. residents are one third less likely to have a regular medical doctor, one fourth more likely to have unmet healthcare needs, and are more than twice as likely to forgo needed medicines.&lt;ref name="Lasser et al." /&gt; The study noted that access problems "were particularly dire for the US uninsured." Those who lack insurance in the U.S. were much less satisfied, less likely to have seen a doctor, and more likely to have been unable to receive desired care than both Canadians and insured Americans.&lt;ref name="Lasser et al." /&gt;

Another cross-country study compared access to care based on immigrant status in Canada and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lebrun LA &amp; Dubay LC. (2010). Access to primary and preventive care among foreign-born adults in Canada and the United States.

Specifically, immigrants living in Canada were less likely to have timely Pap tests compared with native-born Canadians; in addition, immigrants in the U.S. were less likely to have a regular medical doctor and an annual consultation with a health care provider compared with native-born Americans. In general, immigrants in Canada had better access to care than those in the U.S., but most of the differences were explained by differences in socioeconomic status (income, education) and insurance coverage across the two countries. However, immigrants in the U.S. were more likely to have timely Pap tests than immigrants in Canada.

[[Cato Institute]] has expressed concerns that the U.S. government has restricted the freedom of Medicare patients to spend their own money on healthcare, and has contrasted these developments with the situation in Canada, where in 2005 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the province of Quebec could not prohibit its citizens from purchasing covered services through private health insurance. The institute has urged the Congress to restore the right of American seniors to spend their own money on medical care.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Masterson Brown, [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8737 "The Freedom to Spend Your Own Money on Medical Care: A Common Casualty of Universal Coverage"], CATO Institute Policy Analysis no. 601, October 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Under that law, if a health care plan offers mental health and/or substance use disorder benefits, it must offer the benefits on par with the other medical/surgical benefits it covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parity Implementation Coalition|url=http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/sites/default/files/final%20detailed%20summary.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wait times==
One complaint about both the U.S. and Canadian systems is waiting times, whether for a specialist, major elective surgery, such as [[hip replacement]], or specialized treatments, such as [[Radiation therapy|radiation]] for [[breast cancer]]; wait times in each country are affected by various factors. In the United States, access is primarily determined by whether a person has access to funding to pay for treatment and by the availability of services in the area and by the willingness of the provider to deliver service at the price set by the insurer. In Canada, the wait time is set according to the availability of services in the area and by the relative need of the person needing treatment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

As reported by the [[Health Council of Canada]], a 2010 Commonwealth survey found that 39% of Canadians waited 2 hours or more in the emergency room, versus 31% in the U.S.; 43% waited 4 weeks or more to see a specialist, versus 10% in the U.S. The same survey states that 37% of Canadians say it is difficult to access care after hours (evenings, weekends or holidays) without going to the emergency department over 34% of Americans.  Furthermore, 47% of Canadians and 50% of Americans who visited emergency departments over the past two years feel that they could have been treated at their normal place of care if they were able to get an appointment.&lt;ref name=HCC_CommWealth2010&gt;{{cite web|title=How Do Canadians Rate the Health Care System?|url=http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=shop.flypage&amp;product_id=120&amp;category_id=20&amp;manufacturer_id=0&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=170|publisher=Health Council of Canada|accessdate=August 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827054733/http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=shop.flypage&amp;product_id=120&amp;category_id=20&amp;manufacturer_id=0&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=170|archivedate=August 27, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnostic tests were defined as the following: non-emergency magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices; computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans; and angiographies that use X-rays to examine the inner opening of blood-filled structures such as veins and arteries.&lt;/ref&gt;  The median wait time to see a special physician is a little over four weeks with 86.4% waiting less than 3 months.&lt;ref name="Healthy Canadians 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Figs 7 &amp; 8.

Because Medicaid payments are low, some have claimed that some doctors do not want to see Medicaid patients. For example, in [[Benton Harbor, Michigan]], specialists agreed to spend one afternoon every week or two at a Medicaid clinic, which meant that Medicaid patients had to make appointments not at the doctor's office, but at the clinic, where appointments had to be booked months in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhrmans, V.

In a 2009 survey of physician appointment wait times in the United States, the average wait time for an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon in the country as a whole was 17 days. In Dallas, Texas the wait was 45 days (the longest wait being 365 days).  Nationwide across the U.S. the average wait time to see a family doctor was 20 days. The average wait time to see a family practitioner in Los Angeles, California was 59 days and in Boston, Massachusetts it was 63 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merritthawkins.com/pdf/mha2009waittimesurvey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] found that 42% of Canadians waited 2 hours or more in the emergency room, vs. 29% in the U.S.; 57% waited 4 weeks or more to see a specialist, vs. 23% in the U.S., but Canadians had more chances of getting medical attention at nights, or on weekends and holidays than their American neighbors without the need to visit an ER (54% compared to 61%).&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth Fund, Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: An International update on the comparative performance of American health care, Karen Davis et al., May 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistics from the Canadian free market think tank [[Fraser Institute]] in 2008 indicate that the average wait time between the time when a general practitioner refers a patient for care and the receipt of treatment was almost four and a half months in 2008, roughly double what it had been 15 years before.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Pipes, President and CEO of the [[Pacific Research Institute]], writing in ''[[The Washington Examiner]]'', [http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/special-editorial-reports/Canadian-patients-face-long-waits-for-low-tech-healthcare-47035532.html "Canadian patients face long waits for low-tech healthcare"]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, June 4, 2009, page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 survey of hospital administrators conducted in Canada, the U.S., and three other countries found dissatisfaction with both the U.S. and Canadian systems.  For example, 21% of Canadian hospital administrators, but less than 1% of American administrators, said that it would take over three weeks to do a biopsy for possible breast cancer on a 50-year-old woman; 50% of Canadian administrators versus none of their American counterparts said that it would take over six months for a 65-year-old to undergo a routine hip replacement surgery. However, U.S. administrators were the most negative about their country's system. Hospital executives in all five countries expressed concerns about staffing shortages and emergency department waiting times and quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2001977834_cihak13.html Guest columnist: The truth about Canada's ailing health-care system], By Robert J.

In a letter to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', Robert Bell, the President and CEO of University Health Network, Toronto, said that [[Michael Moore]]'s film ''[[Sicko]]'' "exaggerated the performance of the Canadian health system&amp;nbsp;— there is no doubt that too many patients still stay in our emergency departments waiting for admission to scarce hospital beds." However, "Canadians spend about 55% of what Americans spend on health care and have longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. Many Americans have access to quality healthcare. All Canadians have access to similar care at a considerably lower cost." There is "no question" that the lower cost has come at the cost of "restriction of supply with sub-optimal access to services," said Bell. A new approach is targeting waiting times, which are reported on public websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.gov.on.ca/transformation/wait_times/wait_mn.html Ontario Wait Times.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703172616/http://www.health.gov.on.ca/transformation/wait_times/wait_mn.html |date=July 3, 2007 }} From: health.gov.on.ca.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancercare.on.ca |title=Cancer Care Ontario |publisher=Cancercare.on.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118394504633260585 "Canadian and U.S. Health Services – Let's Compare the Two,"] Letters, Wall Street Journal, July 9, 2007; Page A13&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes had characterized her condition as an emergency, said she was losing her sight and portrayed her condition as a life-threatening brain cancer.
In July 2009 Holmes agreed to appear in television ads broadcast in the United States warning Americans of the dangers of adopting a Canadian-style health care system.
The ads she appeared in triggered debates on both sides of the border.
After her ad appeared critics pointed out discrepancies in her story, including that [[Rathke's cleft cyst]], the condition she was treated for, was not a form of cancer, and was not life-threatening.&lt;ref name=CbcShonaExaggeration&gt;

==Price of health care and administration overheads==
Healthcare is one of the most expensive items of both nations' budgets. In the United States, the various levels of government spend more per capita  than levels of government do in Canada. In 2004, Canada government-spending was $2,120 (in US dollars) per person, while the United States government-spending $2,724.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select_process.cfm?countries=all&amp;indicators=nha |title=World Health Organization: Core Health Indicators |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 report found that after exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0% of healthcare expenditures in the United States, as compared with 16.7% in Canada.  In looking at the insurance element, in Canada, the provincial single-payer insurance system operated with overheads of 1.3%, comparing favourably with private insurance overheads (13.2%), U.S. private insurance overheads (11.7%) and U.S. Medicare and Medicaid program overheads (3.6% and 6.8% respectively). The report concluded by observing that gap between U.S. and Canadian spending on administration had grown to $752 per capita and that a large sum might be saved in the United States if the U.S. implemented a Canadian-style system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf |title="Costs of Health Care Administration in the United States and Canada" (2003) Steffie Woolhandler, Terry Campbell, David U. Himmelstein, '&amp;#39;The New England Journal of Medicine'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, U.S. government spending covers less than half of all healthcare costs. Private spending is also far greater in the U.S. than in Canada. In Canada, an average of $917 was spent annually by individuals or private insurance companies for health care, including dental, eye care, and drugs. In the U.S., this sum is $3,372.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; In 2006, healthcare consumed 15.3% of U.S. annual GDP. In Canada, only 10% of GDP was spent on healthcare.&lt;ref name="OECD Canada"/&gt; This difference is a relatively recent development. In 1971 the nations were much closer, with Canada spending 7.1% of GDP while the U.S. spent 7.6%.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Some who advocate against greater government involvement in healthcare have asserted that the difference in costs between the two nations is partially explained by the differences in their demographics.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon L.

===Medical professionals===
Some of the extra money spent in the United States goes to [[physicians]], nurses, and other medical professionals. According to health data collected by the [[OECD]], average income for physicians in the United States in 1996 was nearly twice that for physicians in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econedlink.org/lessons/docs_lessons/535_DaigneaultLajoie1.pdf Health Care Systems: An International Comparison.] Strategic Policy and Research Intergovernmental Affairs, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[Gross (economics)|gross]] average salary for doctors in Canada was CDN[[Canadian dollar|$]]328,000. Out of the gross amount, doctors pay for taxes, rent, staff salaries and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canadian-doctor-total-at-record-high-1.1869346|title=
Canadian doctor total at record high
|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing average incomes of doctors in Canada and U.S., it should be kept in mind that malpractice insurance premiums may differ significantly between Canada and the U.S., and the proportion of doctors who are specialists differs. In Canada, less than half of doctors are specialists whereas more than 70% of doctors are specialists in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conover|first1=Chris|title=Are U.S. Doctors Paid Too Much?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/05/28/are-u-s-doctors-paid-too-much/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=31 January 2015|date=2013-05-28|quote=Consequently, comparing average doctor pay in the U.S. (where more than 70% of doctors are specialists) to that in nations such as Canada and France (where less than half of doctors are specialists) is not very illuminating.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has fewer doctors per capita than the United States. In the U.S, there were 2.4 doctors per 1,000 people in 2005; in Canada, there were 2.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/16/0,3343,en_2825_495642_2085200_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Health Data 2007: Frequently Requested Data |accessdate=2007-07-19 |format=Excel spreadsheet |work=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some doctors leave Canada to pursue career goals or higher pay in the U.S., though significant numbers of physicians from countries such as China, India, Pakistan and South Africa immigrate to practice in Canada.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Many Canadian physicians and new medical graduates also go to the U.S. for post-graduate training in medical residencies. As it is a much larger market, new and cutting-edge sub-specialties are more widely available in the U.S. as opposed to Canada. However, statistics published in 2005 by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), show that, for the first time since 1969 (the period for which data are available), more physicians returned to Canada than moved abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_587_E&amp;cw_topic=587&amp;cw_rel=AR_14_E |title=Supply, Distribution and Migration of Canadian Physicians, 2005 |accessdate=2007-07-11 |date=2006-10-12 |format=PDF |publisher=Canadian Institute for Health Information |page=40, fig. 10 |quote= ... in the past two years, the number of physicians returning from abroad has exceeded the number of physicians moving abroad. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713170030/http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_587_E&amp;cw_topic=587&amp;cw_rel=AR_14_E |archivedate=July 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===
Both Canada and the United States have limited programs to provide prescription drugs to the needy. In the U.S., the introduction of [[Medicare Part D]] has extended partial coverage for pharmaceuticals to Medicare beneficiaries. In Canada all drugs given in hospitals fall under Medicare, but other prescriptions do not. The provinces all have some programs to help the poor and seniors have access to drugs, but while there have been calls to create one, no national program exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/07/30/pharma_040730.html |title=Premiers propose drug plan paid for by Ottawa |publisher=CBC |date=2004-08-03 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two thirds of Canadians have private prescription drug coverage, mostly through their employers.&lt;ref name="OECD Pharmaceuticals"&gt;Valérie Paris and Elizabeth Docteur. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/21/40/37868186.pdf Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Policies in Canada] OECD Health Working Papers&lt;/ref&gt; In both countries, there is a significant population not fully covered by these programs. A 2005 study found that 20% of Canada's and 40% of America's sicker adults did not fill a prescription because of cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schoen C, Osborn R, Huynh PT |title=Taking the pulse of health care systems: experiences of patients with health problems in six countries |journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope) |volume=Suppl Web Exclusives |pages=W5–509–25 |year=2005  |pmid=16269444 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.w5.509 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the 2010 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey indicates that 4% of Canadians indicated that they did not visit a doctor because of cost compared with 22% of Americans.  Additionally, 21% of Americans have said that they did not fill a prescription for medicine or have skipped doses due to cost.  That is compared with 10% of Canadians.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

One of the most important differences between the two countries is the much higher cost of drugs in the United States. In the U.S., $728 per capita is spent each year on drugs, while in Canada it is $509.&lt;ref name="OECD Pharmaceuticals"/&gt; At the same time, consumption is higher in Canada, with about 12 prescriptions being filled per person each year in Canada and 10.6 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Valérie Paris and Elizabeth Docteur. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/21/40/37868186.pdf Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Policies in Canada] OECD Health Working Papers pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference is that patented drug prices in Canada average between 35% and 45% lower than in the United States, though generic prices are higher.&lt;ref&gt;Valérie Paris and Elizabeth Docteur. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/21/40/37868186.pdf Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Policies in Canada] OECD Health Working Papers pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The price differential for brand-name drugs between the two countries has led Americans to purchase upward of $1 billion US in drugs per year from Canadian pharmacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morgan, Steven |author2=Hurley, Jeremiah |date=2004-03-16 |title=Internet pharmacy: prices on the up-and-up |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=170 |issue=6 |pages=945–946 |pmid=15023915 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.104001 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/170/6/945?etoc |accessdate= 2007-07-11 |pmc = 359422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several reasons for the disparity. The Canadian system takes advantage of centralized buying by the provincial governments that have more market heft and buy in bulk, lowering prices. By contrast, the U.S. has explicit laws that prohibit [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or [[Medicaid]] from negotiating drug prices. In addition, price negotiations by Canadian health insurers are based on evaluations of the clinical effectiveness of prescription drugs,&lt;ref name="AARP"&gt;Gross, David.

Retrieved on February 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the relative prices of therapeutically similar drugs to be considered in context. The Canadian Patented Medicine Prices Review Board also has the authority to set a fair and reasonable price on patented products, either comparing it to similar drugs already on the market, or by taking the average price in seven developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmprb-cepmb.gc.ca/english/view.asp?x=654&amp;mid=589 |title=Compendium of Guidelines, Policies and Procedures.

The pharmaceutical industry is important in both countries, though both are net importers of drugs. Both countries spend about the same amount of their GDP on pharmaceutical research, about 0.1% annually&lt;ref&gt;Valérie Paris and Elizabeth Docteur.

===Technology===
The United States spends more on technology than Canada. In a 2004 study on medical imaging in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_13jan2005_e "CIHI report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925190007/http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_13jan2005_e |date=September 25, 2009 }} ''Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004.''&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that Canada had 4.6 [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanners per million population while the U.S. had 19.5 per million.  Canada's 10.3 [[computerized tomography|CT scanners]] per million also ranked behind the U.S., which had 29.5 per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_13jan2005_e |title=Press release: CIHI Report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade |publisher=Secure.cihi.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925190007/http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_13jan2005_e |archivedate=September 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study did not attempt to assess whether the difference in the number of MRI and CT scanners had any effect on the medical outcomes or were a result of overcapacity but did observe that MRI scanners are used more intensively in Canada than either the U.S. or Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_328_E&amp;cw_topic=328&amp;cw_rel=AR_1043_E#full Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516185154/http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_328_E&amp;cw_topic=328&amp;cw_rel=AR_1043_E#full |date=May 16, 2007 }}. {{ISBN|1-55392-515-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This disparity in the availability of technology, some believe, results in longer wait times. In 1984 wait times of up to 22 months for an [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] were alleged in Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/170/5/776-a |title=Saskatchewan's 22-month wait for an MRI is "almost criminal" says radiologists' association – Ehman 170 (5): 776 – Canadian Medical Association Journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.1040237 |publisher=Cmaj.ca |date=2004-03-02 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to more recent official statistics (2007), all emergency patients receive MRIs within 24 hours, those classified as urgent receive them in under 3 weeks and the maximum elective wait time is 19 weeks in Regina and 26 weeks in Saskatoon, the province's two largest metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.sk.ca/adx/aspx/adxGetMedia.aspx?mediaId=185&amp;PN=Shared&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Health Council of Canada's 2010 report "Decisions, Decisions: Family doctors as gatekeepers to prescription drugs and diagnostic imaging in Canada", the Canadian federal government invested $3 billion over 5 years (2000–2005) in relation to diagnostic imaging and agreed to invest a further $2 billion to reduce wait times.  These investments led to an increase in the number of scanners across Canada as well as the number of exams being performed.  The number of CT scanners increased from 198 to 465 and MRI scanners increased from 19 to 266 (more than tenfold) between 1990 and 2009. Similarly, the number of CT exams increased by 58% and MRI exams increased by 100% between 2003 and 2009. In comparison to other OECD countries, including the US, Canada's rates of MRI and CT exams falls somewhere in the middle.  Nevertheless, the Canadian Association of Radiologists claims that as many as 30% of diagnostic imaging scans are inappropriate and contribute no useful information.&lt;ref name=HCC_Decisions2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Decisions,Decisions: Family Doctors as Gatekeepers to Prescription Drugs and Diagnostic Imaging in Canada|url=http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=shop.flypage&amp;product_id=116&amp;category_id=20&amp;manufacturer_id=0&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=170|publisher=Health Council of Canada|accessdate=August 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827055714/http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=shop.flypage&amp;product_id=116&amp;category_id=20&amp;manufacturer_id=0&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=170|archivedate=August 27, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malpractice litigation===

The extra cost of [[malpractice]] lawsuits is a proportion of health spending in both the U.S. (1.7% in 2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Limiting Tort Liability for Medical Malpractice | year=2005 |url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4968&amp;type=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada (0.27% in 2001 or $237 million). In Canada the total cost of settlements, legal fees, and insurance comes to $4 per person each year,&lt;ref name="pmid16136632"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson GF, Hussey PS, Frogner BK, Waters HR |title=Health spending in the United States and the rest of the industrialized world |journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope) |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=903–14 |year=2004 |pmid=16136632 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.4.903 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/4/903.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the United States it is over $16. Average payouts to American plaintiffs were $265,103, while payouts to Canadian plaintiffs were somewhat higher, averaging $309,417.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=27348 |title=USA Spends More Per Capita on Health Care Than Other Nations, Study Finds |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130055246/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=27348 |archivedate=November 30, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, malpractice suits are far more common in the U.S., with 350% more suits filed each year per person.&lt;ref name="pmid16136632"/&gt; While malpractice costs are significantly higher in the U.S., they make up only a small proportion of total medical spending. The total cost of defending and settling malpractice lawsuits in the U.S. in 2004 was over $28 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Tort Costs and Cross-Border Perspectives: 2005 Update | year=2005 |url=https://www.towersperrin.com/tillinghast/publications/reports/2005_Tort_Cost/2005_Tort.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that [[defensive medicine]] consumes up to 9% of American healthcare expenses.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jec.senate.gov/Documents/Hearings/mcclellantestimony28april2005.pdf Testimony of Mark McClellan, MD, PhD, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services], before the Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Malpractice Liability Reform, April 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Daniel P.

===Ancillary expenses===
There are a number of ancillary costs that are higher in the U.S. Administrative costs are significantly higher in the U.S.; government mandates on record keeping and the diversity of insurers, plans and administrative layers involved in every transaction result in greater administrative effort. One recent study comparing administrative costs in the two countries found that these costs in the U.S. are roughly double what they are in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steffie |last=Woolhandler, M.D., M.P.H. |first2=Terry |last2=Campbell, M.H.A. |first3=David U. |last3=Himmelstein, M.D.  |date=August 2003 |title=Costs of Health Care Administration in the United States and Canada

These costs are higher in the U.S., contributing to higher overall costs in that nation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Healthcare outcomes==
In the [[WHO's ranking of health care systems|World Health Organization's rankings of healthcare system performance]] among 191 member nations published in 2000, Canada ranked 30th and the U.S. 37th, while the overall health of Canadians was ranked 35th and Americans 72nd.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html |title=The World Health Organization's ranking of the world's health systems |publisher=Photius.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the WHO's methodologies, which attempted to measure how efficiently health systems translate expenditure into health, generated broad debate and criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Deber, Raisa, [http://www.longwoods.com/product.php?productid=17238&amp;cat=367&amp;page=1 "Why Did the World Health Organization Rate Canada's Health System as 30th? Some Thoughts on League Tables"], Longwoods Review 2 (1). Retrieved on 2008-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers caution against inferring healthcare quality from some health statistics.  June O'Neill and Dave O'Neill point out that "... life expectancy and infant mortality are both poor measures of the efficacy of a health care system because they are influenced by many factors that are unrelated to the quality and accessibility of medical care".&lt;ref name="NBER 2007" /&gt;

In 2007, Gordon H. Guyatt et al. conducted a meta-analysis, or systematic review, of all studies that compared health outcomes for similar conditions in Canada and the U.S., in ''Open Medicine'', an open-access peer-reviewed Canadian medical journal. They concluded, "Available studies suggest that health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent." Guyatt identified 38 studies addressing conditions including cancer, coronary artery disease, chronic medical illnesses and surgical procedures. Of 10 studies with the strongest statistical validity, 5 favoured Canada, 2 favoured the United States, and 3 were equivalent or mixed. Of 28 weaker studies, 9 favoured Canada, 3 favoured the United States, and 16 were equivalent or mixed. Overall, results for mortality favoured Canada with a 5% advantage, but the results were weak and varied. The only consistent pattern was that Canadian patients fared better in kidney failure.&lt;ref name="Open Medicine" /&gt;

In terms of population health, [[life expectancy]] in 2006 was about two and a half years longer in Canada, with Canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and Americans 77.5 years.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/get_file.php3/id/25/file/OECDInFigures2006-2007.pdf |title=OECD in Figures 2006–2007 |accessdate=2007-06-21 |format=PDF |work=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S.&lt;ref name="OECD" /&gt; Some comparisons suggest that the American system underperforms Canada's system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=482678 |title=Commonwealth Fund Study |publisher=Commonwealthfund.org |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000" /&gt;  The WHO did not merely consider health care outcomes, but also placed heavy emphasis on the health disparities between rich and poor, funding for the health care needs of the poor, and the extent to which a country was reaching the potential health care outcomes they believed were possible for that nation. In an international comparison of 21 more specific quality indicators conducted by the Commonwealth Fund International Working Group on Quality Indicators, the results were more divided. One of the indicators was a tie, and in 3 others, data was unavailable from one country or the other. Canada performed better on 11 indicators; such as survival rates for colorectal cancer, [[childhood leukemia]], and kidney and liver transplants. The U.S. performed better on 6 indicators, including survival rates for breast and cervical cancer, and avoidance of childhood diseases such as pertussis and measles.  It should be noted that the 21 indicators were distilled from a starting list of 1000.  The authors state that, "It is an opportunistic list, rather than a comprehensive list."&lt;ref name="pmid15160806"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hussey PS, Anderson GF, Osborn R |title=How does the quality of care compare in five countries? |journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope) |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=89–99 |year=2004 |pmid=15160806 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.23.3.89 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the difference in outcomes may also be related to lifestyle choices. The OECD found that Americans have slightly higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption than do Canadians&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; as well as significantly higher rates of [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/82-620-MIE/2005001/articles/adults/aobesity.htm#5 |title=Adult obesity in Canada: Measured height and weight |publisher=Statcan.ca |date=2008-11-16 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012011617/http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/82-620-MIE/2005001/articles/adults/aobesity.htm#5 |archivedate=October 12, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A joint US-Canadian study found slightly higher smoking rates among Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhis/jcush_mainpage.htm The Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health (JCUSH).] CDC – National Center for Health Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that Americans have higher rates not only of obesity, but also of other health risk factors and chronic conditions, including physical inactivity, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;ref name="Lasser et al." /&gt;

While a Canadian [[systematic review]] stated that the differences in the systems of Canada and the United States could not alone explain differences in healthcare outcomes,&lt;ref name="Szick"/&gt; the study didn't consider that over 44,000 Americans die every year due to not having a single payer system for healthcare in the United States and it didn't consider the millions more that live without proper medical care due to a lack of insurance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and Canada have different racial makeups, different obesity rates and different alcoholism rates, which would likely cause the US to have a shorter average life expectancy and higher infant mortality even with equal healthcare provided. The US population is 12.2% African Americans and 16.3% Hispanic Americans (2010 Census), whereas Canada has only 2.5% African Canadians and 0.97% Hispanic Canadians (2006 Census). African Americans have higher mortality rates than any other racial or ethnic group for eight of the top ten causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hummer|first=RA,|author2=Ellison CG|author3=Rogers RG|author4=Moulton BE|author5=Romero RR|title=Religious involvement and adult mortality in the United States: review and perspective|journal=Southern Medical Journal|date=December 2004|volume=97|issue=12|pages=1223–30|pmid=15646761|doi=10.1097/01.SMJ.0000146547.03382.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cancer incidence rate among African Americans is 10% higher than among European Americans.&lt;ref name=Disparities&gt;American Public Health Association (APHA), Eliminating Health Disparities: Toolkit (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. Latinos have higher rates of death from diabetes, liver disease, and infectious diseases than do non-Latinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Vega WA, Amaro H |title=Latino outlook: good health, uncertain prognosis |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=15 |pages=39–67 |year=1994 |pmid=8054092 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pu.15.050194.000351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adult African Americans and Latinos have approximately twice the risk as European Americans of developing diabetes.&lt;ref name="Disparities"/&gt;  The infant mortality rates for African Americans is twice that of whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rawlings JS, Weir MR |title=Race- and rank-specific infant mortality in a US military population |journal=American Journal of Diseases of Children |volume=146 |issue=3 |pages=313–6 |date=March 1992 |pmid=1543178 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.1992.02160150053020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, directly comparing infant mortality rates between countries is difficult, as countries have different definitions of what qualifies as an infant death.

Another issue with comparing the two systems is the baseline health of the patient's for which the systems must treat. Canada has only half the obesity rate that the US system must deal with (14.3% vs 30.6%).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Bmi30chart.png]]&lt;/ref&gt;  On average, obesity reduces life expectancy by 6–7 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peeters A, Barendregt JJ, Willekens F, Mackenbach JP, Al Mamun A, Bonneux L |title=Obesity in adulthood and its consequences for life expectancy: A life-table analysis |journal=Ann.

A 2004 study found that Canada had a slightly higher mortality rate for [[acute myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) because of the more conservative Canadian approach to revascularizing (opening) coronary arteries.&lt;ref name="pmid15381645"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaul P, Armstrong PW, Chang WC |title=Long-term mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the United States and Canada: comparison of patients enrolled in Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO)-I |journal=Circulation |volume=110 |issue=13 |pages=1754–60 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15381645 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000142671.06167.91 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
Numerous studies have attempted to compare the rates of cancer incidence and mortality in Canada and the U.S., with varying results. Doctors who study cancer epidemiology warn that the diagnosis of cancer is subjective, and the ''reported'' incidence of a cancer will rise if screening is more aggressive, even if the ''real'' cancer incidence is the same.  Statistics from different sources may not be compatible if they were collected in different ways.  The proper interpretation of cancer statistics has been an important issue for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dickman PW, Adami HO |title=Interpreting trends in cancer patient survival |journal=Journal of Internal Medicine |volume=260 |issue=2 |pages=103–17 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16882274 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2796.2006.01677.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Barry Kramer of the [[National Institutes of Health]] points to the fact that cancer incidence rose sharply over the past few decades as screening became more common.  He attributes the rise to increased detection of benign early stage cancers that pose little risk of metastasizing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/health/10skin.html Doctors Balk at Cancer Ad, Citing Lack of Evidence] By CHRISTIE ASCHWANDEN, New York Times, July 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, though patients who were treated for these benign cancers were at little risk, they often have trouble finding health insurance after the fact.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Cancer survival time increases with later years of diagnosis, because cancer treatment improves, so cancer survival statistics can only be compared for cohorts in the same diagnosis year. For example, as doctors in British Columbia adopted new treatments, survival time for patients with metastatic breast cancer increased from 438 days for those diagnosed in 1991–1992, to 667 days for those diagnosed in 1999–2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chia SK, Speers CH, D'yachkova Y |title=The impact of new chemotherapeutic and hormone agents on survival in a population-based cohort of women with metastatic breast cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=973–9 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17647245 |doi=10.1002/cncr.22867 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An assessment by [[Health Canada]] found that cancer mortality rates are almost identical in the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;"Progress Report on Cancer Control in Canada." ''Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control'', 2004 pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Another international comparison by the National Cancer Institute of Canada indicated that incidence rates for most, but not all, cancers were higher in the U.S. than in Canada during the period studied (1993–1997). Incidence rates for certain types, such as colorectal and stomach cancer, were actually higher in Canada than in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncic.cancer.ca/ncic/internet/standard/0,3621,84658243_85787780_379601028_langId-en,00.html |title=International variation in cancer incidence |accessdate=2007-07-02 |work=National Cancer Institute of Canada |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403064200/http://www.ncic.cancer.ca/ncic/internet/standard/0%2C3621%2C84658243_85787780_379601028_langId-en%2C00.html |archivedate=April 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, researchers published a study comparing health outcomes in the Anglo countries. Their analysis indicates that Canada has greater survival rates for both colorectal cancer and childhood leukemia, while the United States has greater survival rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as breast and cervical cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid15160806"/&gt;

A study based on data from 1978 through 1986 found very similar survival rates in both the United States and in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keller | first = D M |author2=E A Peterson |author3=G Silberman  |date=July 1997 | title = Survival rates for four forms of cancer in the United States and Ontario | journal = Am J Public Health | volume = 87 | issue = 7 | pages = 1164–1167 | pmid = 9240107 | doi =  10.2105/AJPH.87.7.1164| url = | pmc = 1380891  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a study based on data from 1993 through 1997 found lower cancer survival rates among Canadians than among Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Chen VW, Howe HL, Wu XC, Hotes JL, Correa CN (eds).

A few comparative studies have found that cancer survival rates vary more widely among different populations in the U.S. than they do in Canada. Mackillop and colleagues compared cancer survival rates in Ontario and the U.S. They found that cancer survival was more strongly correlated with socio-economic class in the U.S. than in Ontario. Furthermore, they found that the American survival advantage in the four highest quintiles was statistically significant. They strongly suspected that the difference due to prostate cancer was a result of greater detection of asymptomatic cases in the U.S.  Their data indicates that neglecting the prostate cancer data reduces the American advantage in the four highest quintiles and gives Canada a statistically significant advantage in the lowest quintile.  Similarly, they believe differences in screening mammography may explain part of the American advantage in breast cancer.  Exclusion of breast and prostate cancer data results in very similar survival rates for both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyd C, Zhang-Salomons JY, Groome PA, Mackillop WJ |title=Associations between community income and cancer survival in Ontario, Canada, and the United States |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=2244–55 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10561282 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10561282 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804151849/http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10561282 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hsing et al. found that prostate cancer mortality incidence rate ratios were lower among U.S. whites than among any of the nationalities included in their study, including Canadians. U.S. African Americans in the study had lower rates than any group except for Canadians and U.S. whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hsing AW, Tsao L, Devesa SS |title=International trends and patterns of prostate cancer incidence and mortality |journal=International Journal of Cancer |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=60–7 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10585584 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000101)85:1&lt;60::AID-IJC11&gt;3.0.CO;2-B |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing the concerns of Dr. Kramer and Professor Mackillop, Hsing later wrote that reported prostate cancer incidence depends on screening. Among whites in the U.S., the death rate for prostate cancer remained constant, even though the incidence increased, so the additional reported prostate cancers did not represent an increase in real prostate cancers, said Hsing. Similarly, the death rates from prostate cancer in the U.S. increased during the 1980s and peaked in early 1990. This is at least partially due to "attribution bias" on death certificates, where doctors are more likely to ascribe a death to prostate cancer than to other diseases that affected the patient, because of greater awareness of prostate cancer or other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hsing AW, Devesa SS |title=Trends and patterns of prostate cancer: what do they suggest? |journal=Epidemiologic Reviews |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=3–13 |year=2001 |pmid=11588851 |url=http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11588851 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a000792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because health status is "considerably affected" by socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, such as level of education and income, "the value of comparisons in isolating the impact of the healthcare system on outcomes is limited," according to health care analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herzlinger RE, Parsa-Parsi R |title=Consumer-driven health care: lessons from Switzerland |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=292 |issue=10 |pages=1213–20 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15353534 |doi=10.1001/jama.292.10.1213 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts say that the incidence and mortality rates of cancer cannot be combined to calculate survival from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, B.C.

===Racial and ethnic differences===
The U.S. and Canada differ substantially in their demographics, and these differences may contribute to differences in health outcomes between the two nations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh GK, Yu SM |title=Infant mortality in the United States: trends, differentials, and projections, 1950 through 2010 |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=957–64 |date=July 1995 |pmid=7604920 |pmc=1615523 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.85.7.957|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7604920}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although both countries have white majorities, Canada has a proportionately larger immigrant minority population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the relative size of different ethnic and racial groups vary widely in each country. [[Hispanics]] and peoples of African descent constitute a much larger proportion of the U.S. population.  Non-Hispanic [[First Nations|North American aboriginal]] peoples constitute a much larger proportion of the Canadian population.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Canada also has a proportionally larger [[South Asian]] and [[East Asian]] population.  Also, the proportion of each population that is immigrant is higher in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

A study comparing aboriginal mortality rates in Canada, the U.S. and New Zealand found that aboriginals in all three countries had greater mortality rates and shorter life expectancies than the white majorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Trovato F |title=Aboriginal mortality in Canada, the United States and New Zealand |journal=Journal of biosocial science |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=67–86 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11316396 |doi= 10.1017/S0021932001000670|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That study also found that aboriginals in Canada had both shorter life expectancies and greater infant mortality rates than aboriginals in the United States and New Zealand.  The health outcome differences between aboriginals and whites in Canada was also larger than in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Though few studies have been published concerning the health of [[Black Canadians]], [[race and health in the United States|health disparities between whites and African Americans]] in the U.S. have received intense scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, C.A., Williams, D.R., Segregation and Mortality: The Deadly Effects of Racism? Sociological Forum, 14, 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  African Americans in the U.S. have significantly greater rates of cancer incidence and mortality.  Drs. Singh and Yu found that neonatal and postnatal mortality rates for American African Americans are more than double the non-Hispanic white rate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  This difference persisted even after controlling for household income and was greatest in the highest income quintile.  A Canadian study also found differences in neonatal mortality between different racial and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, J.E., Mitton,, C., Sankaran, K., Lee, S. K., Canadian Neonatal Network, Ethnic Differences in Risk Factors for Neonatal Morality and Morbidity in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, J. Perin., 2007, 27, 448–452.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Canadians of African descent had a greater mortality rate than whites in that study, the rate was somewhat less than double the white rate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The racially heterogeneous Hispanic population in the U.S. has also been the subject of several studies.  Although members of this group are significantly more likely to live in poverty than are non-Hispanic whites, they often have disease rates that are comparable to or better than the non-Hispanic white majority.  Hispanics have lower cancer incidence and mortality, lower infant mortality, and lower rates of neural tube defects.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/uscs |title=U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feuchtbaum LB, Currier RJ, Riggle S, Roberson M, Lorey FW, Cunningham GC |title=Neural tube defect prevalence in California (1990–1994): eliciting patterns by type of defect and maternal race/ethnicity |journal=Genetic testing |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=265–72 |year=1999 |pmid=10495925 |doi=10.1089/109065799316572 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh and Yu found that infant mortality among Hispanic sub-groups varied with the racial composition of that group.  The mostly white Cuban population had a neonatal mortality rate (NMR)  nearly identical to that found in non-Hispanic whites and a postnatal mortality rate (PMR) that was somewhat lower.  The largely [[Mestizo]], Mexican, Central, and South American Hispanic populations had somewhat lower NMR and PMR. The [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]] who have a mix of white and African ancestry had higher NMR and PMR rates.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Flexibility==
In Canada, increasing demands for healthcare, due to the [[population aging|aging population]], must be met by either increasing taxes or reducing other government programs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In the United States, under the current system, more of the burden will be taken up by the private sector and individuals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Since 1998, Canada's successive multibillion-dollar budget surpluses have allowed a significant injection of new funding to the healthcare system, with the stated goal of reducing waiting times for treatment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  However, this may be hampered by the return to deficit spending as of the [[2009 Canadian federal budget]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Canada====
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
In Canada, the right-wing and now defunct [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] and its successor, the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] considered increasing the role of the private sector in the Canadian system.  Public backlash caused these plans to be abandoned, and the Conservative government that followed re-affirmed its commitment to universal public medicine.

In Canada, it was [[Alberta]] under the Conservative government that had experimented most with increasing the role of the private sector in healthcare. Measures included the introduction of private clinics allowed to bill patients for some of the cost of a procedure, as well as 'boutique' clinics offering tailored personal care for a fixed preliminary annual fee.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. election]] healthcare proved to be an important issue to some voters, though not a primary one.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 2006, [[Massachusetts]] adopted a [[Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute|plan]] that vastly reduced the number of uninsured making it the state with the lowest percentage of non-insured residents in the union. It requires everyone to buy insurance and subsidizes insurance costs for lower income people on a sliding scale. Some{{Who|date=November 2010}} have claimed that the state's program is unaffordable, which the state itself says is "a commonly repeated myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mahealthconnector.org/portal/binary/com.epicentric.contentmanagement.servlet.ContentDeliveryServlet/Health%2520Care%2520Reform/Overview/Connector%2520Progress%2520Report%252009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227065451/https://www.mahealthconnector.org/portal/binary/com.epicentric.contentmanagement.servlet.ContentDeliveryServlet/Health%20Care%20Reform/Overview/Connector%20Progress%20Report%2009.pdf |archivedate=December 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, in a minor amendment, the plan did eliminate dental, hospice and skilled nursing care for certain categories of noncitizens covering 30,000 people (victims of human trafficking and domestic violence, applicants for asylum and refugees) who do pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/22/AR2009102204684.html |title=In Massachusetts, Obama won't promote state's health-care plan |author=Ceci Connolly |date=2009-10-23 |work= Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/proposed_cuts_in_massachusetts.html |title=Proposed cuts in Massachusetts budget threatens health coverage for thousands under new insurance plan |publisher=masslive.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private care===
The Canada Health Act of 1984 "does not directly bar private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services," but provides financial disincentives for doing so. "Although there are laws prohibiting or curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed," according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steinbrook R |title=Private health care in Canada |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=354 |issue=16 |pages=1661–4 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16625005 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp068064 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments attempt to control health care costs by being the sole purchasers and thus they do not allow private patients to bid up prices. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Those with non-emergency illnesses such as cancer cannot pay out of pocket for time-sensitive surgeries and must wait their turn on waiting lists. According to the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] in its 2005 ruling in ''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)|Chaoulli v.

===Consumer-driven healthcare===
In the United States, Congress has enacted laws to promote [[consumer-driven healthcare]] with [[health savings account]]s (HSAs), which were created by the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare bill]] signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on December 8, 2003. HSAs are designed to provide [[tax incentives]] for individuals to save for future qualified medical and retiree health expenses.  Money placed in such accounts is tax-free. To qualify for HSAs, individuals must carry a [[high-deductible health plan]] (HDHP). The higher [[deductible]] shifts some of the financial responsibility for health care from insurance providers to the consumer. This shift towards a market-based system with greater individual responsibility increased the differences between the US and Canadian systems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Some economists who have studied proposals for universal healthcare worry that the consumer driven healthcare movement will reduce the social redistributive effects of insurance that pools high-risk and low-risk people together. This concern was one of the driving factors behind a provision of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], informally known as ''Obamacare'', which limited the types of purchases which could be made with HSA funds. For example, as of January 1, 2011, these funds can no longer be used to buy [[over-the-counter drug]]s without a [[medical prescription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |author-link=Malcolm Gladwell |date=2005-08-29 |title=The Moral Hazard Myth |periodical=[[The New Yorker]] |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2005/2005_08_29_a_hazard.html |accessdate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630194634/http://www.gladwell.com/2005/2005_08_29_a_hazard.html |archivedate=June 30, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Condom fatigue''' is a term used by medical professionals and [[safer sex]] educators to refer to the phenomenon of decreased condom use. It can also be used to describe a general weariness of and decreased effectiveness of safer sex messages. This is sometimes called "prevention fatigue".

The term has particularly been used to describe [[men who have sex with men]], though the term applies to people of all [[gender]]s and [[sexual orientation]]s.  Condom fatigue has been partially blamed for an increase in [[HIV]] infection rates, though this has not been substantiated in any study.

Condom fatigue is not a universal phenomenon. In Germany, condom use between new sexual partners has increased between 1994 and 2010 from 65% to 87%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bzga.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/hohes-schutzniveau-bei-hiv-aids-schutz-gegen-sexuell-uebertragbare-krankheiten-immer-wichtiger/|title=BZgA : Pressemitteilungen|first=Die Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche|last=Aufklärung|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
HIV infection is increasing at a rate of 12% annually among 13–24-year-old American men who have sex with men.&lt;ref name=HIVrising&gt;{{cite news

The increase may also be because of new treatments.&lt;ref name=HIVrising /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">'''Condoms, needles, and negotiation''', also known as the '''CNN approach''', is a [[harm reduction]] approach to reducing the rate of transmission of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s such as [[HIV/AIDS]] by:
* Providing [[condom]]s and teaching [[negotiation]] of [[safer sex]] with partners
* Providing clean needles to reduce transmission from [[drug injection|injection drug use]]

In contrast with the [[abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]], or "ABC" approach to this problem, the "CNN" approach aims primarily at reducing the rate of transmission among high-risk groups such as women in areas where women have low levels of social power, prostitutes and their clients, and intravenous drug users.

==Criticisms==
Pope [[Benedict XVI]] has strongly criticized reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that "it is a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1012144/Condoms-'not-the-answer-to-AIDS':-Pope Condoms 'not the answer to AIDS': Pope]&lt;/ref&gt; This position has been widely criticised for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections.&lt;ref&gt;The papal position on condoms and HIV. Douglas Kamerow, BMJ 2009 338: b1217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roehr, B. (2009). Pope claims that condoms exacerbate HIV and AIDS problem. Published 25 March 2009, {{doi|10.1136/bmj.b1206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, including the Director of Harvard University's AIDS Prevention Research Project, have supported the Pope's position.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5987155.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1049">'''Debug Project''' is an ongoing project by [[Alphabet Inc.]] subsidiary Verily in [[California]] to reduce the numbers of mosquitos in a given area through interruption of the reproductive cycle.  Through laboratory methods naturally-occurring bacteria [[Wolbachia]] infect healthy male [[mosquitos]] of the species [[Aedes aegypti]]. Subsequently these mosquitos are released into the wild with the intent to mate with female mosquitos and by virtue of the Wolbachia infection lay non-producing eggs.  It is believed that through this process the overall population of mosquitos will be reduced by interrupting the reproductive cycle.  The hope is that if successful, these might be released in more endemic areas of the world where mosquitos pose a health risk through the diseases they carry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Stop Bad Bugs With Good Bugs|url=https://debug.com/|website=De Bug Project|publisher=Verily Life Sciences LLC|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent edition is the [https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans]. The nominal purpose of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans is to help [[health professionals]] and policymakers to advise Americans about healthy choices for their [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. Although the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are purported to be based on a systematic review of the current body of nutrition science, the Advisory Committee tasked with formulating the plan for retrieval and analysis of the scientific evidence for the current edition of the DGA used a less than rigorous process for assessing the health effects of consumption of saturated fat and salt and for assessing the health effects of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. This less than rigorous review of the nutrition science literature resulted in omission of multiple large, high-quality, clinical trials and also omission of some high-quality prospective observational studies. Some Advisory Committee members also had conflicts-of-interest&lt;ref&gt;Garduno-Diaz, Sara Diana, Brooke Aksnes, and Maria Alvim Leite.

==History==
{{Main|History of USDA nutrition guides}}
The efforts of the [[US Federal Government]] to establish a scientific basis for [[human nutrition]] began with [[Wilbur Olin Atwater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/timeline/nutrition/|title=nutrition : USDA ARS|website=Ars.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published the first dietary recommendations for Americans in 1894, notably stating that, "We live not upon what we eat, but upon what we digest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/hist/oes_1894_farm_bul_23.pdf |title=Farmer's Bulletin |last=Arwater |first=W |date=1894 |website=Ars.usda.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans has been published every 5 years beginning in 1980, producing eight guidelines to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/history.htm|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans - History|website=Health.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; One consistent recommendation of these eight guidelines has been that Americans reduce their dietary consumption of fat and animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs and to increase their dietary consumption of carbohydrates and plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, and grains.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. Dietary guidelines for Americans, 1980 TO 2000. www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/1980_2000_chart.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Guidelines were established so as to provide dietary advice that would improve the health of Americans and reduce their risk for [[chronic conditions]], such as [[cancer]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[hypertension]], [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], and [[renal disease]]. The Dietary Guidelines have the purpose of guiding the development of Federal policies and programs related to food, nutrition, and health.  The guidelines influence and guide policymakers for Federally-financed food and dietary education programs. They also influence clinicians in the United States and in other countries.

The intended audience for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are policymakers, [[food science|nutrition scientists]], and [[dieticians]] and other [[health professionals]]. The Guidelines themselves are not intended to directly inform the general public, but instead to serve as an authoritative, evidence-based information source that policymakers and health professionals can use to advise Americans about making healthy choices in their daily lives so as to enjoy a healthy diet that also prevents chronic disease. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide an evidence-base that is used by the Federal government to develop nutrition education materials for Americans.

Federal law and regulation require that Federal government publications provide dietary guidance consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  For the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) the guidelines provide the scientific rationale for the [[National School Lunch Program]] and [[School Breakfast Program]], feeding 30 million children every school day, and the [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children]], which has 8 million beneficiaries. For the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] [[Administration on Aging]], the guidelines provide the rationale for the [[Older Americans Act]] Nutrition Services programs which include more than 5,000 community-based nutrition service providers (e.g., [[Meals on Wheels]]), serving more than 900,000 meals a day across the United States. The [[Department of Defense]] uses the guidelines as the rationale for meal rations for military personnel and the [[Department of Veterans Affairs]] uses the guidelines to inform nutrition education for veterans who are patients of the VA Hospital System. In addition to these governmental audiences, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are widely used by state and local governments, schools, commercial enterprises, community groups, the media, and the food industry to inform policy and program development intended to serve the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/introduction/dietary-guidelines-for-americans/|title=The Dietary Guidelines for Americans: What It Is, What It Is Not - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelineswebsite=Health.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current guidelines==
The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015-2020) were developed in three stages, beginning with a review of scientific evidence, followed by development of the guidelines, and finally with implementation of the guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/|title=2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines|website=Health.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to previous guidelines, the 2015–2020 guidelines put emphasize replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, particularly polyunsaturated fats, with the goal of preventing heart attack and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Dong D., and Frank B. Hu. "Dietary fat and risk of cardiovascular disease: recent controversies and advances." Annual review of nutrition 37 (2017): 423-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines provide a general recommendation that people follow a healthy eating pattern with appropriate calories, and that the evaluation of ones eating pattern accounts for all foods and beverages, including snacks. The recommended healthy eating pattern includes:

Include these in diet:
* A broad selection of vegetables, including dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starches (potatoes, rice, pasta, bread), and others
* An emphasis on whole fruits
* An emphasis on whole grains
* Dairy products that are either fat-free or low fat, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and fortified soy beverages
* Protein foods to include seafood, lean meats,  poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts, seeds, and soy products&lt;ref name="Food guide 2015"&gt;{{cite web |title=Executive Summary - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines |website=Health.gov |url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/executive-summary/ |accessdate=1 July 2018 |language=en |date=2015}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limit these in diet:
* Trans fats
* Saturated fats to less than 10% of calories
* Added sugars to less than 10% of calories
* Sodium to less than 2.3&amp;nbsp;mg/day (5.8 g of salt/day), including both added table salt and salt in foods
* If consumed, use alcohol in moderation and only for adults — up to 1 drink daily for women and 2 drinks daily for men.&lt;ref name="Food guide 2015"/&gt;

The Dietary Guidelines also include a key recommendation to meet the [[Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans]].&lt;ref name="Food guide 2015"/&gt;

The [[MyPlate]] initiative, based on the recommendations of the 2015 -2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and produced by the [[USDA]] [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]], is a nutrition education program directed at the general public, providing a guide to "finding healthy eating solutions to fit your lifestyle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.choosemyplate.gov/myplate-mywins|title=MyPlate, MyWins|date=12 December 2016|website=Choosemyplate.gov|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future guidelines==
The USDA has invited interested parties, including members of the general public, to participate and follow the development of the 2020 - 2025 edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Welcome to the portal for you to participate and follow the development of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;/ref&gt; As mandated by the [[Agriculture Act of 2014]], this next edition of the guidelines will cover the full life-span of Americans, as expansion of the guidelines are planned to include recommendations for pregnant women, infants, and children younger than 2 years old. The Trump Administration has proposed a budget of more than $12 million for the evaluation of scientific evidence, development of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and dissemination of the new edition to its target audience of policymakers, nutrition experts, and clinicians; this budget request has been supported by multiple organizations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eatrightpro.org/news-center/on-the-pulse-of-public-policy/from-the-hill/academy-supports-funding-2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-for-americans&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of the 2015 - 2020 Guidelines==
Each edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans has had attendant controversy, with objections particularly from scientists whose point-of-view was not reflected in the guidelines and from commercial interests negatively affected by the recommendations therein.&lt;ref&gt;Nestle M. Perspective: Challenges and Controversial Issues in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 1980–2015. Advances in Nutrition. 2018 Mar 1;9(2):148-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The response to the 2015-2020 guidelines was particularly contentious,&lt;ref&gt;Hite, Adele H., and Pamela Schoenfeld. "Open letter to the secretaries of the US Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services on the creation of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans." Nutrition 31, no. 5 (2015): 776-779.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in action by Congress mandating the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to evaluate the process used to update the DGA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/18/congress-we-need-to-review-the-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/|title=Congress: We need to review the Dietary Guidelines for Americans|first=Peter|last=Whoriskey|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=1 July 2018|website=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review by the National Academies resulted in two reports. The first report, entitled "Optimizing the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: The Selection Process", identified opportunities for improving the process for selecting members of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/reports/2017/optimizing-the-process-for-establishing-the-dietary-guidelines-for-americans-the-selection-process.aspx|title=Optimizing the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: The Selection Process : Health and Medicine Division|website=nationalacademies.org|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, 2018 the [[USDA]] issued an official response to the first report of the National Academies committee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/dietary_guidelines_for_americans/HMDRecommendations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The second report from National Academies of Sciences, entitled "Redesigning the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans", offers an exhaustive review and provides recommendations for improving the process of revising the Dietary Guidelines so as to best identify, analyze, and present the scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/24883/chapter/1#ix|title=Redesigning the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans|date=16 November 2017|website=Nap.edu|accessdate=1 July 2018|doi=10.17226/24883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodology===

One critic contends that the current guidelines do not promote the public interest and have been corrupted by [[regulatory capture]], advancing the commercial concerns of [[agribusiness]] and large food processors, and the political concerns of scientists intent on preserving their point-of-view.&lt;ref&gt;Paarlberg, Robert. "Governing the dietary transition: Linking agriculture, nutrition, and health." Edited by Shenggen Fan and Rajul Pandya-Lorch (2012): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic notes that the DGAs make recommendations that overvalue the findings of observational studies and surrogate measures of outcomes and that undervalue the findings of high-quality randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref name="Nissen, Steven E 2016"/&gt;

There is compelling evidence that [[food frequency questionnaires]] and other methods that rely on human memory do not accurately measure dietary intake.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward, Gregory Pavela, and Carl J. Lavie. "A discussion of the refutation of memory-based dietary assessment methods (M-BMs): the rhetorical defense of pseudoscientific and inadmissible evidence." In Mayo Clinic Proceedings, vol. 90, no. 12, pp. 1736-1739. Elsevier, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the validity of the methods used by the USDA to estimate per capita calorie consumption found that these methods lack validity and the authors of this study recommend that these methods not be used to inform public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward, Diana M. Thomas, Samantha M. McDonald, Gregory Pavela, Carl J. Lavie, James O. Hill, and Steven N. Blair. "The Validity of US Nutritional Surveillance: USDA’s Loss-Adjusted Food Availability Data Series 1971-2010." Current problems in cardiology 41, no. 11-12 (2016): 268-292.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic review found that only a few studies have measured the accuracy or reliability of dietary assessment methods in schoolchildren. The few studies that have been done found that schoolchildren did not accurately report foods consumed but that they did accurately report total calories consumed.&lt;ref&gt;Tugault-Lafleur, Claire N., Jennifer L. Black, and Susan I. Barr. "A Systematic Review of Methods to Assess Children's Diets in the School Context–." Advances in Nutrition 8, no. 1 (2017): 63-79.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Guidelines were based on the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/pdfs/scientific-report-of-the-2015-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee.pdf|format=PDF|title=Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidance Advisory Committee|website=Health.gov|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not rely on actual measurements of dietary intake but instead relied on memory-based dietary assessments, including interviews and surveys despite clear evidence that such methods markedly underestimate actual calorie consumption and nutrient intake.  Thus, the conclusions expressed in the Scientific Report have been criticized, and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are considered invalid by some experts, as the DGAs rely on invalid methods and draw conclusions that do not agree with the available scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward, Gregory Pavela, and Carl J. Lavie. "The inadmissibility of what we eat in America and NHANES dietary data in nutrition and obesity research and the scientific formulation of national dietary guidelines." In Mayo Clinic Proceedings, vol. 90, no. 7, pp. 911-926. Elsevier, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary Fat Restriction===
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans have been criticized for recommending a diet that is low in total fat, and for not adequately emphasizing the harmful effect of industrially-produced trans fats.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nita Forouhi|Forouhi, Nita G.]], Ronald M. Krauss, Gary Taubes, and Walter Willett. "Dietary fat and cardiometabolic health: evidence, controversies, and consensus for guidance." BMJ 361 (2018): k2139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teicholz, Nina. The big fat surprise: why butter, meat and cheese belong in a healthy diet. Simon and Schuster, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic review of 62,421 participants in 10 dietary trials found that reducing dietary fat intake had no effect on coronary heart disease and had no effect on overall mortality. The authors of this meta-analysis conclude that the available evidence from randomized controlled trials does not support the recommendation of the 2015 - 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans that people reduce their fat intake.&lt;ref&gt;Harcombe, Zoë, Julien S. Baker, James J. DiNicolantonio, Fergal Grace, and Bruce Davies. "Evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support current dietary fat guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis." Open Heart 3, no. 2 (2016): e000409.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary Salt Restriction===
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans have been criticized for recommending a diet that contains less than 2.3&amp;nbsp; grams of sodium (5.8 grams of salt/day). Notably, 95% of the world's populations have a mean intake of salt that is between 6 g and 12 g daily and evidence on the [[health effects of salt]] does not support such a severe restriction on salt intake. An analysis of dietary guidelines found that this recommendation for restriction of salt intake is not supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials nor is it supported by evidence from prospective observational studies. In fact, intake of less than 5.8 g of salt per day typically results in activation of the [[Renin–angiotensin system|renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system]], which leads to an increase in plasma lipids and increased mortality. The authors of this analysis suggest a redesign of the dietary guidelines for salt intake is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Graudal, Niels, and Gesche Jürgens. "Conflicting Evidence on Health Effects Associated with Salt Reduction Calls for a Redesign of the Salt Dietary Guidelines." Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A Committee of the National Academies [[Institute of Medicine]] evaluated the evidence about dietary salt intake and health. Overall, the committee found evidence that higher salt intake was associate with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the Committee also found that the evidence did not support the claim that lowering sodium intake in the general population to less than 2,300&amp;nbsp;mg/day was associated with a lower risk of death nor with a higher risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18311/sodium-intake-in-populations-assessment-of-evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcoholic Beverage Consumption===
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting alcoholic beverages consumption to no more than 1 drink daily for women and no more than 2 drinks daily for men. The 2015 - 2020 Scientific Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee asserts that most studies show that moderate consumption of alcohol has been shown to be part of a beneficial dietary pattern. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of scientific studies of alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality found that consumption of up to 2 alcoholic beverages per day had no net mortality benefit compared with lifetime abstention from alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, Tim, Jinhui Zhao, Sapna Panwar, Audra Roemer, Timothy Naimi, and Tanya Chikritzhs. "Do “moderate” drinkers have reduced mortality risk? A systematic review and meta-analysis of alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality." Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs 77, no. 2 (2016): 185-198.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease study found that consumption of ethanol increases the risk of cancer and increases the risk of all-cause mortality, and that the level of ethanol consumption that minimizes disease is zero consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= |title=Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 |journal=Lancet |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=August 2018 |pmid=30146330 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31310-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Guidelines recommend that people not mix alcohol and beverages containing caffeine, as this combined intake may result in greater alcohol consumption, with a greater risk of alcohol-related injury.

===Classification of honey and maple syrup as "Added sugars"===
Producers of honey and maple syrup have objected to the proposed Federal regulatory requirement that honey and maple syrup include the term "added sugar" on product labeling, despite the fact that no additional sugar is added to these products. This regulatory requirement follows from the recommendation in the 2015 - 2020 Guidelines that added sugars be limited to less than 10% of calories and that honey and maple syrup are themselves considered by federal regulators to be added sugars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-vermont-pure-outrage-over-pure-syrup-1530031226|title=In Vermont, Pure Outrage Over Pure Syrup|first=Betsy|last=McKay|date=26 June 2018|accessdate=1 July 2018|website=Wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stammel 5206.JPG|thumb|300px|''Dipsomania'', an 18th-century woodcarving by Josef Stammel in the library of [[Admont Abbey]].]]
'''Dipsomania''' is a historical term describing a medical condition involving an uncontrollable craving for [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. In the 19th century, the term dipsomania was used to refer to a variety of alcohol-related problems, most of which are known today as [[alcoholism]]. Dipsomania is occasionally still used to describe a particular condition of periodic, compulsive bouts of alcohol intake. The idea of dipsomania is important for its historical role in promoting a disease theory of chronic drunkenness. The word comes from Greek ''dipso'' ({{lang-el|"δίψα"}}= thirst) and ''mania''.

It is still mentioned in the WHO ICD-10 classification as an alternative description for Alcohol Dependence Syndrome, episodic use F10.26

==History==
The term was coined by the German physician [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]] in 1819, when, in a preface to an influential book by German-Russian doctor C. von Brühl-Cramer,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hasso Spode]]: Die Macht der Trunkenheit. Sozial- und Kulturgeschichte des Alkohols, Opladen 1993, pp. 125ff.&lt;/ref&gt; he translated Brühl-Cramer's term "''trunksucht''" as "dipsomania".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119222474/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 The history of alcoholism: Brühl-Cramer's concepts and observations - KIELHORN - 2006 - Addiction - Wiley Online Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the influence of Brühl-Cramer's pioneering work, dipsomania became popular in medical circles throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/54233 NLA record]&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Mariana Valverde describes dipsomania as "the most medical" of the many terms used to describe habitual drunkenness in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JkYyd4qmme0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=dipsomania+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqkL0Nbrrv&amp;sig=aIGzrvkXaWMAsdSyxfWet4Dt4YY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=G3n0SZiYE42clAeJ4sy3DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 Google book search]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with terms such as "inebriety", the idea of dipsomania was used as part of an effort of medical professionals and reformers to change attitudes about habitual drunkenness from being a criminally punishable vice to being a medically treatable disease.&lt;ref name="sagepub 5137"&gt;[http://sls.sagepub.com/cgi/pdf_extract/5/1/37 Extract at sagepub.com]&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Roy MacLeod wrote about this dipsomania reform movement, it "illuminates certain features of the gradual transformation taking place in national attitudes towards the prevention and cure of social illnesses during the last quarter of the 19th century."&lt;ref name="sagepub 5137" /&gt;

Although ''dipsomania'' was used in a variety of somewhat contradictory ways by different individuals, by the late 19th century the term was usually used to describe a periodic or acute condition, in contrast to chronic drunkenness.&lt;ref name="psych encyc"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/dipsomania Dipsomania entry] at Psychoanalysis Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1893 book ''Clinical Lessons on Mental Diseases: The Mental State of Dipsomania'', Magnan characterized dipsomania as a crisis lasting from one day to two weeks, and consisting of a rapid and huge ingestion of alcohol or whatever other strong, excitatory liquid was available.&lt;ref name="psych encyc" /&gt; Magnan further described dipsomania as solitary alcohol abuse, with loss of all other interests, and these crises recurred at indeterminate intervals, separated by periods when the subject was generally sober.&lt;ref name="psych encyc" /&gt;

Over time, the term dipsomania became less common, replaced by newer ideas and terms concerning chronic and acute drunkenness and alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tracy | first = Sarah | title = Alcoholism in America |pages=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkYyd4qmme0C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;q=dipsomania | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8018-8119-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''disability management program''', or '''DMP''', is used by employers to assist employees who are unable to work due to [[injury]] or [[illness]].  The DMP consists of several components, however not all DMPs have all possible components. Smaller programs may only include the basic components while larger programs generally have more components. The purpose of the DMP is to benefit the employer by returning experienced, trained employees to work quickly. The central distinction required to plan and operated a DMP is between the terms "impairment" and "[[disability]]".  Although [[physicians]] [[Diagnosis|diagnose]] and treat impairments, employers determine disability.

Disability management programs are applied in different ways. Their implementation depends on a nation´s social security system and disability policies.

== Germany ==

In Germany, rehabilitation and social participation for people with disabilities, or people at risk of developing a disability, are covered by Book IX of the Social Code since 2001. 
The focus of the legislation is on social and occupational participation in society and elimination of barriers in order to achieve equal opportunities. 
Book IX of the German Social Code aims at ensuring the (re)integration of people with disabilities into society and the labor market. 
The German disability management program, called “corporate integration management” (Betriebliches Eingliederungsmanagement), is covered by § 84 (2), Book IX, Social Code since 2004. 
This paragraph stresses the need for preventive measures in the workplace, as well as occupational rehabilitation, and addresses employers` responsibility in this area:

:"Employers, whose workers are unable to work for longer than 6 weeks during a year, are to analyze, how the inability to work can, if possible, be overcome and with what assistance inability to work can be prevented and the job retained. The employer, the employees’ representatives and the company physician are to resolve this matter together with the person in question. The introduction of disability management can be supported by premiums or subsidies.” (§ 84 (2) Book IX)

The '''Drug Abuse Warning Network''' ('''DAWN''') was a public health surveillance system in the United States that monitored drug-related visits to hospital [[emergency department]]s and drug-related deaths.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA_DAWN"&gt;{{Citation |author=SAMHSA |authorlink=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |year=2016 |title=Emergency Department Data |url=http://www.samhsa.gov/data/emergency-department-data-dawn |accessdate=2016-09-08 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAWN was discontinued in 2011,&lt;ref name="SAMHSA_DAWN"/&gt; but its creator, the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), continues to develop other sources of data on drug-related emergency visits.&lt;ref name="SAMHSA_DAWN"/&gt;

==Organization==
Hospitals participating in DAWN are non-federal, short-stay general hospitals that feature a 24-hour emergency department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1970-1975.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201035407/http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1970-1975.html |date=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients are never interviewed. All data are collected through a retrospective review of patient medical records and decedent case files. DAWN collects detailed drug data, including illegal drugs of abuse, prescription and over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, and non-pharmaceutical inhalants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/old_dawn/about/howdawn.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727012612/http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/old_dawn/about/howdawn.asp |date=July 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the DAWN cases are defined broadly, DAWN captures many different types of drug-related cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/tools/faqs.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224172352/https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/tools/faqs.asp |date=February 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole point of this organization is to find out how many people abuse most drugs.  They also seek short-stay hospitals, when a case is drug-related.

==History==
In 1974, DAWN was designed and developed by the scientific staff of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s Office of Science and Technology. It was jointly funded with the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1970-1975.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201035407/http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1970-1975.html |date=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DAWN then became a division of the [[United States Department of Justice]] before becoming part of NIDA in 1980.
On October 1, 1992, DAWN became part the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), an agency of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/publications/factsht/druguse/ |title=Office of National Drug Control Policy &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehousedrugpolicy.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAMHSA has contracted with [[Westat]], a private research corporation, to manage the New DAWN on the agency’s behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/about/whoweare.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704063106/https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/about/whoweare.asp |date=July 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Information collected by DAWN is widely cited by drug policy officials, who have sometimes confused drug-related episodes – [[emergency department]] visits induced by drugs – with drug mentions.  The [[Wisconsin]] Department of Justice claimed, "In Wisconsin, [[marijuana]] overdose visits in emergency rooms equal to [[heroin]] or [[morphine]], twice as common as Valium."  Common Sense for Drug Policy called this as a distortion, noting, "The federal DAWN report itself notes that reports of marijuana do not mean people are going to the hospital for a marijuana [[overdose]], it only means that people going to the hospital  mention marijuana as a drug they use".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugwardistortions.org/distortion6.htm |title=Emergency Room Visits |publisher=Drugwardistortions.org |date=2009-07-15 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This criticism is also not correct.  DAWN has recently clarified their use of the term "drug mention" in methodology because of this erroneous claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/collect/collect_qas.asp#2 |accessdate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527141322/https://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/collect/collect_qas.asp |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data is collected by a systematic and confidential review of patients' medical records.  Thus, for example, a patient who broke an arm while high on marijuana would not be included in the data.  A report released by DAWN in 2002 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugwatch.org/CEDARS/MarDeaths2002e.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523083917/http://www.drugwatch.org/CEDARS/MarDeaths2002e.pdf |date=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that marijuana overdose alone resulted in documented deaths in Atlanta and Boston, respectively.  However, there is no known record or evidence to support the existence of a case of human fatality by result of marijuana overdose.

It has been estimated that over 20% of adults suffer from some form of [[sleep deprivation]].&lt;ref name="Hublin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hublin | first1 = C | last2 = Kaprio | first2 = J | last3 = Partinen | first3 = M | last4 = Koskenvuo | first4 = M.  | year = 2001 | title = Insufficient sleep: a population-based study in adults | url = https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-pdf/24/4/392/13661692/sleep-24-4-392.pdf | journal = Sleep | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 392–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insomnia]] and sleep deprivation are common symptoms of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and can be an indication of other [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Diagnostic"&gt;Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV.

== Attention ==

=== Neural substrates ===
[[Image:Parietal lobe.gif|250px|left|alt=the Parietal lobe highlighted in human brain.|''[[Parietal lobe]]'']] 
The [[parietal lobe]]s of the brain are largely involved in [[attention]]. [[Lesion]]s to this region of the brain in humans result in difficulty or inability to attend to events that are [[contralateral]] to the lesioned [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]]. Those with lesions to the posterior parietal lobe have little to no difficulty shifting attention to and from [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] appearing in the space [[ipsilateral]] to the lesioned hemisphere. However, they do display a slowed response in shifting their focus of current attention to events and stimuli appearing contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = A. | last2 = Rafal | first2 = R. D. | year = 1991 | title = Attention and Feature Integration | url = | journal =  Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 106–110 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1991.tb00109.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies involving [[single-unit recording]]s from the parietal lobes of monkeys have indicated that there are [[neuron]]s solely involved in integrating visual spatial information with postural information. Without this apparent combining of spatial information, it would be difficult or impossible to locate objects in external space, as information provided solely by the [[retina]] is insufficient. The position of the eyes, head and body must also be taken into consideration.

In addition, studies involving [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] application over the parietal lobes as well as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) analysis of the parietal lobes suggest that this region is involved in conjunction searches, but not in single-feature searches.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, J. (2006). Space, Attention and the Parietal Lobes. The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. New York, NY: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Visual search]] for supplementary information.)

=== Auditory attention ===
[[Image:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|right|alt=This shows the primary auditory cortex and the surrounding regions it communicates with.|The [[Primary auditory cortex]] is highlighted in magenta, and has been known to interact with all areas highlighted on this neural map.]]
[[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]] attention has been examined following sleep deprivation. Researchers examined the auditory attention of twelve non-sleep-deprived subjects and twelve sleep-deprived subjects at various time intervals. Subjects were involved in an auditory attention task, which required the reproduction of the spatial relationships between four letters, using a graph composed of six squares, immediately following the presentation of an item from a tape recorder. It was found that auditory attention of sleep-deprived individuals is affected as the total amount of sleep-deprivation increases, possibly due to lowered perceptual vigilance.&lt;ref name="Linde"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linde | first1 = L. | last2 = Edland | first2 = A. | last3 = Bergstrom | first3 = M. | year = 1999 | title = Auditory attention and multiattribute decision-making during a 33-h sleep deprivation period: mean performance and between-subject dispersions | url = | journal = Ergonomics | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 696–713 | doi=10.1080/001401399185397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Divided attention ===

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) scans of the brains of subjects exposed to thirty-five hours of sleep deprivation indicate that sleep deprivation is related to increases in [[prefrontal cortex]] and parietal lobe activation during tasks that combine verbal learning and arithmetic. This is particularly apparent in the right hemisphere. In non sleep-deprived individuals involved in verbal learning and arithmetic tasks the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and the right prefrontal cortex are active. Following sleep deprivation there is increased activation of the left [[inferior frontal gyrus]] and the [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] parietal lobes. This information suggests that divided attention tasks require more attentional resources than normally required by a non sleep-deprived individual.&lt;ref name="Drummond"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Drummond | first1 = S. P. A. | last2 = Gillin | first2 = J. C. | last3 = Brown | first3 = G. G. | year = 2001 | title = Increased cerebral response during a divided attention task following sleep deprivation | url = | journal = European Sleep Research Society | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 85–92 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2869.2001.00245.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exogenous and endogenous attention ===

Studies utilizing [[event-related potential]] (ERP) recordings have found that twenty-four hours of sleep deprivation decreases ERP response to signal inputs from [[endogenous]], but not [[exogenous]], sources. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep deprivation affects endogenously driven selective attention to a greater extent than exogenously driven selected attention.&lt;ref name="Trujillo"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trujillo | first1 = L. T. | last2 = Kornguth | first2 = S. | last3 = Schnyer | first3 = D. M. | year = 2009 | title = An ERP examination of the different effects of sleep deprivation on exogenously cued and endogenously cued attention | url = https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/32/10/1285/2454430 | journal = Journal of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Research | volume = 32 | issue = 10| pages = 1285–1297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selective attention ===

Twenty-four hours of sleep deprivation has been found to affect the functional connectivity between the inferior frontal parietal region (IPS) and the [[parahippocampal place area]] (PPA). However, sleep deprivation does not affect the attention modulation index of the PPA. With this information, researchers have concluded that the [[psychophysiological]] interaction (PPI) is more involved in selective attention than the IPS and PPA.&lt;ref name="Chee"&gt;Chee, M. W. L., Tan, J. C., Parimal, S. &amp; Zagoradnov, V. (2009). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.493.2042&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Sleep deprivation and its effects on object-selective attention]. Neuroimage, 1-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has found that together, attention and sleep deprivation modulate the parahippocampal place area (PPA) activation and scene processing. Specifically, sleep deprivation was related to significant decreases in PPA activation while attending to scenes and when ignoring scenes. This is explained by the absence of change in the Attention Modulation Index (AMI). Face recognition is not affected by sleep deprivation.&lt;ref name="Chee"/&gt;

Sleep deprivation has been shown to negatively affect picture classification speed and accuracy, as well as [[recognition memory]].&lt;ref name="Chee"/&gt; It results in an inability to avoid attending to irrelevant information displayed during attention-related tasks. (Norton) It also decreases activation in the ventral visual area and the frontal parietal control regions.&lt;ref name="Chee"/&gt;

=== Supervisory attention ===

Studies involving sleep deprived subjects’ performance on choice reaction time tests, in which [[Reactive inhibition|response inhibition]], task shifting skill and task strategy were involved, have been conducted and analyzed. These three cognitive processes are involved and critical in tasks involving supervisory attention, which is defined as behaviour that arises through the selection and implementation of schemas.&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt; Following one night of total sleep deprivation, subjects showed no decline in task shifting or response inhibition performance. However, sleep deprivation does affect the ability to use preparatory bias to increase performance speed. It is suggested that the brain’s cognitive resources make an active effort to succeed in a challenging task when subjected to sleep deprivation, and that this deficit becomes apparent in tasks involving preparatory bias.&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jennings | first1 = J. R. | last2 = Monk | first2 = T. H. | last3 = der Molen | first3 = M. W. | year = 2003 | title = Sleep deprivation influences some but not all processes of supervisory attention | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 473–479 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.02456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visuospatial attention ===

Deficits in cognitive performance due to continuous sleep restriction are not well understood. However, there have been studies looking into physiological arousal of the sleep-deprived brain. Participants, whose total amount of sleep had been restricted by 33% throughout one week, were subjected to reaction time tests. The results of these tests were analyzed using quantitative [[EEG]] analysis. The results indicate that the frontal regions of the brain are first to be affected, whereas the parietal regions remain active until the effects of sleep deprivation become more severe, which occurred towards the end of the week. In addition, [[EEG]] and ERP analysis reveals that activation deficits are more apparent in the non-dominant hemisphere than in the dominant hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Cote"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cote | first1 = K. A. | last2 = Milner | first2 = C. E. | last3 = Osip | first3 = S. L. | last4 = Baker | first4 = M. L. | last5 = Cuthbert | first5 = B.

[[Image:Brain chrischan thalamus.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Diagram showing the Thalamus.| ''[[Thalamus]]''.]]
The effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance have been studied through the use of parametric visual attention tasks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of participants' brains who were involved in ball-tracking tasks of various difficulty levels were obtained. These images were taken during rested wakefulness and again after one night of sleep deprivation. The [[thalamus]] is more highly activated when accompanied by sleep deprivation than when the subject is in a state of rested wakefulness. Contrarily, the thalamus is more highly activated during difficult tasks accompanied by rested wakefulness, but not during a state of sleep deprivation. Researchers propose that the thalamic resources, which are normally activated during difficult tasks, are being activated in an attempt to maintain alertness during states of sleep deprivation. In addition, an increase in thalamic activation is related to a decrease in the parietal, prefrontal and [[cingulate cortex]] activation, resulting in the overall impairment of attentional networks, which are necessary for visuospatial attention performance.&lt;ref name="Tomasi"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tomasi | first1 = D. | last2 = Wang | first2 = R. L. | last3 = Telang | first3 = F. | last4 = Boronikolas | first4 = V. | last5 = Jayne | first5 = M. C. | last6 = Wang | first6 = G. J. | last7 = Fowler | first7 = J. S. | last8 = Volkow | first8 = N. D. | year = 2009 | title = Impairment of attentional networks after one night of sleep deprivation | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 233–240 | doi=10.1093/cercor/bhn073| pmc = 2638746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies indicate that the [[posterior cingulate]] (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex are involved in the anticipatory allocation of spatial attention. When sleep-deprived, PCC activity decreases, impairing selective attention. Subjects were exposed to an attention-shifting task involving spatially informative, misleading and uninformative cues preceding the stimuli. When sleep-deprived, subjects showed increased activation in the left [[intraparietal sulcus]]. This region is activated when exposed to stimuli in unexpected locations. These findings suggest that sleep-deprived individuals may be impaired in their ability to anticipate the locations of upcoming events. In addition, inability to avoid attending to irrelevant events may also be induced by sleep-deprivation.&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benjamin | first1 = R. G. | year = 2008 | title = Sleep deprivation alters functioning within the neural network underlying the covert orienting of attention | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2008.04.030 | journal = Brain Research | volume =  1217| issue = | pages = 148–156 | pmid=18511023 | pmc=2528837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, other studies have indicated that the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance, specifically, sustained visual attention, are more global and [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] in nature, as opposed to more lateralized deficit explanations. In a study utilizing the Choice Visual Perception Task, subjects were exposed to stimuli appearing in various locations in visual space. Results indicate that sleep deprivation results in a general decline in visual attention. It is also suggested that the sleep-deprived brain is able to maintain a certain level of cognitive performance during tasks requiring divided attention by recruiting additional cortical regions that are not normally used for such tasks.&lt;ref name="Kendall"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kendall | first1 = A. P. | last2 = Kautz | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Russo | first3 = M. B. | last4 = Killgore | first4 = W. D.

[[Executive function]]ing is "the ability to plan and coordinate a willful action in the face of alternatives, to monitor and update action as necessary and suppress distracting material by focusing attention on the task at hand".&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = K | last2 = Harrison | first2 = Y | year = 2001 | title = Frontal lobe function, sleep loss and fragmented sleep | url = | journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 463–475 | doi=10.1053/smrv.2001.0203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal cortex has been identified as the most important region involved in executive functioning.&lt;ref name="Koechlin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koechlin | first1 = E. | last2 = Ody | first2 = C. | last3 = Kouneiher | first3 = F. | year = 2003 | title = The architecture of cognitive control in the human prefrontal cortex | url = | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5648| pages = 1181–1185 | doi=10.1126/science.1088545 | pmid=14615530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers believe that three of the most 'basic' executive functions are: shifting, updating, and inhibition.&lt;ref name="Miyake"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miyake | first1 = A. | last2 = Friedman | first2 = N.P. | last3 = Emerson | first3 = M.J. | last4 = Witzki | first4 = A.H. | last5 = Howerter | first5 = A. | last6 = Wager | first6 = T.D. | year = 2000 | title = The Unity and Diversity of Executive Functions and Their Contributions to Complex ''Frontal Lobe'' Tasks: A Latent Variable Analysis | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 49–100 | doi = 10.1006/cogp.1999.0734 | pmid = 10945922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting back and forth between different tasks is considered a very important mental behavior involved in executive functioning as it involves active disengagement from the present task and engaging in a new task.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;Norman, D.

Shapiro (Eds.), Consciousness and self-regulation: Advances in research and theory (Vol. 4, pp. 1–18). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; Updating is believed to be involved in [[working memory]] (closely associated with the function of the prefrontal cortex&lt;ref name="Jonides"&gt;Jonides, J., &amp; Smith, E. E. (1997). The architecture of working memory. In M. D. Rugg (Ed.), Cognitive neuroscience (pp. 243–276). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;), where the information that is active needs to be updated by replacing old, now irrelevant information with new, relevant information based on the objective.&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = N. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.

The anterior cingulate cortex has been implemented in the process of inhibiting a habitual response or detecting possible conflicts in responses;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braver | first1 = T.S. | last2 = Barch | first2 = D.S. | last3 = Gray | first3 = J.R. | last4 = Molfese | first4 = D.L.

[[Image:Frontal lobe.gif|250px|left|alt=Frontal Lobe.| [[Frontal lobe]].]]
The processes above illustrate a model of controlled versus automatic behavior that was hypothesized by Shallice et al. (1989), called the [[supervisory attentional system]]. This system is believed to come into play when intervention of habitual response is necessary.&lt;ref name="Shallice"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shallice | first1 = T. | last2 = Burgess | first2 = P.W. | last3 = Baxter | first3 = D.M. | last4 = Schon | first4 = F. | year = 1989 | title = The origins of utilisation behaviour | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 1587–98 | doi=10.1093/brain/112.6.1587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage to the prefrontal cortex will cause a breakdown in this system, resulting in [[utilization behavior]]s.&lt;ref name="Shallice" /&gt; These behaviors would include spontaneous sequences of action on irrelevant objects in the surroundings with no clear goal in mind.&lt;ref name="Shallice" /&gt; This theory has helped to extend the knowledge we now have on executive functions.

=== Decision making ===

[[Decision making]] involves a range of executive functions that need to be combined and organized in order to respond in the most appropriate manner, i.e. respond with the most advantageous decision.&lt;ref name="Harrison, Y., Horne, J.A. (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = Y. | last2 = Horne | first2 = J.A. | year = 1999 | title = One night of sleep loss impairs innovative thinking and flexible decision making | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 128–145 | doi=10.1006/obhd.1999.2827}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many aspects to the process of decision making, including those discussed above. Other processes involved that correlate to executive function will be discussed below.

=== Complexity ===

While most important decisions are made over a longer period of time involving more in-depth cognitive analysis, usually we have limited time in which to assimilate a large amount of information into an informed decision. Lack of sleep appears to negatively affect our ability to appreciate and respond to increasing complexity, as was found in performance deficits after 1 night of sleep deprivation on a simulated marketing game.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;

The game involved subjects promoting a fictional product while getting feedback on the financial effects of their decisions. They would continuously have to take into account new variables to succeed which would increase the game's complexity.&lt;ref name="Harrison, Y., Horne, J.A. (1999)"/&gt;

Other examples of inability to process complex information includes a decrease in ability to assess facial expressions, an increase in resolving to the use of stereotypes and racial biases in evaluations, and an increase in taking the easier solution to solving interpersonal problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Amie M.|last2=Mendes|first2=Wendy Berry|last3=Prather|first3=Aric A.|date=2017-09-27|title=The Social Side of Sleep: Elucidating the Links Between Sleep and Social Processes|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721417712269|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|pages=0963721417712269|doi=10.1177/0963721417712269|issn=0963-7214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation ===

Intuitively, because sleep deprivation had a negative effect on handling  the complexity of the simulated marketing game, it also affected innovative processes as subjects failed to adopt a more innovative (and rewarding) style of play.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt; Innovative thinking involves the construction of new behaviors based on the assimilation of continuously changing or novel information. In a study of military personnel who had undergone two nights of sleep deprivation, results showed marked reductions in the ability to generate ideas about a given topic (categories test); this is known as ideational fluency.&lt;ref name="May"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = May | first1 = J. | last2 = Kline | first2 = P. | year = 1987 | title = Measuring the effects on cognitive abilities of sleep loss during continuous operations | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 443–455 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1987.tb02261.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MRI of orbitofrontal cortex.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Approximate location of the orbitofrontal cortex.|Approximate Location of the ''[[Orbitofrontal cortex]]''.]]

=== Risk ===

Risk versus reward analysis is an important part of decision making. Attempting to create a representation and response to a risky situation highly involves the [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Pais-Vieira"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pais-Viera | first1 = M. | last2 = Lima | first2 = D. | last3 = Galhardo | first3 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Orbitofrontal cortex lesions disrupt risk assessment in a novel serial decision-making task for rats | url = | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 145 | issue = 1| pages = 225–231 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.11.058 | pmid=17204373}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study that involved risk taking analysis of drivers who had been driving for 12 hours straight, it was found that they were more willing to make hazardous maneuvers and were reluctant to adopt any form of a cautious driving style.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = I.D. | last2 = Tickner | first2 = A.H. | last3 = Simmons | first3 = D.C. | year = 1970 | title = Effect of prolonged driving on overtaking criteria | url = | journal = Ergonomics | volume =  13| issue = 2| pages = 239–242 | doi = 10.1080/00140137008931137 | pmid=5432365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies shed further light on this phenomenon. One study used real life decision making scenarios involving choosing cards from 1 of 4 decks of cards. Different cards were considered as a reward while the others were a penalty. The sleep deprived subjects failed to alter their selection methods, continuing to choose cards from decks that were producing a high amount of penalty cards, whereas the control subjects were able to change their choosing strategy by a cost-benefit analysis based on monitoring the outcomes they were getting as they went along.&lt;ref name="Harrison, Y., Horne, J.A. (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = Y. | last2 = Horne | first2 = J.A. | year = 1998 | title = Sleep loss impairs short and novel language tasks having a prefrontal focus | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2869.1998.00104.x | journal = Journal of Sleep Research | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 95–100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planning ===

The process of planning would be done congruently with decision making in determining the outcome behavior. As has been shown so far, sleep deprivation has many detrimental effects on executive functions and planning is not spared. One study involved cadets who were required to complete simulated military operations under sleep deprived conditions. Results showed a decrease in the subjects ability to 'plan on the fly' and overall outcomes were less than those for well rested cadets.&lt;ref name="McCann"&gt;McCann, C., Pointing, T. (1995) The effect of alerting drugs on planning performance during sustained operations. Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine, North York, Ontario, Canada. Retrieved onon November 19, 2009 from http://cradpdf.drdc.gc.ca/PDFS/zbb55/p506693.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another psychological test used to assess planning and decision making is the [[Tower of London test]]. This test has been widely used in the testing of executive functions as well as studies of sleep deprived subjects. In a study examining performance on this test after 45–50 hours of sleep deprivation, it was found that the sleep deprived subjects not only took longer, but required more moves to complete the task than did the controls.&lt;ref name="Killgore"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Killgore | first1 = W.D. | last2 = Kahn-Greene | first2 = E.T. | last3 = Grugle | first3 = N.L. | last4 = Killgore | first4 = D.B. | last5 = Balkin | first5 = T.J.  | year = 2009 | title = Sustaining executive functions during sleep deprivation: A comparison of caffeine, dextroamphetamine, and modafinil | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 205–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Error correction ===

Being able to show insight into one's performance on different tasks and correct or modify those behaviors if they are incorrect is an important part of executive functioning. The problems that could be associated with being unable to learn from a mistake or adapt to a mistake could impair many behaviors.

A common test used to assess error correction and trouble shooting with regards to the frontal lobe is the [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]]. This test involves a change in the rules which requires a shift in strategy. In the same study discussed above,&lt;ref name="Killgore" /&gt; detriments were also found on this task in the sleep deprived individuals.

== Memory ==

Research evidence suggests that sleep is involved in the acquisition, maintenance and retrieval of memories&lt;ref name="Rauchs"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rauchs | first1 = G. | last2 = Desgranges | first2 = B. | last3 = Foret | first3 = J. | last4 = Eustache | first4 = F. | year = 2005 | title = The relationships between memory systems and sleep stages | url = | journal = Journal of Sleep Research | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 123–140 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2869.2005.00450.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[memory consolidation]].&lt;ref name="Saxvig"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saxvig | first1 = I. W. | last2 = Lundervold | first2 = A. J. | last3 = Gronli | first3 = J. | last4 = Ursin | first4 = R. | last5 = Bjorvatn | first5 = B. | last6 = Portas | first6 = C. M. | year = 2007 | title = The effect of a REM sleep deprivation procedure on different aspects of memory function in humans | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 309–317 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00623.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, sleep deprivation has been shown to affect both working memory and [[long-term memory]] processes.

=== Working memory ===

Sleep deprivation increases the number of errors made on working memory tasks. In one study, the working memory task involved illuminating a sequence of 3 or 4 coloured lights, then asking both sleep deprived and non-sleep deprived individuals to memorize and repeat back the sequence. The sleep deprived performed the task much faster than those in the control condition (i.e., not sleep deprived), which initially appeared to be a positive effect. However, there was a significant difference in the number of errors made, with the fatigued group performing much worse.&lt;ref name="Kahol"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kahol | first1 = K. | last2 = Lebya | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Deka | first3 = M. | last4 = Deka | first4 = V. | last5 = Mayes | first5 = S. | last6 = Smith | first6 = M. | last7 = Ferrara | first7 = J. J. | last8 = Panchanathan | first8 = S. | year = 2007 | title = Effect of fatigue on psychomotor and cognitive skills | url = | journal = The American Journal of Surgery | volume = 195 | issue = | pages = 195–204 | doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2007.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence from imaging studies also demonstrates the influence of sleep deprivation on working memory. [[EEG]] studies have documented lower accuracy and slower reaction times among sleep deprived participants performing working memory tasks. Decreasing alertness and lack of focus triggered deficits in working memory that are accompanied by significant degradation of [[event-related potentials]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = M. E. | last2 = McEvoy | first2 = L. K. | last3 = Gevins | first3 = A. | year = 2002 | title = The impact of moderate sleep loss on neurophysiologic signals during working-memory task performance | url = https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-pdf/25/7/56/13661849/sleep-25-7-56.pdf | journal = Sleep | volume = 25 | issue = 7| pages = 784–794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PET scans shows global decrease in glucose metabolism in response to sleep deprivation. As subjects become increasingly impaired on working memory tasks, a more specific decrease of glucose occurs in the thalamus, prefrontal cortex and [[posterior parietal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Durmer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durmer | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Dinges | first2 = D. F. | year = 2005 | title = Neurocognitive consequences of sleep deprivation | url = | journal = Seminars in Neurology | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 117–129 | doi=10.1055/s-2005-867080 | pmid=15798944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

fMRI scans following brief sleep deprivation (24 hours or less) show increases in thalamic activation. Verbal working memory tasks normally cause increases in left [[temporal lobe]] activity. However, after 35 hours of deprivation, there are noted decreases in temporal lobe activation and increases in parietal lobe activation.&lt;ref name="Durmer"/&gt;
[[Image:Working memory model.svg|frame|left|alt=Diagram showing a model of working memory| ''[[Working memory]]'' model.]]
The working [[memory span]] is also affected by sleep deprivation. When sleep deprived participants in a study were asked to remember a [[nonsense word]] and locate it among a number of similar words, the length of time they could hold it in their working memory decreased by 38% compared to rested individuals.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = T. H. | last2 = Drummond | first2 = S. P. A. | last3 = Salamat | first3 = J. S. | last4 = Brown | first4 = G. G. | year = 2007 | title = Effects of 24 Hr of total sleep deprivation on component processes of verbal working memory | url = | journal = Neuropsychology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 787–795 | doi=10.1037/0894-4105.21.6.787 | pmid=17983292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-term memory ===

One way sleep is involved in the creation of long-term memories is through memory consolidation, which is the process by which a new memory is changed into a more permanent form. This is believed to be accomplished by creating connections between the medial temporal lobes and neocortical areas.&lt;ref name="Rauchs"/&gt; [[NREM]] (non-REM) and [[REM sleep]] are both believed to be implicated, with current theories suggesting NREM is most particularly involved in [[procedural memory]] and REM with [[declarative memory]].&lt;ref name="Rauchs"/&gt;

Animal studies have partly validated these claims. For instance, one study conducted with rats showed that REM sleep deprivation after learning a new task disrupted their ability to perform the task again later. This was especially true if the task was complex (i.e., involved using unusual information or developing novel adaptive behaviours).&lt;ref name="Rauchs"/&gt;

There is similar evidence for the role of sleep in procedural memory in humans. Participants in one study were trained on a procedural memory skill involving perceptual-motor skills. Those who were NREM sleep deprived performed significantly worse on subsequent trials compared to those who were fully rested.&lt;ref name="Rauchs"/&gt; Another study using a visuo-motor procedural memory task documented similar results. Participants who were sleep deprived following the initial training showed no improvement on trials the next day, while those who received sleep showed significant positive changes.&lt;ref name="Gais"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gais | first1 = S. | last2 = Koster | first2 = S. | last3 = Sprenger | first3 = A. | last4 = Bethke | first4 = J. | last5 = Heide | first5 = W. | last6 = Kimmig | first6 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Sleep is required for improving reaction times after training on a procedural visuo-motor task | url = | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 90 | issue = | pages = 610–615 | doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2008.07.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies such as these clearly demonstrate the disruptive influence sleep deprivation has on memory consolidation of procedural and declarative memories.

Sleep deprivation also has a documented effect on the ability to acquire new memories for subsequent consolidation. A study done on mice that were sleep deprived before learning a new skill but allowed to rest afterward displayed a similar number of errors on later trials as the mice that were sleep deprived only after the initial learning.&lt;ref name="Linden"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linden | first1 = E. R. | last2 = Bern | first2 = D. | last3 = Fishbein | first3 = W. | year = 1974 | title = Retrograde amnesia: prolonging the fixation phase of memory consolidation by paradoxical sleep deprivation | url = | journal = Physiology and Behavior | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 409–412 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(75)90004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is hypothesized that rather than preventing the memory from being consolidated, sleep deprivation interfered with the initial acquisition of the memory. Mice with pre-trial sleep deprivation also took significantly longer to learn a task than well-rested mice.&lt;ref name="Alvarenga"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alvarenga | first1 = T. A. | last2 = Patti | first2 = C. L. | last3 = Andersen | first3 = M. L. | last4 = Silva | first4 = R. H. | last5 = Calzavara | first5 = M. B. | last6 = Lopez | first6 = G. B. | last7 = Frussa-Filho | first7 = R. | last8 = Tufik | first8 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Paradoxical sleep deprivation impairs acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of a discriminative avoidance task in rats | url = | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 90 | issue = | pages = 624–632 | doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2008.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleep deprivation is also implicated in impaired ability to retrieve stored long-term memories. When an aversive stimulus was included in a trial (i.e., a blowdryer would blast hot air and noise at a mouse), mice that were sleep deprived were less anxious on subsequent trials. This suggests they had not retrieved all of the memory related to the unpleasant experience.&lt;ref name="Alvarenga"/&gt;

=== Explanations for the effect of sleep deprivation on memory ===

Several theories have been put forth to explain the effect sleep deprivation has on memory.

One early study into neurochemical influences on sleep and memory was conducted with cats and demonstrated that sleep deprivation increased brain [[protein synthesis]]. There is evidence that these altered levels of proteins could increase the excitability of the central nervous system, thus increasing the susceptibility of the brain to other neurochemical agents that can cause [[amnesia]].&lt;ref name="Linden"/&gt; Further research has revealed that the protein kinase A (PKA) signalling pathway is crucial to long-term memory. If PKA or protein synthesis inhibition occurs at certain moments during sleep, memory consolidation can be disrupted. In addition, mice with genetic inhibition of PKA have been shown to have long-term memory deficits.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graves | first1 = L. | last2 = Pack | first2 = A. | last3 = Abel | first3 = T. | year = 2001 | title = Sleep and memory: a molecular perspective | url = | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 237–243 | doi=10.1016/s0166-2236(00)01744-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sleep deprivation may act through the inhibition of these protein synthesis pathways.

[[Acetylcholine]] (ACh) may also be involved in the effects of sleep deprivation, particularly with regards to spatial memory. Muscarinic antagonists, or chemicals that block ACh, impair spatial learning when administered prior to a training task among rats. ACh levels are also found to be lower when measured following a period of sleep deprivation.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt; ACh has also been shown to increase the activity of the PKA pathway, which is needed for memory consolidation.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt;

[[Serotonin]] levels (in the form of 5-HT) have been shown to decrease during REM and NREM sleep, leading some researchers to believe that it is also involved in memory consolidation during sleep. Mice lacking the receptor gene for 5-HT engage in more REM sleep and perform better on spatial memory tasks.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt; Researchers have hypothesized that sleep deprivation interferes with the normal reduction in levels of 5-HT, impairing the process of memory consolidation.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt;

Another theory suggests that the stress brought on by sleep deprivation affects memory consolidation by changing the concentration of [[corticosteroids]] in the body. This was simulated in one study by elevating the concentration of [[glucocorticoids]] during early sleep stages. The observed effects on memory retention the next day were similar to those obtained from individuals who had received no sleep.&lt;ref name="Plihal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plihal | first1 = W. | last2 = Born | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Memory consolidation in human sleep depends on inhibition of glucocorticoid release | url = | journal = Learning and Memory | volume = 10 | issue = 13| pages = 2741–2747 | doi=10.1097/00001756-199909090-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleep deprivation may affect memory by interfering with [[neuroplasticity]] as measured by [[long-term potentiation]] in the [[hippocampus]]. This reduced plasticity may be the root cause of impairments in both working memory among humans and spatial memory among rats.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = I. G. | last2 = Guinan | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Horowitz | first3 = J. M. | year = 2002 | title = Sleep deprivation impairs long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices | url = https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.2002.88.2.1073 | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 88 | issue = | pages = 1073–1076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleep deprivation may additionally affect memory by reducing the proliferation of cells in the hippocampus.&lt;ref name ="McEwen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McEwen | first1 = B. S. | year = 2006 | title = Sleep deprivation as a neurobiologic and physiologic stressor: allostasis and allostatic load | url = | journal = Metabolism Clinical and Experimental | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 20–23 | doi=10.1016/j.metabol.2006.07.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleep deprivation has also been associated with decreased overall membrane excitability of neurons in the brain. Activation of these membranes is critical for the formation of memories.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = R. | last2 = Hu | first2 = S. | last3 = Wang | first3 = Y. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = W. | last5 = Luo | first5 = W. | last6 = Chen | first6 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Paradoxical sleep deprivation impairs spatial learning and affects membrane excitability and mitochondrial protein in the hippocampus | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1230 | issue = | pages = 224–232 | doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2008.07.033 | pmid=18674519}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitochondria]] play an essential role in modulating neuron excitability, and research has shown that sleep deprivation is involved in inhibiting mitochondrial metabolism.&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt;

==Practical effects==

===Risk of traffic collisions ===
Reduced duration of sleep, as well as an increase in time spent awake, are factors that highly contribute to the risk of [[traffic collision]]s, the severity and fatality rates of which are on the same level as [[driving under the influence]] of [[alcohol]],&lt;ref name="Pack"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pack | first1 = AI | last2 = Pack | first2 = AM | last3 = Rodgman | first3 = E | last4 = Cucchiara | first4 = A | last5 = Dinges | first5 = DF | last6 = Schwab | first6 = CW.  | year = 1995 | title = Characteristics of crashes attributed to the driver having fallen asleep | url = | journal = Accident Analysis and Prevention | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 769–775 | doi=10.1016/0001-4575(95)00034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stutts"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stutts | first1 = JC | last2 = Wilkins | first2 = JW | last3 = Osberg | first3 = JS | last4 = Vaughn | first4 = BV.  | year = 2003 | title = Driver risk factors for sleep-related crashes | url = | journal = Accid Anal Prev | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 321–331 | doi=10.1016/s0001-4575(02)00007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 19 hours of wakefulness corresponding to a [[blood alcohol content|BAC]] of 0.05%, and 24 hours of wakefulness corresponding to a BAC of 0.10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Dawson D, Reid K|title=Fatigue, alcohol and performance impairment|journal=Nature|year=1997|volume=388|pages=235|doi=10.1038/40775|pmid=9230429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compounding this issue is the proven dissociation between objective performance and subjective alertness; individuals vastly underestimate the effect that sleep deprivation has on their cognitive performance, particularly during the circadian night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bermudez EB, Kerman EB, Cohen DA, Wyatt JK, Czeisler CA, Phillips AJK|title= Prediction of vigilant attention and cognitive performance using self-reported alertness, circadian phase, hours since awakening, and accumulated sleep loss|journal=PLoS One|year=2016|volume=11|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0151770}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the effect of acute sleep deprivation can be countered by [[nap]]ping, with longer naps giving more benefit than shorter naps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mollicone | first1 = DJ | last2 = Van Dongen | first2 = HPA | last3 = Dinges | first3 = DF. | year = | title = Optimizing sleep/wake schedules in space: Sleep during chronic nocturnal sleep restriction with and without diurnal naps | url = | journal = Acta Astronautica | volume = 60 | issue = 4–7| pages = 354–361 | doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.09.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some industries, particularly the Fire Service, have traditionally allowed workers to sleep while on duty, between calls for service.  In one study of [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] providers, 24-hour shifts were not associated with a higher frequency of negative safety outcomes when compared to shorter shifts.&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Patterson PD, Weaver MD, Frank RC, Warner CW, Martin-Gill C, Guyette FX, Fairbanks RJ, Hubble MW, Songer TJ, Calloway CW, Kelsey SF, Hostler D|title=Association Between Poor Sleep, Fatigue, and Safety Outcomes in Emergency Medical Services Providers|journal=Prehospital Emergency Care|year=2012|volume=16|pages=86–97|doi=10.3109/10903127.2011.616261 |pmc=3228875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is especially relevant for young adults as they require 8–9 hours of sleep at night to overcome [[excessive daytime sleepiness]]&lt;ref name="Roehrs"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roehrs | first1 = TA | last2 = Timms | first2 = V | last3 = Zwyghuizen-Doorenbos | first3 = A | last4 = Roth | first4 = T.  | year = 1989 | title = Sleep extension in sleepy and alert normals | url = https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-pdf/12/5/449/13659314/120509.pdf | journal = Sleep | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 449–457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are among the highest risk group for driving while feeling tired and sleep deprivation related crashes.&lt;ref name="Pack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carskadon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carskadon | first1 = MA.  | year = 1989 | title = Adolescent sleepiness: increased risk in a high-risk population | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1990-27983-001 | journal = Alcohol, Drugs and Driving | volume = 5–6 | issue = | pages = 317–328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Evans County Heart Study''' was a long-term [[cardiovascular]] study on residents of [[Evans County, Georgia]]. The study, which was funded by the [[National Institute of Health]], began in July, 1958, and was last updated as recent as May 2016. It resulted in more than 560 published papers that ultimately showed the importance of [[HDL cholesterol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musc.edu/catalyst/archive/2005/co1-14heart.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529150838/http://www.musc.edu/catalyst/archive/2005/co1-14heart.htm |archivedate=2010-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was conducted by Dr. [[Curtis Gordon Hames]], a [[family doctor]] from [[Claxton, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last2=Smith |first2=Diane K. |last3=Feldman |first3=Elaine B. |last4=Hames |first4=Curtis |date=1984 |title=Effect of age, sex, and race on selenium status of healthy residents of Augusta, Georgia |journal=Biological Trace Element Research |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=3–9 |doi=10.1007/BF02918316 |last1=McAdam |first1=Patricia A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study took place in Evans Country because the area had a high death count due to heart complications, such as [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases]]. The studies showed that there was a significant abundance of heart conditions within a variety of ethnicities. People as young as fourteen and as old as seventy-four participated in the tests, and were divided into different age groups; however only males were eligible for the study. Anyone as old as one-hundred years old could be eligible, and any younger.

== Background  ==
The study involved 6,596 people from Evans County and 3,921 people from [[Bulloch County, Georgia|Bulloch County]]. The study population from Evans county consisted of African-American and [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] males, ages 40–74, along with a 15-39 year old group that were involved in other studies. Then, the people were divided up into 10 random, equal in size, random samples. Also, a 50% random sample of the 15-39 year old group was taken by including people from the first five samples solely. By comprising this type of sampling, secular trends in disease patterns, along with possible aging of laboratory reagents were randomized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonough|first=John R.|last2=Hames|first2=Curtis G.|last3=Stulb|first3=Sarah C.|last4=Garrison|first4=Glen E.|date=1963-12-01|title=Cardiovascular disease field study in Evans County, Ga|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=78|issue=12|pages=1051–1060|issn=0094-6214|pmc=1915405|pmid=14090074|doi=10.2307/4592020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study was done in Evans County, Georgia. Evans County is located in the southeastern portion of the United States. It is situated on the coastal plain estimating around 60 miles inland from the seaport of [[Savannah, GA]]. Around half of the population lives on farms while the other half lives in meager little villages. An example is [[Claxton, Georgia|Claxton]]. Claxton is a town that has a population of 2,000, about 40 percent of which is black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000296291541660X|title=Ethnicity and Cardiovascular Disease: The Evans County Heart Study |language=en|access-date=2017-05-03|doi=10.1016/S0002-9629(15)41660-X|volume=311|journal=The American Journal of the Medical Sciences|pages=130–134 | last1 = Hames | first1 = Curtis G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The white population of Evans County was large enough to provide an adequete number for the study, but the black population was considered too small and some blacks from the Bulloch county were incorporated into this study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Goals and Methods ==
The study can be categorized as a [[cohort study]] due to the longevity of the research and its focus on the residents of [[Evans County, Georgia]]. It was the leader in the field of [[epidemiology]] to analyze effects and differences of [[coronary heart disease]] on race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epi.umn.edu/cvdepi/study-synopsis/evans-county-cardiovascular-and-cerebrovascular-study/|title=Evans County Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Heart Study|last=Curtis|first=Hames|date=October 15, 2012|website=University of Minnesota|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study aimed to determine how [[cardiovascular disease]] affected different races among a specific population. To determine the population size, a specific census was conducted in the county for the study during the first two months of 1960, recording 6,596 persons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  From there, the study population included a total of 3,377 residents within Evans County. These residents included a group of randomly selected blacks and whites age 40-74 and an additional group of blacks were selected from Bulloch sub-County. A group of 15-39 year old residents were also selected into this group mainly to participate in other experiments as well. The study population was subsequently randomly divided into 10 groups.

The examination process consisted of two cardiovascular tests including "history and physical, [[blood pressure]] determination, standard [[electrocardiogram]] and chest [[X-ray]], and [[cholesterol]] determination."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ninety-two percent of the study population responded with an examination process. Therefore, data from 3,102 residents was obtained through the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cassel|first=J.|date=1971|title=Evans County Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Heart Study|url=|journal=Archives of international Medicine|volume=128|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a prospective cohort model, the investigators sought to examine the entire population of the county aged over 40 years and half the population aged between 15 and 39 years. They ultimately achieved a 92% response rate for a total study population of 3,102 residents. From 1960-1962, each participant was given an initial examination in which serum cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, height and the participant’s responses to a number of health behavior and medical history questions. A follow-up consisting of a similar battery of tests was completed from 1967-1969. For 90.9% of the study population, a physical similar to the preliminary one was completed. For another 7.9%, health status was ascertained by a phone survey of either subject or a family member. The total rate of follow-up was 98.8%. Factors assessed at the time of follow-up were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, cigarette smoking, body weight, [[hematocrit]] value, ECG abnormalities and diet. Socioeconomic status was also assessed for whites, but not for blacks, as little variability was found in this factor among black subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Cassel, J., ed., 1971. Evans County cardiovascular and cerebrovascular study. Archives of internal medicine, 128 (6), 883-992.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results/Conclusions ==
A central finding of the study was that, across race and social class differences, factors associated with increased risk of [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD) did so equally for blacks and whites whether the risk factors were considered singly or in combination. CHD incidence remained markedly higher for white [[Evans County]] residents. The only [[social grouping]] of white residents that had equally low incidence of CHD was white [[sharecroppers]], which was attributed to higher rates of [[physical activity]] among sharecroppers when compared to whites of higher [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epi.umn.edu/cvdepi/study-synopsis/evans-county-cardiovascular-and-cerebrovascular-study/|title=Evans County Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Study «  Heart Attack Prevention|website=www.epi.umn.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strength of the study was the high response rate of the population in its entirety, one of only two of its kind to successfully examine an entire community. The publication of the initial study results did not include statistical analysis. Hames attributes his decision to avoid statistical analysis to the unique design of the study. He wrote, “…it certainly is not clear to us [the investigators] what differences such tests could make in our interpretations in the context of this study… the population over 40 does not constitute a sample of some universe. They are a [[universe]].”

'''Introduction'''

FIAN International - formerly, FoodFirst Information and Action Network - was founded in 1986 as the first international human rights organization to advocate for the realization of the right to food and nutrition.
Holding a consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, FIAN is active in more than 50 countries, through national sections and seeds groups, which account for 25 of these, as well as individual members and international networks. With no religious or political affiliation dictating its work, FIAN International exposes violations of people's right to food and related rights wherever they may occur and stands up against undue and oppressive practices that prevent people from feeding themselves. 

By holding governments accountable, FIAN International strives to secure people's access to and control over natural resources and means of subsistence, crucial to ensure a life of dignity, now and for future generations. Nutrition, as an inherent component of the right to food, and a fundamental act of food sovereignty, remains a core objective in FIAN's work. As the struggle against gender discrimination and other forms of exclusion is an integral part of its mission, FIAN works with and in favor of the most marginalized and affected groups: its vision is of a world free from hunger, in which every woman, man, boy and girl can fully enjoy their right to food, as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. 

FIAN International's Secretariat is based in Heidelberg, Germany, and Geneva, Switzerland.

'''Organizational Structure'''

FIAN is an international membership based organisation. FIAN's institutional members are its national sections which are legal entities in their own right and have their own membership and elected decision-making bodies.

Current sections of FIAN can be found in some 25 countries, for updates look at [http://www.fian.org/about-us/worldwide/ Worldwide]. 

The overall mission, vision and the strategy of FIAN is defined and revised by the International Council (IC), and represented by delegates of the sections who meet once every three years. The IC elects the International Executive Committee (IEC) -headed by the president, which supervises the implementation of FIAN’s strategic plans. The IEC meets bi-annually to review and strategize FIAN programs, methods and budgets. 

The operative working unit being in charge of the execution of FIAN’s programs is its International Secretariat (IS) located in Heidelberg (Germany) and Geneva (Switzerland), and coordinated by the Secretary General.

'''FIAN International's work'''

FIAN uses various working tools to achieve the realization of the right to adequate food.

'''''Case-work and Interventions'''''

At international Fact Finding Missions, FIAN identifies and addresses human rights violations. FIAN interviews people threatened or affected by violations of their right to food and verifies the facts of a situation. Face-to-face contacts to local counterparts are established and serve as a basis for trustful co-operation. On request of those affected, FIAN reacts quickly, analyses the case and mobilises members and supporters worldwide to send out Urgent Action protest letters. Violations are also followed-up in long-term case-work by local FIAN action groups. In close co-operation with the affected communities, FIAN persistently approaches the responsible authorities and identifies breaches of right to food obligations. FIAN’s analysis is based on the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] as interpreted in the UN General Comments, in particular General Comment 12 on the right to adequate food. Existing recourse mechanisms and legal remedies under national and international human rights law are applied to provide redress to the victims.

'''''Lobby and Advocacy'''''

Reliable contacts and networks, a sound documentation of cases and two decades of experience provide a solid basis for effective lobbying and advocating the right to food. FIAN holds states, international institutions and private actors accountable at the national and international levels. The Right to Food Guidelines adopted by the [[FAO]] in 2004 is one of the tools FIAN uses to monitor states’ right to food policies. FIAN tries to improve the existing right to food protection system and to establish new instruments. Intense follow-up work strives to secure the effective implementation of existing instruments, making the right to food politically and judicially enforceable everywhere for everyone.

'''''Information and Education'''''

Targeted information campaigns and awareness-raising on the right to food are at the core of FIAN’s work - to empower social movements and non-governmental organizations to hold states accountable for violations of the right to food, to clarify for governments and other duty-bearers the content and implementation needs of their obligations, and to motivate supporters from civil society to join action against human rights violations. The systematic information gathered from more than 400 individual cases over the past two decades is analyzed and fed into various professional publications.

'''Impact'''

FIAN was involved prominently in the development of the human rights protection system, for instance in the strengthened procedure of State’s and parallel reporting on economic, social, and cultural human rights in the UN human rights system; the elaboration of the UN General Comment No. 12 on the Right to Food in 1999 as the most authoritative legal interpretation of the right to food in international law; and the adoption of the “Voluntary Guidelines on the Right to Food” by the FAO member states in 2004.

'''''FIAN’s commitment was awarded internationally:'''''

'''Public Eye on Davos - Positive Award:''' In 2006, FIAN International together with two partners won the Public Eye on Davos - Positive Award, which is given every year on the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos, for their commitment in favour of the rights of workers of the Mexican tyre factory Euzkadi.

'''Silver Rose Award:''' In 2005, two staff members of the FIAN Section Germany received the Silver Rose Award for their commitment for the rights of workers in the flower industry, the participation in the development of the International Code of Conduct for the Production of Cut flowers (ICC) and its successful implementation in the framework of the Flower Label Programm (FLP).

It is maintained by the Institut für Arbeitsschutz der Deutschen Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung (IFA, [[Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance]]). Information on occupational medicine and [[First aid|first aid]] is compiled by Henning Heberer and his team (TOXICHEM, Leuna).

The database contains information for the safe handling of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous substances]] and other chemical substances at work:
* [[toxicology]]/[[ecotoxicology]]
* important physical and chemical properties 
* application and handling
* health effects
* protective measures and such in case of danger (incl. first aid)
* special regulations e.g. GHS classification and labelling according to [[CLP Regulation]] (pictograms, [[H phrases]], [[P phrases]]).

The available information relates to about 9,400 substances. Data are updated immediately after publication of new official regulations or after the issue of new scientific results.

A mobile version of the GESTIS Substance Database, suitable for [[Smartphone|smartphones]] and [[Tablet computer|tablets]], is also available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gestismobile-en.itrust.de/ Mobile version of GESTIS Substance Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

GHIs classify a type of global initiative, which is defined as an organized effort integrating the involvement of organizations, individuals, and stakeholders around the world to address a global issue (i.e.: climate change, human rights, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shiffman|first=Jeremy|last2=Smith|first2=Stephanie|date=2007-10-13|title=Generation of political priority for global health initiatives: a framework and case study of maternal mortality|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673607615797|journal=The Lancet|volume=370|issue=9595|pages=1370–1379|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61579-7|issn=0140-6736|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of GHIs are the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR), the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] (Global Fund), and the [[World Bank]]'s [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/EXTAFRHEANUTPOP/EXTAFRREGTOPHIVAIDS/0,,contentMDK:20415735~menuPK:1001234~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:717148,00.html Multi-country AIDS Programme] (MAP), all of which focus on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].  The [[Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance|Gavi]] (formerly the GAVI Alliance) focuses on immunization, particularly with respect to child survival.

==GHI Functions==
In terms of their institutional structure, GHIs have little in common with each other. In terms of their function – specifically their ability to raise and disburse funds, provide resources and coordinate and/or implement disease control in multiple countries – GHIs share some common ground, even if the mechanisms through which each of these functions is performed are different.&lt;ref&gt;Biesma R., Brugha R., Harmer A., Walsh A., Spicer N. and Walt G.

== Political Economy of GHIs ==
{{Cleanup section|reason=Check for original research, needs more sourcing, general cleanup|date=June 2018}}

The amount of political priority given to Global Health Initiatives varies between national and international governing powers. Though evidence shows that there exists an inequity between resource allocation for initiatives concerning issues such as child immunization, HIV/AIDS, and family planning in comparison to initiatives for high-burden disorders such as malnutrition and pneumonia, the source of this variance is unknown due to lack of systematic research pertaining to this subject. Global political priority is defined as the extent to which national and international political leaders address an issue of international concern through support in the forms of human capital, technology, and/or finances in order to aid efforts to resolve the problem. Global political priority is demonstrated through national and international leaders expressing sustained concern both privately and publicly, political systems and organizations enacting policies to help alleviate the issue, and national and international agencies providing resource levels that reflect the severity of the given crisis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The amount of attention a given global initiative receives is considerably dependent on the power and authority of actors connected to the issue, the power and impact of ideas defining and describing the issue, the power of political contexts framing the environments in which the actors operate to address the issue, as well as the weight and power of issue characteristics indicating the severity of the issue (i.e.: statistical indicators, severity metrics, efficacy of proposed interventions, etc.). Factors including objective measurability, scalability of the issue and proposed interventions, ability to track and monitor progress, risk of perceived harm, as well as simplicity and affordability of proposed solutions all contribute to the degree to which a given global initiative is likely to receive political attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, case studies have shown that the likelihood of global initiatives garnering public and political attention is not limited to the aforementioned factors. For example, initiatives concerning polio eradication continue to receive substantial resources in spite of the relatively small global burden of disease as compared to chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and some communicable diseases such as pneumonia which comparatively attract fewer worldwide resources irrespective of the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with such diseases. These cases highlight the need for extensive research methods and evaluative measures to assess the relative causal weights of factors used to determine how global political priority is attributed to global health initiatives. Existing debates also attribute factors such as the increasing influences of economic globalization, international organizations, and economic actors with little to no previous health remit as each contributing to the evolution of global health governance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230249486_1|title=Global Health Governance|last=Kay|first=Adrian|last2=Williams|first2=Owain|date=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|isbn=9781349302284|series=International Political Economy Series|pages=1–23|language=en|doi=10.1057/9780230249486_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of GHIs on Country Health Systems==
There is much discussion about the extent to which the volume of these additional funds creates multiple effects that positively and/or negatively impact both health systems and health outcomes for specific diseases. Assessing the direct impact of GHIs on specific diseases and health systems poses challenges pertaining to the issue of attributing particular effects to individual GHIs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As such, a common response in evaluations of GHIs is to acknowledge the inherent limitations of establishing causal chains in what is a highly complex public health environment, and to base conclusions on adequacy statements resulting from trends that demonstrate substantial growth in process and impact indicators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, existing literature argues that this approach towards evaluating GHIs can inadvertently result in overlooking the impact of social determinants on a disease, as implementers and evaluators are less likely to tackle the complexity of a disease within the larger social, political, cultural, and environmental system. Even if a GHI is effectively evaluated– perhaps showing a decrease in disease prevalence– the challenge remains of comprehensively analyzing the long-term impacts of the GHI by addressing the root social, political, or environmental causes of the disease. Accordingly, existing debates suggest that GHIs should be less concerned with the eradication of specific diseases, and should instead focus primarily on factors– such as basic living conditions, sanitation, and access to nutritious food– that are essential to delivering a sustainable heath program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=Paul E.|last2=Nizeye|first2=Bruce|last3=Stulac|first3=Sara|last4=Keshavjee|first4=Salmaan|date=October 2006|title=Structural violence and clinical medicine |journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e449|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 |pmc=1621099|pmid=17076568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on the effects of GHIs==
A small number of institutions have shaped, and continue to shape, research on GHIs.  In 2003, researchers at [http://www.abtassociates.com/ Abt Associates] devised an influential framework for understanding the system-wide effects of the Global fund which has informed much subsequent research, including their own studies of system-wide effects of the Global Fund in Benin, Ethiopia, Georgia and Malawi - often referred to as the 'SWEF' studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalfund.org/documents/library/studies/evaluation_framework/EF1_full.pdf Bennett S. and Fairbank A, The system-wide effects of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria: A conceptual framework, Oct 2003, Partners for Health Reform''plus'' and Abt Associates Inc.] Document summaries and links to each of the SWEF studies are accessible through the [http://ghinet.org/database.asp Global health Initiatives Network database]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abt continues to support ongoing research on the effects of GHIs in multiple countries. The Washington-based [[Center for Global Development]] has also been very active in its analysis of GHIs, particularly PEPFAR financing. The Center's [http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/hivmonitor HIV/AIDS Monitor] is essential reading for researchers of GHIs. With hubs in London and Dublin, the [http://ghinet.org/index.asp Global Health Initiatives Network] (GHIN) has been coordinating and supporting research in 22 countries on the effects of GHIs on existing health systems.

Knowledge of the effects of GHIs on specific diseases and on health systems comes from multiple sources.[[Longitudinal studies]] enable researchers to establish baseline data and then track and compare GHI effects on disease control or country health systems over time. In addition to Abt Associates' SWEF studies, additional early examples of this type of analysis were three-year, multi-country studies of the Global Fund in Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=59 Brugha et al (2005) Global Fund Tracking Study: A Cross-country Comparative Analysis, LSHTM, London]. PDFs of each country study is accessible through the [http://ghinet.org/database.asp GHIN database]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, research findings were published from tracking studies in [http://ghinet.org/countrystudies_europe_kyrgyzstan.asp Kyrgyzstan], [http://ghinet.org/countrystudies_americas_peru.asp Peru] and [http://ghinet.org/countrystudies_europe_ukraine.asp Ukraine] that sought to identify the health effects of the Global Fund at national and sub-national levels.

In contrast to longitudinal studies, multi-country analyses of GHIs can provide a ‘snapshot’ of GHI effects but are often constrained by “aggressive timelines”.&lt;ref&gt;Interactions between Global Health Initiatives and Health Systems: Evidence from Countries. The Maximising Positive Synergies Academic Consortium, June 2009, p6.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.who.int/healthsystems/GHIsynergies/en/index.html Maximising Positive Synergies Academic Consortium], for example, reported in 2009 on the effects of the Global Fund and PEPFAR on disease control and health systems, drawing on data from 20 countries.&lt;ref&gt;World health Organisation Maximising Positive Synergies Collaborative Group, An assessment of interactions between global health initiatives and country health systems. Lancet 2009, 373:2137-69&lt;/ref&gt; Most GHI evaluations – both internally and externally commissioned – rely on this type of short-term analysis and, inevitably, there is often a trade-off between depth and breadth of reporting.

Synthesis of data from multiple sources is an invaluable resource for making sense of the effects of GHIs. Early synthesis studies include a 2004 synthesis of findings on the effects of the Global Fund in four countries&lt;ref&gt;Brugha et al (2004) The Global Fund: Managing Great Expectations, Lancet, 364:95-100&lt;/ref&gt; by researchers at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] (LSHTM), a 2005 study by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]]&lt;ref&gt;Global health Partnerships: Assessing Country Consequences, 2005, McKinsey and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; and an assessment of the comparative advantages of the Global Fund and World Bank AIDS programs.&lt;ref&gt;Shakow A. Global Fund and world Bank HIV/AIDS Program: Comparative Advantage Study, 2006, Global Fund&lt;/ref&gt;

Two wide-ranging studies were published in 2009: a study of interactions between GHIs and country health systems commissioned by the World Health Organisation&lt;ref&gt;WHO Maximising Positive Synergies Collaborative Group. An assessment of interactions between global health initiatives and country health systems. The Lancet 373, June 20th pp2137-2169&lt;/ref&gt; and a study by researchers from LSHTM and the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]. The latter study - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=117 The effects of global health initiatives on country health systems: a review of the evidence from HIV/AIDS control] – reviewed the literature on the effects of the Global fund, the World Bank MAP and PEPFAR on country health systems with respect to: 1) national policy; 2) coordination and planning; 3) stakeholder involvement; 4) disbursement, absorptive capacity and management; 5) [[monitoring &amp; evaluation]]; and 6) human resources (Table 2).

==Evaluations of GHIs==
In a comparison between the three largest donors in sponsoring efforts to win the fight against AIDS in Africa, a research study found that PEPFAR performs best in money transfer and data collection; the Global Fund outperforms in tailoring programmatic initiatives and sharing data; and MAP performs highest in collaborating with government systems, strengthening health systems, and helping to build the capacity of local recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Oomman, Nandini, et al. ''Following the Funding for HIV/AIDS: a Comparative Analysis of the Funding Practices of PEPFAR, the Global Fund and World Bank MAP in Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia''. Center for Global Development, HIV/AIDS Monitor, 2007, p. xvii, ''Following the Funding for HIV/AIDS: a Comparative Analysis of the Funding Practices of PEPFAR, the Global Fund and World Bank MAP in Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia'', www.popline.org/node/199919.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the four GHIs summarized has been evaluated at least once since 2005 and all four produce their own annual reports.

===World Bank MAP===
The primary purpose of the MAP initiative was to introduce a major upscaling of multi-sectoral approach to responding to the HIV/AIDS crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa by involving a multitude of stakeholders including community-based organizations (CBOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), line ministries, and state governments at the highest levels.&lt;ref name="Sophie Harman 2007, pp. 485-492"/&gt;

[http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=46 A comprehensive study of MAP programs] published in 2007 reviewed whether MAP was implemented as designed, but did not evaluate MAP or assess its impact. In addition, there have been two evaluations that provide important additional insight into the effectiveness of the Bank's HIV/AIDS programmes (though not specifically MAP focused). In 2005, the Bank conducted an internal evaluation - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=51 Committing to Results: Improving the Effectiveness of HIV/AIDS Assistance] - which found that National AIDS strategies were not always prioritised or costed.

Supervision, and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E), were weak; civil society had not been engaged; political commitment and capacity had been overestimated, and mechanisms for political mobilisation were weak; and bank research and analysis, whilst perceived to be useful, was not reaching policy makers in Africa.  In 2009, a hard-hitting evaluation of the Bank’s Health, Nutrition and Population support – [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTOED/EXTWBASSHEANUTPOP/0,,contentMDK:22153992~menuPK:6080533~pagePK:64829573~piPK:64829550~theSitePK:4422776~isCURL:Y,00.html Improving Effectiveness of Outcomes for the Poor in Health, Nutrition and Population] – found that a third of the Bank’s HNP lending had not performed well, and that while the performance of the Bank’s [[International Finance Corporation]] investments had improved, accountability was weak.

===Global Fund===
Unlike many implementing agencies, the Global Fund has no presence in the countries it supports; rather it is a financial mechanism which provides funding to countries in the form of grants through a Secretariat in Geneva on the competitive basis of country proposals. Special emphasis is placed on proposals demonstrating country ownership as well as those that meet other evidence-based, performance-based, and inclusivity-based criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707263866|title=Handbook of transnational governance : institutions and innovations|date=2011|publisher=Polity|others=Hale, Thomas (Thomas Nathan), Held, David.|isbn=9780745650609|location=Cambridge|oclc=707263866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year, comprehensive evaluation of the Global Fund published a synthesis report in 2009 of findings from three Study areas. The Fund’s Technical Evaluation Research Group (TERG) [http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/terg/evaluations/5year/ Five Year Evaluation] (5YE) of the Global Fund drew on data from 24 countries to evaluate the Fund’s [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=131 organisational effectiveness and efficiency], partnership environment and [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=119 impact on AIDS, TB and Malaria]. The Evaluation highlighted the possible decline in HIV incidence rate in some countries, and rapid scale up of funding for HIV/AIDS, access and coverage, but also identified major gaps in support for national health information systems, and poor drug availability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Macro International Inc. 2009, The Impact of Collective Efforts on the Reduction of Disease Burden, Global Fund FiveYear Evaluation: Study Area 3, Submitted to the Global Fund, Macro International Inc., Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;

===GAVI Alliance===
Though GHIs have been instrumental in bringing national and international attention to crucial global health issues, existing debates suggest that they can also negatively impact country health systems. As such, disease-specific GHIs such as GAVI have worked to integrate health system strengthening (HSS) measures into programmatic implementation. However, the existing global debate questions the efficacy of HSS programs aimed at targeting technical solutions with clear measurable outcomes versus those more broadly focused on supporting holistic health systems.&lt;ref&gt;Katerini T. Storeng (2014) The GAVI Alliance and the ‘Gates approach’ to health system strengthening, Global Public Health, 9:8, 865-879, DOI: 10.1080/17441692.2014.940362&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an evaluation of GAVI’s vaccine and immunization support - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=124 Evaluation of the GAVI Phase 1 performance] - reported increased coverage of HepB3, Hib3 and DTP3 and increased coverage in rural areas but also a lack of cost data disaggregated by vaccine that prevented GAVI from accurately evaluating the cost effectiveness of its programs and vaccines, and an “unrealistic” reliance by GAVI on the market to reduce the cost of vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;Chee G., Molldrem V., Hsi N. and Chankova S. (2008) Evaluation of the GAVI Phase 1 Performance. Abt Associates Inc. p15&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, a study of the financial sustainability of GAVI vaccine support - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=122 Introducing New Vaccines in the Poorest Countries: What did we learn from the GAVI Experience with] - found that although GAVI funding equated to $5 per infant in developing countries per year for the period 2005-10, resource need was accelerating faster than growth in financing.

Findings from two evaluations of GAVI’s support for [[health systems strengthening]] (HSS) were published in 2009. An external evaluation by [http://www.hlsp.org/ HLSP]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=142 GAVI Health Systems Strengthening Support Evaluation: Key Findings and Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt; found insufficient technical support provided to countries applying for GAVI grants, an under-performing Independent Review Committee (IRC), and weaknesses in GAVI’s monitoring of grant activities. The study also found that countries were using GAVI grants for ‘downstream’ short-term HSS fixes rather than ‘upstream’ and long-term structural reform.
A study by [[John Snow, Inc]] praised the multi-year, flexible and country-driven characteristics of GAVI HSS grant funding and encouraged GAVI to continue this support. But also found weak M&amp;E of grant activity, low Civil Society involvement in the HSS proposal development process, unclear proposal writing guidelines, and over-reliance by countries on established development partners for assistance in implementing health system reform.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman B. and Abramson W. (2009) Final Synthesis Report - Health Systems Strengthening Tracking Study GAVI RFP00308. JSI Research and Training Institute, Inc. and In-Develop IPM.&lt;/ref&gt;

===PEPFAR===
A quantitative study by Stanford University in 2009 – [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=115 The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa: An Evaluation of Outcomes] – calculated a 10.5% reduction in the death rate in PEPFAR’s 12 focus countries, equating to 1.2 million lives saved at a cost of $2450 per death averted. In 2007, an evaluation of PEPFAR by the [[Institute of Medicine]] found that PEPFAR had made significant progress in reaching its targets for prevention, treatment and care but also reported that budget allocations "limit the Country Teams ability to harmonize PEPFARs activities with those of the partner government and other donors", and PEPFARs ABC (Abstinence, Be faithful, and correct and consistent Condom use) priorities "fragment the natural continuum of needs and services, often in ways that do not correspond with global standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medicine|first=Institute of|date=2007-09-17|title=PEPFAR Implementation|url=https://doi.org/10.17226/11905|language=en|doi=10.17226/11905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PEPFAR program has brought about substantial impact in its recipient countries. The level of urgency and scale of initiatives led through the PEPFAR program were commensurate with that of the HIV/AIDS epidemic at the time of implementation. Existing debates suggest that the next phase of the program consider placing emphasis on the development of knowledge surrounding HIV/AIDS programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S|first=Padian, Nancy|last2=B|first2=Holmes, Charles|last3=I|first3=McCoy, Sandra|last4=Rob|first4=Lyerla,|last5=D|first5=Bouey, Paul|last6=P|first6=Goosby, Eric|title=Implementation Science for the US Presidentʼs Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)|url=https://www.academia.edu/33942595/Implementation_Science_for_the_US_President%CA%BCs_Emergency_Plan_for_AIDS_Relief_PEPFAR_|journal=JAIDS Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes|language=en|volume=56|issue=3|issn=1525-4135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, taking into account [[cultural differences]] and country-specific conditions, it deals with the [[epidemiology]] of [[mental disorder]]s in different countries, their treatment options, mental health education, political and financial aspects, the structure of mental [[health care]] systems, [[Health human resources|human resources]] in mental health, and [[human rights]] issues among others.

The overall aim of the field of global mental health is to strengthen mental health all over the world by providing information about the mental health situation in all countries, and identifying mental health care needs in order to develop cost-effective interventions to meet those specific needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61238-0|pmid= 17804063|year= 2007|author1= Prince|first1= M|title= No health without mental health|journal= Lancet|volume= 370|issue= 9590|pages= 859–77|last2= Patel|first2= V|last3= Saxena|first3= S|last4= Maj|first4= M|last5= Maselko|first5= J|last6= Phillips|first6= M.

Mental, [[neurological]], and substance use disorders make a substantial contribution to the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]] (GBD).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthinfo/bod/en/index.html ''Global burden of disease'']. Geneva, WHO Health statistics and health information systems. Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a global measure of so-called [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALY's) assigned to a certain disease/disorder, which is a sum of the years lived with disability and years of life lost due to this disease within the total population.  [[Neuropsychiatry|Neuropsychiatric]] conditions account for 14% of the global burden of disease. Among [[non-communicable disease]]s, they account for 28% of the DALY's – more than [[cardiovascular disease]] or [[cancer]]. However, it is estimated that the real contribution of [[mental disorders]] to the global burden of disease is even higher, due to the complex interactions and co-morbidity of physical and mental illness.

Around the world, almost one million people die due to suicide every year, and it is the third leading cause of death among young people. The most important causes of disability due to health-related conditions worldwide include [[unipolar depression]], [[alcoholism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar depression]] and [[dementia]]. In low- and middle-income countries, these conditions represent a total of 19.1% of all disability related to health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/mhtargeting/development_targeting_mh_summary.pdf ''Mental Health and Development: Targeting People with Mental Health Conditions as Vulnerable Group''.] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment gap ==
It is estimated that one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/index.html ''Mental disorders affect one in four people.''] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many effective interventions for the treatment of mental disorders are known, and awareness of the need for treatment of people with mental disorders has risen, the proportion of those who need mental health care but who do not receive it remains very high.  This so-called "treatment gap" is estimated to reach between 76–85% for low- and middle-income countries, and 35–50% for high-income countries.

Despite the acknowledged need, for the most part there have not been substantial changes in mental health care delivery during the past years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turekian|first1=Vaughan|title=Mental Health Diplomacy|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=2014-06-23|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/editorial/2014/mental-health-diplomacy-building-global-response}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main reasons for this problem are public health priorities, lack of a mental health policy and legislation in many countries, a lack of resources – financial and human resources – as well as inefficient resource allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X|title=Barriers to improvement of mental health services in low-income and middle-income countries|journal=The Lancet|volume=370|issue=9593|pages=1164–1174|year=2007|last1=Saraceno|first1=Benedetto|last2=Van Ommeren|first2=Mark|last3=Batniji|first3=Rajaie|last4=Cohen|first4=Alex|last5=Gureje|first5=Oye|last6=Mahoney|first6=John|last7=Sridhar|first7=Devi|last8=Underhill|first8=Chris | pmid = 17804061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the World Health Organization estimated a shortage of 1.18 million [[mental health professional]]s, including 55,000 psychiatrists, 628,000
nurses in mental health settings, and 493,000 psychosocial care providers needed to treat mental disorders in 144 low- and middle-income countries. The annual wage bill to remove this [[Health Human Resources|health workforce]] shortage was estimated at about US$4.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffler RM et al. (2011). [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501019_eng.pdf ''Human resources for mental health: workforce shortages in low- and middle-income countries'']. Geneva, World Health Organization Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interventions ==
Information and evidence about cost-effective interventions to provide better mental health care are available.  Although most of the research (80%) has been carried out in high-income countries, there is also strong evidence from low- and middle-income countries that [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] and [[psychosocial]] interventions are effective ways to treat mental disorders, with the strongest evidence for depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hazardous alcohol use.

Recommendations to strengthen mental health systems around the world have been first mentioned in the WHO's [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2001'']],&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2001) [http://www.who.int/whr/2001/en/index.html ''The world health report 2001 – Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope'']. Geneva, WHO Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which focused on mental health:

# Provide treatment in primary care
# Make [[psychotropic drug]]s available
# Give care in the community
# Educate the public
# Involve communities, families and consumers
# Establish national policies, programs and [[legislation]]
# Develop [[Health Human Resources|human resources]]
# Link with other sectors
# Monitor community mental health
# Support more research

Based on the data of 12 countries, assessed by the ''WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems'' (WHO-AIMS),&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/WHO-AIMS/en/''Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems''.] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the costs of scaling up mental health services by providing a core treatment package for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depressive episodes and hazardous alcohol use have been estimated. Structural changes in mental health systems according to the WHO recommendations have been taken into account.

For most countries, this model suggests an initial period of investment of US$0.30 – 0.50 per person per year. The total expenditure on mental health would have to rise at least ten-fold in low-income countries. In those countries, additional financial resources will be needed, while in middle- and high-income countries the main challenge will be the reallocation of resources within the health system to provide better mental health service.

==Prevention==

Prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies, including the 2004 WHO report "Prevention of Mental Disorders", the 2008 EU "Pact for Mental Health" and the 2011 US National Prevention Strategy. NIMH or the National Institute of Mental Health has over 400 grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/research-areas/index.shtml|title=NIMH » Research Areas|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders==

=== World Health Organization (WHO) ===

Two of WHO's core programmes for mental health are WHO MIND (Mental health improvements for Nations Development) and Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP).

WHO MIND focuses on 5 areas of action to ensure concrete changes in people's daily lives.  These are:
#  Action in and support to countries to improve mental health, such as the WHO Pacific Island Mental Health network (PIMHnet)
#  Mental health policy, planning and service development
#  Mental health human rights and legislation
#  Mental health as a core part of human development
#  The QualityRights Project which works to unite and empower people to improve the quality of care and promote human rights in mental health facilities and social care homes.

Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) is WHO’s action plan to scale up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders for countries especially with low and lower middle incomes. The aim of mhGAP is to build partnerships for collective action and to reinforce the commitment of governments, international organizations and other stakeholders.

The mhGAP Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) was launched in October 2010.  It is a technical tool for the management of mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialist health settings.  The priority conditions included are: depression, psychosis, bipolar disorders, epilepsy, developmental and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents, dementia, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, self-harm/suicide and other significant emotional or medically unexplained complaints.

== Criticism ==

One of the most prominent critics of the Movement for Global Mental Health has been China Mills, author of the book ''Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World''.

Mills writes that:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mills, China. [https://www.academia.edu/4905979/Decolonizing_Global_Mental_Health_The_Psychiatrization_of_the_Majority_World Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World]. Retrieved October 17, 2014, from&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=This book charts the creeping of psychology and psychiatry across the borders of everyday experience and across geographical borders, as a form of colonialism that comes from within and from outside, swallowed in the form of a pill. It maps an anxious space where socio-economic crises come to be reconfigured as individual crisis – as 'mental illness'; and how potentially violent interventions come to be seen as 'essential' treatment.|sign=|source=}}

Another prominent critic is Ethan Watters, author of ''Crazy Like Us: The Globalization of the American Psyche''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Watters, Ethan (January 8, 2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6004">'''Health 3.0''' is a health-related extension of the concept of [[Web 3.0]] whereby the users' interface with the data and information available on the web is personalized to optimize their experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labnol.org/internet/web-3-concepts-explained/8908/|title=What is Web 3.0? Semantic Web &amp; other Web 3.0 Concepts Explained in Plain English|work=Digital Inspiration|accessdate= December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the concept of the [[Semantic Web]], wherein websites' data is accessible for sorting in order to tailor the presentation of information based on user preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-semantic-web|title=The Semantic Web|work=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health 3.0 will use such data access to enable individuals to better retrieve and contribute to personalized health-related information within networked electronic health records, and social networking resources.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=69404|title=Healthy Knowledge: Semantic Technology &amp; the Healthcare Revolution|author=Tony Shaw|date=17 August 2010|work=EContent Magazine|accessdate= December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=David B.|title=Health 3.0|journal=P&amp;T|year=2008|pmc=2730068|pmid=19749994|volume=33|issue=2|pages=69–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giustini, D. |date=2007|title= Web 3.0 and medicine: make way for the semantic web |journal= [[British Medical Journal]] |volume= 335 |pages=1273–1274|doi=10.1136/bmj.39428.494236.BE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health 3.0 has also been described as the idea of semantically organizing [[electronic health record]]s to create an Open Healthcare Information Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/05/prweb3957314.htm|title=SemTech 2010 Speaks Out About Health 3.0 -- Open Healthcare Information Architecture|date=5 May 2010|work=PRWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health care could also make use of social media, and incorporate virtual tools for enhanced interactions between health care providers and consumers/patients.&lt;ref name="ShachakJadad"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shachak A., Jadad A.R. | year = 2010 | title = Electronic Health Records in the Age of Social Networks and Global Telecommunications | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 303 | issue = 5| pages = 452–453 | doi=10.1001/jama.2010.63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

*Improved access to health related information on the web via semantic and networked resources will facilitate an improved understanding of health issues with the goal of increasing patient self-management, preventative care and enhancing health professional expertise.&lt;ref name="Shaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash" /&gt;
*Health 3.0 will foster the creation and maintenance of supportive virtual communities within which individuals can help one another understand, cope with, and manage common health-related issues.&lt;ref name="Nash" /&gt;
*Personalized social networking resources can also serve as a medium for health professionals to improve individuals' access to healthcare expertise, and to facilitate health professional-to-many-patients communication with the goal of improved acceptance, understanding and adherence to best therapeutic options.&lt;ref name="Nash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ShachakJadad"/&gt;
*"Digital healing" has been described as a goal of health 3.0. It involves patients obtaining reassurance, support, and validation from others via social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/ideas/38246?page=all|title=Health 3.0: Baby Boomers, Social Media &amp; the Evolution of Digital Healing|author=Joseph F. Coughlin|work=Big Think}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Health 3.0 is recommended to be able to gather imparted data through web-based technologies. Consumers and experts are to be connected by virtual reasoning tools – an expert system. The expert system that can use the collected information through the web-based technologies represent health 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enhancedmd.com/EMD_VirtualReasonWP.pdf | title=Virtual Reasoning Redefining Healthcare Through Health 3.0 | publisher=Enhanced Medical Decisions Inc. | author=Marlene Beggelman | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815062906/http://www.enhancedmd.com/EMD_VirtualReasonWP.pdf | archivedate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The current situation==

Social networking is a popular and powerful tool for engaging patients in their health care. These virtual communities provide a real-time resource for obtaining health-related knowledge and counselling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmir.org/2008/3/e22/|title=JMIR-Medicine 2.0: Social Networking, Collaboration, Participation, Apomediation, and Openness - Eysenbach - Journal of Medical Internet Research|work=Journal of Medical Internet Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pew Internet and American Life Project report that greater than 90% of young adults and nearly three quarters of all Americans access the internet on a regular basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="103966">'''Health equity''' refers to the study and causes of differences in the quality of [[health]] and [[healthcare]] across different populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of a Few Key Public Health Terms|url=http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/ohd/glossary.html|publisher=Office of Health Disparities, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health equity is different from health equality, as it refers only to the absence of disparities in controllable or remediable aspects of health. It is not possible to work towards complete equality in health, as there are some factors of health that are beyond human influence.&lt;ref&gt;WHO | Equity. (n.d.). ''WHO''. Retrieved February 27, 2014, from http://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/equity/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Inequity implies some kind of social injustice. Thus, if one population dies younger than another because of genetic differences, a non-remediable/controllable factor, we tend to say that there is a health inequality. On the other hand, if a population has a lower life expectancy due to lack of access to medications, the situation would be classified as a health inequity.&lt;ref&gt;Kawachi I., Subramanian S., Almeida-Filho N. "A glossary for health inequalities. ''J Epidemiol Community Health'' 2002;56:647–652;56:647–652&lt;/ref&gt; These inequities may include differences in the "presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care"&lt;ref name=goldberg-ohio&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; between populations with a different [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnic groups|ethnicity]], [[sexual orientation]] or [[socioeconomic]] status.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), [[Healthy People 2010]]: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, conference ed. in two vols (Washington, D.C., January 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Health equity falls into two major categories: horizontal equity, the equal treatment of individuals or groups in the same circumstances; and vertical equity, the principle that individuals who are unequal should be treated differently according to their level of need.&lt;ref&gt;JAN. Economic Analysis For Management And Policy [e-book]. Open University Press; 2005 [cited 2013 Mar 21]. Available from: MyiLibrary. &lt;http://lib.myilibrary.com?ID=95419&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Disparities in the quality of health across populations are well-documented globally in both developed and developing nations. The importance of equitable access to healthcare has been cited as crucial to achieving many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;Vandemoortele, Milo (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4751&amp;title=millennium-development-goals-equity-development The MDGs and equity] Overseas Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

== Socioeconomic status ==
[[Socioeconomic status]] is both a strong predictor of health, and a key factor underlying health inequities across populations&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 .&lt;/ref&gt;. Poor socioeconomic status has the capacity to profoundly limit the [[Capability approach#Capabilities|capabilities]] of an individual or population, manifesting itself through deficiencies in both [[Financial capital|financial]] and [[social capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ben-Shlomo Yoav, White Ian R., Marmot Michael | year = 1996 | title = Does the Variation in the Socioeconomic Characteristics of an Area Affect Mortality? | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 312 | issue = 7037| pages = 1013–1014 | doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7037.1013| pmc = 2350820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear how a lack of financial capital can compromise the capacity to maintain good health. In the UK, prior to the institution of the [[National Health Service|NHS]] reforms in the early 2000s, it was shown that income was an important determinant of access to healthcare resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morris S. |author2=Sutton M. |author3=Gravelle H. | year = 2005 | title = Inequity and inequality in the use of health care in England: an empirical investigation | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 6| pages = 1251–1266 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.07.016 |pmid=15626522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because one's job or career is a primary conduit for both financial and social capital, work is an important, yet under represented, factor in health inequities research and prevention efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahonen|first=Emily Quinn|last2=Fujishiro|first2=Kaori|last3=Cunningham|first3=Thomas|last4=Flynn|first4=Michael|date=2018-01-18|title=Work as an Inclusive Part of Population Health Inequities Research and Prevention|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=108|issue=3|pages=306–311|doi=10.2105/ajph.2017.304214|pmid=29345994|pmc=5803801|issn=0090-0036}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Maintenance of good health through the utilization of proper healthcare resources can be quite costly and therefore unaffordable to certain populations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kawachi I., Kennedy B.

In China, for instance, the collapse of the [[Healthcare reform in China|Cooperative Medical System]] left many of the rural poor uninsured and unable to access the resources necessary to maintain good health&lt;ref&gt;Sun, X., Jackson, S., Carmichael, G. and Sleigh, A.C., 2009. Catastrophic medical payment and financial protection in rural China: evidence from the New Cooperative Medical Scheme in Shandong Province. Health economics, 18(1), pp.103-119.&lt;/ref&gt;. Increases in the cost of medical treatment made healthcare increasingly unaffordable for these populations. This issue was further perpetuated by the rising [[income inequality]] in the Chinese population. Poor Chinese were often unable to undergo necessary hospitalization and failed to complete treatment regimens, resulting in poorer health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Zhao, Zhongwei 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhao Zhongwei | year = 2006 | title = Income Inequality, Unequal Health Care Access, and Mortality in China | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 461–483 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00133.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in Tanzania, it was demonstrated that wealthier families were far more likely to bring their children to a healthcare provider: a significant step towards stronger healthcare.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some scholars have noted that unequal income distribution itself can be a cause of poorer health for a society as a result of "underinvestment in social goods, such as public education and health care; disruption of social cohesion and the erosion of social capital".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The role of socioeconomic status in health equity extends beyond simple monetary restrictions on an individual's purchasing power. In fact, [[social capital]] plays a significant role in the health of individuals and their communities. It has been shown that those who are better connected to the resources provided by the individuals and communities around them (those with more social capital) live longer lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = House J.

A 1998 epidemiological study'' ''showed that community healthcare approaches fared far better than individual approaches in the prevention of heart disease mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lomas Jonathan | year = 1998 | title = Social Capital and Health: Implications for Public Health and Epidemiology | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 9| pages = 1181–1188 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(98)00190-7| citeseerx = 10.1.1.460.596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty used by some programs in the developing world appear to lead to a reduction in the likelihood of being sick.&lt;ref name="doi10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Unconditional cash transfers for reducing poverty and vulnerabilities: effect on use of health services and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |pages=CD011135 |year=2017 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD011135.pub2 |pmid=29139110 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Liu |first2=Sze |last3=Walter |first3=Stefan  |last4=Pabayo |first4=Roman |last5=Saith |first5=Ruhi |last6=Lhachimi |first6=Stefan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such evidence can guide resource allocations to effective interventions.

=== Education ===
Education is an important factor in healthcare utilization, though it is closely intertwined with economic status. An individual may not go to a medical professional or seek care if they don’t know the ills of their failure to do so, or the value of proper treatment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Tajikistan, since the nation gained its independence, the likelihood of giving birth at home has increased rapidly among women with lower educational status. Education also has a significant impact on the quality of prenatal and maternal healthcare. Mothers with primary education consulted a doctor during pregnancy at significantly lower rates (72%) when compared to those with a secondary education (77%), technical training (88%) or a higher education (100%).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Falkingham Jane | year = 2003 | title = Inequality and Changes in Women's Use of Maternal Health-Care Services in Tajikistan | url = | journal = Studies in Family Planning | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 32–43 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2003.00032.x| pmid = 12772444 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence for a correlation between socioeconomic status and health literacy; one study showed that wealthier Tanzanian families were more likely to recognize disease in their children than those that were coming from lower income backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schellenberg J. A. |author2=Victora C.

== Spatial disparities in health ==
{{see also|Healthcare reform in China}}

For some populations, access to healthcare and health resources is physically limited, resulting in health inequities. For instance, an individual might be physically incapable of traveling the distances required to reach healthcare services, or long distances can make seeking regular care unappealing despite the potential benefits.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Banerjee, A., Banerjee, A. V., &amp; Duflo, E. (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=em3_AgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty]''. PublicAffairs.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Global physician density map - WHO 2010.png|thumb|Global concentrations of healthcare resources, as depicted by the number of physicians per 100,000 individuals, by country.]]Costa Rica, for example, has demonstrable health spatial inequities with 12–14% of the population living in areas where healthcare is inaccessible. Inequity has decreased in some areas of the nation as a result of the work of healthcare reform programs, however those regions not served by the programs have experienced a slight increase in inequity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosero-Bixby L | year = 2004 | title = Spatial access to health care in Costa Rica and its equity: a GIS-based study | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 58 | issue = 7| pages = 1271–1284 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(03)00322-8 | pmid = 14759675 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

China experienced a serious decrease in spatial health equity following the Chinese economic revolution in the 1980s as a result of the degradation of the [[Healthcare reform in China|Cooperative Medical System]] (CMS). The CMS provided an infrastructure for the delivery of healthcare to rural locations, as well as a framework to provide funding based upon communal contributions and government subsidies. In its absence, there was a significant decrease in the quantity of healthcare professionals (35.9%), as well as functioning clinics (from 71% to 55% of villages over 14 years) in rural areas, resulting in inequitable healthcare for rural populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liu Y. |author2=Hsiao W. C. |author3=Eggleston K. | year = 1999 | title = Equity in health and health care: the Chinese experience | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 10| pages = 1349–1356 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00207-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The significant poverty experienced by rural workers (some earning less than 1 USD per day) further limits access to healthcare, and results in malnutrition and poor general hygiene, compounding the loss of healthcare resources.&lt;ref name="Zhao, Zhongwei 2006"/&gt; The loss of the CMS has had noticeable impacts on life expectancy, with rural regions such as areas of Western China experiencing significantly lower life expectancies.&lt;ref&gt;Qian Jiwei. (n.d.). ''Regional Inequality in Healthcare in China''. East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang H, Xu T, Xu J | year = 2007 | title = Factors Contributing to High Costs and Inequality in China's Health Care System | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 298 | issue = 16| pages = 1928–1930 | doi=10.1001/jama.298.16.1928 | pmid=17954544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, populations in rural Tajikistan experience spatial health inequities. A study by [[Jane Falkingham]] noted that physical access to healthcare was one of the primary factors influencing quality of maternal healthcare. Further, many women in rural areas of the country did not have adequate access to healthcare resources, resulting in poor maternal and neonatal care. These rural women were, for instance, far more likely to give birth in their homes without medical oversight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Ethnic and racial disparities==
{{see also|Race and health}}

Along with the socioeconomic factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities in health and access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that [[Race and health in the United States|these racially centered disparities continue to exist]] and are a significant social health issue.&lt;ref name="Weinick"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weinick R. M. |author2=Zuvekas S. H. |author3=Cohen J. W. | year = 2000 | title = Racial and ethnic differences in access to and use of health care services, 1977 to 1996. Medical care research and review | url = | journal = MCRR | volume = 57 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 36–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences in the quality of care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower quality care than their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Eric C.|date=2002-03-13|title=Racial Disparities in the Quality of Care for Enrollees in Medicare Managed Care|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/194724|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=287|issue=10|doi=10.1001/jama.287.10.1288|issn=0098-7484|page=1288}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their white counterparts made an average of $54,920.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=pcc&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=4&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX1838000217&amp;&amp;docId=GALE&amp;#124;CX1838000217&amp;docType=GALE|title = African American Poverty Leads to Health Disparities|date = 2010|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher = UXL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

There are also considerable racial disparities in access to insurance coverage, with ethnic minorities generally having less insurance coverage than non-ethnic minorities. For example, Hispanic Americans tend to have less insurance coverage than white Americans and as a result receive less regular medical care. The level of insurance coverage is directly correlated with access to healthcare including preventative and [[ambulatory]] care.&lt;ref name="Weinick" /&gt; A 2010 study on racial and ethnic disparities in health done by the [[Institute of Medicine]] has shown that the aforementioned disparities cannot solely be accounted for in terms of certain demographic characteristics like: insurance status, household income, education, age, geographic location and quality of living conditions. Even when the researchers corrected for these factors, the disparities persist.&lt;ref name="unequal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson A | year = 2002 | title = Unequal treatment: confronting racial and ethnic disparities in health care | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594273/pdf/jnma00325-0024.pdf | journal = Journal of the National Medical Association | volume = 94 | issue = | page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery has contributed to [[Race and health in the United States#African-Americans|disparate health outcomes for generations of African Americans in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaskins|first1=Darrell J.|title=RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND WEALTH: THE EFFECTS OF SLAVERY AND PAST DISCRIMINATION|journal=Review of Black Political Economy|date=Spring 2005|volume=32|issue=America: History &amp; Life, EBSCOhost|page=95|accessdate=|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12114-005-1007-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic health inequities also appear in nations across the African continent. A survey of the child mortality of major ethnic groups across 11 African nations (Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia) was published in 2000 by the WHO. The study described the presence of significant ethnic parities in the child mortality rates among children younger than 5 years old, as well as in education and vaccine use.&lt;ref name=pmid10686731&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10686731 |pmc=2560588 |year=2000 |author1=Brockerhoff |first1=M |title=Inequality of child mortality among ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=30–41 |last2=Hewett |first2=P }}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, the legacy of apartheid still manifests itself as a differential access to social services, including healthcare based upon race and social class, and the resultant health inequities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bloom G. |author2=McIntyre D. | year = 1998 | title = Towards equity in health in an unequal society | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 10| pages = 1529–1538 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(98)00233-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McIntyre D. |author2=Gilson L. | year = 2002 | title = Putting equity in health back onto the social policy agenda: experience from South Africa | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 11| pages = 1637–1656 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(01)00332-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, evidence suggests systematic disregard of indigenous populations in a number of countries. The Pygmys of Congo, for instance, are excluded from government health programs, discriminated against during public health campaigns, and receive poorer overall healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ohenjo N. |author2=Willis R. |author3=Jackson D. |author4=Nettleton C. |author5=Good K. |author6=Mugarura B. | year = 2006 | title = Health of Indigenous people in Africa | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9526| pages = 1937–1946 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68849-1 |pmid=16765763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey of five European countries (Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Italy, and France), a 1995 survey noted that only Sweden provided access to translators for 100% of those who needed it, while the other countries lacked this service potentially compromising healthcare to non-native populations. Given that non-natives composed a considerable section of these nations (6%, 17%, 3%, 1%, and 6% respectively), this could have significant detrimental effects on the health equity of the nation. In France, an older study noted significant differences in access to healthcare between native French populations, and non-French/migrant populations based upon health expenditure; however this was not fully independent of poorer economic and working conditions experienced by these populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bollini P. |author2=Siem H. | year = 1995 | title = No real progress towards equity: Health of migrants and ethnic minorities on the eve of the year 2000 | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 41 | issue = 6| pages = 819–828 | doi = 10.1016/0277-9536(94)00386-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study of race-based health inequity in Australia revealed that [[Indigenous health in Australia|Aborigines experienced higher rates of mortality]] than non-Aborigine populations. Aborigine populations experienced 10 times greater mortality in the 30–40 age range; 2.5 times greater infant mortality rate, and 3 times greater age standardized mortality rate. Rates of diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis are also significantly greater in this population (16 and 15 times greater respectively), which is indicative of the poor healthcare of this ethnic group. At this point in time, the parities in life expectancy at birth between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples were highest in Australia, when compared to the US, Canada and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mooney G | year = 1996 | title = And now for vertical equity?

Recognizing the need for LGBT healthcare research, the Director of the [[National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities]] (NIMHD) at the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] designated sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) as a health disparity population for NIH research in October 2016.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Meads, C.; Pennant, M.; McManus, J.; Bayliss, S.

Additionally, members of the LGBT community contend with health care disparities due, in part, to lack of provider training and awareness of the population’s healthcare needs.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; Studies regarding patient-provider communication in the LGBT patient community show that providers themselves report a significant lack of awareness regarding the health issues LGBT-identifying patients face.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt; As a component of this fact, medical schools do not focus much attention on LGBT health issues in their curriculum; the LGBT-related topics that are discussed tend to be limited to HIV/AIDS, sexual orientation, and gender identity.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;

This interaction is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing between sex and gender given their intertwined nature; sex modifies gender, and gender can modify sex, thereby impacting health.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;Sex and gender can both be considered sources of health disparity; both contribute to men and women’s susceptibility to various health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disorders.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Health disparities in the male population ===
As sex and gender are inextricably linked in day-to-day life, their union is apparent in medicine. Gender and sex are both components of health disparity in the male population. In non-Western regions, males tend to have a health advantage over women due to gender discrimination, evidenced by infanticide, early marriage, and domestic abuse for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fikree|first=FF|last2=Pasha|first2=O|date=2004|title=Role of gender in health disparity: the South Asian context|url=|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=328 | issue = 7443 |pages=823–826|via=|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7443.823|pmid=15070642|pmc=383384}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most regions of the world, the mortality rate is higher for adult men than for adult women; for example, adult men suffer from fatal illnesses with more frequency than females.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/child-adolescenthealth/New_Publications/ADH/WHO_FCH_CAH_00.7.pdf|title=What about boys?

In a number of countries, males also face a heightened risk of mortality as a result of behavior and greater propensity for violence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Physicians tend to offer invasive procedures to male patients more than female patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kent|first=Jennifer|last2=Patel|first2=Vinisha|last3=Varela|first3=Natalie|date=2012|title=Gender Disparities in Healthcare|url=|journal=Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine|volume=79|issue=5|pages=555–559|via=|doi=10.1002/msj.21336|pmid=22976361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, men are more likely to smoke than women and experience smoking-related health complications later in life as a result; this trend is also observed in regard to other substances, such as marijuana, in Jamaica, where the rate of use is 2–3 times more for men than women.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Lastly, men are more likely to have severe chronic conditions and a lower life expectancy than women in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Courtenay|first=Will H|date=2000-05-16|title=Constructions of masculinity and their influence on men's well-being: a theory of gender and health|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=50|issue=10|pages=1385–1401|doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00390-1|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.4452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health disparities in the female population ===
Gender and sex are also components of health disparity in the female population. The 2012 [[World Development Report]] (WDR) noted that women in [[Developing country|developing nations]] experience greater [[mortality rate]]s than men in developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. (2012). World Development Report on Gender Equality and Development.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, women in developing countries have a much higher risk of [[maternal death]] than those in developed countries. The highest risk of dying during childbirth is 1 in 6 in Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, compared to nearly 1 in 30,000 in Sweden—a disparity that is much greater than that for neonatal or [[child mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronsmans|first=Carine|last2=Graham|first2=Wendy J|title=Maternal mortality: who, when, where, and why |journal=The Lancet|volume=368|issue=9542|pages=1189–1200|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69380-x|pmid=17011946|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While women in the United States tend to live longer than men, they generally are of lower [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) and therefore have more barriers to accessing healthcare.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Read|first=Jen'nan Ghazal|last2=Gorman|first2=Bridget K.|date=2010|title=Gender and Health Inequality |journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=36|issue=1|pages=371–386|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102535}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being of lower SES also tends to increase societal pressures, which can lead to higher rates of [[Depression (differential diagnoses)|depression]] and chronic stress and, in turn, negatively impact health.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Women are also more likely than men to suffer from [[Sexual violence|sexual]] or [[Intimate partner violence|intimate-partner violence]] both in the United States and worldwide.

Women have better access to healthcare in the United States than they do in many other places in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaidya|first=Varun|last2=Partha|first2=Gautam|last3=Karmakar|first3=Monita|date=2011-11-14|title=Gender Differences in Utilization of Preventive Care Services in the United States |journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=21|issue=2|pages=140–145|doi=10.1089/jwh.2011.2876|pmid=22081983|issn=1540-9996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one population study conducted in Harlem, New York, 86% of women reported having privatized or publicly assisted health insurance, while only 74% of men reported having any health insurance.

This has led to post-approval [[Adverse effect|adverse events]] among women, resulting in several drugs being pulled from the market.

=== Cultural factors ===
Health disparities are also due in part to cultural factors that involve practices based not only on sex, but also gender status. For example, in [[China]], health disparities have distinguished medical treatment for men and women due to the cultural phenomenon of preference for male children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mu|first=Ren|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiaobo|date=2011-01-01|title=Why does the Great Chinese Famine affect the male and female survivors differently?

In [[India]], gender-based health inequities are apparent in early childhood. Many families provide better nutrition for boys in the interest of maximizing future productivity given that boys are generally seen as [[Breadwinner model|breadwinners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Behrman J. R.|year=1988|title=Intrahousehold Allocation of Nutrients in Rural India: Are Boys Favored? Do Parents Exhibit Inequality Aversion?|url=|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|volume=40|issue=1|pages=32–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, boys receive better care than girls and are hospitalized at a greater rate.

Additionally, the cultural practice of [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) is known to impact women's health, though is difficult to know the worldwide extent of this practice. While generally thought of as a [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n practice, it may have roots in the [[Middle East]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uwer|first=Thomas von der Osten-Sacken ; Thomas|date=2007-01-01|title=Is Female Genital Mutilation an Islamic Problem?|url=http://www.meforum.org/1629/is-female-genital-mutilation-an-islamic-problem/|journal=Middle East Quarterly|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated 3 million girls who are subjected to FGM each year potentially suffer both immediate and lifelong negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/|title=Female genital mutilation (FGM)|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following FGM, girls commonly experience excessive bleeding and [[Urinary retention|urine retention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rhmjournal.org.uk/2015/03/immediate-health-consequences-of-female-genital-mutilation/|title=Immediate health consequences of female genital mutilation {{!}} Reproductive Health Matters: reproductive &amp; sexual health and rights|date=2015-03-01|work=Reproductive Health Matters: reproductive &amp; sexual health and rights|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term consequences include [[urinary tract infection]]s, [[bacterial vaginosis]], [[Dyspareunia|pain during intercourse]], and difficulties in childbirth that include prolonged labor, vaginal tears, and excessive bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunnskapssenteret.no/en/publications/gynecological-consequences-of-female-genital-mutilation-cutting-fgm-c|title=Gynecological consequences of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C)|website=Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter for helsetjenesten|language=en|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Rigmor|last2=Underland|first2=Vigdis|date=June 10, 2013|title=The Obstetric Consequences of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ogi/2013/496564/abs/|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology International|volume=2013|doi=10.1155/2013/496564|pmid=23878544|pmc=3710629|via=|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who have undergone FGM also have higher rates of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex virus 2]] (HSV2) than women who have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrendt|first=Alice|last2=Moritz|first2=Steffen|date=2005-05-01|title=Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Memory Problems After Female Genital Mutilation |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=162|issue=5|pages=1000–1002|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.1000|pmid=15863806|issn=0002-953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morison|first=Linda|last2=Scherf|first2=Caroline|last3=Ekpo|first3=Gloria|last4=Paine|first4=Katie|last5=West|first5=Beryl|last6=Coleman|first6=Rosalind|last7=Walraven|first7=Gijs|date=2001-08-01|title=The long-term reproductive health consequences of female genital cutting in rural Gambia: a community-based survey |journal=Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health|language=en|volume=6|issue=8|pages=643–653|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3156.2001.00749.x|issn=1365-3156|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-3156.2001.00749.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals living in rural areas, especially poor rural areas, have access to fewer health care resources. Although 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, only 9 percent of physicians practice in rural settings. Individuals in rural areas typically must travel longer distances for care, experience long waiting times at clinics, or are unable to obtain the necessary health care they need in a timely manner. Rural areas characterized by a largely Hispanic population average 5.3 physicians per 10,000 residents compared with 8.7 physicians per 10,000 residents in nonrural areas. Financial barriers to access, including lack of health insurance, are also common among the urban poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/field-based-outreach-workers-facilitate-access-health-care-and-social-services-underserved |title=Field-Based Outreach Workers Facilitate Access to Health Care and Social Services for Underserved Individuals in Rural Areas |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disparities in access to health care==

Reasons for disparities in access to health care are many, but can include the following:

* '''Lack of [[universal health care]] or [[health insurance]] coverage'''. Without health insurance, patients are more likely to postpone medical care, go without needed medical care, go without prescription medicines, and be denied access to care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tikkanen|first1=Roosa Sofia|last2=Woolhandler|first2=Steffie|last3=Himmelstein|first3=David U.|last4=Kressin|first4=Nancy R.|last5=Hanchate|first5=Amresh|last6=Lin|first6=Meng-Yun|last7=McCormick|first7=Danny|last8=Lasser|first8=Karen E.|title=Hospital Payer and Racial/Ethnic Mix at Private Academic Medical Centers in Boston and New York City|journal=International Journal of Health Services|volume=47|issue=3|date=2 February 2017|pages=460–476|doi=10.1177/0020731416689549|pmid=28152644|pmc=6090544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minority groups in the United States lack insurance coverage at higher rates than whites.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured (KCMU), "The Uninsured and Their Access to Health Care" (December 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This problem does not exist in countries with fully funded public health systems, such as the examplar of the [[National Health Service|NHS]].
* '''Lack of a regular source of care'''. Without access to a regular source of care, patients have greater difficulty obtaining care, fewer doctor visits, and more difficulty obtaining prescription drugs. Compared to whites, minority groups in the United States are less likely to have a doctor they go to on a regular basis and are more likely to use [[emergency rooms]] and [[clinics]] as their regular source of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fryer G. E. |author2=Dovey S. M. |author3=Green L. A. | year = 2000 | title = The Importance of Having a Usual Source of Health Care | url = | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 62 | issue = | page = 477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, which is much more racially harmonious, this issue arises for a different reason; since 2004, NHS [[General practitioners|GPs]] have not been responsible for care out of normal GP surgery opening hours, leading to significantly higher attendances in [[Emergency department|A+E]]
* '''Lack of financial resources'''. Although the lack of financial resources is a barrier to health care access for many Americans, the impact on access appears to be greater for minority populations.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth Fund (CMWF), [http://www.commonwealthfund.org/News/News-Releases/1999/May/Analysis-Of-Minority-Health-Reveals-Persistent--Widespread-Disparities.aspx "Analysis of Minority Health Reveals Persistent, Widespread Disparities,"] press release (May 14, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Legal]] barriers'''. Access to medical care by low-income immigrant minorities can be hindered by legal barriers to public insurance programs.  For example, in the United States federal law bars states from providing [[Medicaid]] coverage to [[immigrants]] who have been in the country fewer than five years.&lt;ref name="Goldberg, J. 2004 page 10"&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J.

Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example could be when a non-English speaking person attends a clinic where the receptionist does not speak the person's language. This is mostly seen in Hispanic people who do not speak English. 
* '''Structural barriers'''. These barriers include poor transportation, an inability to schedule appointments quickly or during convenient hours, and excessive time spent in the waiting room, all of which affect a person's ability and willingness to obtain needed care.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), "National Healthcare Disparities Report," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (July 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The health care financing system'''. The [[Institute of Medicine]] in the United States says fragmentation of the U.S. health care delivery and financing system is a barrier to accessing care. Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be enrolled in health insurance plans which place limits on covered services and offer a limited number of health care providers.&lt;ref name="Goldberg, J. 2004 page 10"/&gt;
* '''Scarcity of providers'''. In inner cities, rural areas, and communities with high concentrations of minority populations, access to medical care can be limited due to the scarcity of primary care practitioners, specialists, and diagnostic facilities.&lt;ref name="K. Collins, D. Hughes 2002"&gt;[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Fund-Reports/2002/Mar/Diverse-Communities--Common-Concerns--Assessing-Health-Care-Quality-for-Minority-Americans.aspx K. Collins, D. Hughes, M. Doty, B. Ives, J. Edwards, and K. Tenney, "Diverse Communities, Common Concerns: Assessing Health Care Quality for Minority Americans]," Commonwealth Fund (March 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] (a [[quango]]) has a legal obligation to ensure that sufficient provision exists in all parts of the nation.
* '''Linguistic barriers'''. Language differences restrict access to medical care for minorities in the United States who are not [[English language|English]]-proficient.&lt;ref&gt;National Health Law Program and the Access Project (NHeLP), Language Services Action Kit: Interpreter Services in Health Care Settings for People With Limited English Proficiency (February 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Health [[literacy]].''' This is where patients have problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. For example, patients with a poor understanding of good health may not know when it is necessary to seek care for certain symptoms. While problems with health literacy are not limited to minority groups, the problem can be more pronounced in these groups than in whites due to socioeconomic and educational factors.&lt;ref name="K. Collins, D. Hughes 2002"/&gt; A study conducted in Mdantsane, South Africa depicts the correlation of maternal education and the antenatal visits for pregnancy. As patients have a greater education, they tend to use maternal health care services more than those with a lesser maternal education background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Determinants of access to and use of maternal health care services in the Eastern Cape, South Africa- a quantitative and qualitative investigation|last = Mluleki Tsawe|first = Appunni Sathiya Susuman|date = 2014|journal = BMC Research Notes|doi = 10.1186/1756-0500-7-723|pmid = 25315012|pmc = 4203863|access-date =|volume=7|pages=723}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lack of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in the health care workforce'''. A major reason for disparities in access to care are the [[cultural]] differences between predominantly white health care providers and minority patients. Only 4% of physicians in the United States are African American, and Hispanics represent just 5%, even though these percentages are much less than their groups' proportion of the United States population.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Age.''' Age can also be a factor in health disparities for a number of reasons. As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care expenses difficult. Additionally, they may face other barriers such as impaired mobility or lack of transportation which make accessing health care services challenging for them physically. Also, they may not have the opportunity to access health information via the internet as less than 15% of Americans over the age of 65 have access to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brodie M, Flournoy RE, Altman DE | year = 2000 | title = Health information, the Internet, and the digital divide | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 255–65 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.19.6.255| pmid = 11192412 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could put older individuals at a disadvantage in terms of accessing valuable information about their health and how to protect it. On the other hand, older individuals in the US (65 or above) are provided with medical care via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].

==Disparities in quality of health care==

Health disparities in the quality of care exist and are based on language and ethnicity/race which includes:

=== Problems with patient-provider communication ===
Communication is critical for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care.   The patient provider relationship is dependent on the ability of both individuals to effectively communicate.  Language and culture both play a significant role in communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians.  Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask.&lt;ref name="Health Care Quality Survey"&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Care Quality Survey|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Surveys/2001/2001-Health-Care-Quality-Survey.aspx|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time.&lt;ref name="Health Care Quality Survey" /&gt; Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Betancourt|first=J. R.|title=Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care|year=2002|publisher=Institute of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers.  Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater.  Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one.  The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ku|first=L.|author2=Flores, G.|title=Pay Now or Pay Later: Providing Interpreter Services in Health Care|journal=Health Affairs|date=Mar–Apr 2005|volume=24|issue=2|pages=435–444|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.2.435|pmid=15757928}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor communication contributes to poor medical compliance and health outcomes.  Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient.  However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez|title=Physician Language Ability and Cultural Competence|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|date=Feb 2004|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167–174|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.30266.x|pmc=1492135|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flores|title=Errors in Medical Interpretation and their Potential Clinical Consequences in Pediatric Encounters|journal=Pediatrics|date=Jan 2003|volume=111|issue=1|pages=6–14|doi=10.1542/peds.111.1.6|pmid=12509547|display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.488.9277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamers|author2=McNulty|title=Professional Interpreters and Bilingual Physicians in a Pediatric Emergency Department|journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|date=Nov 2002|volume=156|issue=11|pages=1108–1113|doi=10.1001/archpedi.156.11.1108}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers.   It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients’ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting.  Understanding a patients’ view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment.  So providers need to assess patients’ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kleinman|first=A.|author2=Eisenberg, L. |title=Culture, Illness and Care: Clinical Lessons for Anthropologic and Cross Culture Research|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|year=1978|volume=88|issue=2|pages=251–258|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-88-2-251|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Other type of communication problems are seen in LGBT health care with the spoken heterosexist (conscious or unconscious) attitude on LGBT patients, lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men (lesbians, gynecologic examinations) and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VA2roY9wVq0C&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=Heterosexism+in+Health+and+Social+Care&amp;ei=SF1fSq6DDJbyzQSX4JnBBQ&amp;hl=en Handbook of health behavior research, David S. Gochman]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Provider discrimination ===
Provider [[discrimination]] occurs when health care providers either unconsciously or consciously treat certain racial and ethnic patients differently from other patients. This may be due to stereotypes that providers may have towards ethnic/racial groups. Doctors are more likely to ascribe negative racial stereotypes to their minority patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Ryn|first=M.|author2=Burke, J.|title=The effect of Patient Race and Socio-economic Status on Physicians' Perceptions on Patients|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2000|volume=50|issue=6|pages=813–828|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00338-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur regardless of consideration for education, income, and personality characteristics. Two types of stereotypes may be involved, [[Implicit stereotype|automatic stereotypes]] or goal modified stereotypes.  Automated stereotyping is when stereotypes are automatically activated and influence judgments/behaviors outside of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Burgess 2006 119–134"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=D.

Critics question this research and say further studies are needed to determine how doctors and patients make their treatment decisions. Others argue that certain diseases cluster by ethnicity and that clinical decision making does not always reflect these differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smedley B. |author2=Stith A. |author3=Nelson A. | year = 2002 | title = Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2594273/pdf/jnma00325-0024.pdf | journal = Institute of Medicine | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of preventive care ===
According to the 2009 National Healthcare Disparities Report, uninsured Americans are less likely to receive preventive services in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Habib JL | year = 2010 | title = Progress lags in infection prevention and health disparities | url = http://www.patientcareonline.com/drug-benefit-trends/progress-lags-infection-prevention-and-health-disparities | journal = Drug Benefit Trends | volume = 22 | issue = 4| page = 112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, minorities are not regularly screened for [[colon cancer]] and the death rate for colon cancer has increased among African Americans and Hispanic populations. Furthermore, limited English proficient patients are also less likely to receive preventive health services such as mammograms.&lt;ref name=pmid9276652&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9276652 |pmc=1497155 |year=1997 |author1=Woloshin |first1=S |title=Is language a barrier to the use of preventive services? |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=472–7 |last2=Schwartz |first2=L. M |last3=Katz |first3=S. J |last4=Welch |first4=H. G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that use of professional interpreters have significantly reduced disparities in the rates of fecal occult testing, flu immunizations and pap smears.&lt;ref name=pmid11520385&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016007468.x |pmid=11520385 |pmc=1495243 |title=Impact of interpreter services on delivery of health care to limited-English-proficient patients |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=468–74 |year=2001 |last1=Jacobs |first1=Elizabeth A |last2=Lauderdale |first2=Diane S |last3=Meltzer |first3=David |last4=Shorey |first4=Jeanette M |last5=Levinson |first5=Wendy |last6=Thisted |first6=Ronald A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, [[Public Health England]], a universal service free at the point of use, which forms part of the NHS, offers regular screening to any member of the population considered to be in an at-risk group (such as individuals over 45) for major disease (such as colon cancer, or diabetic-retinopathy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screening.nhs.uk/programmes UK-wide screening programmes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screening.nhs.uk/cms.php?folder=2844 England-specific programmes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plans for achieving health equity==
There are a multitude of strategies for achieving health equity and reducing disparities outlined in scholarly texts, some examples include:

* '''Advocacy'''. Advocacy for health equity has been identified as a key means of promoting favourable policy change.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Social Determinants of Health. Closing the gap in a generation: health equity through action on the social determinants of health. Final Report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. 2008. Available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; EuroHealthNet carried out a systematic review of the academic and grey literature. It found, amongst other things, that certain kinds of evidence may be more persuasive in advocacy efforts, that practices associated with knowledge transfer and translation can increase the uptake of knowledge, that there are many different potential advocates and targets of advocacy and that advocacy efforts need to be tailored according to context and target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farrer L. |author2=Marinetti C. |author3=Cavaco Y. K. |author4=Costongs C. | year = 2015 | title = Advocacy for Health Equity: A Synthesis Review | url = | journal = Milbank Quarterly | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 392–437 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0009.12112 |pmid=26044634 |pmc=4462882 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of its work, it produced an online advocacy for health equity toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://health-gradient.eu/health-advocacy-toolkit/ | title=Health Gradient &amp;#124; EuroHealthNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Provider based incentives to improve healthcare for ethnic populations'''. One source of health inequity stems from unequal treatment of non-white patients in comparison with white patients. Creating provider based incentives to create greater parity between treatment of white and non-white patients is one proposed solution to eliminate provider bias.&lt;ref&gt;http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These incentives typically are monetary because of its effectiveness in influencing physician behavior. 
* '''Using Evidence Based Medicine (EBM)'''. Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) shows promise in reducing healthcare provider bias in turn promoting health equity.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, J. R., &amp; Maina, A. (2007). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-59745-485-8_5 Barriers to Eliminating Disparities in Clinical Practice]. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (83-98). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory EBM can reduce disparities however other research suggests that it might exacerbate them instead. Some cited shortcomings include EBM’s injection of clinical inflexibility in decision making and its origins as a purely cost driven measure.&lt;ref&gt;Maxey, R. W., &amp; Williams, R. A. (2007). Second Class Medicine: Implications of Evidence-Based Medicine for Improving Minority Access to the Correct Pharmaceutical Therapy. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (99-120). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Increasing awareness'''. The most cited measure to improving health equity relates to increasing public awareness. A lack of public awareness is a key reason why there has not been significant gains in reducing health disparities in ethnic and minority populations. Increased public awareness would lead to increased congressional awareness, greater availability of disparity data, and further research into the issue of health disparities.
* '''The Gradient Evaluation Framework'''. The evidence base defining which policies and interventions are most effective in reducing health inequalities is extremely weak. It is important therefore that policies and interventions which seek to influence health inequity be more adequately evaluated. Gradient Evaluation Framework (GEF) is an action-oriented policy tool that can be applied to assess whether policies will contribute to greater health equity amongst children and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://health-gradient.eu/gef-the-gradient-evaluation-framework/ | title=Health Gradient &amp;#124; EuroHealthNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The AIM framework'''. In a pilot study, researchers examined the role of AIM—ability, incentives, and management feedback—in reducing care disparity in pressure-ulcer detection between African American and Caucasian residents. The results showed that while the program was implemented, the provision of (1) training to enhance ability, (2) monetary incentives to enhance motivation, and (3) management feedback to enhance accountability led to successful reduction in pressure ulcers. Specifically, the detection gap between the two groups decreased. The researchers suggested additional replications with longer duration to assess the effectiveness of the AIM framework.
* '''Monitoring actions on the social determinants of health'''. In 2017, citing the need for accounatbility for the pledges made by countries in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Detereminants of Health, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund called for the monitoring of intersectoral interventions on the social detereminants of health that improve health equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |pmid=29147060 |pmc=5677605 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784–787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health inequalities==
Health inequality is the term used in a number of countries to refer to those instances whereby the health of two demographic groups (not necessarily ethnic or racial groups) differs despite comparative access to health care services. Such examples include higher rates of [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] for those in lower occupational classes than those in higher occupational classes, and the increased likelihood of those from ethnic minorities being diagnosed with a mental health disorder. In [[Canada]], the issue was brought to public attention by the [[LaLonde report]].

In [[UK]], the [[Black Report]] was produced in 1980 to highlight inequalities. On 11 February 2010, Sir [[Michael Marmot]], an epidemiologist at University College London, published the ''Fair Society, Healthy Lives'' report on the relationship between health and poverty. Marmot described his findings as illustrating a "social gradient in health": the life expectancy for the poorest is seven years shorter than for the most wealthy, and the poor are more likely to have a disability. In its report on this study, ''The Economist'' argued that the material causes of this contextual health inequality include unhealthful lifestyles - smoking remains more common, and obesity is increasing fastest, amongst the poor in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displayStory.cfm?story_id=15501633|title=In sickness and in health|journal=The Economist|date=11 February 2010|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the [[European Commission]] launched the Joint Action Health Equity in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/chafea/news/news599.html|title=IA new Joint Action to tackle health inequalities in Europe|date= 21–22 June 2018|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-nine participants from 25 [[European Union]] Member States will work together to address health inequalities and the underlying [[social determinants of health]] across Europe. Under the coordination of the [[Istituto Superiore di Sanità|Italian Institute of Public Health]], the Joint Action aims to achieve greater equity in health in Europe across all social groups while reducing the inter-country heterogeneity in tackling health inequalities.

==Poor health and economic inequality==
[[Economic inequality#Health|Poor health outcomes appear to be an effect of economic inequality]] across a population. Nations and regions with greater economic inequality show poorer outcomes in life expectancy,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 1.1. Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=WJbtCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger]. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; mental health,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 5.1. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; drug abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 5.3.Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; obesity,&lt;ref&gt;Figure 7.1. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; educational performance, teenage birthrates, and ill health due to violence. On an international level, there is a positive correlation between developed countries with high economic equality and longevity. This is unrelated to average income per capita in wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;Figure 1.3. Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic gain only impacts life expectancy to a great degree in countries in which the mean per capita annual income is less than approximately $25,000.
The United States shows exceptionally low health outcomes for a developed country, despite having the highest national healthcare expenditure in the world. The US ranks 31st in life expectancy. Americans have a lower life expectancy than their European counterparts, even when factors such as race, income, diet, smoking, and education are controlled for.&lt;ref&gt;In Woolf, S. H., In Aron, L. Y., National Academies (U.S.)., &amp; Institute of Medicine (U.S.). (2013). U.S. health in international perspective: Shorter lives, poorer health.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relative inequality negatively affects health on an international, national, and institutional levels. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States, that is, more equal states show more desirable health outcomes. Importantly, inequality can have a negative health impact on members of lower echelons of institutions. The [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall I and II]] studies looked at the rates of cardiovascular disease and other health risks in British civil servants and found that, even when lifestyle factors were controlled for, members of lower status in the institution showed increased mortality and morbidity on a sliding downward scale from their higher status counterparts.
The negative aspects of inequality are spread across the population. For example, when comparing the United States (a more unequal nation) to England (a less unequal nation), the US shows higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, lung disease, and heart disease across all income levels.&lt;ref&gt;Figure 13.2. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of the difference between mortality across all occupational classes in highly equal Sweden as compared to less-equal England.&lt;ref&gt;Figure 13.3. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., &amp; Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12625">In the field of medicine, a '''healthcare proxy''' (commonly referred to as HCP) is a document (legal instrument) with which a patient (primary individual) appoints an [[Agent (law)|agent]] to legally make healthcare decisions on behalf of the patient, when the patient is incapable of making and executing the healthcare decisions stipulated in the proxy.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[New York State Department of Health]]|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/forms/doh-1430.pdf|title=Health Care Proxy - New York State Department of Health|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611045033/http://www.health.ny.gov/forms/doh-1430.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the health care proxy is effective, the primary individual continues making healthcare decisions as long as the primary individual is legally [[competence (law)|competent]] to decide. Moreover, in legal-administrative functions, the healthcare proxy is a legal instrument akin to a "springing" [[power of attorney#Health care power of attorney|health care power of attorney]]. The proxy must declare the healthcare agent who will gain durable power attorney. This document also notifies of the authority given from the principal to the agent and states the limitations of this authority. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter201D/Section4|title=General Law - Part II, Title II, Chapter 201D, Section 4|website=malegislature.gov|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those over the age of 18 are allowed to have a healthcare proxy, and these documents are useful in situations that render a person unable to communicate their wishes such as being in a persistent vegetative state, having a form of dementia of an illness that takes away one's ability to effectively communicate, or being under anesthesia when a decision needs to be made. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/patients/health_care_proxy/|title=Healthcare Proxy - Who Will Speak for You?|website=www.health.ny.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;Healthcare proxies are one of three ways that surrogate decision makers are enacted, the other two being court orders and laws for the automatic succession of decision makers. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moye J, Sabatino CP, Weintraub Brendel R | title = Evaluation of the capacity to appoint a healthcare proxy | journal = The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–36 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23498379 | pmc = 4859336 | doi = 10.1016/j.jagp.2012.09.001 | url = https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1064748112000358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to a living will, healthcare proxies do not set out possible outcomes with predetermined reactions, rather they appoint someone to carry out the wishes of an individual. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stonybrookmedicine.edu/patientcare/livingwill#decisions|title=Health Care Proxy/Living Will {{!}} Stony Brook Medicine|website=www.stonybrookmedicine.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The methods of healthcare planning and tools of advanced preparation have changed dramatically over the years. The concept of durable power of attorney arose in Virginia in 1954 for the purpose of setting property matters. This allowed for a continued existence of power of attorney following the original person losing capacity to carry out the necessary actions. This concept evolved over the years and in 1983, the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research addressed this idea as one of great potential in the healthcare industry. This commission also stated the possibility of abuse as a noted concern going forward. In response to this commission, there was an evolution of this concept throughout the 1980's and the 1990's that eventually led to all states in America having a healthcare power of attorney statute by 1997. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sabatino CP | title = The evolution of health care advance planning law and policy | journal = The Milbank Quarterly | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–39 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20579283 | pmc = 2980344 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0009.2010.00596.x | url = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0009.2010.00596.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==

Some jurisdictions place limitations on the persons who can act as agents. (Some forbid the appointment of treating physicians as the healthcare proxy.)&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00099OZLC/|title=The Physician as a Healthcare Proxy|last=Rai|first=Arti | name-list-format = vanc |date=September 1999|work=The Hastings Center Report|publisher=Hastings Center|access-date=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any event the agent should be someone close to and trusted by the primary individual.&lt;ref name = "amazon"/&gt; According to the state of Massachusetts, no person who is an employee or administrator of a facility can be an agent unless it is for someone who is of familial relation to them.  In any event the agent is recommended to be someone close to and trusted by the primary individual. In the absence of a power of attorney, a legal guardian must be appointed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hack J, Buecking B, Lopez CL, Ruchholtz S, Kühne CA | title = [Living will, durable power of attorney and legal guardianship in the trauma surgery routine : Data from a geriatric trauma center] | language = de | journal = Zeitschrift Fur Gerontologie Und Geriatrie | volume = 49 | issue = 8 | pages = 721–726 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 26608036 | doi = 10.1007/s00391-015-0981-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Legal guidelines ===
Healthcare proxies are permitted in forty-nine states as well as the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="amazon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130608064700/http://www.lawserver.com/maps/health-care-powers-of-attorney-witness-and-notary-requirments Health Care Powers of Attorney: Interactive Map], LawServer. Retrieved on August 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
Healthcare forms may differ in structure from state to state and pre-made forms are not compulsory as long as certain guidelines are met. The common guidelines include:&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;

*Name and address of the agent.
*Name and address of an alternate agent.
*Duration of the proxy – not indicating a duration means it is valid unless stated otherwise.
*Special instructions – these can broaden or limit the powers of the agent. If the patient doesn't want to be on feeding tubes no matter what, this can be stated here. If there are certain treatments that the patient does not want to receive like [[dialysis]] or [[blood transfusion]], then they must be indicated. However, if the patient wants to give the agent more flexibility with some or no restriction, this must be written.
*Name, date and signature of the primary individual.
*Instructions on tissue or [[organ donation]].
*Two adult witnesses must sign the document stating that they have witnessed this agreement and that both parties appear to be [[Sanity|sane]]. The witnesses must be 18 years or older. The agent and primary individual do not qualify as witnesses.
*Presence of a lawyer - such a person may help in drafting a document tailored to the needs of the primary individual.
*Once signed, copies of the form must be given to health care providers, the agent, spouse, and close friends. A copy should also be carried by the primary individual (in wallet or purse).

=== Powers and limitations ===

The agent is empowered when a qualified [[physician]] determines that the primary individual is unable to make decisions regarding [[healthcare]]. The agent may be granted the power to remove or sustain [[feeding tube]]s from the primary individual if these tubes are the only things that are keeping the primary individual alive. The agent's decision should draw upon  knowledge of the patient's desire in this matter. If the primary individual made his or her wishes clear on the proxy form, then they must be followed despite any possible objections from the agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron| name-list-format = vanc |title=How a Power of Attorney Works|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/power_of_attorney.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual may have identified end-of-life decisions in a separate document, such as a living will or advanced health care directive, in which case it is necessary to examine all of the documents to determine if any supersede the agent's authority as granted in the healthcare proxy, based on the language of the interrelated documents and governing state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Majette|first1=Shawn| name-list-format = vanc |title=Avoid Disagreements Between Your Power of Attorney Holder and Health Care Proxy|url=http://www.t-mlaw.com/blog/post/avoid-disagreements-between-your-power-of-attorney-holder-and-health-care-proxy/|website=Thompson McMullen, PC|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agent will not be legally or financially liable for decisions made on behalf of the primary individual as long as they follow the terms of the healthcare proxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myths and Facts About   Health Care Advance Directives|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/Commissions/myths_fact_hc_ad.authcheckdam.pdf|website=ABA Commission on Law and Aging|publisher=American Bar Association|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capacity to appoint ==
There are limited legal foundation to determine the ability of someone to appoint a healthcare proxy. Although physicians are allowed to deliver life-saving treatment in emergent situations, in non-emergencies, the it is determined if the patient has the ability to then appoint a healthcare proxy. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moye J, Sabatino CP, Weintraub Brendel R | title = Evaluation of the capacity to appoint a healthcare proxy | journal = The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–36 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23498379 | pmc = 4859336 | doi = 10.1016/j.jagp.2012.09.001 | url = https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1064748112000358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for a patient lacking the ability to make healthcare decisions, to still have the capacity to appoint an agent and have a proxy.

=== United Kingdom ===
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], an independent mental health capacity advocate may be appointed under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]]; the provisions made in the same Act for a [[lasting power of attorney]] may also provide a satisfactory basis for providing care via an [[Lawyer|attorney]], who does not require to be professionally qualified. Different arrangements apply elsewhere in the [[UK]].

'''Hexavalent chromium''' ('''chromium(VI)''', '''Cr(VI)''', '''chromium 6''') is any [[chemical compound]] that contains the element [[chromium]] in the +6 [[oxidation state]] (thus [[valence (chemistry)#Common valences|hexavalent]]). Virtually all chromium ore is processed via hexavalent chromium, specifically the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] [[sodium dichromate]]. Approximately {{convert|136000|tonne|lb}} of hexavalent chromium were produced in 1985.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Gerd Anger, Jost Halstenberg, Klaus Hochgeschwender, Christoph Scherhag, Ulrich Korallus, Herbert Knopf, Peter Schmidt, Manfred Ohlinger, "Chromium Compounds" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07_067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional hexavalent chromium compounds are [[chromium trioxide]] and various salts of [[chromate and dichromate]], among others. Hexavalent chromium is used in textile dyes, wood preservation, [[anti-corrosion]] products, [[chromate conversion coating]]s, and a variety of niche uses. Industrial uses of hexavalent chromium compounds include chromate pigments in dyes, paints, inks, and plastics; chromates added as anticorrosive agents to paints, primers, and other surface coatings; and [[chromic acid]] [[electroplate]]d onto metal parts to provide a decorative or protective coating. Hexavalent chromium can be formed when performing "hot work" such as welding on stainless steel or melting chromium metal. In these situations the chromium is not originally hexavalent, but the high temperatures involved in the process result in oxidation that converts the chromium to a hexavalent state.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;29 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] OSHA General Industry 1910&lt;/ref&gt; Hexavalent chromium can also be found in drinking water and public water systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=Yun|last2=Holmgren|first2=Stephanie|last3=Andrews|first3=Danica M.

Problematic exposure is known to occur among workers who handle chromate-containing products and those who grind and/ or weld stainless steel.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; Workers who are exposed to hexavalent chromium are at increased risk of developing lung cancer, asthma, or damage to the nasal epithelia and skin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Within the [[European Union]], the use of hexavalent chromium in electronic equipment is largely prohibited by the [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]].

==Toxicity==

Hexavalent chromium compounds are [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] [[carcinogen]]s. Due to its structural similarity to sulfate, chromate (a typical form of chromium(VI) at neutral pH) is transported into cells via [[sulfate]] channels.&lt;ref name="Salnikow"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Zhitkovich|first2=A.|year=2008|title=Genetic and Epigenetic Mechanisms in Metal Carcinogenesis and Cocarcinogenesis: Nickel, Arsenic, and Chromium|url=|journal=Chem.

== Remediation of hexavalent chromium in groundwater and drinking water ==
There are mainly three types of methods to remediate hexavalent chromium in ground water and drinking water: 1) reduction of toxicity, 2) removal technologies and 3) containment technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://engr.uconn.edu/~baholmen/docs/ENVE290W/National%20Chromium%20Files%20From%20Luke/Cr(VI)%20Handbook/L1608_C08.pdf|title=Chromium (VI) Handbook|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=9781566706087|location=United States of America|pages=280–298|quote=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110203935/http://engr.uconn.edu/~baholmen/docs/ENVE290W/National%20Chromium%20Files%20From%20Luke/Cr(VI)%20Handbook/L1608_C08.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduction of toxicity of hexavalent chromium involves methods using chemicals, microbes and plants. Some removal technologies include transporting contaminated soil offsite to a landfill, using ion exchange resins to reduce chromium(VI) concentrations to less than detectable limit and granular [[activated carbon]] (GAC) filter. Containment technologies can be employed with the use of physical barriers such as grouts, slurries or sheet piling. 

Attempts have been made to test the removal or reduction of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solutions and environment. For example, a research study conducted by the School of Industrial Technology, [[University Sains Malaysia]] in 2010 found that [[chitosan]] coated with poly 3-methyl thiophene can be effectively employed for removal of hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solutions. Chitosan is a very cheap, economical, and environmentally friendly substrate for coating of this polymer. Adsorption of chromium(VI) is found to be effective in the lower pH range and at higher temperatures and subsequent desorption is readily achieved upon alkaline treatment of the adsorbent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hena|first=Sufia|date=2010-09-15|title=Removal of chromium hexavalent ion from aqueous solutions using biopolymer chitosan coated with poly 3-methyl thiophene polymer|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389410006205|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=181|issue=1–3|pages=474–479|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2010.05.037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study done by the [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] indicates that the airborne hexavalent chromium in acidic mists of an electroplating tank collected on PVC filters was reduced over time after mist generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shin|first=Yong Chul|last2=Paik|first2=Nam Won|date=2000-07-01|title=Reduction of Hexavalent Chromium Collected on PVC Filters|journal=AIHAJ - American Industrial Hygiene Association|volume=61|issue=4|pages=563–567|doi=10.1080/15298660008984569|issn=1529-8663}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other emerging technologies for removing chromium from water are also currently under research, including the use of [[cation|cationic]] [[metal-organic frameworks]] to selectively [[adsorption|adsorb]] chromium [[oxyanions]].&lt;ref name="Aboutorabi MOF"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00522 | title=Metal-Organic Framework Based on Isonicotinate N-Oxide for Fast and Highly Efficient Aqueous Phase Cr(VI) Adsorption | author=Leila Aboutorabi et. al. | journal=Inorganic Chemistry | year=2016 | volume=55 | issue=11 | pages=5507–5513 | doi=10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b00522 | issn=1520-510X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
Toxic poultry feed contaminated by chromium-based [[leather]] [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] (as opposed to traditional slower vegetable tanning) is entering the food supply in Bangladesh through chicken meat, which is the most common source of protein in the country. Tanneries in [[Hazaribagh Thana]], an industrial neighborhood of [[Dhaka]], emit around 21,600 cubic meters of toxic waste each day. The tanneries also generate as much as 100 tonnes per day of scraps, trimmed raw hide, flesh and fat, which are processed into feed by neighborhood recycling plants and used in chicken and fish farms across the country. Chromium levels ranging from 350 to 4,520 micrograms (0.35 to 4.52&amp;nbsp;mg) per kilogram were found in different organs of chickens which had been fed the tannery-scraps feed for two months, according to Abul Hossain, a chemistry professor at the [[University of Dhaka]].

====Eastern Central Greece====
The chemistry of the groundwater in eastern [[Central Greece]] (central [[Euboea]] and the [[Asopos]] valley) revealed high concentrations of hexavalent chromium in groundwater systems sometimes exceeding the Greek and the EU drinking water maximum acceptable level for total chromium. Hexavalent chromium pollution here is associated with industrial waste.

By using the GFAAS for total chromium, diphenylcarbazide-Cr(VI) complex colorimetric method for hexavalent chromium, and flame-AAS and [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|ICP-MS]] for other toxic elements, their concentrations were investigated in several groundwater samples. The contamination of water by hexavalent chromium in central Euboea is mainly linked to natural processes, but there are anthropogenic cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Geochemical Characteristics of Natural Waters Contaminated by Hexavalent Chromium, in Eastern Sterea Hellas, Greece|url=http://www.aueb.gr/users/koundouri/resees/uploads/geo2.pdf|journal=Scientific Annals|volume=99|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115234233/http://www.aueb.gr/users/koundouri/resees/uploads/geo2.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local governments were tasked with environmental monitoring and regulations, such as the monitoring of heavy metals in wastewater. Examples of this can be seen in larger municipalities such Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/9100FMSN.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1976+Thru+1980&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D:%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C76thru80%5CTxt%5C00000015%5C9100FMSN.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL|title=Document Display {{!}} NEPIS {{!}} US EPA|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021236/https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/9100FMSN.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1976+Thru+1980&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C76thru80%5CTxt%5C00000015%5C9100FMSN.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8%2Fr75g8%2Fx150y150g16%2Fi425&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A specific example was in 1969, the Chicago Metropolitan Sanitary District imposed regulations on factories that were identified as having large amounts of heavy metal discharge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On December 2, 1970 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/history|title=EPA History|last=EPA, OA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021903/https://www.epa.gov/history|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the formation of the EPA, the federal government had the funds and the oversight to influence major environmental changes. Following the formation of the EPA, the United States saw groundbreaking legislation such as the [[Clean Water Act]] (1972) and the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974).

The [[Federal Water Pollution Control Act]] (FWPCA) of 1948 was amended in 1972 to what is more commonly known as the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA). The subsequent amendments provided a basis for the federal government to begin regulating pollutants, implement wastewater standards, and increase funding for water treatment facilities among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean-water-act|title=History of the Clean Water Act|last=EPA, OA, OP, ORPM, RMD|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108022914/https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean-water-act|archivedate=2016-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1974, the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was passed by congress. The SDWA aimed to monitor and protect the United States drinking water, and the water sources it is drawn from.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sdwa|title=Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)|last=EPA, OW, OGWDW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027125530/https://www.epa.gov/sdwa|archivedate=2016-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the SDWA, in 1991, the EPA placed chromium under its list of maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG), to have a maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 100 ppb.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/chromium-drinking-water#if-epa-decides-regulate|title=Chromium in Drinking Water|last=EPA, OW, OGWDW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028022008/https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/chromium-drinking-water#if-epa-decides-regulate|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the SDWA was amended to include a provision known as the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/third-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule|title=Third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule|last=EPA, OW, OGWDW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027124423/https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/third-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule|archivedate=2016-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this rule, the EPA issues a list of 30 or less contaminants that aren’t normally regulated under the SDWA. Chromium was monitored under the third UCMR, from January 2013 through December 2015.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The EPA uses data from these reports to assist in making regulatory decisions.

==== Current policies in the United States ====
The current EPA standard in measuring chromium, is in reference to total chromium, both trivalent and hexavalent. However, preliminary findings from water tests conducted by the [[Environmental Working Group]] (EWG), suggest that chromium is most often found in the hexavalent form; the more toxic of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R. (2010, December 20). Chromium-6 in U.S. Tap Water (J. Houlihan, R. Sharp, &amp; N. Bruzelius, Eds.). Retrieved October 10, 2016, from {{cite web |url=http://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/water/public-health-goal/ewg1coms.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021618/http://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/water/public-health-goal/ewg1coms.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often trivalent and hexavalent chromium are mentioned together, when in fact they are very different from each other.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is an issue because hexavalent chromium can cause cancer, whereas trivalent chromium does not.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 1991, the MCL for chromium exposure was set based on potential of “adverse dermatological effects” related to long-term chromium exposure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Chromium’s MCL of 100 ppb has not changed since its 1991 recommendation. In 1998 the EPA released a toxicological review of hexavalent chromium.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This report examined current literature, at the time, and came to the conclusion that chromium was associated with various health issues.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris2/chemicalLanding.cfm?substance_nmbr=144|title=Chromium(VI) CASRN 18540-29-9 {{!}} IRIS {{!}} US EPA, ORD|last=Division|first=US EPA, ORD, Integrated Risk Information System|website=cfpub.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028083633/https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris2/chemicalLanding.cfm?substance_nmbr=144|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the EPA can adjust the policy on chromium levels in drinking water, they have to release a final human health assessment.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The EPA mentions two specific documents that are currently under review to determine whether or not to adjust the current drinking water standard for chromium.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The first study the EPA mentioned that is under review is a 2008 study conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services National Toxicology Program. This study looks at chronic oral exposure of hexavalent chromium in rats, and its association with cancer. The other study mentioned is a human health assessment of chromium, titled Toxicological Review of Hexavalent Chromium. The final human health assessment is currently in the stage of draft development.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This stage is the first of seven. The EPA gives no forecast to when the review will be finalized and if a decision will be made.

===== Military applications =====

Since World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2004/ARL-TR-3220.pdf|title=Replacement Alternatives to the Chromate
Wash Primer DOD-P-15328D|last=Smith|first=Paulette|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Army relied on hexavalent chromium compounds, called Cr(VI), to protect its vehicles, equipment, aviation and missile systems from corrosion. The wash primer was sprayed as a pretreatment and protective layer on bare metal.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dsiac.org/resources/news/arl-effort-improves-health-environment-bottom-line|title=ARL Effort Improves Health, Environment, Bottom Line {{!}} DSIAC|website=www.dsiac.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012-2015, [[Army Research Laboratory]] conducted research on a wash primer replacement, as a part of the DoD’s effort to eliminate the use of toxic wash primers in the military.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Studies indicated that Cr(VI) contained hazardous air pollutants and high levels of volatile organic compounds.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=2972|title=ARL effort improves health, environment, bottom line {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory|website=www.arl.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project resulted in ARL qualifying three wash primer alternatives in 2015&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; for use on Army depots, installations and repair facilities.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The research led to the removal of chromate products from Army facilities in 2017.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@RDECOM/arl-wins-award-improving-health-and-environment-2c3b88ae8ad9|title=ARL wins award improving health and environment|last=RDECOM|first=U.

==== Pending regulations in the United States ====
In 2010, the [[Environmental Working Group]] studied the drinking water in 35 American cities. The study was the first nationwide analysis measuring the presence of the chemical in U.S. water systems. The study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities sampled, with [[Norman, Oklahoma]], at the top of list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's proposed limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2010/12/tap-water-of-many-us-cities-has-probable-carcinogen-study/1#.VkziPoREmlY|title=Study: Tap water in U.S. cities has probable carcinogen|newspaper=USATODAY.COM|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA currently limits total chromium in drinking water to 100 parts per billion, but there is no established specifically for chromium(VI). In the same year, the [[California Environmental Protection Agency]] had proposed a goal of 0.2 parts per billion, despite a 2001 state law requiring a standard be set by 2005. A final Public Health Goal of 0.02 ppb was established in July 2011.&lt;ref name="Hexavalent Chromium PHG" /&gt;

As of August 2016, the EWG alongside activist [[Erin Brockovich]] is pushing for the EPA to change the nationwide MCL to be more reflective of the California standards. This response comes as result of the resignation of a top state health official in North Carolina. [[Pat McCrory|Governor Pat McCrory]] had been attempting to remove warnings against drinking water potentially contaminated by hexavalent chromium from [[Duke Energy]] coal burning facilities. The confusion on the regulating guidelines and health safety of hexavalent chromium within drinking water has led to multiple standards. The EWG's push for stricter national guidelines is done in hopes to eliminate the confusion among citizens and state officials as well as to protect the health of the population from this carcinogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ewg.org/release/wake-nc-hexavalent-chromium-scandal-environmentalists-call-epa-set-national-drinking-water|title=In Wake of N.C.

The EWG released an analysis in September 2016 of federal data from nationwide drinking water tests which showed that seventy-five percent of samples contained hexavalent chromium at levels higher than the California public health goal of 0.02 ppb. The EWG estimates that the US will see 12,000 excess cases in cancer by the end of the century if hexavalent chromium exposure in drinking water is not reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ewg.org/research/chromium-six-found-in-us-tap-water|title='Erin Brockovich' Carcinogen in Tap Water of More than 200 Million Americans|newspaper=EWG|access-date=2016-10-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028084953/http://www.ewg.org/research/chromium-six-found-in-us-tap-water|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Davenport =====
Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District monitored airborne levels of hexavalent chromium at an elementary school and fire department, as well as the point-source.  They concluded that there were high levels of hexavalent chromium in the air, originating from a local cement plant, called [[Cemex]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Health Services Agency. (2008, Nov. 18).

Cemex also made a change in the materials they used, trying to replace current materials with materials lower in chromium.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The HSA also monitored the surrounding schools to determine if there were any health risks.  Most schools came back with low levels, but in the case of higher levels a contractor was hired to clean up the chromium deposits.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This case highlights the previously unrecognized possibility that hexavalent chromium can be released from cement-making.

===== Hinkley =====
{{Main article|Hinkley groundwater contamination}}Hexavalent chromium was found in drinking water in the southern California town of [[Hinkley, California|Hinkley]] and was brought to popular attention by the involvement of [[Erin Brockovich]] and Attorney [[Edward Masry]]. The source of contamination was from the evaporating ponds of a PG&amp;E ([[Pacific Gas and Electric]]) natural gas pipeline Compressor Station located approximately 2 miles southeast of Hinkley. Between 1952 and 1966, chromium(VI) was used to prevent corrosion in the cooling stacks. The wastewater was then dumped into the unlined evaporating ponds. As a result, the chromium(VI) leaked into the groundwater source.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The 580 ppb chromium(VI) in the groundwater in Hinkley exceeded the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 100 ppb for total chromium currently set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/safewater/dwh/c-ioc/chromium.html U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Consumer Factsheet on: Chromium.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010171348/http://www.epa.gov/safewater/dwh/c-ioc/chromium.html |date=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also exceeded the California MCL of 50 ppb (as of November 2008) for all types of chromium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/Documents/DWdocuments/EPAandCDPH-11-28-2008.pdf |title=California Department of Public Health, Maximum Contaminant Levels and Regulatory Dates for Drinking Water. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718144405/http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/Documents/DWdocuments/EPAandCDPH-11-28-2008.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; California first established an MCL specifically for hexavalent chromium in 2014, set at 10 ppb.&lt;ref name="HEX Chrome Letter" /&gt; Prior to that only total chromium standards applied.

==== Illinois ====
In [[Chicago]]'s first ever testing for the toxic metal contaminant, results show that the city's local drinking water contains levels of hexavalent chromium more than 11 times higher than the health standard set in California in July 2011.  The results of the test showed that the water which is sent to over 7 million residents had average levels of 0.23 ppb of the toxic metal. California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment designated the nation's new "public health goal" limit as 0.02 ppb.  Echoing their counterparts in other cities where the metal has been detected, Chicago officials stress that local tap water is safe and suggest that if a national limit is adopted, it likely would be less stringent than California's goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/health/chicago-water-chromium-127068203.html#ixzz1UNwMlC6Q|title=Toxic Metal Found in Chicago Drinking Water|last=Rodriguez|first=Robert|date=2011-08-06|publisher=NBC Chicago|accessdate=2013-08-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216072838/http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/health/chicago-water-chromium-127068203.html#ixzz1UNwMlC6Q|archivedate=2013-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/ct-met-drinking-water-chromium-20110806,0,5813267.story |title=Toxic chromium found in Chicago drinking water |last=Hawthorne |first=Michael |work=Chicago Tribune |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807014854/http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/ct-met-drinking-water-chromium-20110806%2C0%2C5813267.story |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Illinois Environmental Protection Agency]] (Illinois EPA) has developed a chromium(VI) strategic plan which outlines tasks in order to reduce the levels of chromium(VI) in Illinois' drinking water.

====Massachusetts====
Cambridge Plating Company, now known as Purecoat North, was an electroplating business in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]].  A report was conducted by the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR), to evaluate the association between environmental exposures from the Cambridge Plating Company and health effects on the surrounding community.  The report indicated that residents of Belmont were exposed to chromium via air emissions, as well as groundwater and soil.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Public Health Assessment for Cambridge Plating Company.

==== Missouri ====
In 2009, a lawsuit was filed against Prime Tanning Corporation of [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], over alleged hexavalent chromium contamination in [[Cameron, Missouri]]. A cluster of brain tumors had developed in the town that was above average for the population size of the town. The lawsuit alleges that the tumors were caused by waste hexavalent chromium that had been distributed to local farmers as free fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlawsuits.com/lawsuit-alleges-cameron-missouri-brain-tumors-linked-to-fertilizer-3690/|title=Lawsuit Alleges Cameron Missouri Brain Tumors Linked to Fertilizer|date=2009-04-28|publisher=AboutLawsuits.com|accessdate=2013-08-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621215524/http://www.aboutlawsuits.com/lawsuit-alleges-cameron-missouri-brain-tumors-linked-to-fertilizer-3690/|archivedate=2013-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a government study found hexavalent chromium within the soil but not at levels that were hazardous to human health. In 2012, the case ruled that $10 million would be distributed to over a dozen farmers affected in the northwest Missouri area. The Tanning Corporation still denies that their fertilizer caused any harm. Some residents claim that the tumors were a direct cause from the chromium exposure, but it is difficult to determine what other future impacts might arise from exposure in the specific Missouri counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article301330/Burns--McDonnell-settles-case-alleging-hazardous-sludge.html|title=Burns &amp; McDonnell settles case alleging hazardous sludge|first=|date=March 12, 2012|website=www.kansascity.com|publisher=The Kansas City Star|access-date=October 10, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027130004/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article301330/Burns--McDonnell-settles-case-alleging-hazardous-sludge.html|archivedate=October 27, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Texas ====
On April 8, 2009, the [[Texas Commission on Environmental Quality]] (TCEQ) collected ground water samples from a domestic well on West County Road 112 in [[Midland, Texas]] (U.S.), in response to a resident complaint of yellow water. The well was found to be contaminated with chromium(VI). The Midland groundwater reached higher levels of contamination than the EPA mandated maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 100 parts per billion. The current groundwater plume of chromium lies under approximately 260 acres of land at the West County Road 112 Groundwater Site. In response, the TCEQ installed filtration systems on water-well sites that showed contamination of chromium.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tceq.texas.gov/remediation/sites/cr112.html|title=West County Road 112, Midland, TX|website=www.tceq.texas.gov|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028083815/https://www.tceq.texas.gov/remediation/sites/cr112.html|archivedate=2016-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, TCEQ had sampled water from 235 wells and has installed over 45 anion-exchange filtration systems from this site&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; determined to be centered at 2601 West County Road 112, Midland, Texas.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/CurSites/dsp_ssppSiteData1.cfm?id=0606992|title=Search Superfund Site Information|last=OSRTI|first=US EPA,|website=cumulis.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131130939/https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/dsp_ssppSiteData1.cfm?id=0606992|archivedate=2017-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TCEQ continues to sample wells surrounding the area to monitor the movement of the plume. In addition, they continue to monitor the effectiveness of the anion-exchange filtration systems by sampling on a year-quarterly and the filters are maintained at no cost to the residents.

As of March 2011, the West County Road 112 Ground Water site was added to the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL) also known as the Superfund List by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; From 2011 to 2013, TCEQ installed groundwater monitors and conducted groundwater sampling. In 2013, TCEQ began sampling residential soil and confirmed that it was contaminated from use of the contaminated groundwater for garden and lawn care.

According to the EPA, ongoing investigations have not concluded the source of the contamination and cleanup solutions are still being developed. Until such investigations are complete and remediation established, residents will continue to be at risk for health effects from exposure to the groundwater contamination.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==== Wisconsin ====
On January 7, 2011 it was announced that [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] had tested its water and hexavalent chromium was found to be present. Officials stated that it was in such small quantities that it was nothing to worry about, although this contaminant is a carcinogen. In Wisconsin, Milwaukee's average chromium(VI) level is 0.194 parts per billion (the EPA recommended maximum contaminant level (MCL) is 100 ppb).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; All 13 water systems tested positive for chromium(VI). Four out of seven systems detected the chemical in [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]], and both [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha County, Wisconsin|Kenosha Counties]] had the highest levels averaging more than 0.2 parts per billion.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs58.com/story/33146644/dangerous-levels-of-erin-brockovich-chemical-found-in-local-drinking-water|title=Dangerous Levels of 'Erin Brockovich' Chemical Found in Local Drinking Water|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027055407/http://www.cbs58.com/story/33146644/dangerous-levels-of-erin-brockovich-chemical-found-in-local-drinking-water|archivedate=2016-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further testing was being conducted as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/113101749.html City defends water safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110171236/http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/113101749.html |date=2011-01-10 }} ''Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel'', January 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There was no further information available as of October 2016.

[[File:Automation of foundry with robot.jpg|thumb|Articulated industrial robot operating in a foundry.]]
An '''industrial robot''' is a [[robot]] system used for [[manufacturing]]. Industrial robots are automated, programmable and capable of movement on two or more axes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:8373:ed-2:v1:en {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617031837/https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/ |date=2016-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical applications of robots include [[robot welding|welding]], painting, assembly, [[Automated storage and retrieval system|pick and place]] for [[printed circuit board]]s, [[packaging and labeling]], [[Palletizer|palletizing]], product inspection, and testing; all accomplished with high endurance, speed, and precision. They can assist in [[material handling]].

In the year 2015, an estimated 1.64 million industrial robots were in operation worldwide according to [[International Federation of Robotics|International Federation of Robotics (IFR)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21729864-automation-less-threat-workers-emerging-world-it-made-out|title=Worries about premature industrialisation|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021014710/https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21729864-automation-less-threat-workers-emerging-world-it-made-out|archivedate=2017-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly used robot configurations are [[articulated robot]]s, [[SCARA]] robots, [[delta robot]]s and [[cartesian coordinate robot]]s, ([[gantry cranes|gantry]] robots or x-y-z robots). In the context of general robotics, most types of robots would fall into the category of [[robotic arm]]s (inherent in the use of the word ''manipulator'' in ISO standard 1738).
Robots exhibit varying degrees of [[autonomous robot|autonomy]]: 
* Some robots are programmed to faithfully carry out specific actions over and over again (repetitive actions) without variation and with a high degree of accuracy. These actions are determined by programmed routines that specify the direction, acceleration, velocity, deceleration, and distance of a series of coordinated motions.
* Other robots are much more flexible as to the orientation of the object on which they are operating or even the task that has to be performed on the object itself, which the robot may even need to identify. For example, for more precise guidance, robots often contain [[machine vision]] sub-systems acting as their visual sensors, linked to powerful computers or controllers.&lt;ref name=NASAarticle&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[NASA Tech Briefs]] |volume= 35 |issue= 6 |date= June 2011 |title= Machine Vision Fundamentals, How to Make Robots See |author= Turek, Fred D. |pages= 60–62 |url= http://www.techbriefs.com/privacy-footer-69/10531 |accessdate= 2011-11-29 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120127043340/http://www.techbriefs.com/privacy-footer-69/10531 |archivedate= 2012-01-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Artificial intelligence]], or what passes for it,{{clarify|date=November 2016}} is becoming an increasingly important factor in the modern industrial robot.

==History of industrial robotics ==
The earliest known industrial robot, conforming to the ISO definition was completed by 
"Bill" Griffith P. Taylor in 1937 and published in [[Meccano Magazine]], March 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Automatic Block-Setting Crane|journal=Meccano Magazine|date=March 1938|volume=23|issue=3|page=172|publisher=Meccano|location=Liverpool UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Griffith P.|title=The Robot Gargantua|year=1995|publisher=Constructor Quarterly|location=Gargantua|editor=Robin Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crane-like device was built almost entirely using [[Meccano]] parts, and powered by a single electric motor.  Five axes of movement were possible, including ''grab'' and ''grab rotation''. Automation was achieved using punched paper tape to energise solenoids, which would facilitate the movement of the crane's control levers. The [[robot]] could stack wooden blocks in pre-programmed patterns. The number of motor revolutions required for each desired movement was first plotted on graph paper. This information was then transferred to the paper tape, which was also driven by the robot's single motor. Chris Shute built a complete replica of the robot in 1997.

[[Image:George C Devol Color Photo.jpg|thumb|left|George Devol, c. 1982]]
[[George Devol]] applied for the first robotics [[patent]]s in 1954 (granted in 1961).  The first company to produce a robot was [[Unimation]], founded by Devol and [[Joseph Engelberger|Joseph F. Engelberger]] in 1956. Unimation robots were also called ''programmable transfer machines'' since their main use at first was to transfer objects from one point to another, less than a dozen feet or so apart. They used [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[actuator]]s and were programmed in ''[[joint]] [[coordinate system|coordinates]]'', i.e. the angles of the various joints were stored during a teaching phase and replayed in operation.  They were accurate to within 1/10,000 of an inch{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} (note: although accuracy is not an appropriate measure for robots, usually evaluated in terms of repeatability - see later).  Unimation later licensed their technology to [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] and [[GKN]], manufacturing [[Unimate]]s in Japan and England respectively.  For some time Unimation's only competitor was [[Cincinnati Milacron]] Inc. of [[Ohio]]. This changed radically in the late 1970s when several big Japanese conglomerates began producing similar industrial robots.

In 1969 [[Victor Scheinman]] at [[Stanford University]] invented the [[Stanford arm]], an all-electric, 6-axis articulated robot designed to permit an [[arm solution]]. This allowed it accurately to follow arbitrary paths in space and widened the potential use of the robot to more sophisticated applications such as assembly and welding. Scheinman then designed a second arm for the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] Lab, called the "MIT arm." Scheinman, after receiving a fellowship from Unimation to develop his designs, sold those designs to Unimation who further developed them with support from [[General Motors]] and later marketed it as the [[Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly]] (PUMA).

Industrial robotics took off quite quickly in Europe, with both [[ABB Group|ABB Robotics]] and [[KUKA|KUKA Robotics]] bringing robots to the market in 1973. ABB Robotics (formerly ASEA) introduced IRB 6, among the world's first ''commercially available'' all electric micro-processor controlled robot. The first two IRB 6 robots were sold to Magnusson in Sweden for grinding and polishing pipe bends and were installed in production in January 1974. Also in 1973 KUKA Robotics built its first robot, known as [[FAMULUS]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuka-robotics.com/en/company/group/milestones/1973.htm KUKA-Roboter.de: 1973 The First KUKA Robot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220193437/http://www.kuka-robotics.com/en/company/group/milestones/1973.htm |date=2009-02-20 }} English, 28th of March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifr.org/uploads/media/History_of_Industrial_Robots_online_brochure_by_IFR_2012.pdf |title=History of Industrial Robots |accessdate=2012-10-27 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224213437/http://www.ifr.org/uploads/media/History_of_Industrial_Robots_online_brochure_by_IFR_2012.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also one of the first articulated robots to have six electromechanically driven axes.

Interest in robotics increased in the late 1970s and many US companies entered the field, including large firms like [[General Electric]], and [[General Motors]] (which formed [[joint venture]] [[FANUC Robotics]] with [[FANUC]] LTD of Japan). U.S. [[startup companies]] included [[Automatix]] and [[Adept Technology]], Inc. At the height of the robot boom in 1984, Unimation was acquired by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] for 107 million U.S. dollars. Westinghouse sold Unimation to [[Stäubli Faverges SCA]] of [[France]] in 1988, which is still making articulated robots for general industrial and [[cleanroom]] applications and even bought the robotic division of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] in late 2004.

Only a few non-Japanese companies ultimately managed to survive in this market, the major ones being: [[Adept Technology]], [[Stäub]], the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] company [[ABB Asea Brown Boveri]], the [[Germany|German]] company [[KUKA|KUKA Robotics]] and the [[Italy|Italian]] company [[Comau]].

==Technical description==

===Defining parameters===
*''Number of axes'' – two axes are required to reach any point in a plane; three axes are required to reach any point in space. To fully control the orientation of the end of the arm(i.e. the ''wrist'') three more axes ([[yaw, pitch, and roll]]) are required. Some designs (e.g. the SCARA robot) trade limitations in motion possibilities for cost, speed, and accuracy.
*''[[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|Degrees of freedom]]'' – this is usually the same as the number of axes.
*''[[Working envelope]]'' – the region of space a robot can reach.
*''[[robot kinematics|Kinematics]]'' – the actual arrangement of rigid members and [[joint]]s in the robot, which determines the robot's possible motions. Classes of robot kinematics include articulated, cartesian, [[Parallel robot|parallel]] and SCARA.
*''Carrying capacity or [[Cargo|payload]]'' – how much weight a robot can lift.
*''Speed'' – how fast the robot can position the end of its arm. This may be defined in terms of the angular or linear speed of each axis or as a compound speed i.e. the speed of the end of the arm when all axes are moving.
*''Acceleration'' – how quickly an axis can accelerate. Since this is a limiting factor a robot may not be able to reach its specified maximum speed for movements over a short distance or a complex path requiring frequent changes of direction.
*''Accuracy'' – how closely a robot can reach a commanded position. When the absolute position of the robot is measured and compared to the commanded position the error is a measure of accuracy. Accuracy can be improved with external sensing for example a vision system or Infra-Red. See [[robot calibration]]. Accuracy can vary with speed and position within the working envelope and with payload (see compliance).
*''Repeatability'' – how well the robot will return to a programmed position. This is not the same as accuracy. It may be that when told to go to a certain X-Y-Z position that it gets only to within 1&amp;nbsp;mm of that position. This would be its accuracy which may be improved by calibration. But if that position is taught into controller memory and each time it is sent there it returns to within 0.1mm of the taught position then the repeatability will be within 0.1mm.
Accuracy and repeatability are different measures. Repeatability is usually the most important criterion for a robot and is similar to the concept of 'precision' in measurement—see [[accuracy and precision]]. ISO 9283 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evs.ee/Checkout/tabid/36/screen/freedownload/productid/159968/doclang/en/preview/1/EVS_EN_ISO_9283;2001_en_preview.aspx|title=EVS-EN ISO 9283:2001|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310123210/https://www.evs.ee/Checkout/tabid/36/screen/freedownload/productid/159968/doclang/en/preview/1/EVS_EN_ISO_9283;2001_en_preview.aspx|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out a method whereby both accuracy and repeatability can be measured. Typically a robot is sent to a taught position a number of times and the error is measured at each return to the position after visiting 4 other positions. Repeatability is then quantified using the [[standard deviation]] of those samples in all three dimensions. A typical robot can, of course make a positional error exceeding that and that could be a problem for the process. Moreover, the repeatability is different in different parts of the working envelope and also changes with speed and payload. ISO 9283 specifies that accuracy and repeatability should be measured at maximum speed and at maximum payload. But this results in pessimistic values whereas the robot could be much more accurate and repeatable at light loads and speeds.
Repeatability in an industrial process is also subject to the accuracy of the end effector, for example a gripper, and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.
*''Motion control'' – for some applications, such as simple pick-and-place assembly, the robot need merely return repeatably to a limited number of pre-taught positions. For more sophisticated applications, such as welding and finishing ([[spray painting]]), motion must be continuously controlled to follow a path in space, with controlled orientation and velocity.
*''Power source'' – some robots use [[electric motor]]s, others use [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] actuators. The former are faster, the latter are stronger and advantageous in applications such as spray painting, where a spark could set off an [[explosion]]; however, low internal air-pressurisation of the arm can prevent ingress of flammable vapours as well as other contaminants.
*''Drive'' – some robots connect electric motors to the joints via [[gear]]s; others connect the motor to the joint directly (''direct drive''). Using gears results in measurable 'backlash' which is free movement in an axis. Smaller robot arms frequently employ high speed, low torque DC motors, which generally require high gearing ratios; this has the disadvantage of backlash. In such cases the [[harmonic drive]] is often used.
*''Compliance'' - this is a measure of the amount in angle or distance that a robot axis will move when a force is applied to it. Because of compliance when a robot goes to a position carrying its maximum payload it will be at a position slightly lower than when it is carrying no payload. Compliance can also be responsible for overshoot when carrying high payloads in which case acceleration would need to be reduced.

===Robot programming and interfaces===
[[Image:Offline teaching welding 001.png|thumb|Offline programming]]
[[Image:Teach pendant.JPG|thumb|A typical well-used teach pendant with optional [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]]]

The setup or [[Computer programming|programming]] of motions and sequences for an industrial robot is typically taught by linking the robot controller to a [[laptop]], desktop [[computer]] or (internal or Internet) [[computer network|network]].

A robot and a collection of machines or peripherals is referred to as a [[workcell]], or cell. A typical cell might contain a parts feeder, a [[injection molding machine|molding machine]] and a robot. The various machines are 'integrated' and controlled by a single computer or [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]]. How the robot interacts with other machines in the cell must be programmed, both with regard to their positions in the cell and synchronizing with them.

''Software:'' The computer is installed with corresponding [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] software. The use of a computer greatly simplifies the programming process. Specialized [[robot software]] is run either in the robot controller or in the computer or both depending on the system design.

There are two basic entities that need to be taught (or programmed): positional data and procedure. For example, in a task to move a screw from a feeder to a hole the positions of the feeder and the hole must first be taught or programmed. Secondly the procedure to get the screw from the feeder to the hole must be programmed along with any I/O involved, for example a signal to indicate when the screw is in the feeder ready to be picked up. The purpose of the robot software is to facilitate both these programming tasks.

Teaching the robot positions may be achieved a number of ways:

''Positional commands'' The robot can be directed to the required position using a [[GUI]] or text based commands in which the required X-Y-Z position may be specified and edited.

''Teach pendant:'' Robot positions can be taught via a [[teach pendant]]. This is a handheld control and programming unit. The common features of such units are the ability to manually send the robot to a desired position, or "inch" or "jog" to adjust a position. They also have a means to change the speed since a low speed is usually required for careful positioning, or while test-running through a new or modified routine. A large [[emergency stop]] button is usually included as well. Typically once the robot has been programmed there is no more use for the teach pendant.

''Lead-by-the-nose:'' this is a technique offered by many robot manufacturers. In this method, one user holds the robot's manipulator, while another person enters a command which de-energizes the robot causing it to go into limp. The user then moves the robot by hand to the required positions and/or along a required path while the software logs these positions into memory. The program can later run the robot to these positions or along the taught path. This technique is popular for tasks such as [[spray painting|paint spraying]].

''Offline programming'' is where the entire cell, the robot and all the machines or instruments in the workspace are mapped graphically. The robot can then be moved on screen and the process simulated. A robotics simulator is used to create embedded applications for a robot, without depending on the physical operation of the robot arm and end effector. The advantages of robotics simulation is that it saves time in the design of robotics applications. It can also increase the level of safety associated with robotic equipment since various "what if" scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.[8] Robot simulation software provides a platform to teach, test, run, and debug programs that have been written in a variety of programming languages.  [[Image:RoboLogix Work Envelope.jpg|Robotics Simulator|thumb|right]]

''Robot simulation'' tools allow for robotics programs to be conveniently written and debugged off-line with the final version of the program tested on an actual robot. The ability to preview the behavior of a robotic system in a virtual world allows for a variety of mechanisms, devices, configurations and controllers to be tried and tested before being applied to a "real world" system. Robotics simulators have the ability to provide real-time computing of the simulated motion of an industrial robot using both geometric modeling and kinematics modeling.

''Others'' In addition, machine operators often use [[user interface]] devices, typically [[touchscreen]] units, which serve as the operator control panel. The operator can switch from program to program, make adjustments within a program and also operate a host of [[peripheral]] devices that may be integrated within the same robotic system. These include [[Industrial robot end effector|end effector]]s, feeders that supply components to the robot, [[conveyor belt]]s, emergency stop controls, machine vision systems, safety [[interlock (engineering)|interlock]] systems, [[barcode|bar code]] printers and an almost infinite array of other industrial devices which are accessed and controlled via the operator control panel.

The teach pendant or PC is usually disconnected after programming and the robot then runs on the program that has been installed in its [[controller (computing)|controller]]. However a computer is often used to 'supervise' the robot and any peripherals, or to provide additional storage for access to numerous complex paths and routines.

===End-of-arm tooling===
The most essential robot peripheral is the [[Robot end effector|end effector]], or end-of-arm-tooling (EOT). Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), spray guns and also grinding and deburring devices (such as pneumatic disk or belt grinders, burrs, etc.), and grippers (devices that can grasp an object, usually [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] or [[pneumatics|pneumatic]]). Other common means of picking up objects is by [[vacuum]] or [[Magnet|magnets]]. End effectors are frequently highly complex, made to match the handled product and often capable of picking up an array of products at one time.  They may utilize various sensors to aid the robot system in locating, handling, and positioning products.

===Controlling movement===
For a given robot the only parameters necessary to completely locate the end effector (gripper, welding torch, etc.) of the robot are the angles of each of the joints or displacements of the linear axes (or combinations of the two for robot formats such as SCARA). However, there are many different ways to define the points. The most common and most convenient way of defining a point is to specify a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate]] for it, i.e. the position of the 'end effector' in mm in the X, Y and Z directions relative to the robot's origin. In addition, depending on the types of joints a particular robot may have, the orientation of the end effector in yaw, pitch, and roll and the location of the tool point relative to the robot's faceplate must also be specified. For a [[Robotic arm|jointed arm]] these coordinates must be converted to joint angles by the robot controller and such conversions are known as Cartesian Transformations which may need to be performed iteratively or recursively for a multiple axis robot. The mathematics of the relationship between joint angles and actual spatial coordinates is called kinematics. See [[robot control]]

Positioning by Cartesian coordinates may be done by entering the coordinates into the system or by using a teach pendant which moves the robot in X-Y-Z directions. It is much easier for a human operator to visualize motions up/down, left/right, etc. than to move each joint one at a time. When the desired position is reached it is then defined in some way particular to the robot software in use, e.g. P1 - P5 below.

===Typical programming===
Most articulated robots perform by storing a series of positions in memory, and moving to them at various times in their programming sequence. For example, a robot which is moving items from one place to another might have a simple 'pick and place' program similar to the following:

''Define points P1–P5:''

# Safely above workpiece (defined as P1)
# 10&amp;nbsp;cm Above bin A (defined as P2)
# At position to take part from bin A (defined as P3)
# 10&amp;nbsp;cm Above bin B (defined as P4)
# At position to take part from bin B. (defined as P5)

''Define program:''

# Move to P1
# Move to P2
# Move to P3
# Close gripper
# Move to P2
# Move to P4
# Move to P5
# Open gripper
# Move to P4
# Move to P1 and finish

For examples of how this would look in popular robot languages see [[Robot software#Examples of programming languages for Industrial Robots|industrial robot programming]].

===Singularities===
The American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements (ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999) defines a singularity as “a condition caused by the collinear alignment of two or more robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities.” It is most common in robot arms that utilize a “triple-roll wrist”. This is a wrist about which the three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point. An example of a wrist singularity is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot’s wrist (i.e. robot's axes 4 and 6) to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. Another common term for this singularity is a “wrist flip”. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the end effector, and the process. Some industrial robot manufacturers have attempted to side-step the situation by slightly altering the robot’s path to prevent this condition. Another method is to slow the robot’s travel speed, thus reducing the speed required for the wrist to make the transition. The ANSI/RIA has mandated that robot manufacturers shall make the user aware of singularities if they occur while the system is being manually manipulated.

A second type of singularity in wrist-partitioned vertically articulated six-axis robots occurs when the wrist center lies on a cylinder that is centered about axis 1 and with radius equal to the distance between axes 1 and 4. This is called a shoulder singularity. Some robot manufacturers also mention alignment singularities, where axes 1 and 6 become coincident. This is simply a sub-case of shoulder singularities. When the robot passes close to a shoulder singularity, joint 1 spins very fast.

The third and last type of singularity in wrist-partitioned vertically articulated six-axis robots occurs when the wrist's center lies in the same plane as axes 2 and 3.

Singularities are closely related to the phenomena of [[gimbal lock]], which has a similar root cause of axes becoming lined up.

A video illustrating these three types of singular configurations is available here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coro.etsmtl.ca/blog/?p=107|title=Singularities in six-axis vertically-articulated industrial robots|work=CoRo Blog|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417191430/http://coro.etsmtl.ca/blog/?p=107|archivedate=17 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Federation of Robotics]] has predicted a worldwide increase in adoption of industrial robots and they estimated 1.7 million new robot installations in factories worldwide by 2020 [https://ifr.org/industrial-robots/statistics/ &amp;#91;IFR 2017&amp;#93;]. Rapid advances in automation technologies (e.g. fixed robots, collaborative and mobile robots, and exoskeletons) have the potential to improve work conditions but also to introduce workplace hazards in manufacturing workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24649|title=Information Technology and the U.S. Workforce: Where Are We and Where Do We Go from Here?|last=Technology|first=Committee on Information|last2=Automation|last3=Workforce|first3=and the U.S.|last4=Board|first4=Computer Science and Telecommunications|last5=Sciences|first5=Division on Engineering and Physical|last6=Sciences|first6=National Academies of|last7=Engineering|last8=Medicine|first8=and|date=2017-03-16|isbn=9780309454025|language=en|doi=10.17226/24649}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://oshwiki.eu/wiki/A_review_on_the_future_of_work:_robotics]   Despite the lack of occupational surveillance data on injuries associated specifically with robots, researchers from the US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) identified 61 robot-related deaths between 1992 and 2015 using keyword searches of the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries research database (see info from [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/robotics/aboutthecenter.html Center for Occupational Robotics Research]). Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, NIOSH and its state partners have investigated 4 robot-related fatalities under the [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/face/brochure.html Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation Program].  In addition the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has investigated dozens of robot-related deaths and injuries, which can be reviewed at [https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/AccidentSearch.search?acc_keyword=%22Robot%22&amp;keyword_list=on OSHA Accident Search page]. Injuries and fatalities could  increase over time because of the increasing number of collaborative and co-existing robots, powered exoskeletons, and autonomous vehicles into the work environment.

Safety standards are being developed by the [https://www.robotics.org/ Robotic Industries Association] (RIA) in conjunction with the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI).[https://www.robotics.org/robotic-standards] On October 5, 2017, OSHA, NIOSH and RIA signed an [https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/alliances/ria/ria.html alliance] to work together to enhance technical expertise, identify and help address potential workplace hazards associated with traditional industrial robots and the emerging technology of human-robot collaboration installations and systems, and help identify needed research to reduce workplace hazards. On October 16 NIOSH launched the [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/robotics/default.html Center for Occupational Robotics Research] to "provide scientific leadership to guide the development and use of occupational robots that enhance worker safety, health, and wellbeing."  So far, the research needs identified by NIOSH and its partners include: tracking and preventing injuries and fatalities, intervention and dissemination strategies to promote safe machine control and maintenance procedures, and on translating effective evidence-based interventions into workplace practice.

'''Infant mortality''' is the death of young children under the age of 1. This death toll is measured by the '''infant mortality rate''' ('''IMR'''), which is the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1000 live births. The under-five mortality rate is also an important statistic, considering the infant mortality rate focuses only on children under one year of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality/ | title = Under-Five Mortality | work = UNICEF | access-date = 2017-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Child mortality]] is the death of a child before the child's fifth birthday, measured as the under-5 child mortality rate (U5MR). National statistics sometimes group these two mortality rates together. Globally, 9.2 million children die each year before their fifth birthday; more than 60% of these deaths are seen as being avoidable with low-cost measures such as continuous breast-feeding, vaccinations and improved nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/press_materials/fs/fs_mdg4_childmortality/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Child mortality|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infant mortality rate was an indicator used to monitor progress towards the Fourth Goal of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of the [[United Nations]] for the year 2015. It is now a target in the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for Goal Number 3 ("Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages").&lt;ref name="SDG"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg3 |title=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|publisher=UN-DESA|access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Infant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of deaths per 1,000 live births of children under one year of age. The rate for a given region is the number of children dying under one year of age, divided by the number of live births during the year, multiplied by 1,000.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Andrews KM, Brouillette DB, Brouillette RT |title=Encyclopedia of Infant and Early Childhood Development|chapter=Mortality, Infant|year=2008 |pages =343–359|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/B978-012370877-9.00084-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of infant mortality:
* [[Perinatal mortality]] is late fetal death (22 weeks gestation to birth), or death of a newborn up to one week postpartum.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;
*[[Neonatal mortality]] is newborn death occurring within 28 days postpartum. Neonatal death is often attributed to inadequate access to basic medical care, during pregnancy and after delivery.

* Postneonatal mortality is the death of children aged 29 days to one year. The major contributors to postneonatal death are malnutrition, infectious disease, troubled pregnancy, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and problems with the home environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/infantmortality.htm|title=Infant Mortality | work = Maternal and Infant Health {{!}} Reproductive Health | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common causes are preventable with low-cost measures. In the United States, a primary determinant of infant mortality risk is infant birth weight with lower birth weights increasing the risk of infant mortality. The determinants of low birth weight include socio-economic, psychological, behavioral and environmental factors.&lt;ref name=Osel2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Osel | first1 = J.

===Medical===
Causes of infant mortality that are related to medical conditions include: low birth weight, [[sudden infant death syndrome]], malnutrition,congenital malformations, and infectious diseases, including [[neglected tropical diseases]].

===Congenital malformations===
Congenital malformations are birth defects that babies are born with, such as cleft lip and palate, Down syndrome, and heart defects. Often times, this occurs when the mother consumes alcohol, but it can also be a cause of genetics or have an unknown cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Medical Definition of Congenital malformation | url = https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2820 | work = MedicineNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
congenital malformations have had a significant impact on infant mortality. Malnutrition and infectious diseases were the main cause of death in more undeveloped countries. In the Caribbean and Latin America, congenital malformations only accounted for 5% of the infant deaths in these countries while malnutrition and infectious diseases took 7% to 27% of infants in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="pmid10942444"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosano A, Botto LD, Botting B, Mastroiacovo P | title = Infant mortality and congenital anomalies from 1950 to 1994: an international perspective | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 54 | issue = 9 | pages = 660–6 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10942444 | pmc = 1731756 | doi = 10.1136/jech.54.9.660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In more developed countries such as the United States, there was a rise in infant deaths due to congenital malformations. These birth defects mostly had to do with heart and central nervous system. In the 19th century, there was a decrease in the number of infant deaths from heart diseases. From 1979 to 1997, there was a 39% decline  in infant mortality due to heart problems.&lt;ref name="pmid22078432"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Linde D, Konings EE, Slager MA, Witsenburg M, Helbing WA, Takkenberg JJ, Roos-Hesselink JW | title = Birth prevalence of congenital heart disease worldwide: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 58 | issue = 21 | pages = 2241–7 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22078432 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2011.08.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Low birth weight====
{{Main article|Low birth weight}}
[[Low birth weight]] makes up 60–80% of the infant mortality rate in developing countries. ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' stated that "The lowest mortality rates occur among infants weighing {{convert|3000|to|3500|g|lbs|abbr=on}}. For infants born weighing {{Convert|2500|g|lbs|abbr=on}} or less, the mortality rate rapidly increases with decreasing weight, and most of the infants weighing {{convert|1000|g|lbs|abbr=on}} or less die. As compared with normal-birth-weight infants, those with low weight at birth are almost 40 times more likely to die in the neonatal period; for infants with very low weight at birth the relative risk of neonatal death is almost 200 times greater." Infant mortality due to low birth weight is usually a direct cause stemming from other medical complications such as preterm birth, poor maternal nutritional status, lack of [[prenatal care]], maternal sickness during pregnancy, and an unhygienic home environments.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; Along with birth weight, period of gestation makes up the two most important predictors of an infant's chances of survival and their overall health.&lt;ref name="MacDorman 2009"/&gt;

According to the ''New England Journal of Medicine'', "in the past two decades, the infant mortality rate (deaths under one year of age per thousand live births) in the United States has declined sharply." Low birth weights from African American mothers remain twice as high as that of white women. LBW may be the leading cause of infant deaths, and it is greatly preventable. Although it is preventable, the solutions may not be the easiest but effective programs to help prevent LBW are a combination of health care, education, environment, mental modification and public policy, influencing a culture supporting lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalhealthystart.org/site/assets/docs/Infant%20Mortality%20Low%20Birthweight.pdf Infant Mortality, Low birth Weight and Racial Disparity]. nationalhealthystart.org (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Preterm birth is the leading cause of newborn deaths worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/index.html WHO | Preterm birth]. Who.int. Retrieved 2013-09-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though America excels past many other countries in the care and saving of premature infants, the percentage of American woman who deliver prematurely is comparable to those in developing countries. Reasons for this include [[teenage pregnancy]], increase in pregnant mothers over the age of thirty-five, increase in the use of in-vitro fertilization which increases the risk of multiple births, obesity and diabetes. Also, women who do not have access to health care are less likely to visit a doctor, therefore increasing their risk of delivering prematurely.&lt;ref name=lag/&gt;

====Sudden infant death syndrome====
{{Main article|Sudden infant death syndrome}}
Sudden infant death syndrome(SIDS) is a syndrome where an infant dies in their sleep with no reason behind it. Even with a complete autopsy, no one has been able to figure out what causes this disease. This disease is more common in Western countries.&lt;ref name = "Duncan_2018"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: An Overview |first1 = Jhodie R |last = Duncan |first2 = Roger W | last2 = Byard | editor-first1 = Jhodie R | editor-last = Duncan | editor-first2 = Roger W | editor-last2 = Byard | name-list-format = vanc | title = SIDS Sudden infant and early childhood death: The past, the present and the future | publisher = University of Adelaide Press | year = 2018 | doi = 10.20851/j.ctv2n7f0v.6 | jstor = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though researchers are not sure what causes this disease, they have discovered that it is healthier for babies to sleep on their backs instead of their stomachs.&lt;ref name="pmid8165085"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Willinger M, Hoffman HJ, Hartford RB | title = Infant sleep position and risk for sudden infant death syndrome: report of meeting held January 13 and 14, 1994, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 93 | issue = 5 | pages = 814–9 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 8165085 | doi = | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/93/5/814.long }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery saved many families from the tragedy that this disease causes. Scientists have also discovered three causes within a model they created called, the contemporary triple risk model. This model states that three conditions such as the mother smoking while pregnant, the age of the infant, and stress referring to conditions such as overheating, prone sleeping, co-sleeping, and head covering.&lt;ref name = "Duncan_2018" /&gt;
====Malnutrition====
{{Main article|Malnutrition in children}}
Malnutrition or undernutrition is defined as inadequate intake of nourishment, such as proteins and vitamins, which adversely affects the growth, energy and development of people all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Onís M, Monteiro C, Akré J, Glugston G | title = The worldwide magnitude of protein-energy malnutrition: an overview from the WHO Global Database on Child Growth | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 71 | issue = 6 | pages = 703–12 | date = 1993 | pmid = 8313488 | pmc = 2393544 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially prevalent in women and infants under 5 who live in developing countries within the poorer regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.worldvision.org/hunger-news-stories/top-nine-countries-fighting-child-malnutrition|title=Top 9 countries fighting child malnutrition {{!}} World Vision|date=2012-09-26|work=World Vision|access-date=2018-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are most vulnerable as they are yet to fully develop a strong immune system, as well as being dependent upon parents to provide the necessary food and nutritional intake. It is estimated that about 3.5 million children die each year as a result of childhood or maternal malnutrition, with stunted growth, low body weight and low birth weight accounting for about 2.2 million associated deaths. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martins VJ, Toledo Florêncio TM, Grillo LP, do Carmo P, Franco M, Martins PA, Clemente AP, Santos CD, de Fatima A, Vieira M, Sawaya AL | title = Long-lasting effects of undernutrition | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 1817–46 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21776204 | pmc = 3137999 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph8061817 | url = http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/8/6/1817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors which contribute to malnutrition are socioeconomic, environmental, gender status, regional location, and breastfeeding cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahgoud|first=Salah E.O.| name-list-format = vanc |date=2006|title=Factors Affecting Prevalence of Malnutrition Among Children Under Three Years Of Age In Botswana | url = https://ubrisa.ub.bw/bitstream/handle/10311/219/Mahgoub_AJFAND_2006.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |journal=African Journal of Food Agriculture Nutrition and Development|volume=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to assess the most pressing factor as they can intertwine and vary among regions. 

====Adverse effects of malnutrition====
Children suffering from malnutrition face adverse physical effects such as stunting, wasting, or being overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torpy JM, Lynm C, Glass RM | title = JAMA patient page. Malnutrition in children | journal = JAMA | volume = 292 | issue = 5 | pages = 648 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15292091 | doi = 10.1001/jama.292.5.648 | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.292.5.648 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such characteristics entail difference in weight-and-height ratios for age in comparison to adequate standards. In Africa the number of stunted children has risen, while Asia holds the most children under 5 suffering from wasting.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.unicef.org/media/files/JME_2015_edition_Sept_2015.pdf |title=Levels and trends in child malnutrition | work = UNICEF – WHO – World Bank Group joint child malnutrition estimates | date = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of overweight children has increased among all regions of the globe.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Inadequate nutrients adversely effect physical and cognitive developments, increasing susceptibility to severe health problems. Micronutrient deficiency such as iron has been linked to children with anemia, fatigue, and poor brain development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torpy JM, Lynm C, Glass RM | title = JAMA patient page. Malnutrition in children | journal = JAMA | volume = 292 | issue = 5 | pages = 648 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15292091 | doi = 10.1001/jama.292.5.648 | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.292.5.648 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the lack of Vitamin A is the leading cause of blindness among malnourished children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The outcome of malnutrition in children results in decreased ability of the immune system to fight infections, resulting in higher rates of death from diseases such as malaria, respiratory disease and diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tette EM, Sifah EK, Nartey ET | title = Factors affecting malnutrition in children and the uptake of interventions to prevent the condition | journal = BMC Pediatrics | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 189 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26586172 | pmc = 4653928 | doi = 10.1186/s12887-015-0496-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Infectious diseases====
Babies born in low to middle income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia are at the highest risk of neonatal death. Bacterial infections of the bloodstream, lungs, and the brain's covering (meningitis) are responsible for 25% of neonatal deaths. Newborns can acquire infections during birth from bacteria that are present in their mother's reproductive tract.  The mother may not be aware of the infection, or she may have an untreated [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] or [[sexually transmitted disease]]. These bacteria can move up the vaginal canal into the amniotic sac surrounding the baby. Maternal blood-borne infection is another route of bacterial infection from mother to baby. Neonatal infection is also more likely with the premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) of the amniotic sac.&lt;ref name=pmid23976885&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan GJ, Lee AC, Baqui AH, Tan J, Black RE | title = Risk of early-onset neonatal infection with maternal infection or colonization: a global systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = e1001502 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23976885 | pmc = 3747995 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven out of ten childhood deaths are due to infectious diseases: [[acute respiratory infection]], [[diarrhea]], [[measles]], and [[malaria]]. Acute respiratory infection such as [[pneumonia]], [[bronchitis]], and [[bronchiolitis]] account for 30% of childhood deaths; 95% of pneumonia cases occur in the developing world. Diarrhea is the second-largest cause of childhood mortality in the world, while malaria causes 11% of childhood deaths. Measles is the fifth-largest cause of childhood mortality.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha| name-list-format = vanc |title=Creating Capabilities|year=2011|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | isbn=0-674-05054-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Folic acid]] for mothers is one way to combat iron deficiency. A few [[public health]] measures used to lower levels of iron deficiency anemia include iodize salt or drinking water, and include vitamin A and multivitamin supplements into a mother's diet.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; A deficiency of this vitamin causes certain types of [[anemia]] (low red blood cell count).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100714151130/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000723 Folic Acid].

===Environmental===
Infant mortality rate can be a measure of a nation's health and social condition.&lt;ref name="MacDorman 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacDorman MF, Mathews TJ | title = The challenge of infant mortality: have we reached a plateau? | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 124 | issue = 5 | pages = 670–81 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19753945 | pmc = 2728659 | doi = 10.1177/003335490912400509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gortmaker 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gortmaker SL, Wise PH | title = The first injustice: socioeconomic disparities, health services technology, and infant mortality | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 23 | pages = 147–70 | year = 1997 | pmid = 12348279 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.23.1.147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a composite of a number of component rates which have their separate relationship with various social factors and can often be seen as an indicator to measure the level of socioeconomic disparity within a country.&lt;ref name="Gortmaker 1997" /&gt;

Organic [[water pollution]] is a better indicator of infant mortality than health expenditures per capita. Water contaminated with various [[pathogens]] houses a host of [[parasitic]] and [[microbial]] infections. Infectious disease and parasites are carried via water pollution from animal wastes.&lt;ref name="Jorgenson"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jorgenson AK | title = Global inequality, water pollution, and infant mortality | journal = The Social Science Journal | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 279–288 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1016/j.soscij.2004.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas of low [[socioeconomic status]] are more prone to inadequate plumbing infrastructure, and poorly maintained facilities.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; The burning of inefficient fuels doubles the rate of children under 5 years old with acute respiratory tract infections.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; Climate and geography often play a role in sanitation conditions. For example, the inaccessibility of clean water exacerbates poor sanitation conditions.&lt;ref name="Jorgenson" /&gt;

People who live in areas where [[particulate matter]] (PM) air pollution is higher tend to have more health problems across the board. Short-term and long-term effects of ambient air pollution are associated with an increased mortality rate, including infant mortality. Air pollution is consistently associated with post neonatal mortality due to respiratory effects and sudden infant death syndrome. Specifically, air pollution is highly associated with SIDs in the United States during the post-neonatal stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodruff TJ, Darrow LA, Parker JD | title = Air pollution and postneonatal infant mortality in the United States, 1999-2002 | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 116 | issue = 1 | pages = 110–5 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18197308 | pmc = 2199284 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.10370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High infant mortality is exacerbated because newborns are a vulnerable subgroup that is affected by air pollution.&lt;ref name="Glinianaia"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glinianaia SV, Rankin J, Bell R, Pless-Mulloli T, Howel D | title = Does particulate air pollution contribute to infant death?

Women who are exposed to greater air pollution on a daily basis who are pregnant should be closely watched by their doctors, as well as after the baby is born. Babies who live in areas with less air pollution have a greater chance of living until their first birthday. As expected, babies who live in environments with more air pollution are at greater risk for infant mortality. Areas that have higher air pollution also have a greater chance of having a higher population density, higher crime rates and lower income levels, all of which can lead to higher infant mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/resources/advances/2005/infant.cfm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111012190945/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/resources/advances/2005/infant.cfm | archive-date = 12 October 2011 | dead-url = yes | title = Infant Mortality: Reducing Infant Deaths. | publisher = [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key pollutant for infant mortality rates is [[carbon monoxide]]. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that does great harm especially to infants because of their immature respiratory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benjamin DK | url = http://perc.org/articles/air-pollution-and-infant-mortality | title = Air Pollution and Infant Mortality | journal = Property and Environmental Research Center Report | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | date = Winter 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another major pollutant is second-hand smoke, which is a pollutant that can have detrimental effects on a fetus. According to the ''American Journal of Public Health'', "in 2006, more than 42 000 Americans died of second hand smoke-attributable diseases, including more than 41 000 adults and nearly 900 infants&amp;nbsp;... fully 36% of the infants who died of low birth weight caused by exposure to maternal smoking in utero were Blacks, as were 28% of those dying of respiratory distress syndrome, 25% dying of other respiratory conditions, and 24% dying of sudden infant death syndrome." ''The American Journal of Epidemiology'' also stated that "Compared with nonsmoking women having their first birth, women who smoked less than one pack of cigarettes per day had a 25% greater risk of mortality, and those who smoked one or more packs per day had a 56% greater risk. Among women having their second or higher birth, smokers experienced 30% greater mortality than nonsmokers."

Modern research in the United States on racial disparities in infant mortality suggests a link between the [[institutionalized racism]] that pervades the environment and high rates of African American infant mortality. In synthesis of this research, it has been observed that "African American infant mortality remains elevated due to the social arrangements that exist between groups and the lifelong experiences responding to the resultant power dynamics of these arrangements."&lt;ref name=Osel2008/&gt;

It is important to note that infant mortality rates do not decline among African Americans even if their socio-economic status does improve. Parker Dominguez at the University of Southern California has made some headway in determining the reasoning behind this, claiming black women are more prone to psychological stress than other women of different races in the United States. Stress is a lead factor in inducing labor in pregnant women, and therefore high levels of stress during pregnancy could lead to premature births that have the potential to be fatal for the infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/03/03/42483/why-do-black-infants-die-so-much-more-often-than-w/|title=Why do black infants die so much more often than white infants? |date=2014-03-03|work =Southern California Public Radio|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early childhood trauma===
[[Early childhood trauma]] includes physical, sexual, and psychological abuse of a child ages zero to five years-old. [[Childhood trauma|Trauma]] in early development has extreme impact over the course of a lifetime and is a significant contributor to infant mortality. Developing organs are fragile. When an infant is shaken, beaten, strangled, or raped the impact is exponentially more destructive than when the same abuse occurs in a fully developed body. Studies estimate that 1–2 per 100,000 U.S. children annually are fatally injured. Unfortunately, it is reasonable to assume that these statistics under represent actual mortality.&lt;ref name="childwelfare.gov fatality"&gt;https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubpdfs/fatality.pdf{{full|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24094272&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palusci VJ, Covington TM | title = Child maltreatment deaths in the U.S. National Child Death Review Case Reporting System | journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–36 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24094272 | doi = 10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.08.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three-quarters (74.8 percent) of child fatalities in FFY 2015 involved children younger than 3 years, and children younger than 1 year accounted for 49.4 percent of all fatalities.&lt;ref name="childwelfare.gov fatality"/&gt;  In particular, correctly identifying deaths due to neglect is problematic and children with sudden unexpected death or those with what appear to be unintentional causes on the surface often have preventable risk factors which are substantially similar to those in families with maltreatment.

===Socio-economic factors===
[[Social class]] is a major factor in infant mortality, both historically and today. Between 1912 and 1915, the Children's Bureau in the United States examined data across eight cities and nearly 23,000 live births. They discovered that lower [[income]]s tend to [[correlation|correlate]] with higher infant mortality. In cases where the father had no income, the rate of infant mortality was 357% more than that for the highest income earners ($1,250+). Differences between [[race (classification of humans)|races]] were also apparent. African-American mothers experience infant mortality at a rate 44% higher than average;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2011.05.009 |ssrn=1630138 |title=Inequality and infant and childhood mortality in the United States in the twentieth century |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=418–28 |year=2011 |last1=Haines |first1=Michael R | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, research indicates that socio-economic factors do not totally account for the racial disparities in infant mortality.&lt;ref name=Osel2008/&gt;

While infant mortality is normally negatively correlated with GDP, there may indeed be some opposing short-term effects from a recession. A recent study by ''[[The Economist]]'' showed that economic slowdowns reduce the amount of air pollution, which results in a lower infant mortality rate. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the recession's impact on air quality is estimated to have saved around 1,300 US babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=7933604&amp;story_id=13764868 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725034036/http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=7933604&amp;story_id=13764868 | archive-date=2009-07-25 | work=The Economist | title=A recession breathes life | date=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only during deep recessions that infant mortality increases. According to Norbert Schady and Marc-François Smitz, recessions when GDP per capita drops by 15% or more increase infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Schady, Norbert and Smitz, Marc (August 2009) [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRICA/Resources/SchadySmitz_080509.pdf Aggregate Economic Shocks and Infant Mortality: New Evidence for Middle-Income Countries]. The World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;

Social class dictates which medical services are available to an individual. Disparities due to [[socioeconomic]] factors have been exacerbated by advances in medical [[technology]]. Developed countries, most notably the United States, have seen a divergence between those living in poverty who cannot afford medical advanced resources, leading to an increased chance of infant mortality, and others.&lt;ref name="Gortmaker 1997"/&gt;

===War===
In policy, there is a lag time between realization of a problem's possible solution and actual implementation of policy solutions.{{Clarify|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref name="Farahani"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farahani M, Subramanian SV, Canning D | title = The effect of changes in health sector resources on infant mortality in the short-run and the long-run: a longitudinal econometric analysis | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 68 | issue = 11 | pages = 1918–25 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19362762 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.03.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infant mortality rates correlate with [[war]], political unrest, and [[government corruption]].&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;

In most cases, war-affected areas will experience a significant increase in infant mortality rates.  Having a war taking place where a woman is planning on having a baby is not only stressful on the mother and foetus, but also has several detrimental effects.

However, many other significant factors influence infant mortality rates in war-torn areas. Health care systems in developing countries in the midst of war often collapse. Attaining basic medical supplies and care becomes increasingly difficult. During the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s Bosnia experienced a 60% decrease in child immunizations. Preventable diseases can quickly become epidemic given the medical conditions during war.&lt;ref name="Krug 2002"&gt;{{cite book | publisher = Geneva WHO | last = Krug | first = Etienne | name-list-format = vanc | title = World Report on Violence and Health | location = Geneva | year = 2002 | url = http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many developing countries rely on foreign aid for basic nutrition. Transport of aid becomes significantly more difficult in times of war. In most situations the average weight of a population will drop substantially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Toole MJ, Galson S, Brady W | title = Are war and public health compatible? | journal = Lancet | volume = 341 | issue = 8854 | pages = 1193–6 | date = May 1993 | pmid = 8098086 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(93)91013-C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expecting mothers are affected even more by lack of access to food and water. During the Yugoslav Wars in Bosnia the number of premature babies born increased and the average birth weight decreased.&lt;ref name="Krug 2002"/&gt;

There have been several instances in recent years of systematic rape as a weapon of war. Women who become pregnant as a result of war rape face even more significant challenges in bearing a healthy child. Studies suggest that women who experience sexual violence before or during pregnancy are more likely to experience infant death in their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Asling-Monemi |first1=K. |last2=Peña |first2=R. |last3=Ellsberg |first3=M.

===Medicine and biology===
Developing countries have a lack of access to affordable and professional health care resources, and skilled personnel during deliveries.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farahani" /&gt; Countries with histories of extreme [[poverty]] also have a pattern of epidemics, endemic infectious diseases, and low levels of access to maternal and child healthcare.&lt;ref name="Shandra"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shandra JM, Nobles J, London B, Williamson JB | title = Dependency, democracy, and infant mortality: a quantitative, cross-national analysis of less developed countries | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 321–33 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15110423 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2003.10.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants need multiple doses of vaccines such as [[DPT vaccine|diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine]], [[Hib vaccine|Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine]], [[Hepatitis B vaccine|Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine]], [[Polio vaccine|inactivated polio vaccine]] (IPV), and [[pneumococcal vaccine]] (PCV). Research was conducted by the [[Institute of Medicine]]'s Immunization Safety Review Committee concluded that there is no relationship between these vaccines and risk of SIDS in infants. This tells us that not only is it extremely necessary for every child to get these vaccines to prevent serious diseases, but there is no reason to believe that if your child does receive an immunization that it will have any effect on their risk of SIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Stratton | first1 = Kathleen | last2 = Almario | first2 = Donna A. | last3 = Wizemann | first3 = Theresa M. | last4 = McCormick | first4 = Marie C. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2003 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221465/ | title = Immunization Safety Review: Vaccinations and Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy | work = Institute of Medicine, Immunization Safety Review Committee, Board of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention | publisher = National Academies Press (US) | location = Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Political modernization perspective, the neo-classical economic theory that scarce goods are most effectively distributed to the market, say that the level of political [[democracy]] influences the rate of infant mortality. Developing nations with democratic governments tend to be more responsive to public opinion, [[social movements]], and [[special interest groups]] for issues like infant mortality. In contrast, non-democratic governments are more interested in corporate issues and less so in health issues. Democratic status effects the dependency a nation has towards its economic state via export, investments from multinational corporations and international lending institutions.&lt;ref name="Shandra" /&gt;

Levels of socioeconomic development and global integration are inversely related to a nation's infant mortality rate.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuse"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fuse K, Crenshaw EM | title = Gender imbalance in infant mortality: a cross-national study of social structure and female infanticide | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 360–74 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16046041 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.06.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency perspective occurs in a global capital system. A nation's internal impact is highly influenced by its position in the global economy and has adverse effects on the survival of children in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Jorgenson" /&gt; Countries can experience disproportionate effects from its [[trade]] and stratification within the global system.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore S, Teixeira AC, Shiell A | title = The health of nations in a global context: trade, global stratification, and infant mortality rates | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 63 | issue = 1 | pages = 165–78 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16457924 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.12.009 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7316172_The_health_of_nations_in_a_global_context_trade_global_stratification_and_infant_mortality_rates?ev=prf_cit }}&lt;/ref&gt; It aids in the global [[division of labor]], distorting the [[domestic economy]] of developing nations. The dependency of developing nations can lead to a reduce rate of economic growth, increase income inequality inter- and intra-national, and adversely affects the wellbeing of a nation's population. A collective cooperation between economic countries plays a role in development policies in the poorer, peripheral, countries of the world.&lt;ref name="Shandra" /&gt;

These economic factors present challenges to governments' public [[health policy|health policies]].&lt;ref name="Jorgenson" /&gt; If the nation's ability to raise its own revenues is compromised, governments will lose funding for its health service programs, including services that aim in decreasing infant mortality rates.&lt;ref name="Shandra" /&gt; Peripheral countries face higher levels of vulnerability to the possible negative effects of globalization and trade in relation to key countries in the global market.&lt;ref name="Jorgenson" /&gt;

Even with a strong economy and economic growth (measured by a country's [[gross national product]]), the advances of medical technologies may not be felt by everyone, lending itself to increasing social disparities.&lt;ref name="Gortmaker 1997"/&gt;

===Cultural===
High rates of infant mortality occur in developing countries where financial and material resources are scarce and there is a high tolerance to high number of infant deaths. There are circumstances where a number of developing countries to breed a culture where situations of infant mortality such as favoring male babies over female babies are the norm.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; In developing countries such as Brazil, infant mortality rates are commonly not recorded due to failure to register for death certificates.&lt;ref name="Nations"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nations MK, Amaral ML | title = Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry | journal = Medical Anthropology Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 204–220 | year = 1991 | doi = 10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to register is mainly due to the potential loss of time and money and other indirect costs to the family.&lt;ref name="Nations" /&gt; Even with resource opportunities such as the 1973 Public Registry Law 6015, which allowed free registration for low-income families, the requirements to qualify hold back individuals who are not contracted workers.&lt;ref name="Nations" /&gt;

Another cultural reason for infant mortality, such as what is happening in Ghana, is that "besides the obvious, like rutted roads, there are prejudices against wives or newborns leaving the house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = McNeil D | date = October 29, 2012 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/health/gates-foundation-backs-hospital-transportation-for-expectant-mothers.html?ref=infantmortality | title = Ghana: A grant meant to curb infant mortality focuses on getting mothers to the hospital | work = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this it is making it even more difficult for the women and newborns to get the treatment that is available to them and that is needed.

Cultural influences and lifestyle habits in the United States can account for some deaths in infants throughout the years. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association "the post neonatal mortality risk (28 to 364 days) was highest among continental Puerto Ricans" compared to babies of the non-Hispanic race. Examples of this include teenage pregnancy, obesity, diabetes and smoking. All are possible causes of premature births, which constitute the second highest cause of infant mortality.&lt;ref name=lag&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = McNeil D | date = May 2, 2012 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/health/us-lags-in-global-measure-of-preterm-births.html | title = U.S. Lags in Global Measure of Premature Births | work = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic differences experienced in the United States are accompanied by higher prevalence of behavioral risk factors and sociodemographic challenges that each ethnic group faces.&lt;ref name="MacDorman 2009"/&gt;

====Gender favoritism====
Historically, males have had higher infant mortality rates than females. The difference between male and female infant mortality rates have been dependent on environmental, social, and economic conditions. More specifically, males are biologically more vulnerable to infections and conditions associated with prematurity and development. Before 1970, the reasons for male infant mortality were due to infections, and chronic degenerative diseases. However, since 1970, certain cultures emphasizing males has led to a decrease in the infant mortality gap between males and females. Also, medical advances have resulted in a growing number of male infants surviving at higher rates than females due to the initial high infant mortality rate of males.&lt;ref name="Dreven"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drevenstedt GL, Crimmins EM, Vasunilashorn S, Finch CE | title = The rise and fall of excess male infant mortality | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 13 | pages = 5016–21 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18362357 | pmc = 2278210 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0800221105 | url = http://paa2007.princeton.edu/papers/71947 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.5016D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic components results in newborn females being biologically advantaged when it comes to surviving their first birthday. Males, biologically, have lower chances of surviving infancy in comparison to female babies. As infant mortality rates saw a decrease on a global scale, the gender most affected by infant mortality changed from males experiences a biological disadvantage, to females facing a societal disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Dreven"/&gt; Some developing nations have social and cultural patterns that reflects adult [[discrimination]] to favor boys over girls for their future potential to contribute to the household production level. A country's ethnic composition, homogeneous versus heterogeneous, can explain social attitudes and practices. Heterogeneous level is a strong predictor in explaining infant mortality.&lt;ref name="Fuse" /&gt;

====Birth spacing====
Birth spacing is the time between births. Births spaced at least three years apart from one another are associated with the lowest rate of mortality. The longer the interval between births, the lower the risk for having any birthing complications, and infant, childhood and maternal mortality.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rutstein"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutstein SO | title = Effects of preceding birth intervals on neonatal, infant and under-five years mortality and nutritional status in developing countries: evidence from the demographic and health surveys | journal = International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics | volume = 89 Suppl 1 | pages = S7-24 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15820369 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2004.11.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher rates of pre-term births, and low birth weight are associated with birth to conception intervals of less than six months and abortion to pregnancy interval of less than six months. Shorter intervals between births increase the chances of [[Chronic condition|chronic]] and general under-nutrition; 57% of women in 55 developing countries reported birth spaces shorter than three years; 26% report birth spacing of less than two years. Only 20% of post-partum women report wanting another birth within two years; however, only 40% are taking necessary steps such as [[family planning]] to achieve the birth intervals they want.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;

Unplanned pregnancies and birth intervals of less than twenty-four months are known to correlate with low birth weights and delivery complications.  Also, women who are already small in stature tend to deliver smaller than average babies, perpetuating a cycle of being [[underweight]].&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rutstein" /&gt;

==Prevention and outcomes==
To reduce infant mortality rates across the world health practitioners, governments, and non-governmental organizations have worked to create institutions, programs and policies to generate better  health outcomes. Improvements such as better sanitation practices have proven to be effective in reducing public health outbreaks and rates of disease among mothers and children. Efforts to increase a households' income through direct assistance or economic opportunities decreases mortality rates, as families possess some means for more food and access to healthcare. Education campaigns, disseminating knowledge among urban and rural regions, and better access to education attainment prove to be an effective strategy to reduce infant and mother mortality rates. Current efforts from NGOs and governments are focused developing human resources, strengthening health information systems, health services delivery, etc. Improvements in such areas have increased regional health systems and aided in efforts to reduce mortality rates. 

===Public health===
Reductions in infant mortality are possible in any stage of a country's development.&lt;ref name="Bishai" /&gt; Rate reductions are evidence that a country is advancing in human knowledge, social [[institutions]] and [[physical capital]]. Governments can reduce the mortality rates by addressing the combined need for education (such as [[universal primary education]]), nutrition, and access to basic maternal and infant health services. A policy focus has the potential to aid those most at risk for infant and childhood mortality allows rural, poor and migrant populations.&lt;ref name="Farahani" /&gt;

Reducing chances of babies being born at low birth weights and contracting pneumonia can be accomplished by improving air quality. Improving [[hygiene]] can prevent infant mortality. Home-based technology to [[Water chlorination|chlorinate]], filter, and [[solar disinfection]] for organic water pollution could reduce cases of diarrhea in children by up to 48%.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nussbaum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jorgenson" /&gt; Improvements in food supplies and [[sanitation]] has been shown to work in the United States' most vulnerable populations, one being African Americans. Overall, women's health status need to remain high.&lt;ref name="Gortmaker 1997"/&gt;

Simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[hand washing]] with soap, can significantly reduce the rate of infant mortality from respiratory and diarrheal diseases.&lt;ref name=pmid12726975&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Curtis V, Cairncross S | title = Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 275–81 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12726975 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNICEF, hand washing with soap before eating and after using the [[toilet]] can save more lives of children than any single vaccine or medical intervention, by cutting deaths from diarrhea and acute respiratory infections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/The_State_of_the_Worlds_Children_2008.pdf The State of the World’s Children 2008. Child Survival. UNICEF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Future problems for mothers and babies can be prevented. It is important that women of reproductive age adopt healthy behaviors in everyday life, such as taking folic acid, maintaining a healthy diet and weight, being physically active, avoiding tobacco use, and avoiding excessive alcohol and drug use. If women follow some of the above guidelines, later complications can be prevented to help decrease the infant mortality rates. Attending regular [[prenatal care]] check-ups will help improve the baby's chances of being delivered in safer conditions and surviving.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Focusing on preventing preterm and low birth weight deliveries throughout all populations can help to eliminate cases of infant mortality and decrease health care disparities within communities. In the United States, these two goals have decreased infant mortality rates on a regional population, it has yet to see further progress on a national level.&lt;ref name="MacDorman 2009"/&gt;

=== Medical treatments ===
Technological advances in medicine would decrease the infant mortality rate and an increased access to such technologies could decrease racial and ethnic disparities. It has been shown that technological determinants are influenced by social determinants. Those who cannot afford to utilize advances in medicine tend to show higher rates of infant mortality. Technological advances has, in a way, contributed to the social disparities observed today. Providing equal access has the potential to decrease socioeconomic disparities in infant mortality.&lt;ref name="Gortmaker 1997"/&gt; Specifically, Cambodia is facing issues with a disease that is unfortunately killing infants. The symptoms only last 24 hours and the result is death. As stated if technological advances were increased in countries it would make it easier to find the solution to diseases such as this.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, M. (4 July 2012). [http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/whats-killing-cambodias-children/?ref=infantmortality What's Killing Cambodia's Children?] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, there have been declines in the United States that could be attributed to advances in technology. Advancements in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit can be related to the decline in infant mortality in addition to the advancement of surfactants.&lt;ref name="Infant Mortality"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mchb.hrsa.gov/about/timeline/in-depth-2-infant-mortality.asp|title=Infant Mortality|website=mchb.hrsa.gov | access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the importance of the advancement of technology remains unclear as the number of high-risk births increases in the United States.&lt;ref name="Infant Mortality"/&gt;

===Education===
It has been well documented that increased education among mothers, communities, and local health workers results in better family planning, improvement on children's health, and lower rates of children's deaths. High-risk areas, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, have demonstrated that an increase in women's education attainment leads to a reduction in infant mortality by about 35%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=David|last2=Tenikue|first2=Michel | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017-09-13|title=Women’s education, infant and child mortality, and fertility decline in rural and urban sub-Saharan Africa|url=https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol37/21/|journal=Demographic Research|volume=37|pages=669–708|doi=10.4054/demres.2017.37.21|issn=1435-9871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, coordinated efforts to train community health workers in diagnosis, treatment, malnutrition prevention, reporting and referral services has reduced infant mortality in children under 5 as much as 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mugeni C, Levine AC, Munyaneza RM, Mulindahabi E, Cockrell HC, Glavis-Bloom J, Nutt CT, Wagner CM, Gaju E, Rukundo A, Habimana JP, Karema C, Ngabo F, Binagwaho A | title = Nationwide implementation of integrated community case management of childhood illness in Rwanda | journal = Global Health, Science and Practice | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 328–41 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25276592 | pmc = 4168626 | doi = 10.9745/GHSP-D-14-00080 | url = http://www.ghspjournal.org/content/2/3/328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public health campaigns centered around the "First 1,000 Days" of conception have been successful in providing cost-effective supplemental nutrition programs, as well as assisting young mothers in sanitation, hygiene and breastfeeding promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flood D, Chary A, Colom A, Rohloff P | title = Adolescent Rights and the "First 1,000 days" Global Nutrition Movement: A View from Guatemala | journal = Health and Human Rights | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 295–301 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 30008571 | pmc = 6039738 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased intake of nutrients and better sanitation habits have a positive impact on health, especially developing children. Educational attainment and public health campaigns provide the knowledge and means to practice better habits and leads to better outcomes against infant mortality rates. 

=== Income ===
Awareness of health services, education, and economic opportunities provide means to sustain and increase chance of development and survival. A decrease on GPD, for example, results in increased rates of infant mortality. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baird|first=Sarah|last2=Friedman|first2=Jed|last3=Schady|first3=Norbert | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011|title=AGGREGATE INCOME SHOCKS AND INFANT MORTALITY IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23016081|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=93|issue=3|pages=847–856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative effects on household income reduces amount being spent on food and healthcare, affecting the quality of life and access to medical services to ensure full development and survival. On the contrary, increased household income translates to more access to nutrients and healthcare, reducing the risks associated with malnutrition and infant mortality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haddad|first=Lawrence|last2=Alderman|first2=Harold|last3=Appleton|first3=Simon|last4=Song|first4=Lina|last5=Yohannes|first5=Yisehac | name-list-format = vanc |date=2003-06-01|title=Reducing Child Malnutrition: How Far Does Income Growth Take Us?|url=https://academic.oup.com/wber/article/17/1/107/1676289|journal=The World Bank Economic Review | volume=17|issue=1|pages=107–131|doi=10.1093/wber/lhg012|issn=0258-6770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, increased aggregate household incomes will produce better health facilities, water and sewer infrastructures for the entire community. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

===Policies===
Granting women employment raises their status and autonomy. Having a [[gainful employment]] can raise the perceived worth of females. This can lead to an increase in the number of women getting an education and a decrease in the number of female [[infanticide]].&lt;ref name="Fuse" /&gt; In the social modernization perspective, education leads to development. Higher number of skilled workers means more earning and further economic growth. According to the economic modernization perspective, this is one type economic growth viewed as the driving force behind the increase in development and standard of living in a country. This is further explained by the [[modernization theory]]- economic development promotes physical wellbeing. As economy rises, so do technological advances and thus, medical advances in access to clean water, health care facilities, education, and diet. These changes may decrease infant mortality.&lt;ref name="Shandra" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuse" /&gt;

Economically, governments could reduce infant mortality by building and strengthening capacity in [[human resources]]. Increasing human resources such as [[physicians]], [[nurses]], and other health professionals will increase the number of skilled attendants and the number of people able to give out immunized against diseases such as measles. Increasing the number of skilled professionals is negatively correlated with maternal, infant, and childhood mortality. Between 1960 and 2000, the infant mortality rate decreased by half as the number of physicians increased by four folds.&lt;ref name="Farahani" /&gt; With the addition of one physician to every 1000 persons in a population, infant mortality will reduce by 30%.

In certain parts of the U.S., specific modern programs aim to reduce levels of infant mortality. An example of one such program is the 'Healthy Me, Healthy You' program based in Northeast Texas. It intends to identify factors that contribute to negative birth outcomes throughout a 37-county area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Surviving, thriving:Public health workers working to improve East Texas babies' health, reduce infant mortality | work=Tyler Morning Telegraph | date=August 21, 2016 | last = Dillard | first = Coshandra | name-list-format = vanc | location=Tyler, Texas | pages=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional program that aims to reduce infant mortality is the "Best Babies Zone" (BBZ) based at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The BBZ uses the [[life course approach]] to address the structural causes of poor birth outcomes and toxic stress in three U.S. neighborhoods. By employing community-generated solutions, the Best Babies Zone's ultimate goal is to achieve health equity in communities that are disproportionately impacted by infant death.&lt;ref name=pmid27013517&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pies C, Barr M, Strouse C, Kotelchuck M | title = Growing a Best Babies Zone: Lessons Learned from the Pilot Phase of a Multi-Sector, Place-Based Initiative to Reduce Infant Mortality | journal = Maternal and Child Health Journal | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 968–73 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27013517 | doi = 10.1007/s10995-016-1969-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the method of calculating IMR often varies widely between countries, and is based on how they define a live birth and how many premature infants are born in the country. Reporting of infant mortality rates can be inconsistent, and may be understated, depending on a nation's live birth criterion, vital registration system, and reporting practices.&lt;ref name="Anthopolos"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.013 |title=Global Infant Mortality: Correcting for Undercounting |journal=World Development |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=467–81 |year=2010 |last1=Anthopolos |first1=Rebecca |last2=Becker |first2=Charles M | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reported IMR provides one statistic which reflects the standard of living in each nation.

Retrieved 2013-09-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, however, including certain European states (e.g. France) and Japan, only count as live births cases where an infant breathes at birth, which makes their reported IMR numbers somewhat lower and increases their rates of perinatal mortality.&lt;ref name="us news"&gt;{{cite news| last = Healy | first = Bernadine  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Behind the Baby Count |publisher=US News &amp; World Report |date=2006-09-24 |url= http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/060924/2healy.htm |access-date=2014-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824012048/http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/060924/2healy.htm |archive-date=August 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, for instance, requirements for live birth are even higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-CC-03-005/EN/KS-CC-03-005-EN.PDF Demographic Statistics: Definitions and Methods of Collection in 31 European Countries (by European Communities, 2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213060234/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-CC-03-005/EN/KS-CC-03-005-EN.PDF |date=2013-12-13 }}.

Although many countries have vital registration systems and certain reporting practices, there are many inaccuracies, particularly in undeveloped nations, in the statistics of the number of infants dying. Studies have shown that comparing three information sources (official registries, household surveys, and popular reporters) that the "popular death reporters" are the most accurate. Popular death reporters include midwives, gravediggers, coffin builders, priests, and others—essentially people who knew the most about the child's death. In developing nations, access to vital registries, and other government-run systems which record births and deaths, is difficult for poor families for several reasons. These struggles force stress on families{{clarify|date=April 2016}}, and make them take drastic measures{{clarify|date=April 2016}} in unofficial death ceremonies for their deceased infants. As a result, government statistics will inaccurately reflect a nation's infant mortality rate. Popular death reporters have first-hand information, and provided this information can be collected and collated, can provide reliable data which provide a nation with accurate death counts and meaningful causes of deaths that can be measured/studied.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt;

[[UNICEF]] uses a statistical methodology to account for reporting differences among countries:
{{quote|UNICEF compiles infant mortality country estimates derived from all sources and methods of estimation obtained either from standard reports, direct estimation from micro data sets, or from UNICEF's yearly exercise. In order to sort out differences between estimates produced from different sources, with different methods, UNICEF developed, in coordination with WHO, the WB and UNSD, an estimation methodology that minimizes the errors embodied in each estimate and harmonize trends along time. Since the estimates are not necessarily the exact values used as input for the model, they are often not recognized as the official IMR estimates used at the country level. However, as mentioned before, these estimates minimize errors and maximize the consistency of trends along time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx?IndicatorId=0&amp;SeriesId=562 Millennium Indicators]. United Nations. Retrieved 2013-09-29.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another challenge to comparability is the practice of counting frail or premature infants who die before the normal due date as [[miscarriage]]s (spontaneous abortions) or those who die during or immediately after childbirth as [[Stillbirth|stillborn]]. Therefore, the quality of a country's documentation of [[perinatal mortality]] can matter greatly to the accuracy of its infant mortality statistics. This point is reinforced by the demographer [[Ansley J. Coale|Ansley Coale]], who finds dubiously high ratios of reported stillbirths to infant deaths in Hong Kong and Japan in the first 24 hours after birth, a pattern that is consistent with the high recorded sex ratios at birth in those countries. It suggests not only that many female infants who die in the first 24 hours are misreported as stillbirths rather than infant deaths, but also that those countries do not follow WHO recommendations for the reporting of live births and infant deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coale AJ, Banister J | title = Five decades of missing females in China | journal = Demography | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 459–79 | date = August 1994 | pmid = 7828766 | doi = 10.2307/2061752 | jstor = 2061752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another seemingly paradoxical finding, is that when countries with poor medical services introduce new medical centers and services, instead of declining, the reported IMRs often increase for a time. This is mainly because improvement in access to medical care is often accompanied by improvement in the registration of births and deaths. Deaths that might have occurred in a remote or rural area, and not been reported to the government, might now be reported by the new medical personnel or facilities. Thus, even if the new health services reduce the actual IMR, the reported IMR may increase.

Collecting the accurate statistics of infant mortality rate could be an issue in some rural communities in developing countries. In those communities, some other alternative methods for calculating infant mortality rate are emerged, for example, popular death reporting and household survey.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt;
The country-to-country variation in child mortality rates is huge, and growing wider despite the progress. Among the world's roughly 200 nations, only Somalia showed no decrease in the under-5 mortality rate over the past two decades.The lowest rate in 2011 was in Singapore, which had 2.6 deaths of children under age 5 per 1,000 live births. The highest was in Sierra Leone, which had 185 child deaths per 1,000 births. The global rate is 51 deaths per 1,000 births. For the United States, the rate is eight per 1,000 births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Brown | first = David | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2011-02-28 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/child-mortality-falls-more-than-40-percent-in-the-past-two-decades/2012/09/12/8a5bbc68-fd14-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html | title = Child mortality falls more than 40 percent in the past two decades | work = The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infant mortality rate (IMR) is not only a group of statistic but instead it is a reflection of the socioeconomic development and effectively represents the presence of medical services in the countries. IMR is an effective resource for the health department to make decision on medical resources reallocation. IMR also formulates the global health strategies and help evaluate the program success. The existence of IMR helps solve the inadequacies of the other vital statistic systems for global health as most of the vital statistic systems usually neglect the infant mortality statistic number from the poor. There are certain amounts of unrecorded infant deaths in the rural area as they do not have information about infant mortality rate statistic or do not have the concept about reporting early infant death.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt;

===Europe and America===
The exclusion of any high-risk infants from the denominator or numerator in reported IMRs can cause problems in making comparisons.  Many countries, including the United States, Sweden and Germany, count an infant exhibiting any sign of life as alive, no matter the month of gestation or the size, but according to United States some other countries differ in these practices.  All of the countries named adopted the WHO definitions in the late 1980s or early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duc G | title = The crucial role of definition in perinatal epidemiology | journal = Sozial- Und Praventivmedizin | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 357–60 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8578873 | doi = 10.1007/BF01325417 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are used throughout the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2001/monitoring/fp_monitoring_2001_a1_frep_01_en.pdf | title =Definition of data collected in the European Union, see item 8 | work = Europa (web portal) }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 2009, the US CDC issued a report that stated that the American rates of infant mortality were affected by the United States' high rates of premature babies compared to European countries.  It also outlined the differences in reporting requirements between the United States and Europe, noting that France, the Czech Republic, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Poland do not report all live births of babies under 500&amp;nbsp;g and/or 22 weeks of gestation.&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite news| last = Hendrick | first = Bill  | name-list-format = vanc |title=Preemies Raise U.S. Infant Mortality Rate|publisher=WebMD|date=2009-11-04|url=http://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20091103/preemies-raise-us-infant-mortality-rate|access-date=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="associated press 11.09"&gt;{{cite news| last = Stobbe | first = Mike | name-list-format = vanc |title=Premature births worsen US infant death rate|agency=Associated Press|date=2009-11-03 |url= http://www.denverpost.com/food/ci_13707079 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid21058532&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacDorman MF, Mathews TJ | title = Behind international rankings of infant mortality: how the United States compares with Europe | journal = International Journal of Health Services | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 577–88 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21058532 | doi = 10.2190/HS.40.4.a }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the differences in reporting are unlikely to be the primary explanation for the United States' relatively low international ranking.  Rather, the report concluded that primary reason for the United States’ higher infant mortality rate when compared with Europe was the United States’ much higher percentage of preterm births.&lt;ref name=pmid21058532/&gt;

===Russia===
Until the 1990s, Russia and the Soviet Union did not count, as a live birth or as an infant death, extremely premature infants (less than 1,000&amp;nbsp;g, less than 28 weeks gestational age, or less than 35&amp;nbsp;cm in length) that were born alive (breathed, had a heartbeat, or exhibited voluntary muscle movement) but failed to survive for at least seven days.&lt;ref name=jstor1973432&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1973432 |jstor=1973432 |title=Infant Mortality in the Soviet Union: Regional Differences and Measurement Issues |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=705–38 |year=1986 |last1=Anderson |first1=Barbara A |last2=Silver |first2=Brian D | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although such extremely premature infants typically accounted for only about 0.5% of all live-born children, their exclusion from both the numerator and the denominator in the reported IMR led to an estimated 22%–25% lower reported IMR.&lt;ref&gt;In 1990, the Baltic states moved to the WHO standard definition; in 1993 Russia also moved to this definition.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, too, perhaps because hospitals or regional health departments were held accountable for lowering the IMR in their [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]], infant deaths that occurred in the 12th month were "transferred" statistically to the 13th month (i.e., the second year of life), and thus no longer classified as an infant death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blum, Alain | title = Une nouvelle table de mortalité pour l'URSS (1984-1985) | issue = 6| journal = Population (French Edition) | volume = 42 | pages = 843–862 | year = 1987 | doi = 10.2307/1532733 | jstor = 1532733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Ksenofontova NY |year=1994|chapter=Trends in infant mortality in the USSR| veditors = Lutz W, Scherbov S, Volkov A |title=Demographic Trends and Patterns in the Soviet Union before 1991|location=London|publisher=Routledge|pages=359–378|isbn=0-415-10194-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In certain rural developing areas, such as northeastern Brazil, infant births are often not recorded in the first place, resulting in the discrepancies between the infant mortality rate (IMR) and the actual amount of infant deaths. Access to vital registry systems for infant births and deaths is an extremely difficult and expensive task for poor parents living in rural areas. Government and bureaucracies tend to show an insensitivity to these parents and their recent suffering from a lost child, and produce broad disclaimers in the IMR reports that the information has not been properly reported, resulting in these discrepancies. Little has been done to address the underlying structural problems of the vital registry systems in respect to the lack of reporting from parents in rural areas, and in turn has created a gap between the official and popular meanings of child death.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt; It is also argued that the bureaucratic separation of vital death recording from cultural death rituals is to blame for the inaccuracy of the infant mortality rate (IMR). Vital death registries often fail to recognize the cultural implications and importance of infant deaths. It is not to be said that vital registry systems are not an accurate representation of a region's socio-economic situation, but this is only the case if these statistics are valid, which is unfortunately not always the circumstance. "Popular death reporters" is an alternative method for collecting and processing statistics on infant and child mortality. Many regions may benefit from "popular death reporters" who are culturally linked to infants may be able to provide more accurate statistics on the incidence of infant mortality.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt; According to ethnographic data, "popular death reporters" refers to people who had inside knowledge of ''anjinhos'', including the grave-digger, gatekeeper, midwife, popular healers etc. —— all key participants in mortuary rituals.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt; By combining the methods of household surveys, vital registries, and asking "popular death reporters" this can increase the validity of child mortality rates, but there are many barriers that can reflect the validity of our statistics of infant mortality. One of these barriers are political economic decisions. Numbers are exaggerated when international funds are being doled out; and underestimated during reelection.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt;

The bureaucratic separation of vital death reporting and cultural death rituals stems in part due to structural violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farmer PE, Nizeye B, Stulac S, Keshavjee S | title = Structural violence and clinical medicine | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e449 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17076568 | pmc = 1621099 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals living in rural areas of Brazil need to invest large capital for lodging and travel in order to report infant birth to a Brazilian Assistance League office. The negative financial aspects deters registration, as often individuals are of lower income and cannot afford such expenses.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt; Similar to the lack of birth reporting, families in rural Brazil face difficult choices based on already existing structural arrangements when choosing to report infant mortality. Financial constraints such as reliance on food supplementations may also lead to skewed infant mortality data.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt;

In developing countries such as Brazil the deaths of impoverished infants are regularly unrecorded into the countries vital registration system; this causes a skew statistically. Culturally validity and contextual soundness can be used to ground the meaning of mortality from a statistical standpoint. In northeast Brazil they have accomplished this standpoint while conducting an ethnographic study combined with an alternative method to survey infant mortality.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt; These types of techniques can develop quality ethnographic data that will ultimately lead to a better portrayal of the magnitude of infant mortality in the region. Political economic reasons have been seen to skew the infant mortality data in the past when governor Ceara devised his presidency campaign on reducing the infant mortality rate during his term in office. By using this new way of surveying, these instances can be minimized and removed, overall creating accurate and sound data.&lt;ref name="Nations"/&gt;

For the world, and for both less developed countries (LDCs) and more developed countries (MDCs), IMR declined significantly between 1960 and 2001. According to the [[Save the Children State of the World's Mothers report|State of the World's Mothers report]] by [[Save the Children]], the world IMR declined from 126 in 1960 to 57 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/sowc03/tables/table1.html UNICEF, State of the World's Children 2003 infant mortality table].

However, IMR was, and remains, higher in LDCs. In 2001, the IMR for LDCs (91) was about 10 times as large as it was for MDCs (8). On average, for LDCs, the IMR is 17 times as higher than that of MDCs. Also, while both LDCs and MDCs made significant reductions in infant mortality rates, reductions among less developed countries are, on average, much less than those among the more developed countries.{{Clarify|date=December 2016}}

Of the 27 most developed countries, the U.S. has the highest Infant Mortality Rate, despite spending much more on health care per capita{{Citation needed|reason=numbers needed|date=October 2017}}. Significant racial and socio-economic differences in the United States affect the IMR, in contrast with other developed countries, which have more homogeneous populations. In particular, IMR varies greatly by race in the US. The average IMR for the whole country is therefore not a fair representation of the wide variations that exist between segments of the population. Many theories have been explored as to why these racial differences exist with socio economic factors usually coming out as a reasonable explanation. However, more studies have been conducted around this matter, and the largest advancement is around the idea of stress and how it affects pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Christopher | last = Ingraham | name-list-format = vanc | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/29/our-infant-mortality-rate-is-a-national-embarrassment/ |title=Our infant mortality rate is a national embarrassment|website=Washington Post| date = September 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1850s, the infant mortality rate in the United States was estimated at 216.8 per 1,000 babies born for whites and 340.0 per 1,000 for African Americans, but rates have significantly declined in the West in modern times.

U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (Jan 13, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''New York Times'', "the main reason for the high rate is preterm delivery, and there was a 10% increase in such births from 2000 to 2006."  Between 2007 and 2011, however, the preterm birth rate has decreased every year.  In 2011 there was a 11.73% rate of babies born before the 37th week of gestation, down from a high of 12.80% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr62/nvsr62_01.pdf|title=Births: Final Data for 2011|journal=National Vital Statistics Reports|volume =62|issue=1|date= June 28, 2013| vauthors = Martin JA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic expenditures on labor and delivery and neonatal care are relatively high in the United States. A conventional birth averages 9,775 USD with a C-section costing 15,041 USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rosenthal | first = Elisabeth | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 30, 2013 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/health/american-way-of-birth-costliest-in-the-world.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | title = American Way of Birth, Costliest in the World | work = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preterm births in the US have been estimated to cost $51,600 per child, with a total yearly cost of $26.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11358/ | chapter = Chapter 12: Societal Costs of Preterm Birth | title = Preterm Birth: Causes, Consequences, and Prevention | work = Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understanding Premature Birth and Assuring Healthy Outcomes | veditors = Behrman RE, Butler AS | location = Washington (DC) | publisher = National Academies Press (US) | date = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this spending, several reports state that infant mortality rate in the United States is significantly higher than in other developed nations.&lt;ref name=Osel2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oestergaard MZ, Inoue M, Yoshida S, Mahanani WR, Gore FM, Cousens S, Lawn JE, Mathers CD | title = Neonatal mortality levels for 193 countries in 2009 with trends since 1990: a systematic analysis of progress, projections, and priorities | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = e1001080 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21918640 | pmc = 3168874 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Starfield B | title = Is US health really the best in the world? | journal = JAMA | volume = 284 | issue = 4 | pages = 483–5 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10904513 | doi = 10.1001/jama.284.4.483 | url = http://silver.neep.wisc.edu/~lakes/iatrogenic.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Estimates vary; the CIA's ''[[The World Factbook|World Factbook]]'' ranks the US 55th internationally in 2014, with a rate of 6.17, while the UN figures from 2005-2010 place the US 34th.

Aforementioned differences in measurement could play a substantial role in the disparity between the US and other nations.  A non-viable live birth in the US could be registered as a stillbirth in similarly developed nations like Japan, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France – thereby reducing the infant death count.&lt;ref name=pmid21058532/&gt;  Neonatal intensive care is also more likely to be applied in the US to marginally viable infants, although such interventions have been found to increase both costs and disability.

The vast majority of research conducted in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century indicates that African-American infants are more than twice as likely to die in their first year of life than white infants.  Although following a decline from 13.63 to 11.46 deaths per 1000 live births from 2005 to 2010, non-Hispanic black mothers continued to report a rate 2.2 times as high as that for non-Hispanic white mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6301a9.htm|title=QuickStats: Infant Mortality Rates,* by Race and Hispanic Ethnicity of Mother — United States, 2000, 2005, and 2010|journal=Weekly|date=January 10, 2014 |volume= 63|issue=1|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary research findings have demonstrated that nationwide racial disparities in infant mortality are linked to the experiential state of the mother and that these disparities cannot be totally accounted for by socio-economic, behavioral or genetic factors.&lt;ref name=Osel2008/&gt; The [[Hispanic paradox]], an effect observed in other health indicators, appears in the infant mortality rate, as well. Hispanic mothers see an IMR comparable to non-Hispanic white mothers, despite lower educational attainment and economic status. A study in North Carolina, for example, concluded that "white women who did not complete high school have a lower infant mortality rate than black college graduates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dole N, Savitz DA, Siega-Riz AM, Hertz-Picciotto I, McMahon MJ, Buekens P | title = Psychosocial factors and preterm birth among African American and White women in central North Carolina | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 94 | issue = 8 | pages = 1358–65 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15284044 | pmc = 1448456 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.94.8.1358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Mustillo's [[Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study|CARDIA]] (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) study, "self reported experiences of racial discrimination were associated with pre-term and low-birthweight deliveries, and such experiences may contribute to black-white disparities in prenatal outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mustillo S, Krieger N, Gunderson EP, Sidney S, McCreath H, Kiefe CI | title = Self-reported experiences of racial discrimination and Black-White differences in preterm and low-birthweight deliveries: the CARDIA Study | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 94 | issue = 12 | pages = 2125–31 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15569964 | pmc = 1448602 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.94.12.2125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, dozens of population-based studies indicate that "the subjective, or perceived experience of racial discrimination is strongly associated with an increased risk of infant death and with poor health prospects for future generations of African Americans."&lt;ref name=Osel2008/&gt;

==== African American ====
While earlier parts of this article have addressed the racial differences in infant deaths, a closer look into the effects of racial differences within the country is necessary to view discrepancies. Non-Hispanic Black women lead all other racial groups in IMR with a rate of 11.3, while the Infant Mortality Rate among white women is 5.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/infant-mortality-rate-by-race-ethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;selectedDistributions=non-hispanic-white--non-hispanic-black--hispanic&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D |title=Infant Mortality Rate (Deaths per 1,000 Live Births) by Race/Ethnicity|access-date=2017-03-07 | publisher = Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black women in the United States experience a shorter life expectancy than white women, so while a higher IMR amongst black women is not necessarily out of line, it is still rather disturbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/huge-racial-gap-in-life-expectancy-2014-1|title=This Chart Showing The Gap Between Black And White Life Expectancy Should Be A National Embarrassment|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the popular argument leads to the idea that due to the trend of a lower socio-economic status had by black women there is in an increased likelihood of a child suffering. While this does correlate, the theory that it is the contributing factor falls apart when we look at Latino IMR in the United States. Latino people are almost just as likely to experience poverty as blacks in the U.S., however, the Infant Mortality Rate of Latinos is much closer to white women than it is to black women. The Poverty Rates of blacks and Latinos are 24.1% and 21.4% respectively. If there is a direct correlation, then the IMR of these two groups should be rather similar, however, blacks have an IMR double that of Latinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://federalsafetynet.com/us-poverty-statistics.html|title=U.S. Poverty Statistics|website=Federal Safety Net|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as black women move out of poverty or never experienced it in the first place, their IMR is not much lower than their counterparts experiencing higher levels of poverty.

Some believe black women are predisposed to a higher IMR, meaning ancestrally speaking, all black women from African descent should experience an elevated rate. This theory is quickly disproven by looking at women of African descent who have immigrated to the United States. These women who come from a completely different social context are not prone to the higher IMR experienced by American-born black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/03/03/42483/why-do-black-infants-die-so-much-more-often-than-w/|title=Why do black infants die so much more often than white infants? |date=2014-03-03|work=Southern California Public Radio|access-date=2017-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyan Parker Dominguez at the University of Southern California offers a theory to explain the disproportionally high IMR among black women in the United States. She claims African American women experience stress at much higher rates than any other group in the country. Stress produces particular hormones that induce labor and contribute to other pregnancy problems. Considering early births are one of the leading causes of death of infants under the age of one, induced labor is a very legitimate factor. The idea of stress spans socio-economic status as Parker Dominguez claims stress for lower-class women comes from unstable family life and chronic worry over poverty. For black middle-class women, battling racism, real or perceived, can be an extreme stressor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/03/03/42483/why-do-black-infants-die-so-much-more-often-than-w/|title=Why do black infants die so much more often than white infants? |date=2014-03-03|work=Southern California Public Radio|access-date=2017-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arline Geronimus, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health calls the phenomenon "weathering." She claims constantly dealing with disadvantages and racial prejudice causes black women's birth outcomes to deteriorate with age. Therefore, younger black women may experience stress with pregnancy due to social and economic factors, but older women experience stress at a compounding rate and therefore have  pregnancy complications aside from economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/2011/07/08/137652226/-the-race-gap | title=Why Black Women, Infants Lag In Birth Outcomes|last=Geronimus|first=Arline | name-list-format = vanc | work  = National Public Radio | access-date = 2017-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary O. Hearst, a professor in the Department of Public Health at Saint Catherine University, researched the effects of segregation on the African American community to see if it contributed to the high IMR amongst black children.&lt;ref name="pmid18974059"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hearst MO, Oakes JM, Johnson PJ | title = The effect of racial residential segregation on black infant mortality | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 168 | issue = 11 | pages = 1247–54 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18974059 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kwn291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst claims that residential segregation contributes to the high rates because of the political, economic, and negative health implications it poses on black mothers regardless of their socioeconomic status. Racism, economic disparities, and sexism in segregated communities are all examples of the daily stressors that pregnant black women face that can affect their pregnancies with conditions such as pre-eclampsia and hypertension.

Studies have also shown that high IMR is due to the inadequate care that pregnant African Americans receive compared to other women in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/magazine/black-mothers-babies-death-maternal-mortality.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur|title=Why America's Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis|last=Villarosa|first=Linda| name-list-format = vanc |date=April 11, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unequal treatment stems from the idea that there are racial medical differences and is also rooted in racial biases and controlled images of black women. Because of this unequal treatment, research{{Which|date=May 2018}} finds that black women do not receive the same urgency in medical care and are not taken as seriously regarding pain they feel or complications they think they are having, as exemplified by the complications tennis-star [[Serena Williams]] faced during her delivery.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/sports/tennis/serena-williams-baby-vogue.html |title=For Serena Williams, Childbirth Was a Harrowing Ordeal.

Strides have been made, however, to combat this epidemic. In Los Angeles County, health officials have partnered with non-profits around the city to help black women after the delivery of their child. One non-profit in particular has made a large impact on many lives is Great Beginnings For Black Babies in Inglewood. The non-profit centers around helping women deal with stress by forming support networks, keeping an open dialogue around race and family life, and also finding these women a secure place in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbbb-la.org/|title=Great Beginnings for Black Babies|website=Great Beginnings for Black Babies|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research argues that to end high IMR amongst black children, the country needs to fix the social and societal issues that plague African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Smith IZ, Bentley-Edwards KL, El-Amin S, Darity W | date = March 2018 | title = Fighting at Birth: Eradicating the Black-White Infant Mortality Gap | url = https://socialequity.duke.edu/sites/socialequity.duke.edu/files/site-images/EradicatingBlackInfantMortality-March2018%20FINAL.pdf | work = Duke University’s Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity and Insight Center for Community Economic Development }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that Issues such as institutional racism, mass incarceration, poverty, and health care disparities that are present amongst the African American country need to be addressed by the United States Government in order for policy to be created to combat these issues. Following this theory, if institutional inequalities are addresses and repaired by the United States Government, daily stressors for African Americans, and African American women in particular, will be reduced, therefore lessening the risk of complications in pregnancy and infant mortality. Others argue that adding diversity in the health care industry can help reduce the high IMR because more representation can tackle deep-rooted racial biases and stereotypes that exist towards African American women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Black Man in a White Coat: A Doctor's Reflections on Race and Medicine |last=Tweedy |first=Damon| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Picador |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-250-04463-1 |location=New York |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another more recent form of action to reduce high IMR amongst black children is the use of [[Doula|doulas]] throughout pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Not in source given|date=May 2018}} 

== History ==
It was in the early 1900's that countries around the world started to notice that there was a need for better child health care services. Europe started this rally, the United States fell behind them by creating a campaign to decrease the infant mortality rate. With this program, they were able to lower the IMR to 10 deaths rather than 100 deaths per every 1000 births.&lt;ref name="pmid9925845"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brosco JP | title = The early history of the infant mortality rate in America: "A reflection upon the past and a prophecy of the future" | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 103 | issue = 2 | pages = 478–85 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 9925845 | doi = | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/103/2/478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infant mortality was also seen as a social problem when it was being noticed as a national problem. American women who had middle class standing with an educational background started to create a movement that provided housing for families of a lower class. By starting this, they were able to establish public health care and government agencies that were able to make more sanitary and healthier environments for infants. Medical professionals helped further the cause for infant health by creating a pediatrics field that was experienced in medicine for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hargraves |first1=Martha |last2=Thomas |first2=Richard W. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Infant Mortality: Its History and Social Construction |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |date=November 1993 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=17–26 |doi=10.1016/S0749-3797(18)30661-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Decreases in infant mortality in given countries across the world during the 20th century have been linked to several common trends, scientific advancements, and social programs. Some of these include the state improving sanitation, improving access to healthcare, improving education, and the development of medical advancements such as penicillin, and safer blood transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | first = Halbert L. | last = Dunn | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsus/vsus_1950_1.pdf | title = Vital Statistics of the United States | date = 1954 | publisher = United States Printing Office | location = Washington, D.C. | volume = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, improving infant mortality in the early half of the 20th century meant tackling environmental factors. Improving sanitation, and especially access to safe drinking water, helped the United States dramatically decrease infant mortality, a growing concern in the United States since the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39269607|title=Save the babies : American public health reform and the prevention of infant mortality, 1850-1929 | last = Meckel | first = Richard A. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08556-9|location=Ann Arbor|oclc=39269607}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of these environmental factors, during this time the United States endeavored to increase education and awareness regarding infant mortality. Pasteurization of milk also helped the United States combat infant mortality in the early 1900s, a practice which allowed the United States to curb disease in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4838a2.htm|title=Achievements in Public Health, 1900 - 1999: Healthier Mothers and Babies |date=1999 | work = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) | volume = 48 | issue = 38 | pages = 849–858 | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention }}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors, on top of a general increase in the standard of living for those living in urban settings, helped the United States make dramatic improvements in their rates of infant mortality in the early 20th century.

Although the overall infant mortality rate was sharply dropping during this time, within the United States infant mortality varied greatly among racial and socio-economic groups. The change in infant mortality from 1915 to 1933 was, for the white population, 98.6 in 1,000 to 52.8 in 1,000, and for the black population, 181.2 in 1,000 to 94.4 in 1,000. Studies imply that this has a direct correlation with relative economic conditions between these populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Woodbury | first = Robert M. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Infant Mortality in the United States | journal = The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science | volume = 188 | date = November 1936 | pages = 94–106 | jstor = 1020363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, infant mortality in southern states was consistently 2% higher than other states in the US across a 20 year period from 1985. Southern states also tend to perform worse in predictors for higher infant mortality, such as per capita income and poverty rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menifield | first1 = Charles E. | first2 = Jacob | last2 = Dawson | name-list-format = vanc | title = Infant Mortality In Southern States: A Bureaucratic Nightmare | journal = Journal of Health and Human Services Administration | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | year = 2008 | pages = 385–402 | jstor = 41288095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 20th century, a focus on greater access to medical care for women spurred declines in infant mortality in the United States. The implementation of Medicaid, granting wider access to healthcare, contributed to a dramatic decrease in infant mortality, in addition to access to greater access to legal abortion and family-planning care, such the IUD and the birth control pill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last = Grossman | last1 = Jacobowitz | first1 = Steven | first2 = Michael | last2 = Grossman | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Variations in Infant Mortality Rates among Counties of the United States: The Roles of Public Policies and Programs | title = Determinants of Health: An Economic Perspective | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2017 | pages = 305–330 | url = https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/gros17812.16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades following the 1970's, the United State's decreasing infant mortality rates began to slow, falling behind China's, Cuba's, and other developed countries'. Funding for the federally subsidized Medicaid and Maternal and Infant Care was sharply reduced, and availability of prenatal care greatly decreased for low-income parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = C. Arden | name-list-format = vanc | title = Infant Mortality in the U.S. | journal = Scientific American | volume = 253 | issue = 1 | date = July 1985 | pages = 31–37 | jstor = 24967721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
The People's Republic of China's growth of medical resources in the latter half of the 20th century partly explains its dramatic improvement with regards to infant mortality during this time. Part of this increase included the adoption of the Rural Cooperative Medical System, which was founded in the 1950s. The Cooperative Medical System granted healthcare access to previously underserved rural populations, is estimated to have covered 90% of China's rural population throughout the 1960s. The Cooperative Medical System achieved an infant mortality rate of 25.09 per 1,000. The Cooperative Medical System was later defunded, leaving many rural populations to rely on an expensive fee-for-service system, although the rate continued to decline in general.&lt;ref name="pmid1287043"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu X, Cao H | title = China's Cooperative Medical System: its historical transformations and the trend of development | journal = Journal of Public Health Policy | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 501–11 | date = 1992 | pmid = 1287043 | doi = | jstor = 3342538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change in medical systems caused a socio-economic gap in accessibility to medical care in China, which fortunately was not reflected in its infant mortality rate of decline. Prenatal care was increasingly used, even as the Cooperative Medical System was replaced, and delivery assistance remained accessible.&lt;ref name="pmid21896686"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song S, Burgard SA | title = Dynamics of inequality: mother's education and infant mortality in China, 1970-2001 | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 349–64 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21896686 | doi = 10.1177/0022146511410886 | jstor = 23033284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's one-child policy, adopted in the 1980s, negatively impacted its infant mortality. Women carrying unapproved pregnancies faced state consequences and social stigma and were thus less likely to use prenatal care. Additionally, economic realities and long-held cultural factors incentivized male offspring, leading some families who already had sons to avoid prenatal care or professional delivery services, and causing China to have unusually high female infant mortality rates during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lai | first = Dejian | name-list-format = vanc | title = Sex Ratio at Birth and Infant Mortality Rate in China: An Empirical Study | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | date = 2005 | pages = 313–326 | jstor = 27522168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1994). [https://books.google.com/books?id=G038jRhEwRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false “Medicine’s Dilemmas”]. New Haven and New London, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Niles"&gt;Niles, N. (2015). [https://books.google.com/books?id=A0UoAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false History of the U.S. Healthcare System]. In Basics of the U.S. Health Care System (2nd ed., pp. 12-13). Burlington, Mass: Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the vertices represents identical priorities. Increasing or decreasing one results in changes to one or both of the other two. For example, a policy that increases access to health services would lower quality of health care and/or increase cost. The desired state of the triangle, high access and quality with low cost represents value in a health care system.&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;Carroll, A. (October 3, 2012).

== Criticisms of the Iron Triangle ==
Critics of the Iron Triangle state that the model is not actually as rigid as its name indicates, but is more dynamic because costs of care are constantly changing. [[Health care costs]] change faster than the other two dimensions of the triangle, affecting access to care, which in turn influences quality.&lt;ref name="Godfrey"&gt;Godfrey, T. (March 3, 2012). [http://pennsquarepost.com/what-is-the-iron-triangle-of-health-care/ What is the Iron Triangle of Health Care]? Retrieved January 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Other skeptics argue that the Iron Triangle is not a fixed framework, but an observation and reflection of the current state of health care.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, L. (October 26, 2012). [http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2012/10/iron-triangle-health-care-law-observation.html The iron triangle of health care is not law, but an observation]. Retrieved January 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In line with [[Clayton M. Christensen|Clayton Christensen’s]] theory on [[disruptive innovation]], critics of the Iron Triangle believe that health care, particularly in the United States, has not yet been disrupted like fields such as computer production. The belief is that with time and innovation, the current Iron Triangle will be disrupted, and just as the cost of computer production has fallen as quality and access to computers has increased, health care access and quality will rise, and cost will decrease. Critics argue that the Iron Triangle is not a one-size-fits-all model that can be applied to an entire population.&lt;ref name="DOJ"&gt;Department of Justice. (n.d.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2160">The '''labial thermistor clip''' is a device used measure the skin [[temperature]] of the [[labia minora]] and is associated blood [[engorgement]]. This device consists of a [[thermistor]] affixed to a small metal clip that can be attached to the labia minora. The labial thermistor clip is the second most commonly used physiological measure of female genital response, next to the [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]] (VPG).&lt;ref name="Chivers"&gt; Chivers, M.

[“Agreement of self-reported and genital measures of sexual arousal in men and women: A meta-analysis”], “Archives of Sexual Behavior, 6, 1678-1687”, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Both devices can be used simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Prause"&gt;Prause, N. &amp; Heiman, J.

The labial thermistor clip has some advantages over VPG, including better [[test-retest reliability]], greater correlation between genital and self-reported [[sexual arousal]], and an absolute unit of change (temperature).&lt;ref name="Chivers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Payne, K. &amp; Binik, Y. M. [“Reviving the labial thermistor clip”], “Archives of Sexual Behavior, 35, 111-113”, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Like VPG, the labial thermistor clip has [[discriminant validity]]; that is, it detects differences between sexual and nonsexual stimuli. It is also sensitive to different levels of sexual arousal.&lt;ref name="Prause" /&gt; The labial thermistor clip has some disadvantages because participants have difficulty with placing the device correctly and some report discomfort with using the device.&lt;ref name="Prause" /&gt;

Current English, however, both medical and non-medical, uses ''tumor'' as a synonym for a neoplasm (a solid or fluid-filled cystic [[lesion]] that may or may not be formed by an abnormal growth of neoplastic cells) that appears enlarged in size.Some neoplasms do not form a tumor; these include [[leukemia]] and most forms of [[carcinoma in situ]].

'''MEDCIN''', a system of standardized [[medical terminology]], is a proprietary medical vocabulary and was developed by Medicomp Systems, Inc. MEDCIN is a [[point-of-care]] terminology, intended for use in [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicom Systems|url=http://www.medicomp.com|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it includes over 280,000 clinical data elements encompassing symptoms, history, physical examination, tests, diagnoses and therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012AB MEDCIN Source Information|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/MEDCIN/|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This clinical vocabulary contains over 38 years of research and development as well as the capability to cross map to leading codification systems such as [[SNOMED CT]], [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]], [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems#ICD-9-CM|ICD-9-CM]]/[[ICD-10-CM]], [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]],  [[LOINC]], [[Current Dental Terminology|CDT]], CVX, and the [[Clinical Care Classification System|Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System]] for nursing and allied health.&lt;ref name="Whittenburg1"&gt;Whittenburg, L.

(2012) Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System Version 2.5, 2nd Edition: User's Guide,  New York,NY: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MEDCIN coding system is marketed for [[point-of-care documentation]].  Several [[Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) systems embed MEDCIN, which allows them to produce structured and numerically codified patient charts.  Such structuring enables the aggregation, analysis, and mining of clinical and practice management data related to a disease, a patient or a population.

==History==

MEDCIN was initially developed by Peter S. Goltra, founder of Medicomp Systems “as an intelligent clinical database for documentation at the time of care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=S.H.|author2=Rosenbloom, S.T. |author3=Bauer, B.A. |author4=Wahner-Roedler, D. |author5=Froehling, D.A. |author6=Bailey, K.R. |author7=Lincoln, M.J. |author8=Montella, D. |author9=Fielstein, E.M. |author10=Elkin, P.L. |title=Direct Comparison of MEDCIN® and SNOMED CT® for Representation of a General Medical Evaluation Template|journal=AMA Symposium Proceedings|year=2007|pages=75–79|pmc=2655894 |pmid=18693801}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first few years of the development were spent in designing the structure of a knowledge engine that would enable the population of relationships between clinical events.
Since 1978, the MEDCIN database engine has been continuously refined and expanded to include concepts from clinical histories, test, physical examination, therapies and diagnoses to enable coding of complete patient encounters with the collaboration of physicians and teaching institutions such as Cornell, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Medicomp Systems, Inc|url=http://www.medicomp.com/|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interface term"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=S.T|author2=Brown, S.H |author3=Froehling, D. |author4=Bauer, A.B. |author5=Wahner-Roedler, D.L. |author6=Gregg, W.M |author7=Elkin, P.L.  |title=Using SNOMED CT to represent two interface terminology|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association| date=February 2009 |volume=16|issue=1|pages=81–88. doi: 10.1197/jamia.M2694.|pmid=18952944|doi=10.1197/jamia.M2694 |pmc=2605600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

=== Multiple Hierarchical Structure ===

MEDCIN data elements are organized in multiple clinical hierarchies, where users can easily navigate to a medical term by following down the tree of clinical propositions. The clinical propositions define unique intellectual clinical content. An example of such similar propositions include "wheezing which is worse during cold weather" and "wheezing which is worse with a cold" differ in meaning significantly to clinicians and therefore it enables the software to present relevant items to clinical users.&lt;ref&gt;Zanstra, P.E, van der Haring, E.J, Cornet, R, (2003)[http://www.openclinical.org/docs/ext/terminologiesNL2003.pdf Introduction of a Clinical Terminology in the Netherlands: Needs, Constraints, Opportunities.]  Depts. Medical Informatics, UMC St Radboud Nijmegen, AMC Amsterdam. pg 61&lt;/ref&gt;

This hierarchy provides an inheritance of clinical properties between data elements, which greatly enhances the capabilities of EHR systems and as well providing logical presentation structures for the clinical users.&lt;ref name='Zanstra1'&gt;Zanstra, P.E, van der Haring, E.J, Cornet, R, (2003). [http://www.openclinical.org/docs/ext/terminologiesNL2003.pdf Introduction of a Clinical Terminology in the Netherlands: Needs, Constraints, Opportunities.]  Depts. Medical Informatics, UMC St Radboud Nijmegen, AMC Amsterdam. pg 62&lt;/ref&gt;  The linkage of MEDCIN data elements through the use of describing many diagnoses in the diagnostic index creates multiple hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Zanstra1"/&gt;  The MEDCIN engine uses Intelligent Prompting and navigation tools to enable clinicians to select specific clinical terms that they need rather than having to create new terms for rapid documentation.

Medical Informatics, UMC St Radboud Nijmegen, AMC Amsterdam. pg 60&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enhances EHRs usability ===

MEDCIN has been designed to work as an interface terminology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gasch|first=A.|author2=Gasch, B.|title=Successfully choosing your EMR 15 crucial decisions|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Oxford|isbn=9781444320336|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;   to include components to make EHRs more usable when it is used in conjunction with proprietary physician and nursing documentation tools.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, S.T, Miller, R.A., Johnson, K.B., Elkin, P.L., Brown, S.H. (2008). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17947616 A Model for Evaluating Interface Terminologies.]  Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association. 15:65–76. {{DOI|10.1197}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rosenbloom et al. (2006), investigators such as Chute et al., McDonald et al., Rose et al. and Campbell et al. have defined clinical interface terminologies as “a systematic collection of health care-related phrases (term)” (p.&amp;nbsp;277)  that supports the capturing of patient-related clinical information entered by clinicians into software programs such as clinical note capture and decision support tools.&lt;ref name='Rosenbloom'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=S.T. |author2=Miller,R.A. |author3=Johnson, K.B.|author4=Elkin, P.L. |author5=Brown, S.H.|title=Interface Terminologies: Facilitating Direct Entry of Clinical Data into Electronic Health Record Systems|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|year=2006|volume=13|issue=3|pages=277–288|pmc=1513664|doi=10.1197/jamia.m1957|pmid=16501181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an interface terminology to be clinical usable, it has to be able to describe any clinical presentation with speed, ease of use, and accuracy for clinicians to accomplish the intended tasks (e.g. documenting patient care) when using the medical terminology.&lt;ref name='Rosenbloom'/&gt; In addition, the terms in medical terminology must have medical relationships.&lt;ref  name="Zanstra2"/&gt;  MEDCIN’s presentation engine, accomplishes this usability criteria by using the Intelligent Prompting capabilities to present a relevant list of MEDCIN clinical terms for rapid clinical documentations. Another usability feature that the MEDCIN presentation engine provides is the medical relationships of clinical terms through multiple clinical hierarchies for each MEDCIN term.&lt;ref name="Zanstra2"/&gt;

=== Support for ICD-10-CM coding ===

In August 2012, Medicomp Systems released an updated version of the software embedded with [[ICD-10 Clinical Modification|ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification)]] mappings and functionality to comply with the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM as mandated by the US Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICD-10 Code Set to Replace ICD-9|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/hipaahealth-insurance-portability-accountability-act/transaction-code-set-standards/icd10-code-set.page?|publisher=American Medical Association|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="medicomp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Medicomp?|url=http://www.medicomp.com/why-medicomp/|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new  version is specially designed to make the [[ICD 10|ICD-10]] more usable in the EHR systems by providing clinicians easier access to bi-directional mappings, accurate data and codes through their EHR products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicomp Releases ICD-10-CM with New Version of the Powerful MEDCIN Engine® (2011)|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medicomp-releases-icd-10-cm-with-new-version-of-the-powerful-medcin-engine-128470243.html|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD-10 is published by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]]  to enable the systematic collection of morbidity and mortality data from different countries for statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coiera|first=Enrico|title=Guide to Health Informatics. 2nd edition|year=2003|publisher=Hodder Arnold|location=London, UK|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integration to most EHRs and Legacy systems ===

MEDCIN terminology engine can be easily integrated into existing EHRs and legacy systems to enable mapping of existing terminologies and other coding systems such as [[ICD]], [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], [[Current Procedural Terminology|CPT]], [[LOINC]], [[SNOMED CT]] and the [[Clinical Care Classification System|Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System]] to generate seamless codified data  at point of care.&lt;ref name="Zanstra1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="medicomp"/&gt;  MEDCIN’s interoperability features enable easy access and sharing of patient data between health care facilities.

==Interface with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems==

MEDCIN has been implemented into several commercial EHR systems as an interface terminology to support integrated care, clinical documentation, health maintenance monitoring and disease management, and the care planning functions of physicians, nurses and [[Allied health professions|allied health professionals]].&lt;ref name="interface term"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whittenburg2"&gt;Whittenburg, L. (2012) The CCC system in medicomp’s point of care knowledge engine (MEDCIN®) (pp.51-53). In Saba, V. (2012) Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System Version 2.5, 2nd Edition: User's Guide, New York,NY: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such commercial EHR systems include EHRs from EPIC, Allscripts, Pulse, Mckesson, and the United States Department of Defence’s (DoD) EHR system, the [[AHLTA|Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA)]].


=== AHLTA ===

This application uses the Medicomp’s MEDCIN terminology engine for clinical documentation purposes. &lt;span style="color: black"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/span&gt;, shows an example of the MEDCIN terminology where the physician can search for the correct terms for input into the patient note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoyt|first=R.E |author2=Sutton, M., |author3=Yoshihashi, S.A., (eds)|title=Medical informatics practical guide for the healthcare professional|url=http://remongameel.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/medicalinformatics_third_edition_bookmarked_e_book_lulu.pdf|year=2009|publisher=Lulu.com|location=Pensacola, Florida|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MEDCIN Nursing Plan of Care ==

[[File:MEDCIN nursing plan of care.png|thumb|Figure 2: MEDCIN plan of care with nursing diagnoses]]
The Nursing Plan of Care (POC)  was developed by Medicomp Systems, for the [[Clinical Care Classification System|Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System]].&lt;ref name="Whittenburg2"/&gt;  The CCC System is a standardized, coded nursing terminology that provides a unique [[Clinical Care Classification System#The CCC System Framework|framework]] and coding structure for accessing, classifying and documenting patient care by nurses and other [[Allied health professions|allied health professionals]].&lt;ref&gt;Saba, V. K. (2005). Clinical Care Classification (CCC) of Nursing Interventions. Retrieved 25 May 2013, from http://www.sabacare.com/About/.&lt;/ref&gt; The CCC is directly linked in the MEDCIN nursing POC to medical terminology with the purpose of creating patient plan of care by extracting a pool of documentation from the EHR history.&lt;ref name="Whittenburg2"/&gt; The CCC nursing terminology is integrated into the MEDCIN clinical database through a contextual hierarchical tree, providing an array of terminology standards and concepts with Intelligent Prompting capabilities of the MEDCIN engine.&lt;ref&gt;Whittenburg, L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33332">In many parts of the western world, '''mandated reporters''' are people who have regular contact with vulnerable people and are therefore legally required to ensure a report is made when abuse is observed or suspected. Specific details vary across jurisdictions—the abuse that must be reported may include [[neglect]], or [[financial abuse|financial]], [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or other types of [[abuse]]. Mandated reporters may include paid or unpaid people who have assumed full or intermittent responsibility for the care of a child, [[dependent adult]], or [[Senior citizen|elder]].

== History ==
In 1962, United States doctors [[C. Henry Kempe]] and [[Brandt Steele]] published "The Battered Child Syndrome",&lt;ref&gt;C. Henry Kempe and Ray E. Helfer, editors: ''The Battered Child''. 1st edition, 1968. 2nd edition, Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1974. 3rd edition, 1980. 5th edition by M. E. Helfer, R. Kempe, and R. Krugman, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Kempe, Frederic N. Silverman, Brandt F. Steele, William Droegemuller, Henry K. Silver: "The Battered Child Syndrome." ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', 1962, 181: 17-24. Tardieu's syndrome. Also called Caffey-Kempe syndrome.&lt;/ref&gt; which helped doctors identify child abuse, its effects, and the need to report serious physical abuse to legal authorities. Its publication changed the prevalent views in the United States, where child abuse was previously seen as uncommon, and not a regular issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-wolff/battered-child-syndrome_b_2406348.html|title = The Battered-Child Syndrome: 50 Years Later|date = 4 January 2013|accessdate = |website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = Wolff|first = Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the [[US Congress|United States Congress]] passed the [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA), which provides funds to states for development of [[Child Protective Services]] (CPS) and [[hotline]]s to prevent serious injuries to children. These laws and the media and advocacy coverage and research brought about a gradual change in societal expectations on reporting in the United States and, at different rates, in other western nations.&lt;ref name="Krason_Lit_Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255631799_THE_CRITICS_OF_CURRENT_CHILD_ABUSE_LAWS_AND_THE_CHILD_PROTECTIVE_SYSTEM_A_SURVEY_OF_THE_LEADING_LITERATURE|title = The Critics Of Current Child Abuse Laws And The Child Protective System: A Survey Of The Leading Literature|author = Krason, Stephen M.|publisher = The Catholic Social Science Review|year = 2007|page = 307,308,307–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/hjlpp8&amp;div=46&amp;id=&amp;page= | title = "Doing Something" About Child Abuse: The Need to Narrow the Grounds For State Intervention | author = Douglas J.

Originally created to respond to physical abuse, reporting systems in various countries began to expand to address sexual and emotional abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic abuse. This expansion was accompanied by broader requirements for reporting abuse: previously reports were only submitted when an incident caused serious physical injury, but as the definitions changed, more minor physical injuries and developmental and psychological trauma began to be included as well.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.385.2444&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title = Australian Institute of Family Studies Submission to the Special Commission of Inquiry into Child Protection Services in NSW|publisher = National Child Protection Clearinghouse|last = Bromfield|first = Leah|last2 = Holzer|first2 = Prue|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a huge increase of reporting over the decades with enormous numbers of unsubstantiated cases.&lt;ref name="MondaleAct"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.faithandreason.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mondale-Act-After-Forty-Years_-True.pdf |title= The Mondale Act and Its Aftermath: An Overview of Forty Years of American Law, Public Policy, and Governmental Response to Child Abuse and Neglect | author = Krason, Stephen M. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2013 |pages =1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referrals increase each year, but the actual substantiated cases remain low and are approximately the same or decline each year.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011" /&gt;
Media and commentators often take the number of referrals to be synonymous with the number of cases of actual child maltreatment, which makes the problem appear larger than it actually is.&lt;ref name="Child Sweden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/joan_durrant.html |title=Child Abuse in Sweden |author= Joan E. Durrant  |publisher= The Natural Child Project  |year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vulnerable groups==
Various jurisdictions have mandatory reporting requirements for different types of vulnerable people, such as:
* Children {{see also|Mandatory reporting in the United States}}
* Vulnerable adults {{see also|Disability abuse}}
* Senior citizens/elderly {{see also|Elder abuse}}

== Statistics by country ==

=== Australia ===
Overall, the total number of substantiations in Australia has nearly doubled since 2001 (1.77 times higher) but have shown a slight downward trend since 2005-06. Specific comparisons cannot be made before this time, as different jurisdictions have made substantial changes throughout this period in reporting requirements and definitions of terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aifs.gov.au/cfca/pubs/factsheets/a142086/#a2 | title = Child abuse and neglect statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia there was an increase in notifications from 2000-01 to 2008-09, followed by a decrease to 2011-12, reflecting, in part, different mandated thresholds.&lt;ref name="Australian Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aifs.gov.au/cfca/pubs/factsheets/a142086/ |title=Child Protection Australia: 2011-2012 Abuse and Neglect Statistics |author=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Brazil has a mandatory reporting system for child maltreatment that is enforced by the health and educational systems, but due to the absence of national prevalence surveys, the difference between data generated by such mandatory reports and actual incidence of abuse is not known, although it is believed that mandatory report systems may result in underreporting. While specific data on mandatory reporting is unavailable, data collected from 314 municipalities (out of 5564) across the country revealed that in the second half of 2005 alone, 27,986 children received attention from the Social Welfare Centers: either because of sexual abuse (13,240), psychological violence (4,340), neglect (4,073), physical violence (3,436) and sexual exploitation (2,887). Most victims were in the 7–14 years group (17,738). 4,936 were under 6 years old.&lt;ref name="brazilwho"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cardia|first1=Nancy|last2=Lagatta|first2=Pedro|last3=Affonso|first3=Claudinei|title=Assessment of Child Maltreatment  Prevention Readiness Country Report Brazil|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/child/brazil_rap_cm.pdf|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Canada provides data on substantiations but not reports.&lt;ref name="CIS-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cwrp.ca/cis-2008 |title= Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect- 2008 |author= Public Health Agency of Canada | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada in 2008,&lt;ref name="CIS-2008" /&gt; 36% of all investigations were substantiated, with a further 8% of investigations where maltreatment remained suspected by the worker at the conclusion of the investigation and a further 5% with a risk of future maltreatment. 30% of investigations were unfounded and 17% resulted in no risk of future maltreatment was indicated.

=== United Kingdom ===
England provides data on substantiations but not reports.&lt;ref name="England data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/inform |title=Children subject to child protection plans&amp;nbsp;– England 2008-2012 |author= NSPCC  |publisher= NSPCC Inform  |year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2012, the UK reports 50,573 children were on child protection registers or subject to a child protection plan: England (42,850), Scotland (2,706), Wales (2,890), Northern Ireland (2,127).&lt;ref name="UK data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/inform |title=Child protection registers statistics/UK 2008-2012 |author= NSPCC  |publisher= NSPCC Inform  |year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

{{Main |Mandatory Reporting in the United States}}
In the US there was a 2348% increase in hotline calls from 150,000 in 1963 to 3.3 million in 2009.&lt;ref name="MondaleAct"/&gt; In 2011, there were 3.4 million calls.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011" /&gt;
From 1992 to 2009 in the US, substantiated cases of sexual abuse declined 62%, physical abuse decreased 56% and neglect 10%. Although the referrals increase each year, about 1% of the child population is affected by any form of substantiated maltreatment.&lt;ref name="finkelhor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV203_Updated%20trends%202010%20FINAL_12-19-11.pdf |title=Updated Trends in Child Maltreatment, 2010 |last=Finkelhor  |first=David |author2=Lisa Jones |author3=Anne Shuttuch   |publisher=University of New Hampshire, Crimes Against Children Research Center |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, there are approximately 3.6 million calls each year: 9,000/day, 63,000/week,&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/research-data-technology/statistics-research/child-maltreatment |title= Annual NCANDS Reports 1996-2011 |author= Children’s Bureau, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; affecting on average 1 out of 10 U.S. families with children under the age of 18 each year (there are 32.2 million such families).&lt;ref name="2010 US Family Census"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1129.pdf | title = Projections of the Number of Households and Families in the United States: 1995 to 2010, P25-1129 | author = U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census, Table H}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2011 there were a total of 43 million hotline calls.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011" /&gt; Of those substantiated, over half are minor situations and many are situations where the worker thinks something may happen in the future. The largest category was neglect,&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011" /&gt;

Each year in the US, approximately 85% of hotline calls either do not warrant investigation or are not substantiated. Approximately 78% of all investigations are unsubstantiated and approximately 22% are substantiated, with around 9% where "alternative responses" are offered in some states, which have a focus on working with the family to address issues rather than confirming maltreatment.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://archive.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cm09/cm09.pdf |title= National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) 2009 Child Maltreatment Report |author= U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Youth and Families, Children’s Bureau | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mandatory reporting of child abuse by jurisdiction ==
The criteria for reporting vary significantly based on jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/3/3/460/pdf|title = Mandatory Reporting Laws and Identification of Child Abuse and Neglect: Consideration of Differential Maltreatment Types, and a Cross-Jurisdictional Analysis of Child Sexual Abuse Reports|last = Mathews|first = Ben|date = 2014|journal = Social Sciences|doi = 10.3390/socsci3030460|pmid = |access-date = |issue = 3|issn = 2076-0760}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, mandatory reporting applies to people who have reason to suspect the abuse or neglect of a child, but it can also apply to people who suspect abuse or neglect of a dependent adult or the elderly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ladcss.org/APS/APSMandatedtext.htm  | title = APS (adult protective services) Mandated Reporters| author = Los Angeles County, California Department of Community and Senior Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to any members of society.

In '''Brazil''', notification is mandatory in the health system, in schools and by the Child Protection Councils (CPC) network, present in many municipalities.&lt;ref name="brazilwho"/&gt;

In '''Malaysia''', The [[Child Act 2001]] requires any medical officer or medical practitioner, childcare provider or member of the family to notify his/her concerns, suspicions or beliefs that a child may have been abused or neglected to the appropriate child protection authority in the country. Failure to do so can result in criminal charges.&lt;ref name=malaysia_unicef&gt;{{cite web|title=Report Abuse|url=http://www.unicef.org/malaysia/campaigns_getonboard-report-child-abuse.html|website=UNICEF|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''South Africa''', Section 110 of the [[Children's Act, 2005]] mandates 'Any correctional official, dentist, homeopath, immigration official, labour inspector, legal practitioner, medical practitioner, midwife, minister of religion, nurse, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, psychologist, religious leader, social service professional, social worker, speech therapist, teacher, traditional health practitioner, traditional leader or member of staff or volunteer worker at a partial care facility, drop-in centre or child and youth care centre' to report when they suspect that a child has been abused 'in a manner causing physical injury, sexually abused or deliberately neglected'. The [[Sexual Offences Act, 1957]], compels all citizens who are aware of the sexual exploitation of children to report the offence to the police.&lt;ref name=SAMJ&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hendricks|first1=ML|title=Mandatory reporting of child abuse in South Africa: Legislation explored|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=August 2014|volume=104|issue=8|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
In the '''United States,''' states frequently amend their laws, but as of November 2013 all states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have statutes identifying persons who are required to report suspected child maltreatment to an appropriate agency.&lt;ref name="us"/&gt;

Approximately 48 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands designate professions the members of which are mandated by law to report child maltreatment.&lt;ref name="us"/&gt;

As of November 2013, in 18 states and Puerto Rico, any person who suspects child abuse or neglect is required to report suspected abuse or neglect regardless of profession.
In all other States, territories, and the District of Columbia, any non-mandated person is also allowed to report.&lt;ref name="us"&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information (NAIC)|title=Mandatory Reporters of Child Abuse and Neglect|date=2003 | url =https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/manda.pdf | publisher = Child Welfare Information Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canada''' imposes a mandatory requirement on all citizens, except in the Yukon Territory where it is restricted to those who come in contact with children in their professional roles.&lt;ref name=crossjuris/&gt;

'''Mexico''' also has legislative reporting duties.&lt;ref name=crossjuris&gt;{{cite web|title=Mandatory reporting legislation in the USA, Canada and Australia: a cross-jurisdictional review of key features, differences and issues.|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/11850/1/11850_1.pdf|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2013|author=Mathews, Benjamin|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union===
In 15 member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) reporting obligations are in place for all professionals. In 10 member states (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Greece, Finland, Italy, Latvia, Portugal and Slovakia) existing obligations only address certain professional groups such as social workers or teachers.&lt;ref name = "eu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Provisions on professionals' legal obligation to report cases of child abuse, neglect and violence|url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/data-and-maps/comparative-data/child-protection/reporting-1|website=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than half (15) of the EU member states (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden) have specific reporting obligations addressing civilians, with specific obligations for civilians to report cases of child abuse, neglect and/or exploitation. In many member states without specific provisions, general provisions on the obligation for all citizens to report a criminal act under national law apply, but with no specific obligation to report a child at risk of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Specific legal obligations for civilians to report cases of child abuse, neglect and violence|url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/data-and-maps/comparative-data/child-protection/reporting2|website=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, Malta and the Netherlands, no reporting obligations were in place in March 2014. In Malta, however, the new draft Child Protection Act (Out of Home Care),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Protection Act (Out of Home Care), 2014.|url=http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=25981&amp;l=1|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduces the obligation of mandatory reporting for all professionals and volunteers.&lt;ref name = "eu"/&gt;

Under '''UK''' law only local authority social workers, health and social service board social workers (Northern Ireland) and police have a duty to report suspicions that a child is in need of care and protection. Local child protection guidelines and professional codes of conduct may expect other professionals, such as teachers and medical staff, to report, but they do not have to do so as a matter of law.&lt;ref name="Madge 1996"/&gt; Front line professionals are also required to report cases of [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/crime-and-policing-news-update-february-2015/crime-and-policing-news-update-february-2015|title=Crime and policing news update: February 2015 - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==
The criteria for reporting vary greatly among jurisdictions. In some, for example, only physical or sexual abuse to be reported must be reported, while elsewhere any signs of sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse or neglect are included.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission" /&gt;&lt;ref name=us /&gt;&lt;ref name=crossjuris /&gt;

Mandated reporters are usually required to give their name when they make a report. This allows investigators to contact them for further details if needed, and protects the mandated reporter from accusations that they did not report as required by law.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission" /&gt;&lt;ref name=us /&gt;&lt;ref name=crossjuris /&gt;

Typically, reporters are encouraged to report their suspicions and not to investigate or wait for absolute proof, which can lead to further harm directed at the suspected victim, and allow for perpetrators to prepare their defence through intimidation. The investigation of the abuse is then left to professionals. Some jurisdictions allow clear protections for reports made in good faith, protecting the disclosure of the reporter's name.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission" /&gt;&lt;ref name=us /&gt;&lt;ref name=crossjuris /&gt;

Innocence should be presumed unless and until evidence establishing guilt is obtained and it must be remembered that only suspicions are being reported.&lt;ref name="welfareacademy.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.welfareacademy.org/pubs/childwelfare/respondingto_94.pdf |title= Responding to Child Sexual Abuse: The Need for a Balanced Approach |author=Besharov, Douglas J, |journal=The Future of Children| volume = 4|number = 2| pages = 136, 135–155| date = Summer 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professions and reporting ==
Mandated reporting requirements generally apply to professions that have frequent contact with children, although in some jurisdictions all citizens are required to report suspicions of some forms of abuse. Other jurisdictions have mandated requirements only of doctors or medical professionals.
Mandated professions may include, but are not limited to the following:&lt;ref name="us" /&gt;
* Child care providers
* [[Caregivers]]
* [[Clergy]], although clergy-penitent privileged communication is exempt in some areas
* Counselors and other [[mental health]] professionals
* Medical examiners and coroners
* Health care providers
* [[Police]] and other law enforcement officers
* School [[teacher]]s, [[Coach (sport)|coach]]es, guidance counselors, principals and other school personnel
* [[Social worker]]s
* Abortion clinic staff (in some states)

Jurisdictions may note that, while these groups are ''legally required'' (mandated) to report, most jurisdictions allow for ''voluntary'' reports by any concerned people.

=== Clergy-penitent privilege and other exemptions ===
Conflicts between a mandated reporter's duties and some [[privileged communication]] statutes are common but, in general, [[attorney-client privilege]]s and clergy-penitent privileges are exempt from mandatory reporting in many jurisdictions. In some states in the US, psychiatrist and psychologists are also exempt from mandatory reporting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

"[[Clergy-penitent privilege]]" is privileged communication that protects communication between a member of the clergy and a communicant, who shares information in confidence. When applied, neither the minister nor the "penitent" can be forced to testify in court, by deposition, or other legal proceedings, about the contents of the communication.&lt;ref name= "abanow.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.abanow.org/2006/12/answers-to-questions-about-the-attorney-client-privilege   |title= Answers to Questions about the Attorney-Client Privilege| author=American Bar Association |journal=ABA Now| editor = American Bar Association| date = December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most US states provide the privilege, typically in rules of evidence or civil procedure, and the confidentiality privilege has also been extended to non-catholic clergy and non-Sacramental counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/clergymandated.pdf | title = Clergy as Mandatory Reporters of Child Abuse and Neglect| author=Child Welfare Information Gateway | editor = Children’s Bureau | year = 2012 | pages = 1–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Originally created to respond to physical abuse, reporting systems in various countries have expanded the reportable incidents, when it was recognised that sexual and emotional abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic abuse also have profound impacts on children's wellbeing.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission" /&gt; Critics of investigations into reports of child abuse state that
* A child may be wrongfully removed. 
* Long, repeated interrogations and physical examinations can leave emotional scars. 
* Even if not removed, there may be ongoing fear, distrust and insecurity. 
* Long-term foster care can leave lasting psychological scars and do irreparable damage to the parent/child bond. 
* An accusation of wrongdoing may disrupt a family even if allegations are dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1991|title=The Dynamic of Shame in Interactions Between Child Protective Services and Families Falsely Accused of Child Abuse|url=http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume3/j3_2_5.htm|journal=IPT|volume=3|author1=Sabrina Luza|author2=Enrique Ortiz|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often threats and an assumption of guilt over innocence lead to feelings of powerlessness, inadequacy, depression, denial of due process and liberties, reputations tarnished and privacy invaded, and legal consequences if assumed guilty.&lt;ref name="paul chill"&gt;{{Cite web|ssrn=1886506|title=Burden Of Proof Begone: The Pernicious Effect Of Emergency Removal In Child Protective Proceedings|last=Chill|first=Paul|date=October 2003|website=[[Social Science Research Network]]|pages=1–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There may be economic harm due to the need to obtain legal representation to defend one’s self and comply with the requirements demanded of them. 
Critics state that mandatory reporting may also
* overload the child welfare system and increase the tax burden.&lt;ref name="oregonlive"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2012/06/jerry_sandusky_sex_abuse_case.html | title = Jerry Sandusky sex abuse case has states re-examining mandatory reporter laws | author = The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* jeopardize the ability of people, including abused people, to seek medical treatment or maintain a therapeutic relationship, for fear of being reported. 
* disproportionately affect [[African American|African-American]] families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mandated Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect: A Practical Guide for Social Workers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FHiBniv8-GEC|publisher = Springer Publishing Company| date = 2008-12-02|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9780826117823|first = Dr Kenneth Lau|last = LCSW|first2 = Ms Kathryn Krase JD|last2 = LCSW|first3 = Mr Richard H. Morse|last3 = LMSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* discourage fellow citizens from taking positive neighborhood action with families in trouble, as they may consider that their responsibilities have been met when they call in an anonymous hotline.&lt;ref name="orr" /&gt;
They also state that mandatory reporting laws have had unintended consequences for the accused. Individuals, including juveniles, who have never been convicted of anything may be placed on CPS Central Registries/databases (different from [[Sex offender registry|Sex Abuse Registries]]) for decades, limiting educational and employment opportunities due to background checks.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} There is a 1.2–12.3% recidivism rate (repeat substantiations within 6 months of initial substantiations).&lt;ref name="Report Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cwo07-10/cwo07-10.pdf|title=Child Welfare Outcomes 2007-2010, Report to Congress|year=2010|author=US Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Children’s Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feel that unsubstantiated rates are enormous and go beyond anything reasonably needed,&lt;ref name="welfareacademy.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Besharov"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=51&amp;articleid=271 |title=Protecting Children from Abuse and Neglect |journal = The Future of Children |publisher = Princeton Brookings | volume = 8 | number = 1 |author=Douglas Besharov | date=Spring 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that emotions about child abuse and sensational media coverage has led to an overreaction by some professionals and citizens, who report many cases that do not amount to child abuse.&lt;ref name="welfareacademy.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="welfareacademy.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Besharov" /&gt; Media and commentators often take the number of referrals to be synonymous with the number of cases of actual child maltreatment, which makes the problem appear larger than it actually is.&lt;ref name="Child Sweden" /&gt; Conversely, Dr. Jill McLeigh from Colorado University has stated that, in the United States, there is "gross underreporting" of child abuse and neglect, but she does not believe mandatory reporting laws are the appropriate way to address it.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Ben Mathews of Queensland University of Technology said he had studied 10 years of data from Australia and other countries, and concluded that there were more benefits than not where reporting was compulsory.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Niven|first1=David|last2=File|first2=Kieran|title=Should reporting child abuse be compulsory?

'''Medical foods''' are foods that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. In the United States they were defined in the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments&lt;ref name="CFR21.109"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/CFR101-9.HTML|title=CFR 21 Part 101 Subpart A|author=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are subject to the general food and safety labeling requirements of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. In Europe the [[European Food Safety Authority]] established definitions for "foods for special medical purposes" (FSMPs) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outcome of a public consultation on the Draft Scientific and Technical Guidance of the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) on foods for special medical purposes in the context of Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 609/2013|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/sp.efsa.2015.EN-904/pdf|accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Medical foods, called "food for special medical purposes" in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food for special medical purposes|url=https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/labelling_nutrition/special_groups_food/medical_en|publisher=European Commission|language=en|date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use, from traditional foods that bear a [[health claim]], and from dietary supplements. In order to be considered a medical food the product must, at a minimum:&lt;ref name="FDA2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food And Drug Administration Compliance Program Guidance Manual: Chapter 21 – Food Composition, Standards, Labeling And Economics|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/complianceenforcement/ucm073339.pdf|website=[[U.S. FDA]]|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA_1116"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Statutes &amp; Regulations on Dietary Treatment of Disorders Identified Through Newborn Screening November 2016|url=http://www.nccrcg.org/docs/NCC/ACA/Products/Dietary_Treament_Supplements_2016.pdf|website=[[U.S. FDA]]|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* be a food for oral ingestion or tube feeding ([[nasogastric tube]])
* be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements, and
* be intended to be used under medical supervision.

Medical foods can be classified into the following categories:
*Nutritionally complete formulas
*Nutritionally incomplete formulas
*Formulas for metabolic disorders
*Oral rehydration products

==Regulation==
Medical foods are regulated by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act regulations.  21 CFR 101.9(j) (8).&lt;ref name="CFR21.109"/&gt;

The term medical food, as defined in section 5(b) of the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983|Orphan Drug Act]] (21 U.S.C. 360ee (b) (3)) is "a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/default.htm|title=Medical Foods Guidance Documents &amp; Regulatory Information|first=Office of Regulatory|last=Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical foods are not required to undergo premarket review or approval by FDA. Additionally, they are exempted from the labeling requirements for health claims and nutrient content claims under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. In 2016 the FDA published an update: Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition. Definitions and labeling requirements are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/MedicalFoods/ucm054048.htm|title=Medical Foods - Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Foods; Second Edition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liping Kou observes microgreens.jpg|thumb|Technicians harvesting different types of microgreens for shelf-life studies and nutrient analyses.]]
'''Microgreens''' are a [[Leaf vegetable|vegetable green]], harvested after [[sprouting]] as [[shoot]]s, that are used both as a visual and flavor component or ingredient primarily in fine dining restaurants. Fine dining chefs use microgreens to enhance the attractiveness and taste of their dishes with their delicate textures and distinctive flavors. Smaller than “baby greens,” and harvested later than [[Sprouting|sprouts]], microgreens can provide a variety of leaf flavors, such as sweet and spicy. They are also known for their various colors and textures. Among upscale markets, they are now considered a specialty genre of greens that are good for garnishing salads, soups, plates, and sandwiches.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Millard | first=E. | title=Indoor Kitchen Gardening: Turn Your Home Into a Year-round Vegetable Garden | publisher=Cool Springs Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-61058-981-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEf4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 | access-date=May 28, 2017 | page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edible young greens and grains are produced from various kinds of vegetables, herbs or other plants. They range in size from {{convert|1|to|3|in|cm}}, including the stem and leaves. A microgreen has a single central stem which has been cut just above the soil line during harvesting. It has fully developed [[cotyledon]] leaves and usually has one pair of very small, partially developed true leaves. The average crop-time for most microgreens is 10–14 days from seeding to harvest.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vanderlinden|first=Colleen|title=Grow Your Own Microgreens|url=http://organicgardening.about.com/od/vegetablesherbs/a/growmicrogreens.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Microgreens began showing up on chefs' menus as early as the 1980s, in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;
In Southern California, microgreens have been grown since about the mid{{nbhyph}}1990s. There were initially very few varieties offered. Those available were such as [[arugula]], [[basil]], [[beets]], [[kale]], [[cilantro]] and a mixture called Rainbow Mix. Having spread eastward from California, they are now being grown in most areas of the country with an increasing number of varieties being produced.&lt;ref name=micro /&gt; Today, the U.S. microgreens industry consists of a variety of seed companies and growers.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;

==Form==
Microgreens have three basic parts: a central stem, cotyledon leaf or leaves, and typically the first pair of very young true leaves. They vary in size depending upon the specific variety grown, with the typical size being {{convert|1|to|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} in total length.  When the green grows beyond this size, it should no longer be considered a microgreen. Larger sizes have been called petite greens.&lt;ref name=micro&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freshorigins.com/microgreens.html | title=MicroGreen Facts | publisher=Fresh Origins | accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microgreens are typically 2–4 weeks old from germination to harvest.&lt;ref name=waterfields&gt;{{cite web | url=http://waterfieldsllc.com/what-are-microgreens/ | title=What are Microgreens? | publisher=Waterfields | accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both baby greens and microgreens lack any legal definition. The terms "baby greens" and "microgreens" are marketing terms used to describe their respective categories. Sprouts are germinated seeds and are typically consumed as an entire plant (root, seed, and shoot), depending on the species. For example, sprouts from almond, pumpkin, and peanut reportedly have a preferred flavor when harvested prior to root development. Sprouts are legally defined, and have additional regulations concerning their production and marketing due to their relatively high risk of microbial contamination compared to other greens. Growers interested in producing sprouts for sale need to be aware of the risks and precautions summarized in the FDA publication Guidance for Industry: Reducing Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Sprouted Seeds (FDA 1999).&lt;ref name=ufl&gt;{{cite web|last=Treadwell|first=Danielle D.|title=Microgreens: A New Specialty Crop|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/hs1164|publisher=Univ. of Florida IFAS Extension|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growing==
Growing microgreens is relatively easy; many small "backyard" growers have sprung up selling their greens at farmers' markets or to restaurants. A shallow [[plastic container]] with drainage holes, such as a nursery flat or prepackaged-salad box, will facilitate sprouting and grow out on a small scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galloway|first=Will|title=Growing Microgreens Indoors|url=http://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/garden/growing-microgreens-indoors|publisher=Organic Gardening|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing and marketing high-quality microgreens commercially is much more difficult.&lt;ref name=ufl /&gt;

==Nutritional analysis==
[[File:Red Cabbage Microgreens.jpg|thumb|ARS scientists analyzed key nutrients in 25 different varieties of microgreens and found that red cabbage microgreens (shown here) had the highest concentrations of vitamin C. These nutritious microgreens are ready to harvest just 10 days after planting.]]
Researchers at the USDA Agricultural Research Service have published, as of early 2014, several studies that identify the nutritional make-up and the shelf life of microgreens. Twenty-five varieties were tested, key nutrients measured were [[ascorbic]] acid (vitamin C), [[tocopherol]]s (vitamin E), [[phylloquinone]] (vitamin K), and [[beta-carotene]] (a vitamin A precursor), plus other related [[carotenoids]] in the cotyledons.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the 25 microgreens tested, red cabbage, cilantro, garnet amaranth, and green daikon radish had the highest concentrations of vitamin C, carotenoids, vitamin K, and vitamin E, respectively. In general, microgreens contained considerably higher levels of vitamins and carotenoids—about five times greater—than their mature plant counterparts, an indication that microgreens may be worth the trouble of delivering them fresh during their short lives.&lt;ref name="ARS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contents Specialty Greens Pack a Nutritional Punch|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan14/greens0114.htm|publisher=USDA|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A nutritional study of microgreens was done in the summer of 2012 by the Department of Nutrition and Food Science, University of Maryland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Xiao | first1 = Z. | last2 = Lester | first2 = G. E. | last3 = Luo | first3 = Y. | last4 = Wang | first4 = Q. | title = Assessment of Vitamin and Carotenoid Concentrations of Emerging Food Products: Edible Microgreens | doi = 10.1021/jf300459b | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 60 | issue = 31 | pages = 7644–7651 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22812633| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating promising potential that microgreens may indeed have particularly high nutritional value compared to mature vegetables. Bhimu Patil, a professor of horticulture and director of the Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center at Texas A&amp;M University, agrees that microgreens may potentially have higher levels of nutrients than mature vegetables. But he says more studies are needed to compare the two side by side. "This is a very good start, but there can be a lot of variation in nutrients depending on where you grow it, when you harvest, and the soil medium," Patil says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barclay|first=Eliza|title=Introducing Microgreens: Younger, And Maybe More Nutritious, Vegetables|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/08/29/160274163/introducing-microgreens-younger-and-maybe-more-nutritious-vegetables|publisher=NPR|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing a microgreen, researchers say to look for the most intensely colored ones, which will be the most nutritious.&lt;ref name="Reviewed by Louise Chang, MD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Jennifer|title=Tiny Microgreens Packed With Nutrients|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20120831/tiny-microgreens-packed-nutrients?page=2|publisher=Web MD|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Results of the microgreens research project conducted by the University of Maryland and the USDA has garnered attention from several national media outlets including National Public Radio (NPR) and The Huffington Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gavin|first=Sara|title=Mighty Microgreens|url=http://agnr.umd.edu/news/mighty-microgreens|publisher=AGNR|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microgreens sprout comparison==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
Sprouts are germinated or partially germinated seeds. A sprout consists of the seed, root, stem, while microgreens are harvested without the roots.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Microgreens have stronger flavors compared to sprouts, and come in a wide selection of leaf shapes, textures and colors.

Microgreens are grown in soil or soil-like materials such as peat moss.  Microgreens require high light levels, preferably natural sunlight with low humidity and good air circulation.  Microgreens are planted with very low seed density compared to sprout processing. Crop times are generally one to two weeks for most varieties, though some can take four to six weeks. Microgreens are ready to harvest when the leaves are fully expanded. Harvesting is usually with scissors cutting just above the soil surface, excluding any roots. Some growers sell them while still growing, rooted in the growing trays so that they can be cut later. Once removed from their growing environment, these trays of microgreens must be used quickly or they will rapidly begin to elongate and lose color and flavor.

Sprout seeds are soaked in water for usually eight hours and then drained.  A high density of seed is placed inside of sprouting equipment or enclosed containers. The seed germinates rapidly due to the high moisture and humidity levels maintained in the enclosures. Seeds can also be sprouted in cloth bags that are repeatedly soaked in water. The sprouting process occurs in dark or very low light conditions. These dark, wet, crowded conditions are ideal for the rapid proliferation of dangerous pathogenic bacteria.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} After a few days of soaking and repeated rinsing in water (several times a day to minimize spoilage), the processing is complete and the sprouts are ready to consume.

The conditions that are ideal for properly grown microgreens do not encourage the growth of dangerous pathogens. These growing methods would not work for the production of sprouts.

However, the potential for food safety issues with microgreens may be increasing due to the number of indoor microgreen growing operations in which excessive seed density, low light intensity, low air circulation or most commonly, a lack of GAP ([[good agricultural practices]]) and GMP ([[good manufacturing practices]]) based food safety procedures. Certain provisions of the Guidance for Industry: Reducing Microbial Food Safety Hazards For Sprouted Seeds &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ProducePlantProducts/ucm120244.htm&lt;/ref&gt; may be beneficial and prudent for growers of microgreens to follow.

==Storage and commercial transport==
Microgreens have a short shelf life and better methods of storing and transporting microgreens are currently being studied, which at this time are mainly focusing on buckwheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=279279|title=Publication : USDA ARS|website=www.ars.usda.gov|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial microgreens are most often stored in plastic clamshell containers, which do not provide the right balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide for any live greens to breathe.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Among package materials called films, differences in permeability, (see [[Permeation]]), are referred to as the [[oxygen transmission rate]].&lt;!---Please fix this unintelligible sentence! ---&gt;

The ARS researchers found that buckwheat microgreens packaged in films with an oxygen transmission rate of 225 cubic centimeters per square inch per day had a fresher appearance and better cell membrane integrity than those packaged in other films tested. Following these steps, the team maintained acceptable buckwheat microgreen quality for more than 14 days—a significant extension, according to authors. This study was published in LWT-Food Science and Technology in 2013.&lt;ref name=ARS /&gt;

[[Light-emitting diodes]]. otherwise known as LEDs, now provide the ability to measure impacts of narrow-band wavelengths of light on seedling physiology. The carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] has been hypothesized to be a blue light receptor in plant physiology. A study was carried out to measure the impact of short-duration blue light on phytochemical compounds, which impart the nutritional quality of sprouting broccoli microgreens. Broccoli microgreens were grown in a controlled environment under LEDs using growing pads. Short-duration blue light acted to increase important phytochemical compounds influencing the nutritional value of broccoli microgreens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kopsell|first=Dean A.|title=Increases in Shoot Tissue Pigments, Glucosinolates, and Mineral Elements in Sprouting Broccoli after Exposure to Short-duration Blue Light from Light Emitting Diodes|url=http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/138/1/31.abstract|publisher=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Colon Cancer Awareness Month''' is an annual celebration observed in the United States during the month of March, to increase awareness of [[colorectal cancer]]. In the United States it is organized by the [[Colorectal Cancer Alliance]]."&lt;ref name=CCAM&gt;{{cite web|title=Colon Cancer Awareness Month|url=https://www.ccalliance.org/awareness-month/|publisher=Colorectal Cancer Alliance|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origin ===

National Colon Cancer Awareness Month (or National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month) in the United States was first established via Presidential Proclamation,&lt;ref name=proclamation&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Bill|url=https://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/New/html/20000301_1.html|title=NATIONAL COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH, 2000 
|publisher=NARA|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by [[Bill Clinton|William Jefferson Clinton]] on February 29, 2000.

==Events==
A National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month proclamation was issued by President Barack Obama for three years between 2014-2016.

The manner of celebration for national colon cancer awareness month varies, but many organizations host special events to help engage their local communities in raising awareness, such as with the [[Dress in Blue Day]] promoted by the Colorectal Cancer Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dressinblueday.org "Dress in Blue Day "] Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural Cycles''' is the first app to be certified for contraception in Europe. The app predicts the days on which a woman is [[fertility awareness|fertile]] and may be used for planning [[pregnancy]] and [[contraception]].  It was developed by [[CERN]] scientist Dr. [[Elina Berglund]], who founded the company with her husband, Dr. Raoul Scherwitzl.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/07/natural-cycles-fertility-app-algorithm-replace-pill-contraception |author=Emma Lundin |date=7 November 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Could an algorithm replace the pill?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/natural-cycles-ovulation-app |journal=Wired | author=Daniela Walker |date=4 October 2016 |title=Can an algorithm replace the pill?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-health/11677914/Could-an-app-replace-the-contraceptive-pill.html |title=Could an app replace the contraceptive pill? |newspaper=Daily Telegraph | author=Claire Cohen |date=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |author=Maddy Savage |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40629994 |title=The Swedish physicist revolutionising birth control |publisher=BBC news |date=7 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved U.S. marketing for Natural Cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/fda-approves-marketing-contraception-app-1st-time/story?id=57146537|title=FDA approves marketing for a contraception app for the 1st time|publisher=ABC News|first1=Catherine|last1=Thorbecke|date=August 12, 2018|access-date=August 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Dr. Berglund was a top physicist at CERN who was part of the [[Higgs boson]] discovery, which led to the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013, before co-founding the company with her husband Dr. Scherwitzl. Because the couple was in search of an alternative natural contraceptive themselves, Dr. Berglund used data analysis to develop an algorithm designed to pinpoint her ovulation. 

The couple then decided to create an app with the underlying algorithm, Natural Cycles. Following several medical trials, the app became the first tech-based device to be certified for use as contraception in the EU, in February 2017 by the European inspection and certification organisation [[TÜV SÜD]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In November 2017 Natural Cycles received a $30M investment in series B round led by [[EQT Ventures]] fund, with participation from existing investors Sunstone, [[E.ventures|E-ventures]] and Bonnier Growth Media (the [[Venture capital|VC]] arm of privately held Swedish media group, the [[Bonnier Group]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/natural-cycles-gets-30m-for-its-eu-certified-digital-contraception/ | title = Natural Cycles gets $30M for its EU-certified “digital contraception”|last=Lomas|first=Natasha|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the product is only currently certified in the European Union, where its users are concentrated in the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries, it is available worldwide. Natural Cycles offers a subscription product, which now has over 800,000 users across 160 countries (as of June 2018). 75 percent use the app as a contraceptive, and the rest use it to try and become pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/a-birth-control-app-raised-30-million-to-come-to-the-us-2017-11?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T|title=A Swedish app that wants to replace your birth control pill has raised $30 million to expand to the US|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The app works by taking your temperature each morning, under the tongue as soon as you wake up in the morning and logging it into the app. This is done with a [[basal thermometer]] which has a higher sensitivity than a typical fever thermometer as it displays two decimal places. The apps [[algorithm]] calculation is based on the observation that post-ovulation, [[progesterone]] warms the female body by up to 0.45C.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/ive-tried-the-app-thats-as-reliable-as-the-contraceptive-pill/|title=Could an app really replace the contraceptive pill?|last=Cohen|first=Claire|date=2016-04-13|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Natural Cycles algorithm then determines, based on the temperature, whether the user is fertile or not. A red day means fertile (which is when you should abstain or use a [[condom]]), a green day means not fertile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.breakit.se/artikel/9672/p-piller-i-appform-darfor-satsas-en-kvarts-miljard-pa-natural-cycles|title=P-piller i appform – varför satsar någon pengar på det?|work=Breakit|access-date=2017-12-15|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical significance ==
The most recent published clinical study showed that natural cycles, when used correctly, is as effective in preventing pregnancies as the contraceptive pill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
The study analysed 22,785 women through a total of 224,563 menstrual cycles across a year, to calculate the app’s [[Pearl Index]] – the rate used to measure a contraceptive effectiveness. It found that if used perfectly – using protection such as condoms on red days – effectiveness is 99 percent. [[Efficacy|Typical use]], where people become pregnant for all possible reasons, leads to 93 percent effectiveness. This is well above other [[Fertility awareness-based method|Fertility awareness based methods]] that rate at around 75 percent and even the [[Oral contraceptive pill|contraceptive pill]], which rates at 91 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berglund Scherwitzl E, Lundberg O, Kopp Kallner H, Gemzell Danielsson K, Trussell J, Scherwitzl R | title = Perfect-use and typical-use Pearl Index of a contraceptive mobile app | journal = Contraception | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 420–425 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 28882680 | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2017.08.014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies include the “Identification and prediction of the fertile window using Natural Cycles"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berglund Scherwitzl E, Lindén Hirschberg A, Scherwitzl R | title = Identification and prediction of the fertile window using NaturalCycles | journal = The European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 403–8 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25592280 | doi = 10.3109/13625187.2014.988210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and  “Fertility awareness-based mobile application for contraception”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berglund Scherwitzl E, Gemzell Danielsson K, Sellberg JA, Scherwitzl R | title = Fertility awareness-based mobile application for contraception | journal = The European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 234–41 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27003381 | pmc = 4898152 | doi = 10.3109/13625187.2016.1154143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. For the app to remain effective, women need to follow the app's instructions correctly, and it does not protect its users from [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2018, [[Södersjukhuset|Södersjukhuset,]] a hospital in Stockholm, Sweden filed a complaint with the Medical Products Agency of Sweden after 37 women who had been using Natural Cycles as their primary method of contraception sought an abortion at the hospital after becoming pregnant unintentionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nordic.businessinsider.com/a-swedish-hospital-is-reporting-birth-control-app-natural-cycles-to-the-authorities--after-37-of-its-patients-got-pregnant--/|title=Hyped birth control app Natural Cycles has been reported to the authorities - after 37 unwanted pregnancies|website=nordic.businessinsider.com|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural Cycles responded by saying the number of pregnancies was within the reported effectiveness rates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/natural-cycles-under-investigation-unwanted-pregnancies-2018-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://naturalcycles.com/en/science&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the app is currently under investigation by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] over supposedly misleading claims in its marketing over the accuracy of the app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/pregnancy-app-contraception-period-natural-cycles-uk-investigation-a8468741.html|title=Contraceptive app investigated over 'misleading' claims about its accuracy|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of users and healthcare professionals have expressed concerns over the efficacy of the app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/21/colossally-naive-backlash-birth-control-app|title=‘I felt colossally naive’: the backlash against the birth control app|last=Sudjic|first=Olivia|date=2018-07-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2018, Lauren Streicher, professor of clinical obstetrics at [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Feinberg School of Medicine]] expressed concerns over the [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s approval of the app. Streicher has claimed that the app is "problematic" as the app relies on users' self-reported temperatures which must be taken as soon as they wake up each morning in order to be accurate. In an interview with [[Vox (website)|Vox]], Streicher claimed "The minute you rely on action, the efficacy goes down.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/8/14/17684392/natural-cycles-birth-control-app-fda|title=The first "birth control app" was just approved by the FDA. Its transparency and effectiveness are in question.|work=Vox|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Natural Cycles has also been criticised for its marketing strategy of paying social media influencers to promote the app. In July 2018 researchers at the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine|London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] published a study which claimed “Natural Cycles’ marketing materials ought to be entirely transparent, more clear than they currently are about the limitations of their app and pregnancy risks”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hough|first=Amy|last2=Bryce|first2=Maggie|last3=Forrest|first3=Simon|date=2018-07-21|title=Social media and advertising natural contraception to young women: the case for clarity and transparency with reference to the example of ‘Natural Cycles’|url=https://srh.bmj.com/content/early/2018/07/21/bmjsrh-2018-200110|journal=BMJ Sex Reprod Health|language=en|pages=bmjsrh–2018–200110|doi=10.1136/bmjsrh-2018-200110|issn=2515-1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/8/14/17684392/natural-cycles-birth-control-app-fda|title=The first "birth control app" was just approved by the FDA.

'''Non-consensual condom removal''', or "'''stealthing'''", is the practice of one sex partner covertly removing a [[condom]], when [[consent]] has only been given by the other sex partner for condom-protected [[safer sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/inside-the-online-community-of-men-who-preach-removing-condoms-without-consent_us_58f75eb2e4b05b9d613eb997|title=Inside The Online Community Of Men Who Preach Removing Condoms Without Consent|last=Hatch|first=Jenavieve|date=21 April 2017|work=Huffington Post|access-date=23 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brodsky|first=Alexandra |title='Rape-Adjacent': Imagining Legal Responses to Nonconsensual Condom Removal |journal=Columbia Journal of Gender and Law |volume=32 |issue=2 |year=2017 |ssrn=2954726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and practice==
News and media outlets have reported on a research article by Alexandra Brodsky published in the ''[[Columbia Journal of Gender and Law]]'' about stealthing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WaTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/27/health/stealthing-sexual-assault-condoms/index.html|title=Some call it 'stealthing,' others call it sexual assault|first=Michael |last=Nedelman |date=27 April 2017 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Howard |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39860999/what-its-like-to-be-a-victim-of-stealthing |title=What it's like to be a victim of 'stealthing'  |website=Newsbeat |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Brodsky described victims' experiences, legal implications, and legal avenues to address stealthing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WaTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; The term ''stealthing'' has been in use in the [[gay community]] to describe this practice {{as of|2014|alt=since at least 2014.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Hugh|date=22 October 2014|title=Generationing, Stealthing, and Gift Giving: The Intentional Transmission of HIV by HIV-Positive Men to their HIV-Negative Sex Partners|journal=Health Psychology Research|volume=2|issue=3|doi=10.4081/hpr.2014.1582|issn=2420-8124|pmc=4768590|pmid=26973945|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brodsky described how the practice of stealthing is discussed, described, and advocated for on various websites and forums.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WaTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; These forums are sometimes used to brag about committing stealthing and to share tips on how to do it.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;&lt;ref name=WTSP&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Glasser |url=http://www.wtsp.com/mb/news/local/stealthing-the-practice-of-removing-condoms-during-sex-is-on-the-rise/433971040 |title=Should it be a crime to remove a condom during sex? |publisher=WTSP |location=St. Petersburg, Florida |date=25 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has also been described as "a threat to [a victim's] bodily agency and as a dignitary harm", and men who do this "justify their actions as a natural male instinct".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Columbia Law School professor Suzanne Goldberg says that the practice of stealthing is likely not new, but its promotion on the internet among men is new.&lt;ref name=NBC&gt;{{cite news |first=Kalhan |last=Rosenblatt |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/stealthing-victims-describe-partners-removing-condoms-during-sex-without-consent-n752681|title=What is 'stealthing'?: Disturbing sexual practice detailed in new report|publisher=NBC News |date=29 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such website, ''The Experience Project'', posted how-to guides for men.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/health/stealthing-condoms-legal-concerns-1.4088491|title='I felt like I had been raped': Stealth removal of condom during sex raises legal, ethical concerns|last=Mullin|first=Malone|date=3 May 2017|website=|publisher=CBC|type=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condom negotiation is often silenced by male partners in adolescent relationships, partially due to the female's fear of her partner’s response, a feeling of obligation, and a lack of knowledge or skills in negotiating condom use. To prevent this, it is important that male partners are reached with the information as to why condoms are beneficial for them as well. Forums for this outreach could include community-wide interventions fostering discussion of healthy and unhealthy relationship practices and prevention programs for [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]]s. Schools can provide a safe site for prevention interventions, but high-risk adolescents who are not in school must be reached through additional means, such as in community centers or detention centers.&lt;ref&gt;Teitelman AM, Tennille J, Bohinski JM, Jemmott LS, Jemmott JB III Unwanted unprotected sex: Condom coercion by male partners and self-silencing of condom negotiation among adolescent girls. Advances in Nursing Science, 2011; 34 (3): 243-259&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics on the prevalence of stealthing are limited.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; However, a 2014 study by Kelly Cue Davis and colleagues reported that 9.0% of participants in their sample of young men reported having engaged in condom sabotage, which included non-consensual condom removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Kelly Cue|last2=Stappenbeck|first2=Cynthia A.|last3=Norris|first3=Jeanette|last4=George|first4=William H.|last5=Jacques-Tiura|first5=Angela J.|last6=Schraufnagel|first6=Trevor J.|last7=Kajumulo|first7=Kelly F.|date=1 May 2014|title=Young Men's Condom Use Resistance Tactics: A Latent Profile Analysis|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2013.776660|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=51|issue=4|pages=454–465|doi=10.1080/00224499.2013.776660|issn=0022-4499|pmid=23548069|pmc=3723757}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Sexual Assault Hotline]] reports receiving calls about stealthing.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

==Legal and ethical concerns==
In UK law, consent to a specific sex act, but not to any sex act without exceptions, is known as [[Consent|conditional consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/man-convicted-of-rape-after-removing-condom-during-sex-without-consent|title=Man Convicted of Rape After Removing Condom During Sex Without Consent|work=Broadly|access-date=23 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/consent/#a07|title=CPS Legal Guidance|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service|website=www.cps.gov.uk|access-date=24 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509180545/http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/consent/#a07#a07|archive-date=9 May 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a Swiss court convicted a French man for [[rape]] for removing a condom during sex against the expectations of the woman he was having sex with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/man-convicted-rape-condom-sex-switzerland-a7521891.html|title=Man convicted of rape for taking off condom during sex|date=11 January 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=23 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/16/removing-condom-without-permission-rape-swiss-court-definition-non-consensual-sex|title=Is removing a condom without permission rape?|last=Williams|first=Zoe|date=16 January 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=24 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruling upheld a sexual assault conviction of a man who poked holes in his condom.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt;

Existing laws in the United States do not specifically cover stealthing and there are no known legal cases about it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WaTimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Kelly |url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/30/stealthing-sex-assault-of-removing-condom-during-i/|title=Law paper condemns 'stealthing' assailants removing condoms during intercourse without consent |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=30 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her research on stealthing, Brodsky noted that Swiss and Canadian courts have prosecuted cases of condoms broken or removed by men unbeknownst to their partners.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Brodsky describes stealthing as legally "rape-adjacent" and akin to rape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;

==Impact and risks==
By removing the condom during sex, stealthing increases the risks of pregnancy and the transmittal of STIs and STDs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WaTimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Victims may experience emotional and psychological distress as well, especially those who have experienced sexual violence in the past.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8894">'''Nutrient density''' identifies the proportion of [[nutrients]] in foods, with terms such as '''nutrient rich''' and  '''micronutrient dense''' referring to similar properties. Several different national and international standards have been developed and are in use (see [[Nutritional rating systems]]).

==Definition and usage==
According to the [[World Health Organization]], [[nutrient profiling]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010/en/ Nutrient Profiling: Report of a WHO/IASO Technical Meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, accessed 10/15/2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; classifies and/or ranks foods by their nutritional composition in order to promote human (and/or animal) health and to prevent disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/profiling/en/ Nutrient Profiling, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ranking by nutrient density is one such nutrient profiling strategy.  Ordering foods by nutrient density is a statistical method of comparing foods by the proportion of nutrients in foods.  Some such comparisons can be the [[glycemic index]] and the [[Overall Nutritional Quality Index]].

Nutrient-dense foods such as [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s are the opposite of [[energy density|energy-dense]] food (also called "[[empty calorie]]" food), such as [[alcohol]] and foods high in added [[sugar]] or processed [[cereals]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/food/nutrition/nutrition/dietary_guide/hgic4062.html Hunter, J. G., Cason, K. L., Nutrient Density, Clemson University, 2006(November), accessed 10/15/2014.  Nutrient density is defined as "a measure of the nutrients provided per calorie of food, or the ratio of nutrients to calories (energy)."]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B758G-4HP5YFV-D/2/c86659719922a2736490366333062119 Darmon, N., Darmon, M., Maillot, M., Drewnowski, A., ''A Nutrient Density Standard for Vegetables and Fruits: Nutrients per Calorie and Nutrients per Unit Cost'', Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 105(12),2005 (December), 1881–1887, DOI: 10.1016/j.jada.2005.09.005, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond its use to distinguish different ''types'' of food from each other, nutrient density allows comparison to be made for different examples or samples of the same kind of food. Nutrient density is correlated with soil quality and mineralization levels of the soil, although the relationship is complex and incorporates other dimensions.

The [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] reported in 2013 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several indicators of nutrient quality have been summarized by the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Drewnowski, A., Defining nutrient density: Development and validation of the nutrient rich foods index. J Am Coll Nutr. 2009; 28(suppl 4):421S-426S.&lt;/ref&gt;

First published February 24, 2010, doi: 10.3945/ajcn.2010.28450D]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==International standards==

The Nutrient Profiling Scoring Calculator (NPSC) in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] is a calculator for determining whether health claims can be made for a food by its reference to the Nutrient Profiling Scoring Criterion (NPSC).  It is defined by the FSANZ Board, which operates under the FSANZ Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/industry/labelling/pages/nutrientprofilingcalculator/Default.aspx FSANZ Board, Nutrient Profiling Scoring Calculator, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom Ofcom nutrient profiling model provides "a single score for any given food product, based on calculating the number of points for ‘negative’ nutrients which can be offset by points for ‘positive’ nutrients."  A 2007 UK-commissioned review of nutrient profiling models commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency identified over 40 different schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publichealth.ox.ac.uk/bhfhprg/publicationsandreports/acad-publications/bhfcpnppublished/nutrientprofilemodel Rayner, M., Scarborough, P., Lobtein, P., The UK Ofcom Nutrient Profiling Model, October 2009, accessed 10/15/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] reviews scientific and operational issues related to human nutrition, specifically when developing world populations are impacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010/en/ World Health Organization, Nutrient profiling: report of a technical meeting, London, United Kingdom, 4-6 October 2010, 20 pages, Publication date: 2011], {{ISBN|978 92 4 150220 7}}, accessed 10/15/2014, downloadable as a PDF from http://www.who.int/entity/nutrition/publications/profiling/WHO_IASO_report2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overnutrition''' or '''hyperalimentation''' is a form of [[malnutrition]] in which the intake of nutrients is oversupplied. The amount of nutrients exceeds the amount required for normal growth, development, and [[metabolism]]. 

The term can also refer to:
* [[Obesity]], which occurs by eating more calories than one burns, as well as:
* Oversupplying a ''specific'' nutrient, such as [[dietary minerals]] or [[vitamin poisoning]]. This is  due to an excessive intake or a nutritional imbalance caused by [[fad diet]]s.

For mineral excess, see:
* [[Iron poisoning]], and
* [[Low sodium diet]] (a response to excess sodium).

Overnutrition may also refer to greater [[food]] consumption than appropriate,&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000050758|hyperalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other feeding procedures such as [[parenteral nutrition]].

'''Physical strength''' is the measure of an [[animal]]'s exertion of [[force]] on [[physical object]]s. Increasing physical strength is the goal of [[strength training]].

==Overview==
An individual's physical strength is determined by two factors; the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers recruited to generate force and the intensity of the recruitment.  Individuals with a high proportion of [[Muscle fibre#Type I|type I]] slow twitch muscle fibers will be relatively weaker than a similar individual with a high proportion of [[Muscle fibre#Type II|type II]] fast twitch fibers, but would have a greater inherent capacity for physical endurance.  The genetic inheritance of muscle fiber type sets the outermost boundaries of physical strength possible (barring the use of enhancing agents such as testosterone), though the unique position within this envelope is determined by training.  Individual muscle fiber ratios can be determined through a muscle biopsy. Other considerations are the ability to recruit muscle fibers for a particular activity, joint angles, and the length of each limb. For a given cross-section, shorter limbs are able to lift more weight. The ability to gain muscle also varies person to person, based mainly upon genes dictating the amounts of hormones secreted, but also on sex, age, health of the person, and adequate nutrients in the diet.  A [[one-repetition maximum]] test is the most accurate way to determine maximum muscular strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hprc-online.org/physical-fitness/training-exercise/exercise/muscular-fitness-and-flexibility/muscular-strength|title=Muscular Strength — Human Performance Resource Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahealthyphilosophy.com/article/muscular-strength|title=Muscular Strength|publisher=}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strength capability==
There are various ways to measure physical strength of a person or population. Strength capability analysis is usually done in the field of [[ergonomics]] where a particular task (e.g. lifting a load, pushing a cart, etc.) and/or a posture is evaluated and compared to the capabilities of the section of the population that the task is intended towards. The external reactive [[torque|moments]] and forces on the joints are usually used in such cases. The strength capability of the joint is denoted by the amount of moment that the muscle force can create at the joint to counter the external moment.

Skeletal muscles produce reactive forces and moments at the joints. To avoid injury or fatigue, when person is performing a task, such as pushing or lifting a load, the external moments created at the joints due to the load at the hand and the weight of the body segments must be ideally less than the muscular moment strengths at the joint.

One of the first [[sagittal plane|sagittal-plane]] models to predict strength was developed by Chaffin in 1969.&lt;ref name = Chaffin&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Chaffin DB, Andersson GB, Martin BJ |title= Occupational Biomechanics, 3rd Edition |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=New York |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-471-24697-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on this model, the external moments at each joint must not exceed the muscle strength moments at that joint.

'''&lt;center&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;j/L&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;'''

Where, S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; is the muscle strength moment at joint, j, and M&lt;sub&gt;j/L&lt;/sub&gt; is the external moment at the joint, j, due to load, L and the body segments preceding the joint in the top-down analysis.

Top-down analysis is the method of calculating the reactive moments and forces at each joint starting at the hand, all the way till the ankle and foot. In a 6-segment model, the joints considered are elbow, shoulder, L5/S1 [[vertebral column|disc of the spine]], hip, knee and ankle. It is common to ignore the wrist joint in manual calculations. Software intended for such calculation use the wrist joint also, dividing the lower arm into hand and forearm segments.

==Prediction of static strength==
Static strength prediction is the method of predicting the strength capabilities of a person or a population (based on anthropometry) for a particular task and/or posture (an [[Isometric exercise|isometric contraction]]). Manual calculations are usually performed using the top-down analysis on a six or seven-link model, based on available information about the case and then compared to standard guidelines, such as the one provided by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], to predict capability.

In medicine, '''Piskacek's sign''' is an indication of [[pregnancy]]. This sign, however, may or may not be a concrete probability of pregnancy along with other signs of early pregnancy. Other signs of early pregnancy include [[Goodell's sign|Goodell]], [[Hegar's sign|Hegar]], [[von Braun-Fernwald's sign|von Braun Fernwald]], and [[Chadwick's sign|Chadwick]]. 

Specifically, Piskacek's sign consists noting a palpable lateral bulge or soft prominence one of the locations where the uterine tube meets the [[uterus]]. Piskacek's sign can be noted in the seventh to eight week of gestation. Non pregnant uterus is pyriform in shape. By 12 weeks of gestation it becomes globular. In lateral implantation, there is asymmetrical enlargement of the uterus. One half of the uterus where the implantation occurred is firm while the other half is soft. This is known as Piskacek's sign.
The sign is named after [[Ludwig Piskaçek]].

==Neolithic==

In the book ''[[Inside the Neolithic Mind]]'', the authors, archaeologists [[David Lewis-Williams]] and David Pearce argue that hallucinogenic drugs formed the basis of neolithic religion and rock art. Similar practices and images are found in some contemporary "stone-age" [[Indigenous peoples in South America]] using [[yaje]].

==Ancient Greece==

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Some scholars have suggested that Ancient Greek [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s employed [[entheogens|entheogen]], such as the [[Kykeon]] central to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], to induce a trance or dream state. Research conducted by John R. Hale, Jelle Zeilinga de Boer, Jeffrey P. Chanton and Henry A. Spiller suggests that the prophecies of the [[Delphic Oracle]] were uttered by Priestesses under the influence of gaseous vapors exuded from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/19/science/for-delphic-oracle-fumes-and-visions.html|title=For Delphic Oracle, Fumes and Visions|last=Broad|first=William J.|date=2002-03-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings are published in ''Questioning the Delphic Oracle: Overview / An Intoxicating Tale''.

== Buddhism ==
{{see also|Five Precepts|Buddhist ethics|ethic of reciprocity|karma|two truths doctrine}}
In Buddhism the Right [[view (Buddhism)|View]] (''{{IAST|samyag-dṛṣṭi}}'' / ''{{IAST|sammā-diṭṭhi}}'') can also be translated as "right perspective", "right outlook" or "right understanding", is the right way of looking at life, nature, and the world as they really are for us. It is to understand how our reality works. It acts as the reasoning with which someone starts practicing the path. It explains [[five aggregates|the reasons]] for our human existence, suffering, sickness, aging, death, the existence of greed, hatred, and delusion. Right view gives direction and efficacy to the other seven path factors. It begins with concepts and propositional knowledge, but through the practice of right concentration, it gradually becomes transmuted into wisdom, which can eradicate the [[fetter (Buddhism)|fetters of the mind]]. An understanding of right view will inspire the person to lead a virtuous life in line with right view. In the [[Pāli Canon|Pāli]] and [[Chinese Buddhist Canon|Chinese canons]], it is explained thus:&lt;ref name="BSac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.than.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TSac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.141.piya.html |title=Saccavibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Piyadassi Thera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.008.than.html |title=Magga-vibhanga Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |title=Madhyama Agama, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 26, sutra 31 (分別聖諦經第十一) |accessdate=27 October 2008 |publisher=Cbeta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122103247/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0026_007.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 32, Page 814|accessdate=27 October 2008|publisher=Cbeta|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122092756/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0032_001.htm|archivedate=22 November 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right livelihood===
Right livelihood (''samyag-ājīva'' / ''sammā-ājīva''). This means that practitioners ought not to engage in trades or occupations which, either directly or indirectly, result in harm for other living beings. In the Chinese and Pali Canon, it is explained thus:&lt;ref name=BSac/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu"/&gt;

{{quote|And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This is called right livelihood.}}

More concretely today interpretations include "work and career need to be integrated into life as a Buddhist,"&lt;ref name="triratna"&gt;[http://thebuddhistcentre.com/text/right-livelihood Right Livelihood], The Buddhist Centre: a triratna buddhist community space&lt;/ref&gt; it is also an ethical livelihood, "wealth obtained through rightful means" (Bhikku Basnagoda Rahula) – that means being honest and ethical in business dealings, not to cheat, lie or steal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lewis-richmond/right-livelihood-is-consc_b_832298.html Buddhism and Wealth: Defining 'Right Livelihood'], Huff Post, 16 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As people are spending most of their time at work, it’s important to assess how our work affects our mind and heart. So important questions include "How can work become meaningful? How can it be a support, not a hindrance, to spiritual practice — a place to deepen our awareness and kindness?"&lt;ref name="triratna"/&gt;

The five types of businesses that should not be undertaken:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.177.than.html |title=Vanijja Sutta |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Access to Insight |last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bogoda/wheel397.html |title=A Simple Guide to Life |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Robert Bogoda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/price/wheel363.html |title=Two Dialogues on Dhamma |accessdate=6 May 2008|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |last=Robert Bogoda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Business in weapons: [[Arms industry|trading in all kinds of weapons]] and instruments for killing.
# Business in human beings: [[slave trading]], [[prostitution]], or the buying and selling of children or adults.
# Business in meat: "meat" refers to the bodies of beings after they are killed. This includes breeding animals for slaughter.
# Business in intoxicants: manufacturing or selling [[intoxicating drink]]s or [[addictive drug]]s.
# Business in poison: producing or trading in any kind of [[poison]] or a toxic product designed to kill.

=== The fifth precept ===
According to the fifth precept of the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] are meant to refrain from any quantity of "fermented or distilled beverages" which would prevent mindfulness or cause heedlessness.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Dahlke |first1=Paul |last2=Sīlācāra |first2=Bhikkhu |last3=Oates |first3=L.R. |last4=Lounsbery |first4=G. Constant |title=The Five Precepts |journal=The Wheel Publication |year=1963 |publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |location=Sri Lanka |volume= |issue=55 |pages= |url=http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh055.pdf |issn=0068-3345 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pali]] [[Tipitaka]] the precept is explicitly concerned with [[alcoholic beverage]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I undertake the training rule to abstain from fermented drink that causes heedlessness."
&lt;br /&gt;
''Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, [[caffeine]] and [[tea]] are permitted, even encouraged for monks of most traditions, as it is believed to promote wakefulness.

Generally speaking, the vast majority of Buddhists and Buddhist sects denounce and have historically frowned upon the use of any intoxicants by an individual who has taken the five precepts. Most Buddhists view the use and abuse of intoxicants to be a hindrance in the development of an [[Bodhicitta|enlightened mind]]. However, there are a few historical and doctrinal exceptions.

=== Vajrayana ===

{{see also|Skillful means|ganachakra|amrita}}

Many modern Buddhist schools have strongly discouraged the use of psychoactive drugs of any kind; however, they may not be prohibited in all circumstances in all traditions. Some denominations of [[Tantric Buddhism|tantric]] or esoteric Buddhism especially exemplify the latter, often with the principle [[skillful means]]:

==== Alcohol ====

For example, as part of the  [[ganachakra]] ''tsok'' ritual (as well as [[Homa (ritual)|Homa]], [[abhisheka]] and sometimes [[drubchen]]) some [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] and [[Bön]]pos have been known to ingest small amounts of [[grain alcohol|grain]] [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] (called ''amrit'' or ''[[amrita#Buddhism|amrita]]'') as an offering. If a member is an alcoholic, or for some other reason does not wish to partake in the drinking of the alcoholic offering, then he or she may dip a finger in the alcohol and then flick it three times as [[Tsok#Alcohol in Vajrayana|part of the ceremony]].

Amrita is also possibly the same as, or at least in some sense a conceptual derivative of the ancient Hindu ''[[soma (drink)|soma]]''. (The latter which historians often equate with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' or other ''[[Amanita]]'' [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] [[fungi]].) Crowley (1996) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Undoubtedly, the striking parallels between "The legend about Chakdor" and the Hindu legend of the origin of soma show that the Buddhist amrita and the Hindu soma were at one time understood to be identical. Moreover, the principal property of amrita is, to this day, perceived by Buddhists as being a species of inebriation, however symbolically this inebriation may be interpreted. Why else would beer (Tibetan ''chhang'', "barley beer") be used by yogins as a symbolic substitute for amrita [Ardussi]? Conversely, why else would the term bDud.rTsi be used as a poetic synonym for [[beer]]?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Conversely, in [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] lore there is a story about a monk who came across a woman who told him that he must either:
* '''a.''' kill her goat,
* '''b.''' sleep with her, or
* '''c.''' drink a mug of [[beer]].
* '''d.''' All of the above.

The monk thought to himself, "''well, surely if I kill the goat then I will be causing great suffering since a living being will die. If I sleep with the woman then I will have broken another great vow of a monk and will surely be lost to the ways of the world. Lastly, if I drink the beer then perhaps no great harm will come and I will only be intoxicated for a while, and most importantly I will only be hurting myself.''" (In the context of the story this instance is of particular importance to him because monks in the Mahayana and Vajrayana [[bodhicitta|try to bring all sentient beings to enlightenment]] as part of their goal.)

So the monk drank the mug of beer and then he became very drunk. In his drunkenness he proceeded to kill the woman and sleep with the goat, breaking all three vows and, at least in his eyes, doing much harm in the world. The lesson of this story is meant to be that, at least according to the cultures from which it delineates, alcohol causes one to break all of one's vows, in a sense that one could say it is the cause of all other harmful deeds.&lt;ref&gt;one place this story is referenced is in the more Western article 'Sherpa Purity' by Sherry B. Ortner, published in the magazine American Anthropologist. The beginning of that article is available online, here: https://www.jstor.org/pss/672339 but the story is not available unless you login etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vajrayana]] teacher Drupon Thinley Ningpo [[Rinpoche]] has said that as part of the five precepts which a layperson takes upon [[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]], that although they must refrain from taking intoxicants, they may drink enough so as they do not become drunk. [[Bhikku]]s and [[Bhikkuni]]s (monks and nuns, respectively), on the other hand, who have taken the [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|ten vows]] as part of taking refuge and becoming ordained, cannot imbibe any amount of alcohol or other drugs, other than [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]]s taken as medicine.

[[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, is known as teetotaler and non-smoker.

==== Hallucinogens ====
{{see also|Dzogchen|Rahu|tantrism}}

There is some evidence regarding the use of [[deliriant]] ''[[Datura]]'' seeds (known as ''candabija'') in Dharmic rituals associated with many [[tantras]] – namely the  ''Vajramahabhairava'', ''Samputa'', ''Mahakala'', ''Guhyasamaja'', ''Tara'' and ''Krsnayamari'' tantras – as well as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and other [[entheogens]] in minority Vajrayana [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vajrayana.faithweb.com/rich_text_5.html|title=Entheogens in the Vajrayana Tradition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald M Davidson says that in Indian Vajrayana, [[Datura]] was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“employed as a narcotic paste or as wood in a fire ceremony and could be easily absorbed through the skin or the lungs. The seeds of this powerful narcotic, termed "passion seeds"  (candabija), are the strongest elements and contain the alkaloids hyoscine, hyoscyamine, and atropine in forms that survive burning or boiling. In even moderate doses, datura can render a person virtually immobile with severe belladonna-like [[hallucinations]].”&lt;ref&gt;Ronald M Davidson 2002, Indian Esoteric Buddhism: a social history of the Tantric movement (datura and betel)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''Profound Summarizing Notes on the Path Presented as the Three Continua'' a [[Sakya]] [[Lamdre]] text, by [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk]] (1524-1568), the use of [[Datura]] in combination with other substances, is prescribed as part of a meditation practice meant to establish that "All the phenomena included in apparent existence, samsara and nirvana, are not established outside of one's mind."&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Cyrus; Taking the Result as the Path: Core Teachings of the Sakya Lamdre Tradition (Library of Tibetan Classics), 2006, page 421, 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Baker writes that Tibetan terma literature such as the [[Vima Nyingtik]] describes "various concoctions of mind altering substances, including datura and oleander, which can be formed into pills or placed directly in the eyes to induce visions and illuminate hidden contents of the psyche."&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Ian; The Heart of the World: A Journey to Tibet's Lost Paradise, Part Three, Hell night&lt;/ref&gt;

A book titled ''Zig Zag Zen: Buddhism and Psychedelics'' (2002), details the history of Buddhism and the use of psychedelic drugs, and includes essays by modern Buddhist teachers on the topic.

=== Zen ===

[[Zen Buddhism]] is known for stressing the precepts. [[Buddhism in Japan|In Japan]], however, where Zen flourished historically, there are a number of examples of misconduct on the part of monks and [[Laity|laypeople]] alike. This often involved the use of alcohol, as [[sake]] drinking has and continues to be a well known aspect of [[Japanese culture]].

The Japanese Zen monk and abbot, [[shakuhachi]] player and poet [[Ikkyu]] was known for his unconventional take on [[Zen Buddhism]]: His style of expressing [[dharma]] is sometimes deemed "Red Thread Zen" or "Crazy Cloud Zen" for its unorthodox characteristics. Ikkyu is considered both a heretic and saint in the [[Rinzai]] Zen tradition, and was known for his derogatory poetry, open [[alcoholism]] and for frequenting the services of [[prostitutes]] in [[brothels]]. He personally found no conflict between his lifestyle and Buddhism.

There are several [[koans]] (Zen riddles) referencing the drinking of sake ([[rice wine]]); for instance [[Mumonkan]]'s tenth koan titled ''Seizei Is Utterly Destitute'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Seizei said to Sozan, "Seizei is utterly destitute. Will you give him support?" Sozan called out: "Seizei!" Seizei responded, "Yes sir?!" Sozan said, "You have finished three cups of the finest wine in China, and still you say you have not yet moistened your lips!"'
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another monk, Gudo, is mentioned in a koan called ''Finding a Diamond on a Muddy Road'' buying a gallon of sake.

==Judaism==
Judaism maintains that people do not own their bodies – they belong to God. As a result, Jews are not permitted to harm, mutilate, destroy or take risks with their bodies, life or health with activities such as taking life-threatening drugs. However, there is no general prohibition against drugs in Judaism, as long as they don't interfere with one's ritual duties and don't cause definite harm, though most Rabbis generally prohibit drugs, in order to avoid social, legal and medical problems in their community.

Spiritual use of various alcoholic beverages, sometimes in very large quantities, is common and well known. In some Jewish communities there is a tradition to get drunk on [[Purim]] until they forget the difference between the Hebrew phrases "Cursed is Haman" and "Blessed is Mordechai", which signified reaching the spiritual world [[Atzilut]] where all opposites unite. In many Jewish communities it is customary to drink on [[Simchat Torah]] as well. Drinking in small quantities as a mind-altering practice is commonly used during the [[Chabad|Farbrengens]] of the [[Chabad]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]]. A large body of Chabad literature refers to the spiritual dangers of drinking, but a few anecdotal references refer to the spirutal power of alcohol, when used for the sake of connecting to God and achieving brotherly love among fellows Jews.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The Lubavitcher Rebbe forbade his Chassidim under the age of 40 to consume more than 4 small shots of hard liqueurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2007/08/drugs-judaism/|title=Drugs &amp; Judaism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wine]] plays a prominent role in many Jewish rituals, most notably the [[kiddush]].
Hasidic Jews often engage in a free ceremony called "Tisch" in which drinks such as Vodka are drunk in a group. Drinking is accompanied by singing and the study of the Torah.

Some Hasidic Rabbis, e.g. the [[Chaim Zanvl Abramowitz|Ribnitzer Rebbe]] used to drink large amounts of [[Vodka]] on some special occasions, apparently as a powerful mind-altering method. The [[Chaim Zanvl Abramowitz|Ribnitzer Rebbe]] also practiced severe [[sleep deprivation]], extremely long meditative prayers and a number of ascetic purification rituals. During his life in the [[USSR]] he used to immerse himself every day in ice water.

The spiritual use of [[caffeine]] and [[nicotine]] as stimulants is well known in the Hasidic communities. Many stories are told about miracles and spiritual journeys performed by the [[Baal Shem Tov]] and other famous [[Tzaddik]]im with the help of their smoking pipe. Some people suggest that, judging by the nature of these stories, the tobacco was sometimes mixed with strong mind-altering drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ethics/Our_Bodies/Health_and_Healing/Smoking_Alcohol_and_Drugs/Tobacco.shtml|title=Tobacco|work=My Jewish Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cannabischassidis.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_archive.html|title=Cannabis Chassidis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular Hasidic saying relates coffee to the Psalmic verse "Hope in God". The Hebrew word for "hope" ("Kave") sounds identical to the Yiddish word for coffee. Coffee is believed to have power to awaken the soul to the worship of God.

Some [[Kabbalists]], including [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre|Isaac of Acco]] and [[Abraham Abulafia]], mention a method of "philosophical meditation", which involves drinking a cup of "strong wine of [[Avicenna]]", which would induce a [[trance]] and would help the adept to ponder over difficult philosophical questions.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan, Meditation and Kabbalah, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The exact recipe of this wine remains unknown; Avicenna refers in his works to the effects of [[opium]] and [[datura]] extracts.

Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], a prominent researcher of Jewish meditations, suggested that some medieval Kabbalists may have used some psychedelic drugs&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan, Meditation and Kabbalah, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, one can find in Kabbalistic medical manuals cryptic references to the hidden powers of [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]], [[harmal]] and other psychoactive plants, though the exact usage of these powers is hard to decipher.

According to [[Aryeh Kaplan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Aryeh|title=[[The Living Torah]]|location=New York|year=1981|page=442|isbn=0-940118-35-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; cannabis was an ingredient in the [[Holy anointing oil]] mentioned in various sacred [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] texts.  The herb of interest is most commonly known as ''kaneh-bosem'' (קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/backissues/cc11/christ.html |title=Cannabis and the Christ: Jesus used Marijuana |work=[[Cannabis Culture (magazine)|Cannabis Culture]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822175502/http://www.cannabisculture.com/backissues/cc11/christ.html |archivedate=2009-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) which is mentioned several times in the [[Old Testament]] as a bartering material, incense, and an ingredient in Holy anointing oil used by the high priest of the temple. Many [[Rastafarians]], who use cannabis as a sacrament, identify as Jewish.

According to [[Josephus]], the head-dress of the Jewish High Priests' was modeled upon the capsule of the [[Hyoscyamus niger|Hyoscyamus]] flower, which he calls "Saccharus". This Greek word for sugar stems from the Hebrew root that means "intoxicating".&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Antiquities, Book III, 7:6&lt;/ref&gt;

Benny Shanon, a psychology professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, proposed that Moses may have been high on hallucinogenic mushrooms at the time he received the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-525993/Moses-high-hallucinogenic-drug-received-Ten-Commandments-claims-academic.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title='Moses was high on hallucinogenic drug when he received Ten Commandments,' claims top academic | date=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
{{see also|Christian views on alcohol|}}

Many [[Christian]] denominations disapprove of the use of most illicit drugs. Many denominations permit the moderate use of socially and legally acceptable drugs like [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[caffeine]] and [[tobacco]]. Some [[Christian]] denominations permit smoking [[tobacco]], while others disapprove of it. Many denominations do not have any official stance on drug use, some more-recent Christian denominations (e.g. [[Mormons]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Jehovah’s Witnesses]]) discourage or prohibit the use of any of these substances.

Because [[Jesus]] and many Biblical figures drank [[wine]], most [[Christian]] denominations do not require [[teetotalism]]. In the Eucharist, wine represents (or among [[Christian]]s who believe in some form of [[Real Presence]], like the Catholic, Lutheran and Orthodox churches, actually ''is'') the blood of Christ. Lutherans believe in the real presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist,&lt;ref name=WELSparticipation&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=814&amp;cuItem_itemID=1045 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102081951/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=814&amp;cuItem_itemID=1045 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=1 Corinthians 10:16 - Meaning of "Participation |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WELSQA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=258&amp;cuItem_itemID=8633 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102005853/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=258&amp;cuItem_itemID=8633 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 January 2008 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Beliefs of other Church |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |quote=As [[Confessional Lutheran]]s we believe in baptismal regeneration, the real presence of Christ's body and blood in the Lord's Supper, and infant baptism. |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the body and blood of Christ are "truly and substantially present in, with and under the forms."&lt;ref name=WLS-Real&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BrugReal.pdf |title=The Real Presence of Christ’s Body and Blood in The Lord's Supper: Contemporary Issues Concerning the Sacramental Union |last=Brug |first=John F. |publisher=[[Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary]] |quote=Lutherans have always emphasized that Christ's true body and blood are really present "in, with, and under" the bread and wine and that Christ's true body and blood are received by all who receive the elements, either to their blessing or to their condemnation...Lutherans emphasize that although the presence of Christ in the Sacrament is a supernatural presence, which is beyond our understanding and explanations, it is a real, substantial presence.

On the other hand, some [[Protestant]] Christian denominations, such as [[Baptist]]s and [[Methodist]]s associated with the [[temperance movement]], encourage or require teetotalism. In some Protestant denomination, grape juice or non-alcoholic wine is used in place of wine to represent the blood of Christ.
 
The best known Western prohibition against alcohol happened in the United States in the 1920s, where concerned prohibitionists were worried about its dangerous side effects. However, the demand for alcohol remained and criminals stepped in and created the supply. The consequences of organized crime and the popular demand for alcohol, led to alcohol being legalized again.

==Islam==

Islam prohibits all drugs that are not medically prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islam: Drugs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/sanctity/isdrugsrev2.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's prohibition of drugs&lt;ref name=IslamO1&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Yusuf Al-Qaradawi]]|title=Islam Prohibits Alcohol and Drugs|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545310}}&lt;/ref&gt; stems from two concerns:
*their intoxication effects
*their harm to the human body

There are numerous verses in the Qur'an and hadith that ban ''[[khamr]]'' (intoxicants, including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]). [[Muhammad]] said:&lt;ref name=IslamO1/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every intoxicant is like alcohol, and every (type of) alcohol is prohibited. ([[Sahih Muslim|Muslim]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second reason for banning drugs is that they are believed to have a harmful effect on the body. The Qur'an says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And make not your own hands contribute to your destruction." Surah, Al-Baqara, 2: 195&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Muslim nations of Turkey and Egypt were instrumental in banning [[opium]], [[cocaine]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] when the [[League of Nations]] committed to the 1925 International Convention relating to opium and other drugs (later the 1934 Dangerous Drugs Act). The primary goal was to ban opium and cocaine, but cannabis was added to the list, and it remained there largely unnoticed due to the much more heated debate over opium and coca. The 1925 Act has been the foundation upon which every subsequent policy in the [[United Nations]] has been founded. Cannabis use and abuse as an intoxicant was largely unknown in the West at that point, but Islamic leaders have been critical of it since the 13th century.

O You who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones and (divination by) arrows are an abomination of Satan’s handiwork. Avoid (such abominations) that you may prosper. (5:90)

Satan’s plan is to sow hatred and enmity amongst you with intoxicants and gambling, and to hamper you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. Will you not give up? (5:91)

There are no prohibitions in Islam on alcohol for scientific, industrial or automotive use.

In spite of these restrictions on substance use, tobacco and caffeine are still widely used throughout many Muslim nations.

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] are forbidden to drink [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or to take drugs, unless prescribed by doctors.  Accordingly, the sale and trafficking of such substances is also forbidden.  Smoking is discouraged but not prohibited.

==Rastafari movement==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Many [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] believe [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which they call "ganja," "the herb," or "Kaya," is a sacred gift of [[Jah]]. It may be used for spiritual purposes to commune with God, but should not be used profanely. The use of other drugs, however, including alcohol, is frowned upon. Many believe that the wine Jesus/Iyesus drank was not an alcoholic beverage, but simply the juice of grapes or other fruits.

While some Rastafari suggest that the Bible may refer to marijuana, it is generally held by academics specializing in the archaeology and paleobotany of [[Ancient Israel]], and those specializing in the lexicography of the [[Hebrew Bible]], that cannabis is not documented or mentioned in early Judaism. Against this some popular writers&lt;ref&gt;Dan Merkur ''The Mystery of Manna: The Psychedelic Sacrament of the Bible'' (2001); James D. Dure, ''Manna Magic Mushroom of Moses : Manna Botanical I.D. of a Biblical Sacrament'' (self published, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that there is evidence for religious use of cannabis in the Hebrew Bible, although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., [[John Allegro]] in relation to [[Qumran]], 1970) have been "widely dismissed as erroneous" (Merlin, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;[[Economic Botany]] [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057%5B0295:AEFTTO%5D2.0.CO%3B2#page-1  M. D. Merlin  Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World - University of Hawaii] "23 May 2011 - ".. Judaism (Dure 2001; Merkur 2000), and Christianity (Allegro 1970; Ruck et al. 2001). Although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., Allegro 1970) have been widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue"&lt;/ref&gt; The primary advocate of a religious use of cannabis plant in early Judaism was [[Sula Benet]] (1967), who claimed that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pag. 89&lt;/ref&gt; although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 p73&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reasoning ===
A "reasoning" is a simple event where the Rastas gather, smoke cannabis ("ganja"), and discuss. The person honored by being allowed to light the herb says a short sentence beforehand. The ganja is passed in a clockwise fashion (passing 'pon the lef' han' side) except in times of war, when it is passed counterclockwise. It is used to reason with Jah.

=== Groundation ===
A "groundation" (also spelled "grounation") or "binghi" is a holy day; the name "binghi" is derived from "Nyabinghi" (literally "Nya" meaning "black" and "Binghi" meaning "victory"). Binghis are marked by much dancing, singing, feasting, and the smoking of "ganja", and can last for several days.

=== Bible verses which Rastas believe justify cannabis use ===
...thou shalt eat the herb of the field.

Genesis 3.18

...eat every herb of the land.

Exodus 10:12

Better is a dinner of herb where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.

Proverbs 15:17

=== Beliefs about other drugs ===
According to many Rastas, the illegality of cannabis in many nations is evidence of persecution of Rastafari. They are not surprised that it is illegal, viewing Cannabis as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth – something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. Cannabis use is contrasted with the use of alcohol and other drugs, which they feel destroy the mind.

==Asatru==
Alcoholic drinks are commonly used during Asatru blots but non-alcoholic drinks can be substituted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravenkindred.com/RBRituals.html|title=The Rituals of Asatru|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/heathen_home/faq.html#11]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3888">The '''Safe bottle lamp''', called '''sudeepa''' or '''sudipa''' for ''good lamp'', is a safer [[kerosene lamp]] designed by [[Wijaya Godakumbura]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101230052253/http://www.theworldchallenge.co.uk/2009-winner.php "A Bright Idea - Winner 2009 (Archived)"]&lt;/ref&gt; of Sri Lanka. The safety comes from heavier glass, a secure screw-on metal lid, and two flat sides which prevent it from rolling if knocked over.

==History==
As surgeon Dr. Godakumbura saw many burn cases caused by kerosene lamp fires.  Over 1 million homes in Sri Lanka do not have electricity, and rely on kerosene lamps for illumination, often [[improvised]] lamps made from [[bottle]]s.  These tall lamps tip easily, and when they do, the [[candle wick|wick]] holder often falls out and starts a sudden, intense fire.  Often the fuel falls on a nearby person, setting them ablaze and resulting in severe [[burn (injury)|burns]], often fatal.

In 1992, Dr. Godakumbura set out to design a new lamp that was both safer, and inexpensive enough to be affordable by the impoverished Sri Lankans at risk for these fires.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Lanka Guardian [http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/09/dr-wijaya-godakumbura-and-wonderful.html "Dr. Wijaya Godakumbura and the Wonderful Lamp"], September 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting lamp is a small, flattened sphere, which resists tipping and rolling. It is made of thick glass to resist breaking, and has a screw-on metal cap that holds the wick in place and prevents spilling.

In 1993, with contributions from numerous sources, including [[Science Fiction]] writer and Sri Lanka resident [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and the [[Canada|Canadian High Commission]], the lamp was put into production.

Available for a cost of less than US$0.25 each, over half a million of the new lamps have been sold, and Dr. Godakumbura hopes to continue producing the new lamps until use of improvised lamps drops to a small percentage of lamp use in Sri Lanka.

==The Foundation==
Having received a Rolex Award for Enterprise in 1998, Dr. Godakumbura established the Safe Bottle Lamp Foundation (SBLF), a non-profit organization. The Foundation is governed by a board of directors and employs two full-time staff .

In addition to the [[Rolex award|Rolex Award]], the foundation and Dr. Godakumbura have received a range of other local and international awards and grants. Among these are a Lindbergh Foundation Grant and a BBC [[The World Challenge|World Challenge]] Award. The project has been featured in many international publications such as TIME, Newsweek, Science and Nature, National Geographic and La Figaro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safelamp.org/acclaim.html |title=The Safe Bottle Lamp Foundation (Archived Copy)|accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921172511/http://safelamp.org/acclaim.html|archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Godakumbura has represented the foundation in many international conferences on burn and accident prevention as a speaker or as a participant. The foundation and the Sudeepa lamp have been promoted as a replicable solution for other developing countries where accidental burns due to unsafe lamps is prevalent.

''Tannerella forsythia'' was discovered by and named after Dr. Anne Tanner who works at [[The Forsyth Institute]] located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

''T. forsythia'' has been identified in atherosclerotic lesions. Lee et al. found that infecting mice with ''T. forsythia'' induced foam cell formation and accelerated the formation of atherosclerotic lesions.&lt;ref&gt;[LEE HR, JUN HK, &amp; CHOI BK. (2014).

A '''women's health nurse practitioner''' ('''WHNP''') is a [[nurse practitioner]] that specializes in continuing and comprehensive healthcare for women across the lifespan with emphasis on conditions unique to women from [[menarche]] through the remainder of their life cycle. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nurse Practitioner Primary Care Competencies in Specialty Areas|url=http://www.aacn.nche.edu/education-resources/npcompetencies.pdf|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and board certification==
Following educational preparation at the [[Master of Science in Nursing|master's]] or [[Doctor of Nursing Practice|doctoral]] level, WHNPs must become [[Nursing board certification|board certified]] by an approved certification body.  Board certification must be maintained by obtaining [[continuing nursing education]] credits.  In the US, board certification is provided through the [[National Certification Corporation]] (awards the [[WHNP-BC]] credential).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certification exams|url=http://www.nccwebsite.org/Certification|publisher=NCC|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of practice==
WHNPs deliver a range of acute, chronic, and [[preventive healthcare]] services:
* Obtaining a relevant health history, including a comprehensive [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] and [[gynecologic]] history, with emphasis on gender-based differences.
* Performing a complete, system, or symptom-directed physical examinations on women, including obstetric and gynecologic conditions/needs that include, [[Human pregnancy|pregnancy]], benign and malignant gynecologic conditions, [[contraception]], [[sexually transmitted infections]], [[infertility]], [[perimenopause]]/[[menopause]]/[[postmenopause]] and other gender-specific illnesses.
* Assessing, diagnosing, and treating for maternal and fetal well-being, [[High risk pregnancy|high-risk pregnancies]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and pregnancy/postpartum complications.
* Assessing, diagnosing, and treating disease risk factors specific to women.
* Distinguishing female gender differences in presentation and progression of health problems and responses to pharmacological agents and other therapies.
* Assessing social and physical environmental health risks, including [[teratogens]], that impact [[childbearing]].
* Assessing for evidence of [[intimate partner violence]], [[sexual abuse]], and [[substance abuse]].
* Assessing, diagnosing, and treating issues related to [[human sexuality|sexuality]].
* Assessing parental behavior and skills and promotes smooth transition to role changes.
* Assessing, diagnosing, and treating selected [[reproductive health]] needs or problems in male partners, such as sexually transmitted infections, contraception, and infertility.
* Assessing [[Genetics|genetic risks]] and refers, as needed, for [[Genetic testing|testing]] and counseling.
* Collaborating with other health care providers for management or referral of high-risk pregnancies.
* Performing primary care procedures, including [[pap smears]], microscopy, [[post-coital test|post-coital tests]], [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) insertion, and [[Endometrial biopsy|endometrial biopsies]].
* Providing management and education for women and men in need of [[family planning]] and [[fertility control]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2786">The '''World Mental Health Survey Initiative''' is a collaborative project by [[World Health Organization]], [[Harvard University]], [[University of Michigan]], and country-based researchers worldwide to coordinate the analysis and implementation of [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[Survey (human research)|surveys]] of [[Mental_disorder|mental]] and [[Behavioral disorder|behavioral]] disorders and substance abuse in all [[World_Health_Organization#Regional_offices|WHO Regions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Mental Health Survey Initiative|url=https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmh/|website=Harvard Medical School|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mental Health Survey Initiative|url=https://www.src.isr.umich.edu/international/world-mental-health-survey-initiative/|website=University of Michigan|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aim ==
It is estimated that the burden of mental and addictive disorders are among the highest in the world with expected increase over the next decades. However, those estimations are not based on [[Cross-sectional_study|cross-sectional]] [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[Survey (human research)|surveys]], rather, they are mainly based on [[literature reviews]] and isolated studies.
The WMH Survey Initiative aim is to accurately address the global burden of mental disorders by obtaining accurate cross-sectional information about the prevalences and correlates of mental and behavioral disorders as well as substance abuse, allowing for evaluation of risk factors and study of patterns of service use in order to target appropriate interventions.

== Collaborators ==
Collaborators in this survey come from all WHO regions of the world, with 27 participating countries.
