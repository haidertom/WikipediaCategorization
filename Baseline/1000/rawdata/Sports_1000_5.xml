'''1872 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[American football]]==
'''College championship'''
* [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|College football national championship]] – [[Princeton Tigers]]
'''Events'''
* Five teams compete in the [[1872 college football season]]: {{cfb link|year=1872|team=Columbia Lions|school=Columbia University|title=Columbia}}, {{cfb link|year=1872|team=Rutgers Scarlet Knights|title=Rutgers}}, [[1872 Princeton Tigers football team|Princeton]], [[1872 Stevens Ducks football team|Stevens Tech]] and [[1872 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]].

==[[Association football]]==
'''International'''
* 30 November — [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] v. [[England national football team|England]] in Glasgow is the [[Scotland v England (1872)|first–ever official football international]]. The match is a goalless draw.

'''England'''
* 16 March — inaugural [[1872 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]]. [[Wanderers F.C.|The Wanderers]] 1–0 [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] at [[The Oval|Kennington Oval]] in London.  The goal is scored by [[Morton Betts]].  In its way, this first final marks the beginning of major competitive football.
* The FA rules that the ball must have a circumference of between 68&amp;nbsp;cm and 71&amp;nbsp;cm.  It must be spherical and must consist of an India rubber bladder enclosed within a casing made of leather or another approved material.  Also, the ball must weigh at least 396 grams but no more than 453 grams.  The prescribed weight is interesting because leather balls will become notorious for gaining weight when wet: the weight can almost double if the ball gets really soaked.&lt;ref&gt;Among the many stories told about [[Bill Shankly]] is one concerning the introduction of plastic balls in the 1960s.  Someone remarked to Shankly that so–and–so was a master of the "banana shot" and could bend the ball through the air.  Shankly replied: "Huh!  I'd like to see him try bending one of those soggy wet leather things we used to play with.  It'd break his bloody ankle!"&lt;/ref&gt;  
'''Scotland'''
* February — [[Rangers F.C.]] is formed in Glasgow by four friends.  The team's first pitch is on common land at Flesher's Haugh, Glasgow Green.

==[[Baseball]]==
'''National championship'''
* [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] champion – [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]]
'''Events'''
* The [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] (NA) permits [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]]ing with a wrist snap, practically legalising the [[New York Mutuals]].
* Multiple [[NABBP]] champions [[Brooklyn Eckfords|Eckford]] and [[Brooklyn Atlantics|Atlantic]] from [[Brooklyn, New York]] join the NA but neither will regain prominence.
* The original [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] win the NA pennant, beginning a four-year run

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* No fights of note take place in 1872.  American Champion [[Mike McCoole]] and his challengers are inactive.&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/mccoole.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Mike McCoole].  Retrieved on 8 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* An experiment takes place at [[Lord's]] to study the effects of covering the pitch before the start of a match, the first time this is known to have been tried.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p.284.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''England'''
* Most runs – [[W. G. Grace]] 1,485 @ 57.11 (HS 170*)
* Most wickets – [[James Southerton]] 169 @ 13.07 (BB 8–20)

'''Athletic training''' has been recognized by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) as an allied health care profession since June 1991.&lt;ref&gt;"What is an Athletic Trainer?". The Board of Certification Website. 2003
As defined by the Strategic Implementing Team of the National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) in August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Athletic training is practiced by athletic trainers, health care professionals who collaborate with physicians to optimize activity and participation of patients and clients.  Athletic training encompasses the prevention, diagnosis, and intervention of emergency, acute and chronic medical conditions involving impairment, functional limitations and disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;"Strategic implementation team defines profession". NATA News (12/2007): 14. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are five domains of athletic training listed in the 7th edition (2015) of the Athletic Training Practice Analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bocatc.org/images/stories/resources/pa7-outline-vf.pdf|title=Practice Analysis, 7th ed.|last=Board of Certification|first=|date=2015|website=www.bocatc.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-29}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Injury and Illness Prevention and Wellness Promotion
* Examination, Assessment and Diagnosis
* Immediate and Emergency Care
* Therapeutic Intervention
* Healthcare Administration and Professional Responsibility

An athletic trainer functions as an integral member of the health care team in clinics, secondary schools, colleges and universities, professional sports programs, and other athletic health care settings.&lt;ref&gt;Prentice, W. (2011). Principles of Athletic Training. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Athletic training in the United States began in October 1881 when Harvard University hired James Robinson to work conditioning their football team. At the time, the term "athletic trainer" meant one who worked with track and field athletes. Robinson had worked with track and field athletes and the name "athletic trainer" transferred to those working on conditioning these football players and later other athletes. Athletic trainers began to treat and rehabilitate injuries in order to keep the athletes participating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webber|first=Matt|title=Dropping the Bucket and Sponge|year=2013|publisher=Athletic Training History|location=Prescott, AZ|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The first major text on athletic training and the care of athletic injuries was called Athletic Training (later changed to The Trainer's Bible) written in 1917 by Samuel E. Bilik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prentice|first=William|title=Principles of Athletic Training: A Competency-Based Approach|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages|location=New York, NY|pages=3, 27, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early athletic trainers had "no technical knowledge, their athletic training techniques usually consisted of a rub, the application of some type of counterirritant, and occasionally the prescription of various home remedies and poultices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prentice|first=William|title=Principles of Athletic Training: A Competency-Based Approach|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages|location=New York, NY|pages=3, 27, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1918, Chuck Cramer started the Cramer Chemical Company (now Cramer Products) that produced a line of products used by athletic trainers and began publishing a newsletter in 1932 entitled The First Aider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cramer Sports Med|url=http://www.cramersportsmed.com/resources/first-aider|accessdate=14 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505235217/http://www.cramersportsmed.com/resources/first-aider|archive-date=2012-05-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization named the National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA) was founded in 1938 and folded in 1944. Another NATA was founded in 1950 and still exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webber|first=Matt|title=Dropping the Bucket and Sponge|year=2013|publisher=Athletic Training History|location=Prescott, AZ|pages=487–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first athletic training curriculum approved by NATA was in 1959 and the amount of athletic training programs began to grow throughout colleges and universities in the United States.  In the early development of the major, athletic training was geared more towards prepping the student for teaching at the secondary level, emphasizing on health and physical education.  This program was first introduced at an undergraduate level in 1969 to the schools of Mankato State University, Indiana State University, Lamar University, and the University of New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delforge|first=G.D.|author2=Behnke, R.S.|title=The History and Evolution of Athletic Training Education in the United States|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|year=1999|volume=34|issue=1|pages=53–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years athletic training has evolved to be defined as "health care professionals who specialize in preventing, recognizing, managing, and rehabilitating injures".  During the 1970s the NATA Professional Education Committee formed a list of objectives to define athletic training as a major course of study and to eliminate it as a secondary-level teaching credential.  By June 1982, there were nine NATA-approved graduate athletic training education programs.  On July 1, 1986, this work was used to implement athletic training as a major course of study in at least 10 colleges and universities, and to only start the development of the major in a handful of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delforge|first=G.D.|author2=Behnke, R.S.|title=The History and Evolution of Athletic Training Education in the United States|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|year=1999|volume=34|issue=1|pages=53–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once athletic training was recognized as an allied health profession the process of accrediting programs began.  NATA's Professional Education Committee (PEC) was the first to take on this role of approving athletic training educational programs.  The AMA's Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation (CAHEA) was given the responsibility in 1993 to develop requirements for the programs of entry-level athletic trainers.  At this time all programs had to go through the CAHEA accreditation process.  A year later CAHEA was broken up and replaced with the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP), which then lead the accreditation process.  In 2003 JRC-AT, Joint Review Committee on Athletic Training completely took over the process and became an independent accrediting agency like all other allied health professions had.  Three years later JRC-AT officially became the Committee for Accreditation of Athletic Training Education ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110521070849/http://www.caate.net/imis15/CAATE/Accredited_Programs/Core/directory.aspx?hkey=b91f27b1-2a93-4ed1-b1e6-55cc82ac0fc3 CAATE]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission on Accreditation and Administration of Athletic Training Education Directory |url=http://www.caate.net/imis15/CAATE/Accredited_Programs/Core/directory.aspx?hkey=b91f27b1-2a93-4ed1-b1e6-55cc82ac0fc3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521070849/http://www.caate.net/imis15/CAATE/Accredited_Programs/Core/directory.aspx?hkey=b91f27b1-2a93-4ed1-b1e6-55cc82ac0fc3 |archivedate=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is fully in charge of accrediting athletic training programs in the United States.  NATA produced the NATABOC in 1969 in order to implement a certification process for the profession for an entry-level athletic trainer.  In 1989, became an independent non-profit corporation and soon later changed its name to the Board of Certification ([[Board of Certification, Inc.|BOC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delforge|first=G.D.|author2=Behnke, R.S.|title=The History and Evolution of Athletic Training Education in the United States|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|year=1999|volume=34|issue=1|pages=53–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roles and responsibilities ==

=== Scope ===

The [[Board of Certification, Inc.|Board of Certification]] serves as the national certifying body for athletic trainers, and its Standards of Professional Practice outline the roles and responsibilities of certified athletic trainers. Such practice standards include practice expectations such as, "The Athletic Trainer renders service or treatment under the direction of a physician."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bocatc.org/images/stories/multiple_references/standardsprofessionalpractice.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the setting, limitations and restrictions on what an athletic trainer can do and who can be treated are in large part determined by the regulatory statutes governing professional practice in individual states.&lt;ref&gt;Prentice, W. (2011). Principles of Athletic Training. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Referring ===

"In certain situations, an individual may require treatment from or consultation with a variety of both medical and nonmedical services and personnel other than the athletic trainer."   It is the athletic trainer's responsibility to understand the limits of their scope of practice and recognize situations where a referral is necessary. "A number of support health services may be used including school health services, nurses, physicians, dentists, podiatrists, physician's assistants, physical therapists, strength and conditioning specialists, biomechanists, exercise physiologists, nutritionists, psychologists, massage therapists, occupational therapists, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, chiropractors, orthopedists, prosthesis, equipment personnel, referees, or social workers."&lt;ref&gt;Prentice, W. (2011). Principles of Athletic Training. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NATA code of ethics ===

"The National Athletic Trainers’ Association Code of Ethics states the principles of ethical behavior that should be followed in the practice of athletic training.  It is intended to establish and maintain high standards and professionalism for the athletic training profession."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nata.org/codeofethics&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE) [http://www.caate.net website] provides a list of all the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110521070849/http://www.caate.net/imis15/CAATE/Accredited_Programs/Core/directory.aspx?hkey=b91f27b1-2a93-4ed1-b1e6-55cc82ac0fc3 accredited programs] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission on Accreditation and Administration of Athletic Training Education|url=http://www.uncg.edu/kin/atep/applicationprocess.html|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It provides you with the name of the college, who to contact, and a link to the institution's website. An Undergraduate Athletic Training degree can only be received at an accredited school for athletic training.

=== Entry-level masters programs ===

Although the majority of athletic trainers receive a bachelor's degree in athletic training before taking the Board of Certification Exam (BOC), it is not the only way to receive an education in athletic training.  An entry-level masters program is a two-year program that covers the same material as an undergraduate athletic training degree. Common prerequisite classes are human anatomy, human physiology, kinesiology, biomechanics, exercise physiology, nutrition, and personal health along with a certain number of observation hours completed under the supervision of a certified athletic trainer (ATC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission on Accreditation and Administration of Athletic Training Education|url=http://www.uncg.edu/kin/atep/applicationprocess.html|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Prerequisites can vary by institution so be sure to research the prerequisites for your institutions of interest.  There are 26 accredited entry level masters programs in the U.S.A.  See below for a link to a list of these institutions.

=== Graduate school in athletic training and related fields ===

There are approximately 15 accredited athletic training masters programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prentice|first=William|title=Principles of Athletic Training: A Competency-Based Approach|year=2011|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780073523736|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These programs consist of students who are already certified athletic trainers that want to advance their academic and clinical experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prentice|first=William|title=Principles of Athletic Training: A Competency-Based Approach|year=2011|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780073523736|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;    These are two-year programs which culminate with a Master of Science degree (M.S.) in athletic training.
Graduate programs in athletic training are not always specifically in athletic training, but in a related field.  Some of these fields may include, but are not limited to, kinesiology, biomechanics, sports management, sport and exercise psychology, exercise physiology, health promotion, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Athletic Training Graduate Programs|url=https://www.gradschools.com/programs/physical-occupational-therapy/athletic-training|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    These programs are also two years in length.  While enrolled in one of these programs, the athletic trainer may gain clinical experience and receive a stipend through a make some money by obtaining a graduate assistantship.

=== Graduate assistant position ===

A graduate assistant athletic trainer position is a position in which a graduate athletic training student is able to work as an assistant athletic trainer while taking graduate courses. Graduate assistant athletic trainers are responsible for providing the medical coverage of select teams at the institution where they are working. Responsibilities may vary, but include administering daily medical coverage for selected intercollegiate athletic teams (practice/event); traveling with the assigned team, evaluation and documentation of athletic injuries, administrative responsibilities, serve as Approved Clinical Instructor (ACI) or Clinical Instructor (CI) in a CAATE – accredited ATEP, and other duties as assigned by the head athletic trainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Athletic Trainers’ Association Career Center|url=http://jobs.nata.org/jobs/4697707/?ref=1|accessdate=11 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Other responsibilities may include working at a high school, clinic, teaching, or doing research. Graduate assistant positions are generally about 10-month appointments that are renewable after the first year, and may include additional summer work.

=== Accredited programs ===

Athletic Training programs are evaluated by CAATE to ensure that they follow the standards for Entry-Level Athletic Training Programs. Evaluations may take place every three to seven years depending on the results of the last visit. Successfully completing the CAATE accredited education program is a part of the criteria that determines a candidate's eligibility for the Board of Certification (BOC) examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education: Overview of the Commission|url=http://www.caate.net/imis15/CAATE/About/CAATE/About.aspx?hkey=1b198b36-7205-4b7f-9447-abd3800a3264|accessdate=11 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525154253/http://www.caate.net/imis15/CAATE/About/CAATE/About.aspx?hkey=1b198b36-7205-4b7f-9447-abd3800a3264|archivedate=25 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Certification|url=http://www.bocatc.org/|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==

"The National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA) is the professional membership association for certified athletic trainers and others who support the athletic training profession. Founded in 1950, the NATA has grown to more than 35,000 members worldwide today. The majority of certified athletic trainers choose to be members of the NATA – to support their profession, and to receive a broad array of membership benefits. By joining forces as a group, NATA members can accomplish more for the athletic training profession than they can individually".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATA|url=http://www.nata.org/aboutNATA|accessdate=2013-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the formation of NATA, athletic trainers occupied a somewhat insecure place in the athletic program.  Since that time, as a direct result of the standards and ethics established by NATA, there has been considerable professional advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Prentice, W. (2011). Principles of Athletic Training. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Every year NATA works on behalf of all athletic trainers to enhance health care for both athletic trainers and those who receive care.
   
NATA is the professional organization for Athletic trainers across the nation. Each region of the USA has their own district under NATA but within their area, they have their own agendas and board members. Each district also has a director that serves on the NATA Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATA|url=http://www.nata.org/aboutNATA|accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Athletic Trainers' Association#NATA Districts|There are 10 districts]].

Every state has their own state athletic training association that acts similar to the district associations as they have their own board members. The state associations answer to the district associations and the National Athletic Trainers’ Association. Links to the state associations can be found through the regional websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATA|url=http://www.nata.org/aboutNATA|accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current topics ==

Due to the physicality of athletics and the campaign for healthy well-being, there are issues that become hot topics in the media. Athletic trainers have to continually be aware of changes in laws, position statements of the National Athletic Trainers Association, and institutional policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATA Press Room|url=http://www.nata.org/press-room/news-releases|publisher=NATA|accessdate=2012-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814102739/http://www.nata.org/press-room/news-releases|archivedate=2012-08-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''black armband protest''' was made by [[Zimbabwe]]an cricketers [[Andy Flower]] and [[Henry Olonga]] during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. The pair decided to wear [[black armband]]s to "mourn the death of democracy in Zimbabwe". The protest received condemnation from senior Zimbabwean political figures, and also some senior Zimbabwean cricket figures, but was praised by the international media. The [[International Cricket Council]] deemed that Flower and Olonga had taken a political action, but refused to charge the pair with an offence. Their initial protest was during Zimbabwe's first match of the tournament in [[Harare]], and the pair wore armbands to protest at all of the matches. As a result of the protest, Flower and Olonga were forced to leave Zimbabwe, and both men later settled in the United Kingdom.

=== Planning ===

After Flower had decided to protest, he decided that he wanted Olonga to partner him in the protest, as "one white Zimbabwean and one black one operating together gave the message the most eloquent balance."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Olonga was the first black, and the youngest ever, cricketer to play for Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/08/31/henry.olonga.zimbabwe/| title= Henry Olonga, Zimbabwe's cricketing rebel |publisher=CNN|date= 7 September 2010|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/henry-olonga-he-has-a-love-for-zimbabwe-even-now-but-while-mugabe-is-alive-he-knows-he-cant-return-2034849.html|title= Henry Olonga: He has a love for Zimbabwe even now. But while Mugabe is alive, he knows he can't return|publisher= The Independent| date=25 July 2010|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met up in a news café in [[Harare]] to plan the protest, originally considering withdrawing from the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]], but later deciding to protest instead.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/292618.html| title= Standing up for their principles| publisher= ESPN Cricinfo|date=27 April 2007|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair spoke with lawyer [[David Coltart]], a founding member of the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]].

In the match, Zimbabwe batted first, and the public at the ground were not aware of the protest until the 22nd over, when Flower came out to bat wearing a black armband.&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt; Olonga was also seen wearing a black armband on the Zimbabwe team balcony.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; The crowd of 4,000 at the ground were supportive of the protest, and a number of them made their own black armbands during the match.&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC"/&gt; In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs ([[Duckworth-Lewis method|D/L method]]).&lt;ref name="Wisden" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/65236.html|title=ICC World Cup, 2nd Match: Zimbabwe v Namibia at Harare, Feb 10, 2003|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
[[File:Nasser Hussain.JPG|thumb|right|Former England captain [[Nasser Hussain]], who said Flower and Olonga "have proved to be great men by what they have done."]]

After the match, one man was arrested for wearing a black armband.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/feb/11/cricketworldcup2003.cricketworldcup3|title= Olonga risks his career with political protest| publisher=The Guardian|date=11 February 2015|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Zimbabwe's next{{efn|name=Ex|Excluding the walkover against England}} group stage match against India, nearly 200 spectators wore black armbands, to support the protest.&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt;

Inside Zimbabwe, the reaction was hostile to the players. Zimbabwe's [[Minister of Information]], [[Jonathan Moyo]], called Olonga an "Uncle Tom" who had "a black skin and a white mask".&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cricinfo World Cup No. 8"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wctimeline/content/current/story/825253.html | title=Olonga and Flower make a stand | work=Cricinfo | date=2 February 2015 | accessdate=28 February 2016 | author=Brickhill, Liam}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zanu PF]] information secretary [[Nathan Shamuyarira]] claimed they were forced into it by the British media, and "No true Zimbabwean would have joined in," but "Olonga is not a Zimbabwean, he is a Zambian".&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian events" /&gt; Olonga was charged with treason, an offence punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/olonga-sought-for-treason-1.103157#.VY6CM_lViko| title= Olonga 'sought for treason'| publisher=IOL Sport|date=17 March 2003|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDC leader [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] released a statement in support of the protest. He was charged with treason, although the charge was later dropped.&lt;ref name=BBC2003/&gt; Givemore Makoni, the President of [[Takashinga Cricket Club]] where Olonga played said "It is disgraceful what Henry Olonga and Andy Flower have done. Taking politics on to the playing field is a thing the International Cricket Council and all sports organisations have been trying to avoid," and that "by taking politics on to the field and bringing the game into disrepute Henry appears to have breached Takashinga's code of conduct".&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Olonga was immediately suspended and later sacked by Takashinga Cricket Club.&lt;ref name=BBC2003&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2748899.stm| title= Brave cricketers risk Mugabe's wrath| last=Winter| first=Joseph| work=[[BBC News]]| date=11 March 2003| accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian events"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/mar/17/cricketworldcup2003.cricketworldcup|title= 'I was a cricketer. Now it's time for music'| publisher= The Guardian|date= 17 March 2003|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Mandongo, the President of the [[Zimbabwe Cricket Union]] also condemned the protest, saying "What Flower and Olonga did is very wrong. They have jeopardised our reputation when given this once in a lifetime chance to host the World Cup ... It would be wrong if they wore black armbands again."&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt; They referred the matter to the [[International Cricket Council]], who deemed that they had taken a political action, but refused to charge them with a formal offence. Instead, they released a statement reiterating the apolitical nature of the organisation, and asked the players not to wear black armbands for the rest of the tournament, with the threat of more serious punishment if they continued to wear them.&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian events" /&gt;

The international reaction to the protest was favourable. [[The Times]] sports correspondent called it a "powerful blow for sanity, decency and democracy", whilst [[The Daily Telegraph]]'s [[Donald Trelford]] praised the players and criticised the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] and [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]], saying the players "shine out like diamonds in a pile of mud".&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt; Cricket writer [[Tim de Lisle]] praised the pair, saying that "Together they were responsible for a shining moment in the game's history ... Two strips of black tape, more potent than any logo, breathed life back into the game's battered spirit."&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt; [[England national cricket team|England]] captain [[Nasser Hussain]] said that Flower and Olonga "have proved to be great men by what they have done."&lt;ref name="Guardian events" /&gt; As a result of the protest, Olonga's girlfriend broke up with him, and he received numerous threatening emails and death threats.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Electrical-tape black.jpg|thumb|200px|Insulating tape was used instead of black armbands in the protest.]]

Zimbabwe won their next match against [[England national cricket team|England]] on a walkover, and also beat the [[Netherlands cricket team|Netherlands]], and had a no-result in their final group match against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], which allowed them to qualify for the Super 6 stage of the competition.&lt;ref name="Wisden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WC 2003 Results"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/series/61124.html?template=fixtures| title= Fixtures: Zimbabwe| publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were eliminated in this stage,&lt;ref name="Wisden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WC 2003 Results" /&gt; however this allowed both players to leave Zimbabwe for South Africa.&lt;ref name="Guardian Olonga" /&gt;

Olonga was dropped for 6 matches,{{efn|Including the walkover against England}} with no reason given – some have speculated that he was dropped as a result of the protest, whilst other suggest it was due to poor form.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; Flower on the other hand was considered "undroppable".&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt; To comply with the ICC warning not to wear black armbands, during their next{{efn|name=Ex|Excluding the walkover against England}} group match, Flower and [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|twelfth-man]] Olonga both wore black wristbands, and in subsequent matches, Flower wore white armbands.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; Olonga's only subsequent appearance for Zimbabwe was in their match against Kenya.&lt;ref name="WC 2003 Results" /&gt;

After their final Super Six match, Olonga immediately announced his retirement from international cricket, after 30 Test matches and 50 ODIs.&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard" /&gt; Flower had already previously announced his retirement from international cricket, and had signed for [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]], and [[South Australia cricket team|South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/low/newsid_2860000/newsid_2863100/2863151.stm| title= Flower to play in Australia|publisher=BBC Sport|date= 19 March 2003|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olonga, had not planned what to do after the protest, as he "had in my own naivety thought that I could carry on in Zimbabwe – maybe my career would come to an end but I could still live there."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In the end, he was kicked off the team bus,&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt; and travelled to [[Johannesburg]], where he stayed for a month, before being granted a work permit to play for Lashings Cricket Club in England.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent2004/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Olonga" /&gt; He was subsequently granted asylum in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-10-09/olonga-granted-extended-refuge-in-britain/1490854| title= Olonga granted extended refuge in Britain|publisher=ABC|date=9 October 2003|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither player has since returned to Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Olonga" /&gt;

== Legacy ==

Both players were awarded an Honorary Life Membership of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], an honour usually only given to players who have retired from [[first-class cricket]].&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; In 2013, the [[BBC]] recorded a special radio programme commemorating 10 years of the protest.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

During the annual [[Boston Marathon]] on April 15, 2013, two homemade pressure cooker bombs detonated 12 seconds and {{convert|210|yd|m}} apart at 2:49&amp;nbsp;p.m., near the finish line of the race, killing three people and injuring several hundred others, including 16 who lost limbs.&lt;ref name="NYDN-5/15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe-number-injured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn-what-we-know" /&gt;

Three days later, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) released images of two suspects,&lt;ref name="Clark Estes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-5" /&gt; who were later identified as [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]]-American brothers [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]] and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]]. They killed an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department#Shooting by Boston Marathon bombing suspects|MIT policeman]], kidnapped a man in his car, and had a shootout with the police in nearby [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], during which two officers were severely injured, one of whom died a year later. Tamerlan was shot several times, and his brother ran him over while escaping in the stolen car; Tamerlan died soon after.

An unprecedented [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] for Dzhokhar ensued on April 19, with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-6" /&gt; residents of Watertown and surrounding communities were asked to stay indoors, and the transportation system and most businesses and public places closed.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoZ2-1" /&gt; Around 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his backyard.&lt;ref&gt;"Two unnamed officials say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, did not have a gun when he was captured Friday in a Watertown, Mass. backyard. Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said earlier that shots were fired from inside the boat." The Associated Press Wednesday, April 24, 2013, 8:42 PM.&lt;/ref&gt; He was shot and wounded by police before being taken into custody.&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;

During questioning, Dzhokhar said that he and his brother were motivated by extremist [[Islamism|Islamist]] beliefs and the [[Iraq War|wars in Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups, and that he was following his brother's lead. He said they learned to build explosive devices from an [[Inspire (magazine)|online magazine]] of the [[al-Qaeda]] affiliate in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-8" /&gt; He also said they had intended to travel to [[New York City]] to bomb [[Times Square]]. On April 8, 2015, he was convicted of 30 charges, including use of a [[Weapon of mass destruction#Criminal (civilian)|weapon of mass destruction]] and malicious destruction of property resulting in death.&lt;ref name="DOJ affidavit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Boston Marathon bomber found guilty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-32225787|accessdate=April 8, 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, he was sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/what-happened-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-update-boston-marathon-bomber-sentenced-death-2526052|title=What Happened To Dzhokhar Tsarnaev?

The [[2013 Boston Marathon|117th annual Boston Marathon]] was run on [[Patriots' Day]], April 15, 2013. At {{Nowrap |2:49&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]}} {{Nowrap|(18:49 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])}}, two bombs detonated about {{convert|210|yd|m}} apart at the finish line on Boylston Street near [[Copley Square]].&lt;ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe-investigation-continues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt; The first exploded outside [[Marathon Sports (retailer)|Marathon Sports]] at 671–673 Boylston Street at 2:49:43&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /&gt; At the time of the first explosion, the race clock at the finish line showed 04:09:43,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-13" /&gt;{{snd}}the elapsed time since the Wave 3 start{{explain|date=July 2018}} at 10:40&amp;nbsp;a.m. The second bomb exploded at 2:49:57&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref name="globe-investigation-continues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt; about 14 seconds later and one block farther west at 755 [[Boylston Street]].&lt;ref name="cnn-what-we-know" /&gt; The explosions took place nearly three hours after the winning runner crossed the finish line,&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt; but with more than 5,700 runners yet to finish.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-11" /&gt;

Windows on adjacent buildings were blown out but there was no structural damage.&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /&gt; Runners continued to cross the line until 2:57&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-14" /&gt;

== Casualties and initial response ==
Rescue workers and medical personnel, on hand as usual for the marathon, gave aid as additional police, fire, and medical units were dispatched,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-29" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-30" /&gt; including from surrounding cities as well as private ambulances from all over the state. The explosions killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others, who were treated at 27 local hospitals. At least 14 people required amputations, with some suffering [[traumatic amputation]]s as a direct result of the blasts.&lt;ref name="globe-number-injured" /&gt;

Police, following emergency plans, diverted arriving runners to [[Boston Common]] and [[Kenmore Square]]. The nearby [[The Lenox Hotel|Lenox Hotel]] and other buildings were evacuated.&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt; Police closed a 15-block area around the blast site; this was reduced to a 12-block crime scene on April 16.&lt;ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters_McLaughlin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt; Boston police commissioner [[Edward F. Davis]] recommended that people stay off the streets.&lt;ref name="NYT-marathon-blasts" /&gt;

Dropped bags and packages, abandoned as their owners fled from the blasts,  increased uncertainty as to the possible presence of more bombs.&lt;ref name="globe_explosions_rock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-31" /&gt; There were false reports of more bombs.&lt;ref name="Clark Estes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN_Levs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-32" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-33" /&gt; An unrelated electrical fire at the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|John F. Kennedy Presidential Library]] in nearby [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] was initially feared to be a bomb.

[[File:2013 Boston Marathon explosions aftermath emergency services.jpg|thumb|left|Emergency services at work after the bombing]]
The airspace over Boston was restricted, and departures halted from Boston's [[Logan International Airport]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-35" /&gt; Some local transit service was halted as well.&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt;

The [[Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency]] suggested people trying to contact those in the vicinity use text messaging instead of voice calls because of crowded cellphone lines.&lt;ref name="NBCNews" /&gt; Cellphone service in Boston was congested but remained in operation, despite some local media reports stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

The [[American Red Cross]] helped concerned friends and family receive information about runners and casualties.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-37" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ARC" /&gt; The [[Boston Police Department]] also set up a [[helpline]] for people concerned about relatives or acquaintances to contact and a line for people to provide information.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-38" /&gt; [[Google Person Finder]] activated their disaster service under ''Boston Marathon Explosions'' to log known information about missing people as a publicly viewable file.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-39" /&gt;

Due to the closure of several hotels near the blast zone, a number of visitors were left with nowhere to stay; many Boston-area residents opened their homes to them.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-40" /&gt;

== Investigation ==
[[File:Pressure cooker bomb.jpg|thumb|This [[pressure cooker]] fragment was part of one of the explosive devices.]]
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] led the investigation, assisted by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[National Counterterrorism Center]], and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]],&lt;ref name="Hosenball" /&gt; and they named two official suspects.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-45" /&gt; It was initially believed by some that [[North Korea]] was behind the attack after escalating tensions and threats with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/north-korea-blamed-for-boston-bombings-2013-4?IR=T&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/north-korea-denies-any-link-boston-marathon-bombs-says-it-still-may-strike-us-1211721&lt;/ref&gt;

United States government officials stated that there had been no intelligence reports suggesting such an attack. Representative [[Peter T. King|Peter King]], a member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]], said: "I received two top secret briefings last week on the current threat levels in the United States, and there was no evidence of this at all."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-46" /&gt;

The father of the two suspects claimed that the FBI had been watching his family, and that they questioned his sons in Cambridge, Massachusetts five times in relation to possible explosions on the streets of Boston.{{explain|reason=possible explosions?|date=July 2018}}&lt;ref name="AutoLC-47" /&gt;

[[File:Tsarnaev Fireworks.jpg|thumb|left|Emptied fireworks from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's backpack, found in a landfill near the UMass Dartmouth campus]]
Evidence found near the blast sites included bits of metal, nails, ball bearings,&lt;ref name="McLaughlin" /&gt; black nylon pieces from a backpack,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-131" /&gt; remains of an electronic circuit board, and wiring.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lister" /&gt; A [[pressure cooker]] lid was found on a nearby rooftop.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-49" /&gt; Both of the [[improvised explosive device]]s were [[pressure cooker bomb]]s manufactured by the bombers.&lt;ref name="abc-pressure-cooker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-51" /&gt; Authorities confirmed that the brothers used bomb-making instructions found in [[Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]]'s ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="la-times-suspect-describes-plot" /&gt; After the suspects were identified, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that Tamerlan purchased [[fireworks]] from a fireworks store in [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="AutoQU-2" /&gt;

On April 19, the FBI, [[West New York]] Police Department, and [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] Sheriff's Department seized computer equipment from the apartment of the Tsarnaevs' sister in [[West New York, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-52" /&gt; On April 24, investigators reported that they had reconstructed the bombs, and believed that they had been triggered by remote controls used for toy cars.&lt;ref name="la-times-bombs-triggered" /&gt;

=== Release of suspect photos ===
[[Jeff Bauman]] was immediately adjacent to one of the bombs and lost both legs; he wrote while in the hospital: "Bag, saw the guy, looked right at me".&lt;ref name="Bauman evidence" /&gt; He later gave a detailed description which enabled the photo to be identified and circulated quickly.&lt;ref name="Bauman evidence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-54" /&gt;

At 5:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. on April 18, the FBI released images of two suspects carrying backpacks, asking the public's help in identifying them.&lt;ref name="FBI18AprSuspectPics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI plea" /&gt; The FBI said that they were doing this in part to limit harm to people wrongly identified by news reports and on social-media.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-175" /&gt;
As seen on video, the suspects stayed to observe the chaos after the explosions, then walked away casually. The public sent authorities a deluge of photographs and videos, which were scrutinized by both authorities and online public [[social networking service|social networks]].&lt;ref name="FBI plea" /&gt;

=== MIT shooting and carjacking ===
[[File:Scenes and approximate times of events of April 18-19.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|left|Scenes and approximate times of events of April 18–19]]
A few hours after the photos were released, the Tsarnaev brothers shot Sean A. Collier of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department]] six times&lt;ref name="admits" /&gt; in an attempt to steal his gun, which they could not get out because of the holster's retention system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police believe Tsarnaev brothers killed officer for his gun|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57581048/police-believe-tsarnaev-brothers-killed-officer-for-his-gun/|publisher=CBS News|date=April 23, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collier, aged 27, was seated in his police car near the [[Stata Center]] (Building 32) on the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] campus.&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lowery" /&gt; He died soon after.&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-58" /&gt;

The brothers then [[carjacking|carjacked]] a [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] [[SUV]] in the [[Allston-Brighton]] neighborhood of Boston. Tamerlan took the owner, Chinese national Dun "Danny" Meng&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/boston-marathon-bombing-jurors-see-dramatic-video-of-carjack-victims-escape/|title=Boston bombing jurors see dramatic video of carjack victim's escape|agency=CBS/[[Associated Press|AP]] | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=March 12, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{zh|c=孟盾}})&lt;ref&gt;Chinese name from: {{cite web|url=http://ny.uschinapress.com/weekends/2017/01-13/111620.html|title=《爱国者日》上映 再现波马爆炸案 留学生孟盾事迹搬...|publisher=''[[The China Press]]''|date=2017-01-13|accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, hostage and told him that he was responsible for the Boston bombing and for killing a police officer.&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt; Dzhokhar followed them in the green Honda, later joining them in the Mercedes-Benz. Interrogation later revealed that the brothers "decided spontaneously" that they wanted to go to New York and bomb [[Times Square]].&lt;ref name=Gorman /&gt;

The Tsarnaev brothers forced Meng to use his [[ATM card]]s to obtain $800 in cash.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPost04192013" /&gt; They transferred objects to the Mercedes-Benz and one brother followed it in their Honda Civic,&lt;ref name="wsjdetails" /&gt; for which an [[all-points bulletin]] was issued. While the Tsarnaev brothers stopped at a [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] gas station, Meng escaped and ran across the street to the [[Mobil]] gas station, asking the clerk to call 911.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoZ2-11" /&gt; His cell phone remained in the vehicle, allowing the police to [[Mobile phone tracking|focus their search]] on Watertown.&lt;ref name="cnnpol" /&gt;

=== Watertown shootout ===
Shortly after midnight on April 19, [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] police officer Joseph Reynolds identified the brothers in the [[Honda]] Civic and the stolen SUV. A gunfight followed between the brothers and police arriving at the scene on the 100 block of Laurel St.&lt;ref name="captured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times Standoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Watertown firefight, Globe" /&gt; An estimated 200 to 300 rounds of ammunition were fired and at least one further bomb and several "crude [[grenade]]s" were thrown.&lt;ref name="Watertown firefight, Globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-65" /&gt;

According to Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau, the brothers had an "[[arsenal]] of guns."&lt;ref name="Tucson Citizen" /&gt; Tamerlan ran out of ammunition and threw his empty pistol at Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, who tackled him with help from Sergeant John MacLellan.&lt;ref name="DeWitt2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeWitt|first1=Vincent|title=Watertown Mass.

David Henneberry, a Watertown resident outside the search area, noticed that the tarp was loose on his parked boat on the evening of April 19, two hours after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-83" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCboat" /&gt; He then saw a body lying inside the boat in a pool of blood.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-84" /&gt; Authorities surrounded the boat and a police helicopter verified movement through a [[thermal imaging]] device.&lt;ref name="captured" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-85" /&gt; The figure inside the boat started poking at the tarp, and police shot at the boat.&lt;ref name="AutoG4-1" /&gt;

According to Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis and Watertown Police Chief Deveau, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was shooting at police from inside the boat, "exchanging fire for an hour".&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/19/suspect-in-custody-newspaper-says/2095845/ |access-date=April 20, 2013 |title=As manhunt ends, new questions emerge in Boston bombings |author=Johnson, Kevin |work=USA Today |date=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent report indicated that the firing lasted for a shorter time.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/officials-boston-suspect-had-no-firearm-when-barrage-of-bullets-hit-hiding-place/2013/04/24/376fc8a0-ad18-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story.html|title=Officials: Boston suspect had no firearm when barrage of bullets hit hiding place|first1=Sari|last1=Horwitz|first2=Peter|last2=Finn|date=April 24, 2013|publisher=|access-date=October 15, 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspect was found to have no weapon when he was captured.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-87" /&gt; He was arrested at 8:42&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; and taken to [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], where he was listed in [[Medical state#Serious|critical condition]]&lt;ref name="AutoLC-88" /&gt; with gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs, and hand.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-89" /&gt;

== Legal proceedings ==

=== Interrogation ===
United States Senators [[Kelly Ayotte]], [[Saxby Chambliss]], [[Lindsey Graham]], and [[John McCain]], and Representative [[Peter T. King]] suggested that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, should be tried as an [[unlawful combatant|unlawful enemy combatant]] rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining [[Assistance of Counsel Clause|legal counsel]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-92" /&gt; Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]], and would jeopardize the prosecution.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-94" /&gt; The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant.&lt;ref name="CNN220130423" /&gt;

Dzhokhar was questioned for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating with them on the night of April 22 after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a [[Miranda warning]].&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-103" /&gt; Dzhokhar had not previously been given a Miranda warning, as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's [[public safety exception]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-90" /&gt; This raised doubts whether his statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- this article's misspelling of "Dzhokhar" is [sic] --&gt;{{cite news|title=The Right to Remain Silent: Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the Public Safety Exception, and Miranda in a post-911 World|url=http://www.marathonlawdenver.com/2013/04/22/dzokharpublicsafetyexceptionmiranda/|newspaper=Marathon Law|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613153900/http://www.marathonlawdenver.com/2013/04/22/dzokharpublicsafetyexceptionmiranda/|date=April 22, 2013|archivedate=June 13, 2013|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Andrew|title=Tsarnaev Without Tears: The Legal Way Forward|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/tsarnaev-without-tears-the-legal-way-forward/275160/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=April 20, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|title=Why Should I Care That No One's Reading Dzhokhar Tsarnaev His Miranda Rights?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2013/04/dzhokhar_tsarnaev_and_miranda_rights_the_public_safety_exception_and_terrorism.html|newspaper=Slate|date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charges and detention ===

On April 22, 2013, formal criminal charges were brought against Tsarnaev in the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]] during a bedside hearing while he was hospitalized. He was charged with use of a [[weapon of mass destruction]] and with malicious destruction of property resulting in death.&lt;ref name="DOJ affidavit" /&gt; Some of the charges carry potential sentences of [[life imprisonment]] or the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]].&lt;ref name="USC2332" /&gt; Tsarnaev was judged to be awake, mentally competent, and lucid, and he responded to most questions by nodding. The judge asked him whether he was able to afford an attorney and he said no; he was represented by the [[Federal Public Defender's Office|Federal Public Defender]]'s office.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-96" /&gt; On April 26, Dzhohkar Tsarnaev was moved from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to the [[Federal Medical Center, Devens|Federal Medical Center]] at [[Fort Devens]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} from Boston.

=== Trial and sentencing ===

Jury selection began on January 5, 2015 and was completed on March 3, with a jury consisting of eight men and ten women (including six alternates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/02/20/opening-statements-tsarnaev-trial-could-begin-early-march-official-says/4TZWH4KMZY2nXaHLPywTMN/story.html|title=Opening statements in Tsarnaev trial could begin in early March, official says – Metro – The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began on March 4 with Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb describing the bombing and painting Dzhokhar as "a soldier in a holy war against Americans" whose motive was "reaching paradise".

Defense attorney [[Judy Clarke]] admitted that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had placed the second bomb and was present at the murder of Sean Collier, the carjacking of Dun Meng, and the Watertown shootout, but she emphasized the influence that his older brother had on him, portraying him as a follower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite proceedings|chapter-url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1681442/tsarnaev-dzkokhar-trial-transcript-3-4-2015-clarke.pdf |title=United States v.

== Motives and backgrounds of Tsarnaev brothers ==

=== Motives ===
According to FBI interrogators, Dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by Islamic beliefs but "were not connected to any known terrorist groups", instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by [[al-Qaeda]] affiliates in Yemen.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-8" /&gt; They further alleged that "[Dzhokhar and] his brother considered suicide attacks and striking [the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular] on the Fourth of July;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boston Plotters Said to Initially Target July 4 for Attack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/03/us/Boston-bombing-suspects-planned-july-fourth-attack.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 2, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015|first1=Eric|last1=Schmitt|first2=Mark|last2=Mazzetti|first3=Michael S.|last3=Schmidt|first4=Scott|last4=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately decided to use pressure cooker bombs (capable of remote detonation) and other IEDs."

Dzhokhar said that he and his brother wanted to defend Islam from the U.S., accusing the U.S. of conducting the [[Iraq War]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] against Muslims.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN220130423" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoG4-3" /&gt; A CBS report revealed that Dzhokhar had scrawled a note with a marker on the interior wall of the boat where he was hiding; the note stated that the bombings were "retribution for U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq", and called the Boston victims "[[collateral damage]]", "in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world."&lt;ref name="cbs20130516" /&gt;&lt;ref name="consortium_mcgovern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consortiumnews.com/2013/05/17/boston-suspects-writing-on-the-wall/|title=Boston Suspect’s Writing on the Wall|work=consortiumnews.com|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the note were later used in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=CBS Local Boston|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/03/10/jury-in-boston-bombing-trial-sees-photos-of-writing-in-boat/|accessdate=March 12, 2017|title=Boston Marathon Bombing Trial Jury Sees Photos Of Tsarnaev Boat Note|date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT20130516&gt;{{cite news|title=Note by Boston Bombing Suspect Sheds Light on Motive, Officials Say|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/us/boston-bombing-developments.html|newspaper=The New York Times | first1=Scott|last1=Shane|first2=Ellen|last2=Barry|date=May 16, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student at the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] with a major in [[marine biology]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-116" /&gt; He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on September 11, 2012.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-117" /&gt; Tamerlan's boxing coach reported to NBC that the young brother was greatly affected by Tamerlan and admired him.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-118" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-119" /&gt;

Tamerlan was previously connected to [[2011 Waltham triple murder|the triple homicide]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], on the evening of September 11, 2011, but he was not a suspect at the time.&lt;ref name=probe&gt;{{cite news|url=http://boston.com/metrodesk/2013/04/22/police-probe-possible-link-between-marathon-bomber-and-unsolved-triple-homicide-waltham/T6MgaX0lur7plZrGj0HsvO/story.html|first=Michael|last=Rezendes|title=Police probe possible link between Marathon bomber and unsolved triple homicide in Waltham|work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=April 22, 2013|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/boston-bombing-brings-twist-cold-murder-case/story?id=19063282&amp;page=2#.UYgiLLWkoXE |title=Boston Bombing Brings Twist to Cold Murder Case |publisher=ABC News |date=April 29, 2013 |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brendan Mess]], [[Erik Weissman]], and [[Raphael Teken]] were murdered in Mess's apartment.

Some analysts claim that the Tsarnaev's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is a radical extremist and supporter of jihad who influenced her sons' behavior.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto9P-5" /&gt; This prompted the Russian government to warn the U.S. government on two occasions about the family's behavior. Both Tamerlan and his mother were placed on a terrorism watch list about 18 months before the bombing took place.&lt;ref name="AutoQU-8" /&gt;

== Other arrests, detentions, and prosecutions ==

=== People detained and released ===
On April 15, several people who were near the scene of the blast were taken into custody and questioned about the bombing, including a Saudi man whom police stopped as he was walking away from the explosion; they detained him when some of his responses made them uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-120" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-121" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-122" /&gt; Law enforcement searched his residence in a Boston suburb, and the man was found to have no connection to the attack.

On the night of April 18, two men riding in a taxi in the vicinity of the shootout were arrested and released shortly thereafter when police determined that they were not involved in the Marathon attacks.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-124" /&gt; Another man was arrested several blocks from the site of the shootout and was forced to [[Strip search|strip naked]] by police who feared that he might have concealed explosives. He was released that evening after a brief investigation determined that he was an innocent bystander.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-125" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-126" /&gt;

=== Dias Kadyrbayev, Azamat Tazhayakov, and Robel Phillipos ===

==== Personal backgrounds ====
Robel Phillipos (19) was a U.S. citizen of [[Ethiopian American|Ethiopian descent]] living in Cambridge who was arrested and faced with charges of knowingly [[making false statements]] to police.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA.Friend"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/01/boston-marathon-bombings-tsarnaev-phillipos/2127469/|title=Bomb suspect's friend Robel Phillipos: Who is he?|last=Winter|first=Michael|date=May 1, 2013|work=[[USA Today]] | accessdate=January 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from high school in 2011 with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-6" /&gt;
Dias Kadyrbayev (19) and Azamat Tazhayakov (20) were natives of [[Kazakhstan]] living in the U.S.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-128" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoQU-10" /&gt; They were Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's roommates in an off-campus housing complex in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] at which Tsarnaev had sometimes stayed.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;

Phillipos, Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov, and Tsarnaev entered the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth]] in the fall of 2011 and knew each other well. After seeing photos of Tsarnaev on television, the three men traveled to his dorm room where they retrieved a backpack and laptop belonging to Tsarnaev. The backpack was discarded, but police recovered it and its contents in a nearby New Bedford landfill on April 26. During interviews, the men initially denied visiting the dorm room but later admitted their actions.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;

==== Arrests and legal proceedings ====
Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were arrested by police at the off-campus housing complex during the night of April 18–19. An unidentified girlfriend of one of the men was also arrested,&lt;ref name="AutoLC-127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-128" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoQU-10" /&gt; but all three were soon released.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were re-arrested in New Bedford on April 20 and held on immigration-related violations. They appeared before a federal [[immigration judge]] on May 1 and were charged with overstaying their [[student visa]]s.&lt;ref name="AutoQU-11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-129" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-130" /&gt; That same day, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were charged criminally with:

{{Quote |willfully conspir(ing) with each other to commit an offense against the United States… by knowingly destroying, concealing, and covering up objects belonging to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, namely, a backpack containing fireworks and a laptop computer, with the intent to impede, obstruct, and influence the criminal investigation of the Marathon bombing.&lt;ref name="AutoQU-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoQU-13" /&gt;}}

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were indicted by a [[Grand juries in the United States|federal grand jury]] on August 8, 2013 on charges of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to [[Obstruction of justice|obstruct justice]] for helping Dzhokhar Tsarnaev dispose of a laptop computer, fireworks, and a backpack after the bombing.

Tazhayakov pleaded not guilty and went to trial, arguing that "Kadyrbayev was the mastermind behind destroying the evidence and that Tazhayakov only 'attempted obstruction.'" Jurors returned a guilty verdict against him, however, and he was sentenced to 42 months in prison in June 2015, which equated to three and a half years. Judge [[Douglas Woodlock]] gave a lighter sentence to Tazahayakov than to Kadyrbayev, who was viewed as more culpable.&lt;ref name="McMahoSargent" /&gt; Tazhayakov was released in May 2016 and subsequently deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/05/16/tsarnaev-friend-released-from-prison/1WbAvRNlmSjPdhjDTUBc9K/story.html|title=Tsarnaev friend to be released from prison|last=Valencia|first=Milton|date=May 17, 2016|work=The Boston Globe|access-date=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillipos was arrested and faced charges of knowingly [[making false statements]] to police.&lt;ref name="businessinsider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA.Friend" /&gt; He was released on $100,000 bail and placed under house confinement with an [[ankle monitor]].&lt;ref name="Auto9P-6" /&gt; He was convicted on October 28, 2014, on two charges of lying about being in Tsarnaev's dorm room.

=== Khairullozhon Matanov ===
A federal indictment was unsealed against Khairullozhon Matanov on May 30, 2014, charging him with "one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation." Matanov bought dinner for the two Tsarnaev brothers 40 minutes after the bombing.  After the Tsarnaev brothers' photos were released to the public, Matanov viewed the photos on the CNN and FBI websites before attempting to reach Dzhokhar, and then tried to give away his cell phone and delete hundreds of documents from his computer. Prosecutors said that Matanov attempted to mislead investigators about the nature of his relationship with the brothers and to conceal that he shared their philosophy of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/30/justice/boston-marathon-bombings-charges/|title=Massachusetts man charged with obstructing Boston bombings probe|first=Jason|last=Hanna|first2=Mariano|last2=Castillo|date=May 30, 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LySentenceJune"&gt;{{cite news|first=Laura|last=Ly|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/18/us/tsarnaev-friend-sentence/|title=Friend of Boston marathon bombers gets 30-month sentence|work=CNN|date=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matanov was originally from Kyrgyzstan. He came to the U.S. in 2010 on a [[student visa]], and later claimed asylum. He attended [[Quincy College]] for two years before dropping out to become a taxicab driver. He was living in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] at the time of his arrest, and was a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.&lt;ref name="LySentenceJune" /&gt;

The One Fund Boston was established by [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Deval Patrick]] and Boston mayor [[Thomas Menino]] to make monetary distributions to bombing victims.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trumbull" /&gt; The [[Boston Strong]] concert at the TD Garden in Boston on May 30, 2013 benefitted the One Fund, which ultimately received more than $69.8 million in donations.&lt;ref name=NECN&gt;{{cite web|title=$212K donation made to One Fund Boston|url=http://www.necn.com/09/12/13/212K-donation-made-to-One-Fund-Boston/landing.html?blockID=852181|publisher=NECN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after the bombing, [[crowd funding]] websites&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[GoFundMe]], [[GiveForward]], [[FundRazr]], [[YouCaring]], and [[Fundly]]&lt;/ref&gt; received more than 23,000 pledges promising more than $2 million for the victims, their families, and others affected by the bombing.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-42" /&gt; The Israel Trauma Coalition for Response and Preparedness sent six psychologists and specialists from [[Israel]] to help Boston emergency responders, government administrators, and community people develop post-terrorist attack recovery strategies.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-7" /&gt;

Numerous sporting events, concerts, and other public entertainment were postponed or cancelled in the days following the bombing.&lt;ref name="BostonSports-WashTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-133" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonSports-WashTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-134" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Nazareth host" /&gt; The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] public transit system was under heavy National Guard and police presence and it was shut down a second time April 19 during the manhunt.&lt;ref name="lowery" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan and Taxis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Powers" /&gt;

In the days after the bombing, makeshift memorials began to spring up along the cordoned-off area surrounding Boylston Street. The largest was located on Arlington Street, the easternmost edge of the barricades, starting with flowers, tokens, and T-shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://imgur.com/4JRa9gt | title=Photograph Taken From the Arlington Shrine on April 16, 2013|accessdate = April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/ci_23040059/grit-and-grief-at-makeshift-boston-marathon-memorial | work=Sentinel &amp; Enterprise | title=Grit and grief at makeshift Boston Marathon memorial | date= April 16, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/04/17/update-downtown-boston | work=WBUR | title=An Update From Downtown Boston | date= April 17, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.wbur.org/2013/04/17/photos-boylston-st-after-the-blasts | work=WBUR | title=Photos: Boylston Street After The Blasts | date= April 17, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://photos.masslive.com/republican/2013/04/boston_15jpg.html | work=Mass Live | title=People gather at makeshift memorial near scene of Boston Marathon bombing | date=April 18, 2013 | accessdate=April 11, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113819/http://photos.masslive.com/republican/2013/04/boston_15jpg.html | archive-date=April 2, 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the Makeshift Memorial located in Copley Square was taken down and the memorial objects located there were moved to the archives in  West Roxbury for cleaning, fumigation, and archiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/06/21/makeshift-memorial-marathon-bombing-victims-taken-down-moved-city-archives/7DZAxM2iDyAnDgxvjLukiN/story.html | work=Boston.com | title=Makeshift memorial to Marathon bombing victims to be taken down, moved to city archives | date=June 21, 2013 &lt;!-- 5:37 PM --&gt;  |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after the bombing, The Boston Globe reported all of the items from the memorials were being housed in a climate controlled environment, free of charge, by the storage company, [[Iron Mountain (company)|Iron Mountain]] in [[Northborough, Massachusetts]]. Some of the items are also being stored in Boston's city archives in [[West Roxbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramos |first=Nestor |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/04/14/fragments-tragedy-and-our-best-selves/gtnbkn7MiT91kYzFL1MBOL/story.html |title=Fragments of tragedy, and of our best selves |work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=2018-04-14 |accessdate=2018-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boston University]] established a scholarship in honor of Lü Lingzi, a student who died in the bombing.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-135" /&gt; [[University of Massachusetts Boston]] did the same in honor of alumna and bombing victim Krystle Campell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.umb.edu/the_university/chancellor/communications/krystle_campbell_scholarships_awarded_to_umass_students|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510170308/https://www.umb.edu/the_university/chancellor/communications/krystle_campbell_scholarships_awarded_to_umass_students|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2017-05-10|title=Krystle Campbell Scholarships Awarded to UMass Students – University of Massachusetts Boston|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[MIT]] also established a scholarship and erected a sculpture (unveiled on April 29, 2015), both in memory of MIT Police officer Sean Collier.

One study conducted by the Institute for Public Service at [[Suffolk University]] in Boston, Massachusetts, records the mental health and emotional response of various survivors, for three years following the bombing. In doing so, it reviews the kinds of aid that were available in local hospitals and gives advice as to how a person or community may be healed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=3e680122-e67a-4fed-8ffc-a8b9572a7c67%40sessionmgr4007|title=The mental health response to the Boston bombing: A three-year review|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This study also mentions that after realizing the under coverage of people in the city being killed or injured on a daily basis, the city of Boston "applied for and received a grant from The Rockefeller Foundation to be part of their 100 resilient cities network and to develop a cross cutting resilience strategy".

However, there was rising [[anti-Muslim sentiment]] online and locally in the weeks following the bombing, causing distress in the local [[Muslim]] community and leaving some afraid of going out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhattacharyya|first1=Sriya|last2=Ashby|first2=Kimberly M.|last3=Goodman|first3=Lisa A.|title=Social Justice Beyond the Classroom|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|date=26 September 2014|volume=42|issue=8|pages=1136–1158|doi=10.1177/0011000014551420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National ===
President [[Barack Obama]] addressed the nation after the attack.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-137" /&gt; He said that the perpetrators were still unknown, but that the government would "get to the bottom of this" and that those responsible "will feel the full weight of justice".&lt;ref name="AutoLC-138" /&gt; He ordered flags to half-staff until April 20 on all federal buildings as "a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-140" /&gt;

Moments of silence were held at various events across the country, including at the openings of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], [[NASDAQ]], and [[New York Mercantile Exchange|NYMEX]] on the day after the bombing.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; Numerous special events were held, including marathons and other runs.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-142" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-143" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20130421/NEWS06/304210177/lansing-marathon-boston-bombing|title=Lansing Marathon runners hit the street to salute Boston|work=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onerunforboston.org|title=One Run For Boston 2|work=One Run for Boston|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International ===
[[File:US flag flying at half mast in Milan, 2013.JPG|thumb|upright|Flag flying at half staff at the American consulate in [[Milan]], Italy]]
The bombing was denounced and condolences were offered by many international leaders as well as leading figures from international sport. Security measures were increased worldwide in the wake of the attack.&lt;ref name="oregon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-144" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph_wl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SI_1" /&gt;

In China, users posted condolence messages on [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]] in response to the death of Lü Lingzi.&lt;ref name="newyorkFan" /&gt; Chris Buckley of ''The New York Times'' said "Ms. Lu's death gave a melancholy face to the attraction that America and its colleges exert over many young Chinese."&lt;ref name="Buckley" /&gt; Laurie Burkitt of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said "Ms. Lu's death resonates with many in China" due to the [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-146" /&gt;

Organizers of the [[2013 London Marathon|London Marathon]], which was held six days after the Boston bombing, reviewed security arrangements for their event. Hundreds of extra police officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, and a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets. Runners in London observed a 30-second silence in respect for the victims of Boston shortly before the race began, and many runners wore black ribbons on their vests. Organizers also pledged to donate US$3 to a fund for Boston Marathon victims for every person who finished the race.&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-147" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-148" /&gt;

Organizers of the 2013 [[Vancouver Sun Run]], which was held on April 21, 2013, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Jamie Pitblado, vice-president of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province, said the money would go to One Fund Boston, an official charity that collected donations for the victims and their families. Sun Run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. There were over 48,000 participants, many dressed in blue and yellow (Boston colors) with others wearing Boston Red Sox caps.&lt;ref name="Auto9P-8" /&gt;

[[Petr Gandalovic]], ambassador of the Czech Republic, released a statement after noticing much confusion on Facebook and Twitter between his nation and the Chechen Republic. "The Czech Republic and Chechnya are two very different entities – the Czech Republic is a Central European country; Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-152" /&gt;

Security was also stepped up in Singapore in response to online threats made on attacking several locations in the city-state and the Singapore Marathon in December. Two suspects were investigated and one was eventually arrested for making false bomb threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/singapore-hit-by-bomb-hoaxes-after-boston-attacks/ |title=Singapore Hit By Bomb Hoaxes After Boston Attacks|accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russian reaction ====
The [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] said special attention would be paid to security at upcoming international sports events in Russia, including the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-149" /&gt; According to the Russian embassy in the U.S., President [[Vladimir Putin]] condemned the bombing as a "barbaric crime" and "stressed that the Russian Federation will be ready, if necessary, to assist in the U.S. authorities' investigation."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-150" /&gt; He urged closer cooperation of security services with Western partners&lt;ref name="AutoLC-151" /&gt; but other Russian authorities and mass media blamed the U.S. authorities for negligence as they warned the U.S. of the Tsarnaevs.&lt;ref name="Russia-could"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2013/04/26/mnenie-site.html |script-title = ru:Россия могла предотвратить теракт в Бостоне |trans-title=Russia could have prevented a terrorist attack in Boston|author=Shestakov, Yevgeny|work=Rossiyskaya Gazeta|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate= April 11, 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover Russian authorities and mass media since the spring of 2014 blame the United States for politically motivated false information about the lack of response from Russian authorities after subsequent U.S. requests.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} As proof a letter from the Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) was shown to the members of an official U.S. Congressional delegation to Moscow during their visit. This letter with information about Tsarnaev (including his biography details, connections and phone number) had been sent from the FSB to the FBI and CIA during March 2011.&lt;ref name="Russia-blame-again"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/boston_terror/20140410/1003329322.html |script-title = ru:Эксперт: обвинения США по делу Царнаева политически мотивированы|trans-title=Expert: U.S. blame around Tsarnaev case are politically motivated|author=Korotchenko, Igor|work=RIA Novosti |date=April 10, 2014|accessdate= April 11, 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican U.S. Senators [[Saxby Chambliss]] and [[Richard Burr]] reported that Russian authorities had separately asked both the FBI (at least twice: during March and November 2011) and the CIA (September 2011) to look carefully into Tamerlan Tsarnaev and provide more information about him back to Russia.&lt;ref name="BG-RUS"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/04/23/russia-contacted-fbi-multiple-times-concerns-about-alleged-boston-marathon-bomber/ND0bhUdq1Tp1mRuC8xlb8N/story.html |title = Russia contacted US government ‘multiple’ times|author1=Bender, Bryan |author2= Bierman, Noah|work=The Boston Globe|date= April 23, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RT-RUS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/usa/fbi-boston-senate-hearing-263/ |title= Senate grills FBI over Boston bombings intel failures|work=RT|date=April 23, 2013|accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) secretly recorded phone conversations between [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]] and his mother (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the FBI as evidence of possible extremist links within the family.&lt;ref name="Boston-RUSS"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rt.com/usa/tsarnaev-mother-wiretap-jihad-519/ |title=

In addition, subsequent U.S. requests for additional information about Tsarnaev went unanswered by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Radia|first=Kirit|title=Lawmakers Traveling to Russia to Investigate Boston Bombing|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/05/lawmakers-traveling-to-russia-to-investigate-boston-bombing/|newspaper=ABC News|date=May 21, 2013 |accessdate= April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chechen reactions ====
On April 19, 2013, the press-secretary of the [[head of the Chechen Republic]], [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], issued a statement that, inter alia, read: "The Boston bombing suspects have nothing to do with Chechnya".&lt;ref name="AutoLC-153" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-154" /&gt; On the same day, Kadyrov was reported by ''[[The Guardian]]'' to have written on [[Instagram]]:&lt;ref name="AutoLC-155" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain. They grew up in the U.S., their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America. The whole world must battle with terrorism. We know this better than anyone. We wish recover {{sic}} to all the victims and share Americans' feeling of sorrow.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Akhmed Zakayev]], head of the secular wing of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen separatist movement]], now in exile in London, condemned the bombing as "terrorist" and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. Zakayev denied that the bombers were in any way representative of the Chechen people, saying that "the Chechen people never had and can not have any hostile feelings toward the United States and its citizens."&lt;ref name="AutoLC-156" /&gt;

The [[Caucasus Emirate|Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province of Dagestan]], the [[North Caucasian Federal District|Caucasian]] Islamist organization in both Chechnya and Dagestan, denied any link to the bombing or the Tsarnaev brothers and stated that it was at war with Russia, not the United States. It also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since 2012.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-157" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-158" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-159" /&gt;

=== Criticism of "shelter-in-place" directive and house-to-house searches ===
During the manhunt for the perpetrators of the bombing, Governor [[Deval Patrick]] said "we are asking people to shelter in place." The request was highly effective; most people stayed home, causing Boston, Watertown, and Cambridge to come to a virtual standstill. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, "media described residents complying with a 'lockdown order,' but in reality the governor's security measure was a request." [[Scott Silliman]], emeritus director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke Law School, said that the shelter-in-place request was voluntary.&lt;ref name="Rawlings"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nate|last=Rawlings|url=http://nation.time.com/2013/04/19/was-boston-actually-on-lockdown/|title=Was Boston Actually on Lockdown?|work=Time|date=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shelter-in-place directive was criticized by some commentators. Michael Cohen of ''[[The Observer]]'' said that Americans have little experience with daily terrorism compared to some countries and "are more primed to … assume the absolute worst."&lt;ref name="observerCriticalReaction" /&gt; Cohen wrote that it was not the first time dangerous murderers have been on the loose in a large American city (citing [[Christopher Dorner]] in 2013 and the [[Beltway sniper attacks]] in 2002), but noted that "lockdown" measures were not used in those cases.&lt;ref name="observerCriticalReaction" /&gt;  Former congressman and presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]], criticized what he described as a "military-style takeover of parts of Boston" during the investigation and wrote that "this unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself."&lt;ref name="RPaul" /&gt;

''[[Haaretz]]''{{-'}}s Chemi Salev wrote that "in terms of cost-benefit analysis, from the evil terrorist's point of view, the Boylston Street bombings and their aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph" since the "relatively amateurish" terrorists managed to intimidate a vast number of people and got a maximum amount of publicity.&lt;ref name="Haaretz" /&gt; Responding to Salev in ''The New York Times'', [[Ross Douthat]] commented that the massive manhunt operation might deter other amateur terrorists, but not hard-core terrorists such as [[Mohammed Atta]].&lt;ref name="DouthatNYTimes" /&gt; Douthat argued that out-of-the-ordinary measures can only be used when terrorism itself is out-of-the-ordinary: if attacks started to occur more often, people would not be as willing to comply with shelter-in-place commands, yet once a terrorist has been hunted with such an operation, it is hard to justify why such measures should not be taken the next time.&lt;ref name="DouthatNYTimes" /&gt;

The [[National Lawyers Guild]] and some news outlets questioned the constitutionality of the door-to-door searches conducted by law enforcement officers looking for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archive.boston.com/yourtown/news/watertown/2013/11/lawyers_to_speak_about_unconstitutional_watertown_home_searc.html| author=Jaclyn Reiss| title=Lawyers raising questions about Watertown home searches following Marathon bombings, shootout| publisher=Boston Globe| date=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/watertown-door-door-search-bombing-suspects-violation-fourth-140043137.html?ref=gs| author=Liz Klimas| title=Was Watertown’s Door-to-Door Search for Bombing Suspects a Violation of the Fourth Amendment?| publisher=Yahoo News| date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/04/22/the-police-response-to-the-boston-marathon-bombing/| author=Radley Balko| title=Was the police response to the Boston bombing really appropriate?| publisher=The Washington Post| date=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicting reports ==
[[File:Boston Marathon bombings news conference.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boston Police Department#List of Boston Police Commissioners|Boston Police Commissioner]] [[Edward F. Davis]] gives a [[news conference]] about the bombing on April 15. Governor [[Deval Patrick]] is second from right and Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley is at far left.]]

On the afternoon of the bombing, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a Boston hospital.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-160" /&gt; That evening, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said that there had not been an arrest.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-163" /&gt; The ''Post'' did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, CNN, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-164" /&gt; The day after the bombing, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-165" /&gt;

The ''New York Post'' on its April 18 front page showed two men, and said they were being sought by the authorities. The two were not the ones being sought as suspects. They were a 17-year-old boy and his track coach. The boy, from [[Revere, Massachusetts]], turned himself over to the police immediately and was cleared after a 20-minute interview in which they advised him to deactivate his Facebook account.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-169" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; ''New York Post'' editor [[Col Allan]] stated, "We stand by our story. The image was emailed to law enforcement agencies yesterday afternoon seeking information about these men, as our story reported. We did not identify them as suspects." The two were implied to be possible suspects via [[crowdsourcing]] on the websites [[Reddit]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; and [[4chan]].&lt;ref name="Reconsidering the Internet detectives in Boston manhunt on Reddit and 4Chan: the benefits and pitfalls" /&gt;

Several other people were mistakenly identified as suspects.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-170" /&gt; Two of those wrongly identified as suspects on Reddit were a 17-year-old track star and [[Sunil Tripathi]], a [[Brown University]] student missing since March.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-171" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Missing Brown University student's family dragged into virally fueled false accusation in Boston" /&gt; Tripathi was found dead on April 23 in the [[Providence River]].&lt;ref name="AutoLC-172" /&gt;

On April 17, the FBI released the following statement:
{{Quote|Contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate. Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-173" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoLC-174" /&gt;}}

The decision to release the photos of the Tsarnaev brothers was made in part to limit damage done to those misidentified on the Internet and by the media, and to address concerns over maintaining control of the manhunt.&lt;ref name="AutoLC-175" /&gt;

== Film adaptation ==
A film about the Boston Marathon bombing and subsequent manhunt, ''[[Patriots Day (film)|Patriots Day]]'', was released in December 2016. Another film, ''[[Stronger (film)|Stronger]]'', which chronicles survivor [[Jeff Bauman]], was released in September 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5602">A '''buyout clause''' or '''release clause''' refers to a clause in a [[contract]] that imposes an obligation on another organisation wishing to acquire the services of the employee under contract to pay the (usually substantial) fee of the clause to the organisation which issued the contract and 'owns' the employee.

It is most commonly used in reference to sports teams, where a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer fee]] is usually paid for a player under contract; however, the current owning club is not obliged to sell their player, and if an agreement on a suitable fee cannot be reached, the buying club can instead resort to paying the player's buyout fee – should their contract have such a clause – which the owning club cannot block.&lt;ref name=applied&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3172294/how-release-clauses-work-neymar-treated-like-any-spanish-worker|title=How release clauses are applied: Neymar like 'any other worker' in Spain|date=5 August 2017|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually this is a higher amount than the player's expected market value, although on occasion a player at a smaller club will sign a contract but insist on a low buyout fee to attract bigger clubs if their performances generate interest.

The aim of this clause is twofold; firstly with its high amount, competing teams are discouraged from attempting to acquire the player if the current club shows no signs of selling them, and secondly it raises any hint to the players not to go through with their contractual commitment.

[[Football in Spain|In Spain]], buyout clauses have been mandatory in football contracts since 1985. If wishing to rescind their contract, the players are required to pay the buyout fee to their current club personally (via the [[Liga de Fútbol Profesional|league body]]), which would be advanced to them by the club signing them;&lt;ref name=applied/&gt;&lt;ref name=change/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanguard/&gt; however this advance of funds was originally deemed by the Spanish government to be taxable income, requiring the buying club to pay [[income tax]] on top of the fee itself, with the prohibitively high costs involved in this dual transaction discouraging clubs from making such deals.&lt;ref name=change&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cityam.com/252013/recent-change-spains-tax-laws-could-make-buying-liga-manchester-united|title=A change in Spain's tax laws could make buying La Liga players easier for Premier League clubs such as Manchester United|date=22 October 2016|work=[[City A.M.]]|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanguard&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/08/spanish-buyout-clauses-work/|title=How Spanish buyout clauses work|date=2 August 2017|publisher=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]]|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 the laws were changed, with the buyout fee advances to the players no longer subject to tax, meaning only the fee itself had to be paid.&lt;ref name=change/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanguard/&gt;

As of November 2017, the five largest buyout clauses were those of association football players [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and player [[Karim Benzema]] of [[Real Madrid]] (€1 billion each) – Ronaldo subsequently moved to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] (a deal not involving the buyout fee); [[Isco]] and [[Marco Asensio]] (also Real Madrid, €700 million each),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/liga/2017-2018/isco-pens-new-real-madrid-deal-with-huge-buyout-cause-marcelo-also-extends-contract_sto6333555/story.shtml|title=Isco pens new Real Madrid deal with huge buyout clause, Marcelo also extends contract|date=2017-09-14|work=[[Eurosport]]|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/4223054/isco-signs-new-five-year-real-madrid-deal-and-his-staggering-release-clause-will-leave-you-speechless/|title=Real Madrid midfielder signs new five-year-deal with outrageous buyout clause|date=2017-08-11|work=The Sun|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/the-neymar-effect-real-madrid-slap-astronomical-buyout/zd8ndsturtlw1jcarttg0zunc|title=The Neymar effect: Real Madrid slap astronomical buyout clauses on stars to avoid Barcelona’s fate|website=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/news/2017-2018/video-lionel-messi-signs-new-contract-fc-barcelona|title=Lionel Messi signs new deal through 2020/21 season {{!}} FC Barcelona|website=FC Barcelona|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of [[FC Barcelona]] player [[Lionel Messi]] (also €700 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/42123022|title=Lionel Messi: Barcelona forward signs new deal until 2021|date=2017-11-25|work=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2017, [[Paris Saint-Germain]] activated the buyout clause of Brazilian footballer [[Neymar]] from FC Barcelona, which was set at €222 million, making him the [[world football transfer record|most expensive football player]] in history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neymar Has Signed a Record-Breaking $262 Million Deal With PSG|url=http://time.com/4887096/neymar-psg-world-record-transfer//|website=The Time|date=4 August 2017|access-date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=applied/&gt; ahead of the previous record set by [[Paul Pogba]] (€105 million) in 2016.

{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}

A '''bye''' in sports (and certain other competitions) refers to organizers scheduling a competitor to not participate in a given round of competition, due to one of several circumstances. 

In [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out (single-elimination) tournaments]] this can be granting a special privilege to reward the best ranked participant(s), or to make a working [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]] if the number of participants is not a power of two (e.g. 16 or 32) - or both. 

In [[round-robin tournament]]s, usually one competitor gets a bye in each round when there are an odd number of competitors, as it is impossible for all competitors to play in the same round. However, over the whole tournament, each plays the same number of games as well as sitting out for the same number of rounds.

Similar to the round-robin context, in league sports with weekly regular-season play such as [[gridiron football]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]], a team not scheduled to play on a given week or fixture (competition period) can be said to be on its "bye week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fantasy Football Terms You Need to Know|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/fantasy-football-terms-you-need-to-know.html|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byes are needed if there is an odd number of teams, but can be used even with an even number of teams, as has been done in the NFL.

==Elimination tournaments==

In a standard [[single-elimination tournament]], each round has half the number of teams as the preceding round. Thus the finals will have two, the semi-finals will have four, the quarter finals will have eight, etc. Thus tournaments with competitors numbering a [[Power of two#The first 96 powers of two|power of two]] can have a standard bracket in which all teams are paired up with the loser of each match eliminated and the winner moving on to the next round until only one champion remains.

Therefore, if the number of teams is not a power of two, a simple elimination tournament would eventually produce a round with an odd number of teams (if the number is not odd to start with). For example, a tournament of nine teams could only have four matches in the first round, while a simple tournament of ten teams would produce a second round with five teams, meaning only two matches could occur.
Thus, if the number of participants is not a power of two (e.g. 16 or 32), to make a working [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]] byes are provided to automatically move certain participants into a later round without requiring them to compete in an earlier one. 

When participants are ranked, participants with the highest ranking going into the tournament are given a bye to the second round, as it is generally seen as an advantage to be assured entry into a later round. In the [[National Football League playoffs|NFL playoffs]], for example, the top two division-leaders in each conference are given byes to the second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ob1gui/nflrules.htm |title=NFL PLayoff Seeding &amp; Tie Breaker Rules |publisher=Home.earthlink.net |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) also grants a bye to its two division winners, directly to the division finals as four other teams compete in a semi-final week. In other tournaments where teams are unranked, random draw may be used to determine the byes.

The number of teams offered a bye is generally designed to ensure that the next round consists of a power-of-two number of teams so the tournament can proceed as a simple single-elimination tournament from that round onward. 

If the byes are all single first-round byes into the second round of a tournament, the number of byes required is the difference between the number of teams and the next-highest power of two. For example, a 12-team tournament will require four byes (16−12) to ensure that instead of six teams in the second round, eight advance (as the four byes avoid two of the four teams being eliminated).

===Examples from Gaelic football===
In the Provincial Championships of Gaelic football, some teams receive a bye due to the irregular number of teams competing in each province. The different numbers resulted in different byes alignments in each Provincial Championship.

For example, below is an assessment of the 2012 Provincial Championships, and their use of the "bye".

Seven teams contested the [[Connacht Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Connacht Senior Football Championship]], so a quarter-final was not played by [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]]. Mayo therefore advanced directly to the semi-final to await the winner of the game between [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]] and [[London GAA|London]].

Eleven teams contested the [[Leinster Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Leinster Senior Football Championship]], so five teams were given first round byes. Three teams ([[Carlow GAA|Carlow]], [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] and [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]]) played winners of the three preliminary matches, while the other two played each other in the quarter-finals without playing a game in the preliminary round.

Six teams contested the [[Munster Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Munster Senior Football Championship]], so two teams ([[Clare GAA|Clare]] and [[Cork GAA|Cork]]) were permitted to advance to the semi-finals without playing a game in the quarter-finals.

Nine teams contested the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Ulster Senior Football Championship]], so only [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]] played in the preliminary round, while the other seven advanced via bye to the quarter-finals without playing a game in the preliminary round.

==="Double Byes"===

While less common, byes can be offered for multiple rounds (e.g. a "double bye" directly into the third round), or starting in a later round (e.g. the top-ranked team in the first round is given a bye straight to the third round). A bye granted in a later round of the tournament eliminates the need for two byes in the previous round. 
 
In the English [[FA Cup]], the football clubs in the top two [[English football league system#The system|league divisions]] receive two-round byes and enter in the third round "proper" (of eight); the two next-highest divisions' teams will have entered in the first round. Another example is the [[UEFA Europa League]].

The [[WNBA]] also grants double byes to the league's top two seeds, while the next two seeds get first-round byes for their [[WNBA Playoffs|playoffs]].

In [[NCAA Division I]] basketball, the [[2009 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament]] introduced "double byes", as the conference invited all 16 members to participate for the first time (previously only the top twelve were invited). To limit the number of games each round to four, the four highest seeded teams were advanced to the third round of competition, the 5th-8th seeded teams given byes to the second round, and the bottom eight competed the first day. 

Due to the [[2010–2014 NCAA conference realignment|realignment of major conferences]], "double byes" were no longer needed by the Big East after 2013, but were added by the [[2013_SEC_Men's_Basketball_Tournament|SEC in 2013]], the [[2014_ACC_Men's_Basketball_Tournament|ACC in 2014]], and the [[2015_Big_Ten_Conference_Men's_Basketball_Tournament|Big Ten in 2015]].

===Hidden Byes (Play-in Games)===

In certain tournaments, the byes are somewhat disguised. When more teams are given first-round byes than actually compete in the first round, these first games may be referred to as "play-in" games and might not be a formally labelled as a tournament round.

Since 2012, the [[Major League Baseball postseason|Major League Baseball playoffs]] has included ten teams consisting of six division winners and four wildcard teams (the top-ranked non-division-winners). The first round of the playoffs consists two [[Major League Baseball wild-card game|wild-card games]]: single-game matches in which the four wild-card teams are reduced to two. The winners move on to the Divisional series with the six division winners for an eight-team, three-round tournament. Although this is billed as adding two extra "one-game showdowns" to the post-season, it could also be viewed as adding a fourth round to the ten-team tournament with six byes for the division winners. 

The [[FA Cup]] also has certain teams compete in up to 6 preliminary rounds to qualify for the first round "proper". 

Another example is the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which since 2011 has had 68 teams, effectively granting 60 byes, while eight teams compete in the "First Four" games for remaining four spots in the round of 64. From 2011 to 2015, the "First Four" was considered the first round, the round of 64 played on Thursday and Friday, was called the "second round"; the round of 32 was then called the "third round", consisting of games played on Saturday and Sunday. In 2016, the naming reverted to the round of 64 being the "first round" once again, and the round of 32 being the "second round".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leger |first=Justin |title=NCAA To Rename 'Rounds of 64 and 32' To 'First And Second Rounds' In 2016 |url=http://nesn.com/2014/11/ncaa-to-rename-rounds-of-64-and-32-to-first-and-second-rounds-in-2016/ |publisher=[[New England Sports Network|NESN]] |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though the play-in round and all eight of those teams are officially part of the tournament.

==American and Canadian Football/Rugby Bye weeks==

Certain professional [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[gridiron football|gridiron]] football leagues use the term "bye week" for any week during the regular season in which a team does not play a game. (School teams may also have non-competing weeks, but these are scheduled by individual schools and more commonly termed "open dates".)

===United States===

Each [[National Football League | NFL]] team has one "bye week" during a normal season; this is placed on the team's schedule, usually falling between Week 5 and Week 11 inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating the NFL Schedule|url=https://operations.nfl.com/the-game/creating-the-nfl-schedule/|website=NFL Operations|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The NFL added the bye week in [[1990 NFL season | 1990]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/28/sports/nfl-lengthens-its-season-to-fit-new-tv-arrangement.html|title=N.F.L. Lengthens Its Season To Fit New TV Arrangement|author=Eskenazi, Gerald|date=February 28, 1990|publisher=''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to extend the 16-game regular season schedule to span 17 weeks to increase the number of viewable games for TV contracts. The [[1993 NFL season]] spanned 18 weeks with each team having 2 bye weeks. In the rare case of a game postponement that cannot be made up within the week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/14/sports/sp-nflrep14|title=Texans game postponed due to storm | agency= Associated Press | work = Los Angeles Times |date=September 14, 2008|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bye week may act as an available date to reschedule the delayed game, with the day of postponement acting as the new "bye week"; although both teams would have to be available on the same bye week; this was done during the [[2008 NFL season]] when the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[Houston Texans]] had to reschedule their Week 2 matchup in Houston due to [[Hurricane Ike]], which also impacted the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]' schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80ac4273&amp;template=without-video&amp;confirm=true |title= Ravens-Texans game postponed; Bengals also affected|accessdate=September 14, 2009 |work=[[NFL.com]]|publisher= |date=September 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] were given a Week 1 bye week due to [[Hurricane Irma]] in the 2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thephinsider.com/2017/9/6/16262418/2017-miami-dolphins-hurricane-irma-schedule-adjusted-week-1-tampa-bay-buccaneers-week-11-bye-week|title=Miami Dolphins schedule after Hurricane Irma Week 1 delay: History and oddity|author=Nogle, Kevin|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=The Phinsider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1960 NFL season | 1960]] and [[1966 NFL season | 1966]] NFL seasons, the league had an odd number of teams due to expansion. Each week during those seasons, one team had a bye, including one team each in the first and last week of the season. (Thus, because they had to play all their games with no break in the middle, those two teams effectively had ''no'' byes.) The [[American Football League]] (at the time a completely separate league, but later became the [[American Football Conference]]) also had an odd number of teams in 1966 and 1967 following the addition of the Miami Dolphins, leaving each team with two bye weeks.

Between the [[1999 NFL season| 1999]] through [[2001 NFL season | 2001]] seasons, the NFL had an odd number of teams, 31, as a result of the [[Cleveland Browns]] re-entering the league. Each week during these three seasons featured at least one team with its bye week (the 2001 season also added an additional impromptu league-wide bye the weekend after the [[September 11 attacks]]). The league returned to having an even number of teams (32) in the 2002 season with the addition of the [[Houston Texans]], and implemented the current bye week system.

Sarcastically, the media may refer to a team having a "bye week" if that team is playing an especially bad team and is all but assured of a win.

===Canada===

Traditionally, the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] has had nine teams and required bye weeks. Beginning 2018, each team has three bye weeks and 18 games over a 21-week regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/cfl-to-announce-immediate-end-to-full-contact-practices-1.855515|title=CFL immediately ends full-contact practices|author=Naylor, Dave|date=September 17, 2017|publisher=TSN}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most seasons, (from 2014 to 2017 and prior to 2007), each team has two bye weeks during the 20 week 18-game regular season.  When the league had only 8 teams, the league usually had no bye weeks.  However between 2007 and 2013, the league had one bye per team over in two weeks in August (4 teams would have a bye during week 6 and the other 4 teams would have a bye on week 7).

===Australia===

In Australia's [[National Rugby League]] (NRL), each team has two byes each season. During the representative period of the season (such as the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]]), byes are generally scheduled to the clubs that are expected to have the most players involved in the representative match, in the round preceding (or following) the representative fixture, to allow those clubs to sufficiently rest those players and prevent them from fielding a weakened side. On the competition ladder, teams are awarded two points (equivalent to a win) during their bye week except for the [[Melbourne Storm]] in 2010, who were barred from receiving premiership points for the remainder of the season as a punishment for [[Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal|gross long-term breaches of the salary cap]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrl.com/melbourne-storm-breach-nrl-salary-cap/tabid/10874/newsid/58359/default.aspx Melbourne Storm breach NRL salary cap], ''NRL.com official website'', 22 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Australian Football League]], which comprises an even number of clubs, gives each club a bye week in mid-season. In  [[1915 VFL season|1915]], [[1919 VFL season|1919]] [[1924 VFL season|to 1924]], [[1942 VFL season|1942]] [[1943 VFL season|and 1943]], [[1991 AFL season|1991]] [[1994 AFL season|to 1994]] and [[2011 AFL season|2011]], when there were an odd number of clubs competing, each club was given two byes.

In both leagues, and under many other professional and amateur sports leagues in Australia, higher placed teams don't earn byes during [[playoffs|finals]], but instead the opportunity not to be eliminated by losing their first-round match (also called a double chance).  This practice is common in Australia, but it is not used in most other countries, to earn an easier passage to the Grand Final as reward for finishing higher on the ladder.  This is different from a double elimination format, in which a team has to lose both in the tournament and the repechage to be eliminated.

In a variation of the round-robin case, at certain high-level competitions in [[artistic gymnastics]], teams cycle through the apparatuses in an "Olympic Order" with scheduled byes in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grassie |first1=Julia |title=Gymnastics 101: Competition format |url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/gymnastics-101-competition-format |website=NBCOlympics.com |publisher=NBC Universal |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the [[NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championships]] has 36 teams with six teams apiece at six  regional sites, with 12 advancing to two semifinal rounds of six that decide participants for the final "Super Six".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/2018-womens-gymnastics-bracket.pdf|title=Womens Gymnastics Bracket|publisher=NCAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=September 2018}} In each of these nine sextets, each team  competes during four of six "rotations" with the other two as byes - scheduled before the parallel bars and the floor exercise. For example, Semifinal II of the 2018 championships operated as follows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/2018-womens-gymnastics-2018.pdf|title=Womens Gymnastics 2018|publisher=NCAA}} &lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}

==Swiss system tournaments==
In a [[Swiss-system tournament]] with an odd number of players, one player gets a bye in each round, but not all players will get a bye (as there are fewer rounds than there are players). However, as with the case of NFL "bye weeks", these "byes" do not confer any advantage, or in the case of a seeded tournament, that any player/team receiving one is perceived as any better than one that does not, as all of the participants receive one, whereas the awarding of a bye in a single-elimination tournament most definitely does, in both cases.

In [[sports]], an '''ejection''' (also known as '''dismissal''', '''sending-off''', or '''disqualification''') is the removal of a participant from a contest due to a violation of the sport's rules. The exact violations that lead to an ejection vary depending upon the sport, but common causes for ejection include [[unsportsmanlike conduct]], violent acts against another participant that are beyond the sport's generally accepted standards for such acts, abuse against officials, violations of the sport's rules that the contest official deems to be egregious, or the use of an illegal substance to better a player's game. Most sports have provisions that allow players to be ejected, and many allow for the ejection of coaches, managers, or other non-playing personnel.

The decision to eject a participant usually lies with one or more officials present at the contest (e.g., referees or umpires). In addition to removal from the contest, many sports leagues provide additional sanctions against participants who have been ejected, such as monetary fines or suspensions from future contests.

When the offender is ejected, he/she must leave the immediate playing area; in most cases, this means going to the locker room or other part of the venue out of sight of the playing area, or in extreme cases, leaving the facility grounds. In many youth sports leagues, ejected players are required to stay with their coach in the team area, or at least be supervised by an adult at whatever location the player is required to go. If a participant refuses to cooperate with an ejection, additional sanctions may be levied, such as forfeiture of the contest, monetary fines, or suspensions.

==Conditions==

===Basketball===
In the [[NBA]] and most other [[basketball]] games, a player or coach is ejected from the game if he accumulates two [[technical foul]]s of an unsportsmanlike nature over the course of the game. Participants who commit [[Flagrant foul|fouls of violence]] or intentionally enter the stands are ejected summarily regardless of the number of technical fouls accumulated. Ejected players/coaches must leave the court area for the remainder of play, and must do so immediately, or else risk even heavier fines/suspensions. In the NBA, an ejection will result in, at minimum, a $1,000 fine; an ejection for leaving the bench during a fight carries at least a one-game suspension as well. In domestic games, refusing to leave after being ejected can result in a player being put on report. If being put on report does not provide enough encouragement for a player to leave the court, the official may [[wiktionary:forfeit|award the game to the opposing team]], regardless of score. Players who incur 16 technical fouls in a single NBA season are automatically suspended for one game; an additional suspension is imposed for each increment of two thereafter. Should a player receive the 16th technical foul in the last regular-season game, he will be suspended for the first game in the next season, unless if his team is in the playoffs, when he will be suspended for the first playoff game. In the playoffs, players are suspended if they receive seven technical fouls.

A significant rule change was made in 1981 whereby the NBA eliminated the ejection of a coach for three technical fouls caused by an [[Defensive Three-Second Violation|illegal defense]].  Also, in the NBA ejections and suspensions are not permissible if a technical foul is caused by an excessive timeout, delay of game, accidental departure from the coach's box, the destruction of a backboard caused by a play (such as a dunk), defensive hanging on any part of the basket unit to successfully touch a ball (Rule 12), or any remaining in the game after six fouls when a team is out of players because of fouls, injuries, and ejections under Rule 3, Section I, paragraph b.  These technical fouls are referenced as "Non-Unsportsmanlike Conduct Technical Fouls". The NBA all-time leader in disqualifications is [[Vern Mikkelsen]], who was disqualified 127 times in 631 games.

In FIBA sanctioned games, a player is ejected for two technicals (since October 1, 2014), unsportsmanlike fouls or one disqualifying foul.  Technical fouls in FIBA include swinging of elbows without contact and [[Flop (basketball)|flopping]], which are not fouls in the NBA.  A coach can be ejected upon having incurred two coach technical fouls, or a combination of three bench and coach technical fouls.  There is no separation regarding a "non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul," as in the NBA, so two delay of game violations result in an ejection.

In [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] contests, ejected players must remain on the team bench, so that they may continue to be supervised by a coach or other adult team representative. If an adult team representative other than the head coach, such as an adult assistant coach, can provide supervision from the court and to the locker room for the duration of the contest, the player may leave the visual confines of the playing area with this representative.

In NCAA contests, ejected players are dismissed to the locker room; no adult supervision is required as NCAA players are assumed to be legally of adult age.

Basketball also features disqualification, also known as fouling out.  A player who commits a certain number of [[foul (basketball)|personal foul]]s in a game (5 or 6 in most leagues), is removed from the game and is said to have "fouled out".  Unlike ejection, disqualification is not considered a punitive action but rather a natural consequence of a very physical sport with many instances of contact. Disqualified players are permitted to remain on the bench with the team (instead of being sent to the locker room, as with an ejected player) and are not subject to any further penalties (such as fines or suspensions); they can resume play in their next game. In the NBA, a technical foul (which does not count towards suspension or ejection) is also assessed for re-entering a game after fouling out of a game in emergency situations listed in Rule 3, Section I when a team is reduced to five players.  Once that occurs, a technical foul is charged if a player remains in the game after his sixth or subsequent foul, or as the last player to foul out, re-enters the game in case of injury to an eligible player that must be removed.

===Baseball===
{{see also|Major League Baseball umpiring records#Ejections}}
[[Image:Scott steinmann ejected.jpg|thumb|250px|Despite having been ejected, manager of the [[Wisconsin Timber Rattlers]] Scott Steinmann continues to argue with umpire Nicholas Nolde.]]
In baseball, each umpire has a considerable amount of discretion, and may eject any player, [[coach (baseball)|coach]], or [[manager (baseball)|manager]] solely on his own judgment of [[unsportsmanlike conduct]].&lt;ref name="901d"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 9.01(d) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule9.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ejectable offense may be an excessively heated or offensive argument with an umpire, [[interference (baseball)|offensive interference]] (contact with the catcher on a play at the plate), malicious game play (especially pitchers [[Beanball|attempting to intentionally strike batters with the ball]] or a manager or coach [[Hit by pitch|ordering a pitcher to do so]]),&lt;ref name="802d"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 8.02(d) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule8.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; illegally applying a foreign substance to a bat or otherwise tampering with a ball (most famously, [[George Brett]]'s [[Pine Tar Game]]),&lt;ref name="802a"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 8.02(a) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule8.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[corked bat]],&lt;ref name="606d"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 6.06(d) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule6.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[charging the mound]], or otherwise fighting. Between players and umpires, there is a common understanding that a certain level of argument is permitted, but players who too vigorously question an umpire's judgment of balls and strikes,&lt;ref name="902a"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 9.02(a) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule9.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or argue a [[balk]], may risk an ejection. A player is also automatically ejected when a bat, glove, cap or helmet is taken off and thrown down in anger and/or confusion.

Persons other than players, coaches and managers, such as spectators, ballpark staff, or members of the media, may be ejected at an umpire's discretion.&lt;ref name="901e"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 9.01(e) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule9.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the circumstances, spectators who are ejected may also face arrest and prosecution. Bat boys and ball boys may be ejected for not wearing proper safety equipment.&lt;ref name="116e"&gt;{{cite web | title = Rule 1.16(e) | work = Official Major League Rule Book | publisher = Major League Baseball | url = http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule1.shtml | accessdate = 2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, an ejection is followed by a fine or a suspension by the league if the player, or manager or coach, reacts in a very hostile manner towards the umpire. Also, any ejection for malicious game play will normally result in a suspension. Some managers will engage in arguments with umpires specifically to provoke an ejection, in hopes of inspiring a rally from their team. Former [[Atlanta Braves]] manager [[Bobby Cox]] holds the MLB record for most ejections with 161 while Hall of Fame umpire [[Bill Klem]] holds the record for most ejections by an umpire with 251.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closecallsports.com/2011/08/polls-she-gone.html|title=Umpire Ejection Fantasy League Polls: He Gone|work=Close Call Sports|date=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball has a rich vocabulary for describing ejections: a player or coach may also be "run", "thrown out", "banned", "given the ol' heave-ho", "sent to the clubhouse", "hit the showers", "tossed", "kicked out", "dumped", "sent off", "pitched", "bounced out", "canned", "chucked", or "booted". The umpire can signal an ejection by pointing to the dugout or waving his arm toward the dugout in a “throwing” motion, usually yelling at the ejected person to leave. Fans of a home team usually cheer when a player from the visiting team is ejected. Managers or other players usually come out of the dugout and push the offending player away so as to keep them from getting into more trouble with the umpire. Managers often are simultaneously ejected when attempting to protect a player or otherwise leaving the dugout during play. Once an ejection is called, the ejected person and other associated people usually continue yelling at the umpire, with more anger. This is colloquially known as “getting your money’s worth”.

===American football===
Any player or team official who commits a personal foul (i.e. striking, kicking, kneeing) against another player or team official, commits an act of [[American football rules|unnecessary roughness]] against another player or team official, commits an act of unsportsmanlike conduct, or commits a [[palpably unfair act]] is liable to be disqualified from further participation if the act is found to be flagrant. Any player or team official who fights with another player or team official, leaves the bench to take part in a fight, intentionally makes contact with or assaults a game official, or uses any item of equipment as a weapon is automatically disqualified.

Compared to other American sports (perhaps with the exception of [[basketball]]), ejections in American football are relatively uncommon considering the physical nature of the sport.  If a player or team official is disqualified, his/her team is assessed a 15-yard penalty, but if a player or team official is disqualified for a palpably unfair act, the distance or score penalty will be determined by the referee after consultation with the other officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/penaltysummaries|title=NFL Rules Digest: Summary of Penalties|author=|date=|website=www.nfl.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Football League]] (NFL) made an experimental rule change on March 23, 2016 for the following season stating that two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties on a player would result in an automatic ejection from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000646837/article/nfl-passes-automatic-ejection-rule-for-2016-season|title=NFL passes automatic ejection rule for 2016 season|author=|date=|website=nfl.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some coaches have expressed concern that this could result in a player with one such penalty being goaded by the opposing team into a second penalty to get them removed from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2627124-coaches-fear-the-nfls-new-ejection-rule-could-lead-to-the-goon-scenario|title=Coaches Fear the NFL's New Ejection Rule Could Lead to 'The Goon Scenario'|first=Mike|last=Freeman|date=|website=bleacherreport.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[National Federation of State High School Associations|high school football]], a player or team official is automatically disqualified if he/she receives two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the same game. In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|college football]], a player is automatically disqualified if he/she is determined to have led with the crown of his/her helmet, or targeted a defenseless player in his/her head or neck area. In addition, if said infraction is committed in the second half of a game, the player is suspended for the first half of the following game.

===Association football===
[[File:Cartonrouge.jpg|right|thumb|A red card, signifying ejection from a match|alt=An arm and hand, extended upward, with a black sweatband around the wrist holding a small red square plastic card by its bottom corner]]
{{Main|Fouls and misconduct (association football)}}
In association football, a player is dismissed from the field of play by the [[referee (association football)|referee]] showing him/her a red card if (s)he commits a dismissible offence or has committed a second cautionable ([[Yellow card (sports)|yellow card]]) offence having already received a yellow card in the same game. The act of ejection is referred to in the sport as "sending off".

A difference between being dismissed in association football and the above-mentioned sports is that in association football, a player may not be replaced, forcing his/her team to play a man down for the remainder of the match. Additionally, a dismissal in any professional league results in an automatic suspension of at least one match.

It is also possible for the [[Manager (association football)|manager]] or other team official to be "sent off", which requires him/her to leave his/her [[Dugout (football)|dugout]] and sit in the stands away from the touch line. This usually requires another member of the coaching staff to make decisions for the team, such as substitutes and [[Formation (association football)|formation]]. Also, depending upon the rules of the association presiding over the game, the manager or team official may not be allowed on the bench or to communicate with assistants for at least his/her team's next game.

If the same team has 5 players who have been "sent off", the match is then "abandoned", that is, the game no longer continues. The officials then file a game report with the appropriate league or association. The league or associatation then decides if a forfeit will be assessed and what the final score is recorded as.

According to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', the most red cards administered in one game is 20, for a match between [[Paraguay]]an teams [[Sportivo Ameliano]] and [[General Caballero Sport Club|General Caballero]] that broke down into a generalized brawl and was subsequently abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jan/28/theknowledge.sport|title=The most red cards in a game... ever!|first=Sean|last=Ingle|date=28 January 2002|website=the Guardian|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby football===
In all codes of rugby, a player may be temporarily suspended for a period of the match. In [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]], the standard suspension period is 10 minutes (out of an 80-minute game). This is generally referred to as a 'yellow card' as players are generally shown one in a manner similar to association football. Suspended players are said to be sent to the [[sin bin]] and is signalled by the referee showing two outstretched hands to the offender (rugby league) or by a [[penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] (rugby union). In the Northern Hemisphere it is not uncommon for referees to use both red and yellow cards in rugby league, similar to rugby union.

In [[rugby sevens|rugby union sevens]], which normally lasts 14 minutes (20 in finals), the suspension period is 2 minutes. While eight minutes shorter than in fifteens, suspensions are more severe in sevens as one seventh of the team is out for one seventh of the match; this opens up more space than losing one fifteenth of the team for one eighth of the match.

Temporary suspensions are usually given for repeated infringements (by either the same player or team), [[professional foul]]s and foul play, such as high tackles. A player cannot be replaced while temporarily suspended, though may be at the conclusion of the suspension period. For more serious offences or a second infraction warranting a temporary suspension sanction, a player may be sent off for the rest of the game, with no replacement allowable.

Special conditions exist in rugby union for the replacement of a sinbinned or sent-off front-row forward.

Referees also have the power to send team officials to the stands, similar to that in football.

===Cricket===
Prior to 2017, there was no provision in the Laws for a player to be ejected, although post-game disciplinary action could occur.&lt;ref name="cricket-laws-2000"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marylebone Cricket Club |authorlink1=Marylebone Cricket Club |title=Laws of Cricket 2000 Code, 6th Edition (2016) |url=https://www.lords.org/assets/Uploads/MCC-Laws-of-Cricket-2000-Code-6th-Edition-2016.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616170646/https://www.lords.org/assets/Uploads/MCC-Laws-of-Cricket-2000-Code-6th-Edition-2016.pdf |archivedate=2018-06-16 |pages=52–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was however, provision in the Laws (Law 42 prior to 2017, now Law 41) for umpires to suspend a bowler from bowling in the remainder of his team's innings, detailed below.

The [[Laws of Cricket]] 2017 Code introduced a new Law (Law 42) dealing with players' conduct, as by then it was widely accepted that a need existed to provide the umpires with on-field sanctions for poor conduct, and that such sanction could lead to sending off for acts of violence.&lt;ref name="cricket-laws-2017-summary"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marylebone Cricket Club |authorlink1=Marylebone Cricket Club |title=Summary of changes to the Laws of Cricket 2017 Code |url=https://www.lords.org/assets/Uploads/Law-Summary-Paper-updated-28-June.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616165140/https://www.lords.org/assets/Uploads/Law-Summary-Paper-updated-28-June.pdf |archivedate=2018-06-16 |pages=4, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the new Law, four different levels of offences were created: a Level 3 offence (intimidating an umpire by language or gesture, or threatening to assault a player or any other person except an umpire) results in the offending player being suspended for a number of overs dependent on the length of the match, while a Level 4 offence (threatening to assault or making inappropriate or deliberate physical contact with an umpire, physically assaulting a player or any other person, or committing any other act of violence) results in the offending player being removed from the field for the remainder of the match.&lt;ref name="cricket-laws-2017-laws-42"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marylebone Cricket Club |authorlink1=Marylebone Cricket Club |title=Law 42 - Players' Conduct |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-42-players-conduct/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001123056/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-42-players-conduct/ |archivedate=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In circumstances where a players' conduct offence of any level has been committed, the umpires will halt the game, summon the offending player's captain to the field, inform the captain of the breach of Law and the associated penalty and, in the cases of a Level 3 or Level 4 offence, instruct the captain to remove the offending player from the field.  If the offending player's captain refuses to comply with an instruction to remove a player, the umpires will consider awarding the match to the opposition, or will abandon the match in a case where both captains are involved and both refuse to comply.  Furthermore, any players' conduct offence will result in a report to the Executive of the offending player’s team and to any Governing Body responsible for the match who, as was the case in the prior Laws, may take additional disciplinary action after the match.&lt;ref name="cricket-laws-2017-laws-42" /&gt;

Additionally, the umpires have the power to eject a bowler from the team's bowling attack for the remainder of the innings (or in the case of a one-innings match or the second innings of a two-innings match, the remainder of the match) if the bowler, after having received one or two prior warnings (depending on prior offences), is guilty of throwing (law 21.3), [[ball-tampering]] (law 41.3), dangerous and unfair bowling (laws 41.6 to 41.8), time wasting (law 41.9) or running onto the protected area of the pitch (law 41.13). Any bowler who is guilty of deliberately bowling a high full-pitched ball (law 41.7) is automatically ejected.  If a bowler is ejected, the umpires will direct the captain of the fielding team, once the ball is dead, to take the bowler off forthwith. If there is an over in progress when the bowler is ejected, it shall be completed by another bowler who shall neither have bowled the previous over nor be allowed to bowl the next over. The bowler thus ejected shall not bowl again in that innings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marylebone Cricket Club |authorlink1=Marylebone Cricket Club |title=Law 41 - Unfair play |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-41-unfair-play/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001121603/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-41-unfair-play/ |archivedate=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ice hockey===
{{See also|Penalty (ice hockey)}}
In [[ice hockey]], there are several types of ejections for penalties: a "game ejection", "game misconduct penalty", "match penalty", and formerly "gross misconduct penalty".

During games sanctioned by Hockey Canada, a "game ejection" is issued for three stick infraction penalties and is rather rare. These penalties include cross checking, high sticking, butt ending, slashing, and spearing.

A game misconduct penalty is usually issued against a player for unsportsmanlike play, escalating a [[fighting (ice hockey)|fight]], or leaving the [[penalty box]] before he has completed serving time for another penalty, although some major penalties carry an automatic game misconduct.  If a player incurs three game misconducts in a season, (s)he will be given a one-match ban.  The player must leave the ice immediately, and a substitute may take over.  However, if any other penalties are incurred by the ejected player in the same incident, they must be served in the penalty box by the substituting player.  By the USA Hockey rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Menu_RulesEquipment/2011%20-%2013%20Playing%20Rules%20Casebook.pdf |title=USA Hockey Rulebook |work=USA Hockey |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a player can receive a game misconduct for violently checking an opponent into the boards from behind, or if the opponent's head strikes the boards or the goal frame as a result of the check from behind. It is also common knowledge that a player receives a game misconduct, regardless of the force of the hit, the second time (s)he checks an opponent from behind.

A match penalty is usually issued against a player for deliberately attempting to injure another player, such as stomping on him with his/her skate or a malicious hit.  In addition to the offending player being immediately ejected (and usually subject to suspension), another player must serve a five-minute major penalty in the penalty box in addition to any other penalties imposed.  The only exception is if a match penalty is against a goaltender, in which case the replacement goaltender can enter the ice immediately and a non-goaltender player serves the penalties. Match penalties may also be automatically flagged for review and supplementary discipline, depending on the league or association.

Prior to 2000, a gross misconduct was normally issued for an action far outside the normal level of acceptable behavior and was commonly given when a player has "made a travesty of the game".

===Water polo===
An ejection is called for a hold, sink, or pullback by a defensive player. If a player commits a foul within 5 meters to the goal that prevents a probable goal the offense will be awarded a penalty shot. Ejections and penalties are also awarded due to interference of a play. For example, if an ordinary foul is called (one blast of whistle) and the defensive player continues to play on that player, an ejection will be awarded. If the player fails to make their way to the penalty box, the offensive team will be awarded a penalty shot. The replacement player may not join play until a change of possession, [[turnover (water polo)|turnover]] or once 20 seconds elapse. Should the player acquire 3 personal fouls (penalties/ejections) the player must sit out for the remainder the game. Players in the water that acquire a misconduct (shown by circular hand motions by the referee) may no longer participate in the game and must sit out for the remainder of the game. Coaches and players on the bench may be removed by being awarded a red card. For Flagrant Misconducts and Brutalities the player may no longer participate for the remainder of the game, leave the playing area, and must face the consequences following their respective rulebook (NCAA, FINA, NFHS, etc.)

===Field lacrosse===
In [[field lacrosse]], an ejection (expulsion foul) is issued for a severe penalty, such as fighting, [[bench-clearing brawl|leaving the bench to take part in a fight]], malicious hits, deliberately attempting to injure another player, blatant fouls at the end of or immediately following a game, or, in high school, receiving two unreleasable [[unsportsmanlike conduct#field lacrosse|unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalties. Coaches and team officials can also be ejected for being caught using alcohol or tobacco during a game.

The team guilty of the expulsion foul must serve a three-minute non-releasable penalty, and the ejected player/coach/official is suspended for at least the next game.

Fouling out occurs if a player incurs five minutes of personal foul penalty time (I.e. slashing, illegal body check, tripping, unnecessary roughness, unsportsmanlike conduct, punishable by a one to three minute penalty), but does not result in a suspension from the next game.

[[Technical foul (field lacrosse)|Technical fouls]] do not count towards the five minutes; however a player may be called for unsportsmanlike conduct if they repeatedly commit the same technical foul, in which case it would count toward fouling out.

==Additional penalties==
In some instances, a player or coach who is ejected must serve a suspension and may pay a [[fine (penalty)|fine]]. Often, the suspension is one game for the first offense, with harsher penalties depending on subsequent ejections and the severity of the offense. Sometimes in professional sports, a fine may be sanctioned against a player or coach.

Most [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] contests require ejected players to remain in the team area, so they may be supervised by a responsible team adult, usually the head or assistant coach (as requiring a minor to leave an area unsupervised can lead to legal liabilities).  If the player continues to be unruly, other solutions may be implemented such as requiring an assistant coach to leave the area with the player, handing the player over to the school administrator on duty, requiring the player's parents/legal guardians to take the player home, or more rarely, if the ejected player becomes violent, law enforcement to take them into custody.

'''Femke Van den Driessche''' (born 27 August 1996) is a Belgian former [[cyclo-cross]] [[bicycle racing|cyclist]], [[mountainbike]]r and road racing cyclist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Cyclo-cross World Championships: Entries list women's under-23 |url=http://www.wk2016.be/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160125_HZOL_Entries.pdf |publisher=wk2016.be |accessdate=1 February 2016 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Femke Van Den Driessche| url=http://www.cyclingarchives.com/coureurfiche.php?coureurid=71208|publisher=cyclingarchives.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a junior, she became national cyclo-cross champion in 2011 and mountain bike champion in 2013. In 2015, Van den Driessche won the [[European Cyclo-cross Championships]] in the women's under-23 category, and in 2016 she became Belgian champion in the same category, but both titles were stripped later.

She became the first cyclist to officially be charged with [[mechanical doping]], which arose from an incident that occurred at the [[2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships]]. On 26 April 2016, she was retroactively banned from the sport for six years from 11 October 2015 until 10 October 2021, and all her results since that time shall be disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/van-den-driessche-handed-six-year-ban-for-mechanical-doping/ Van den Driessche handed six-year ban for mechanical doping]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
As a junior, she became national cyclo-cross champion in 2011 and junior national mountain bike champion in 2013. At the junior cyclocross championships she won the silver medal in 2013, winning in 2014 the silver medal at the junior national mountain bike championships. She was also active as a road cyclist and won the provincial time trial championships in the novices category in 2012 after finishing second in the same race the year before.

In the ''Middelkerke'' cyclocross race in February 2015 she finished third behind [[Sanne Cant]] and the British rider  [[Helen Wyman]].

Van den Driessche competed between May and July 2015 on the road in international races in Belgium and the Netherlands. She competed in the national road race championships, [[BeNe Ladies Tour]], [[Diamond Tour]] and [[Gooik-Geraardsbergen-Gooik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.procyclingstats.com/mob/rider.php?id=192077|title=Femke van den Driessche|website=www.procyclingstats.com|access-date=28 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2015-16 cyclosross season Van den Driessche was beaten at the ''Koppenberg'' race by [[Jolien Verschueren]] in November 2015. Later that month she won her biggest race in her career, the [[European Cyclo-cross Championships]] in the women's under-23 category. In January 2016 she became Belgian cyclocross champion in the same category.

===Allegations of mechanical doping===
Van den Driessche started as one of the favorites during the women's under-23 race at the [[2016 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships|2016 World Championships]], but failed to finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3425863/Secret-motor-frame-race-bike-Officials-discover-concealed-device-cyclo-cross-championship-event-competitor-withdrew-mechanical-problems.html |title=Secret electric MOTOR is discovered inside cyclist's bike at women's world championship race after competitor pulls out with 'mechanical problem' |quote=Femke Van den Driessche was at the world cyclo-cross championship.

During the race, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] checked the bicycles of Van den Driessche and found a motor in a bicycle that was in her pit. Almost six years since the first allegations of "[[mechanical doping]]" in cycling, this was the first time in cycling history that evidence of technological fraud had been found. The UCI had been testing a new detection system. The offence carries a minimum six-month suspension and a fine of between [[Swiss franc|SFr]]20,000 and 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2016/01/news/uci_detains_bike_cyclocross_worlds_394233_394233%20%E2%80%98 |title=Technological fraud discovered at Zolder cyclocross worlds |first1=Dan |last1=Seaton |date=30 January 2016 |newspaper=[[VeloNews]] |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/hidden-motor-bike-world-cyclo-cross-championships |title=Rider implicated after motor found on bike at world cyclo-cross championships |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van den Driessche denies she intended to cheat, and maintains that the bicycle was owned by a friend and was taken to the pit in error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/35452791 |title=UCI confirms motorised bike at Cyclo-cross World Championships |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=31 January 2016 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/femke-van-den-driessche-denies-using-motor-at-cyclo-cross-world-championships/ |title=Femke van Den Driessche Denies Using Motor at Cyclo-cross World Championships |date=31 January 2016  |work=[[Cycling News]] |accessdate=29 February  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources were openly incredulous. {{cite news |url=https://gizmodo.com/cycling-has-moved-from-actual-doping-to-mechanical-dopi-1756312660 |title=Cycling Has Moved From Actual Doping to 'Mechanical Doping' |work=[[Gizmodo]] |first1=Chris |last1=Mills |date=31 January 2016 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days following the incident, the friend who was claimed by Van den Driessche, Nico Van Muylder, said to ''[[Het Nieuwsblad]]'' that the bike was his. However, UCI technical regulation 12.1.013, bars the presence of motors on the bike, regardless of intent or whether the bike was actually used, going to be used or even belonged to anyone on the team.  Riders are responsible under [[strict liability]].&lt;ref name="Redford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first1=Kirsten |last1=Frattini|title = Van den Driessche’s friend claims ownership of motorised bike |date=2 February 2016 |url = http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/van-den-driessches-friend-claims-ownership-of-motorised-bike/ |publisher=Cyclingnews.com |newspaper=[[Cycling News]] |access-date = 4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frattini"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-investigates-possible-bike-fraud-at-cyclo-cross-worlds/ |first1=Kirsten |last1=Frattini |date=30 January 2016 |title=Race: UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships {{mdash}} UCI investigates possible bike fraud at cyclo-cross Worlds: Bike detained after inaugural U23 women's race in Zolder |newspaper=Cycling News|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a clip that was later analyzed from the ''Koppenbergcross'' cyclo-cross race in November 2015 some moments look amiss. At one point she pulls away from the break on a cobble climb; apparently with little effort and still sitting on the saddle while others look laboured. At another point where she misses a couple of pedal strokes as she fiddles with her gears, it doesn't seem to take too much from her momentum despite being on an incline at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stickybottle.com/offroad/video-was-van-den-driessche-using-motor-in-this-race-clip-take-a-look/|title=Video: Was Van den Driessche using motor in this race clip? Take a look|access-date=28 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to the mechanical doping allegations===

On 31 January 2016, Brian Cookson of the UCI held a press conference.  He said “It is no secret that a motor was found.” He used three different phrases to characterize use of the motor as "technological doping", "mechanical doping" and "technological fraud".  'Legal' proceedings would be commenced, which could result in sanctions of the rider, team or staff.  Possible penalties for the rider can be fines up to [[Swiss franc|SFr]]200,000, and a lifetime ban from the sport.  the team could be fined up to [[Swiss franc|SFr]]1 million.&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cxmagazine.com/motor-mechanical-doping-femke-van-den-driessche-suspected-2016-cyclocross-world-championships-update |title=UCI Confirms Mechanical Doping at 2016 Cyclocross World Championships |date=31 January 2016|author=Andrew |work=[[Cyclocross Magazine]] |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The matter will be heard by an independent Disciplinary Commission that is charged to hear evidence from "all relevant parties" and render its decision on whether a rule violation is proved and the amount of sanctions, if any, for breaches of the UCI Regulations.&lt;ref name="MacKay"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/cycling/uci-refer-femke-van-den-7346880 |title=Mechanical doping in cycling |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=10 February  2016 |first1=Hamish |last1=MacKay |accessdate=29 February  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Six months is pretty short as it's only a season off the bike - I think a couple of years.  But because she is such a young age I think there should be more penalties for the coaches and support team around her.  Belgium is so into cyclo-cross that it's quite upsetting there wasn't the right support around her. So I think the penalties should not just be on her." |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Claims have been made that she would receive the minimum sanction, as the weight of full sanctions might be unjust.  That matter was referred to [[Philippe Muyters]], the Flemish Minister for Sport.&lt;ref name="Curtin"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cxmagazine.com/rumors-and-rumblings-mechanical-doping-femke-van-den-driessche |title=Rumors &amp; Rumblings: Femke Van den Dreissch May Only Get 6 Month Suspension and Fine |first1=Daniel, Jr. |last1=Curtin |work=Cyclocross Magazine |date=10 February 2016 |quote=Flemish MP Lionel Bajart has indicated in a press release that whether mechanical or biological, the idea behind the sanction is the same, to discourage cheating and punish those who are caught.

"I never thought that such schemes were possible. It's a scandal that Femke's entourage have deceived the Belgian federation," he said.
Her sponsors expressed outrage at her breach of trust, and said that they would start their own legal actions.&lt;ref name="McMahon2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bike-investigated-technological-fraud-cycling-world-championships-cyclocross-2016-1 |title=A 19-year-old Belgian cyclist got caught cheating at the world championships after racing a bike that had a motor hidden in the frame

One cyclocross veteran, [[Sven Nys]] expressed shock and disappointment. Managing director Andrea Gastaldello, said he was "stunned" by the news that Van den Driessche competed with a concealed motor in her [[Wilier Triestina]] bike, "Our company will take legal action against the athlete and against any (person) responsible for this very serious matter to safeguard the reputation and image of the company," he said.&lt;ref name="McMahon2"/&gt;

===Aftermath and end of career===
On 14 March 2016, Van den Driessche announced she would not be defending herself in front of the disciplinary committee on March 15.  She cited the heavy suspension demanded by the prosecution and the prohibitive cost of such a procedure in Switzerland.  She said she was being denied the chance of getting a fair trial, as she had already been tried and convicted in the court of public opinion. Van den Driessche also announced her immediate retirement from cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20160314_02181600 |title=Femke Van den Driessche: 'Mijn proces was overal al gevoerd' |newspaper=[[De Standaard]] |accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2016, it was announced by the UCI that Driessche had been banned for six years and would forfeit all results since 10 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uci.ch/pressreleases/the-uci-announces-disciplinary-commission-decision-the-case-femke-van-den-driessche/ |title=The UCI announces Disciplinary Commission decision in the case of Femke Van den Driessche |work=[[Union Cycliste Internationale]] |publisher=[[Union Cycliste Internationale]] |date=26 April 2016 |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Field house''' or '''fieldhouse''' is a common name for indoor sports [[arena]]s and [[stadiums]], mostly used for [[college basketball]], [[volleyball]], or [[ice hockey]].  Additionally it is known to serve as a support building for various adjacent sports fields, i.e. locker room, team room, coaches' offices, etc.  When spelled "'''Field House'''", it may also refer to a residence owned by someone named [[Field (surname)|Field]].

This [[American English]] term dates from the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/field-house Random House Dictionary]'': "1890–95, Americanism"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|fieldhouse}}: "First known use: 1895"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Football pitch metric and imperial.svg|300px|thumb|right|Standard pitch measurements. Not all pitches are the same size, though the preferred size for many professional teams' stadiums is {{convert|105|x|68|m|yd}} with an area of {{convert|7140|m2|ft2 acre ha}}.]]
A '''football pitch''' (also known as a '''football field'''&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/football-development/referees/26293-evolution-of-football-field-markings|title=Evolution of football field markings|date=9 December 2009|author=George Cuming, Manager Project Future Referees|publisher=[[Asian Football Confederation]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023004546/http://www.the-afc.com/en/football-development/referees/26293-evolution-of-football-field-markings|archivedate=23 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''soccer field''') is the playing surface for the game of [[association football]]. Its dimensions and markings are defined by Law 1 of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]], "The Field of Play".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|url=http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/premiership_football_stadiums.html
|title=Premiership football stadiums
|publisher=TalkFootball
|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The surface can either be natural or artificial. Artificial surfaces must be green in colour. The pitch is typically made of [[Sod|turf (grass)]] or [[artificial turf]], although amateur and recreational teams often play on dirt fields.

All line markings on the [[Pitch (sports)|pitch]] form part of the area which they define. For example, a ball on or above the [[touchline]] is still on the field of play, and a foul committed over the line bounding the [[penalty area]] results in a penalty. Therefore, a ball must completely cross the touchline to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line (between the goal posts) before a goal is scored; if any part of the ball is still on or above the line, the ball is still in play.

The field descriptions that apply to adult matches are described below. Note that due to the original formulation of the Laws in England and the early supremacy of the four British football associations within [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]], the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in [[imperial units]]. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate [[SI|metric]] equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), but use of the imperial units remains common in some countries, especially in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Pitch boundary==
[[File:Goal line at Old Trafford 1992.JPG|thumb|right|The Goal line at the Stretford End of [[Old Trafford]] in Manchester (1992)]]
The pitch is rectangular in shape. The longer sides are called [[touchline]]s. The other opposing sides are called the goal lines. The two goal lines must be between {{convert|45|and|90|m|yds|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} and be the same length.&lt;ref name=LOTGp7&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2011/2012|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12e.pdf|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=12 August 2011|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two touch lines must also be of the same length, and be between {{convert|90|and|120|m|yd|-1|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=LOTGp7/&gt; All lines must be equally wide, not to exceed {{convert|12|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=LOTGp7/&gt; The corners of the pitch are marked by corner flags.&lt;ref name=LOTGp8&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2011/2012|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12e.pdf|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=12 August 2011|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For international matches the field dimensions are more tightly constrained; the goal lines must be between {{convert|64|and|75|m|yd|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long and the touch lines must be between {{convert|100|and|110|m|yd|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=LOTGp7/&gt;
In March 2008 the [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]] attempted to standardise the size of the football pitch for international matches and set the official dimensions of a pitch to {{convert|105|by|68|m|yd}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal-line technology put on ice|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/media/news/newsid=707751/|work=IFAB media release|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=12 August 2011|date=8 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at a special meeting of the IFAB on 8 May 2008, it was ruled that this change would be put on hold pending a review and the proposed change has not been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Circular 1145|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/77/82/55/circularno.1145-amendmentstothelawsofthegame-2008.pdf|work=FIFA media release|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ''goal line'' is often taken to mean only that part of the line between the goalposts, in fact it refers to the complete line at either end of the pitch, from one corner flag to the other. In contrast, the term ''byline'' (or ''by-line'') is often used to refer to that portion of the goal line outside the goalposts. This term is commonly used in football commentaries and match descriptions, such as this example from a BBC match report; "Udeze gets to the left byline and his looping cross is cleared..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/2982466.stm Match report] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Scoring in association football}}
[[File:Football goal 20050521.jpg|thumb|A football goal]]
''[[Goal (sport)|Goals]]'' are placed at the centre of each goal-line.&lt;ref name=LOTGp9&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2011/2012|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12e.pdf|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=12 August 2011|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These consist of two upright posts placed equidistant from the corner flagposts, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar. The inner edges of the posts must be {{convert|7.32|m|yd|0}} apart, and the lower edge of the crossbar must be {{convert|2.44|m|ft|0}} above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/81/42/36/log2013en_neutral.pdf|format=PDF|title=Laws of the Game : 2013/2014|website=Fifa.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nets are usually placed behind the goal, though are not required by the Laws.

[[Goalpost]]s and [[Goal (sport)|crossbars]] must be white, and made of wood, metal or other approved material. Rules regarding the shape of goalposts and crossbars are somewhat more lenient, but they must conform to a shape that does not pose a threat to players. Since the beginning of the football there have always been goalposts, but the crossbar wasn't invented until 1875, before which a string between the goalposts was used.&lt;ref name=Hornby12&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornby |first=Hugh|year=2000|title=Football|page=12|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd|isbn=8778267633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Scoring in association football|goal is scored]] when the ball crosses the goal line between the goal-posts, even if a defending player last touched the ball before it crossed the goal line (see [[own goal]]). A goal may, however, be ruled illegal (and void by the referee) if the player who scored or a member of his team commits an offence under any of the laws between the time the ball was previously out of play and the goal being scored. It is also deemed void if a player on the opposing team commits an offence before the ball has passed the line, as in the case of fouls being committed, a penalty awarded but the ball continued on a path that caused it to cross the goal line.

The football goal size for a junior match goal is approximately half the size of an adult sized match goal.&lt;ref name=Quickplay&gt;{{cite web|title=Football Goal Size|url=https://www.quickplaysport.com/football-goal-sizes|publisher=Quickplay Sport|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of football goals and nets===
Football goals were first described in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, [[John Norden]] and [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] referred to "goals" in [[Cornish hurling]]. Carew described how goals were made: "they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Similarly in a poem in 1613, [[Michael Drayton]] refers to "when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe". Solid crossbars were first introduced by the [[Sheffield Rules]]. Football nets were invented by [[Liverpool]] engineer [[John Alexander Brodie|John Brodie]] in 1891,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/blue-plaque-for-man-who-invented-football-goal-net-707003.html |work=The Independent |location=London  | title=Blue plaque for man who invented football goal net | first=Ian | last=Herbert | date=7 July 2000 | accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100406024509/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/blue-plaque-for-man-who-invented-football-goal-net-707003.html| archivedate= 6 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were a necessary help for discussions about whether or not a goal had been scored.&lt;ref name=Hornby13&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornby |first=Hugh|year=2000|title=Football|page=13|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd|isbn=8778267633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalty and goal areas{{anchor|goal area}}==
{{Further|Penalty area}}
[[File:Flickr RangersZenit1.jpg|thumb|right|The ''penalty area'' is the large marked rectangular area. The smaller rectangle within it is the ''goal area'' (here the yellow-shirted goalkeeper is the only player in the goal area). The ''penalty arc'' is the curved line adjoining the "top" of the penalty area (here the red-shirted referee is standing near the arc).]]
Two rectangular boxes are marked out on the pitch in front of each goal.&lt;ref name=LOTGp7/&gt;

The ''goal area'' (colloquially the ''"six-yard box"''), consists of the rectangle formed by the goal-line, two lines starting on the goal-line {{convert|5.5|m|yd|0}} from the goalposts and extending {{convert|5.5|m|yd|0}} into the pitch from the goal-line, and the line joining these. Goal kicks and any free kick by the defending team may be taken from anywhere in this area. Indirect free kicks awarded to the attacking team within the goal area are taken from the point on the line parallel to the goal line (the "six-yard line") nearest where the infringement occurred; they cannot be taken any closer to the goal line. Similarly [[dropped-ball|drop-balls]] that would otherwise occur closer to the goal line are taken on this line.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The ''penalty area'' (colloquially ''"The 18-yard box"'' or just ''"The box"'') is similarly formed by the goal-line and lines extending from it, but its lines start {{convert|16.5|m|yd|0}} from the goalposts and extend {{convert|16.5|m|yd|0}} into the field. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to denote where the [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]] may handle the ball and where a foul by a defender, usually punished by a direct free kick, becomes punishable by a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]. Both the goal and penalty areas were formed as halfcircles until 1902.&lt;ref name=Hornby13/&gt;

The ''penalty mark'' is {{convert|11|m|yd|0}} in front of the very centre of the goal; this is the point from where penalty kicks are taken.

The ''penalty arc'' (colloquially "the D") is marked from the outside edge of the penalty area, {{convert|9.15|m|yd|0}} from the penalty mark; this, along with the penalty area, marks an exclusion zone for all players other than the penalty kicker and defending goalkeeper during a penalty kick.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Other markings==

The ''centre circle'' is marked at {{convert|9.15|m|yds|0}} from the ''centre mark''. Similar to the penalty arc, this indicates the minimum distance that opposing players must keep at [[kick-off (association football)|kick-off]]; the ball itself is placed on the ''centre mark''.&lt;ref name=Hornby13/&gt; During [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] all players other than the two goalkeepers and the current kicker are required to remain within this circle.

The ''half-way line'' divides the pitch in two. The half which a team defends is commonly referred to as being their half. Players must be within their own half at a kick-off and may not be penalised as being [[Offside (association football)|offside]] in their own half. The intersections between the half-way line and the touchline can be indicated with flags like those marking the corners – the laws consider this as an optional feature.&lt;ref name=LOTGp8/&gt;

The arcs in the ''corners'' denote the area (within 1 yard of the corner) in which the ball has to be placed for corner kicks; opposition players have to be {{convert|9.15|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} away during a corner, and there may be optional lines off-pitch 9.15 metres (10 yards) away from the corner arc on the goal- and touch-lines to help gauge these distances.&lt;ref name=LOTGp9 /&gt;

==Turf==
{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}

{{see also|Sports turf}}
Grass is the normal surface of play, although [[artificial turf]] may sometimes be used especially in locations where maintenance of grass may be difficult due to inclement weather. This may include areas where it is very wet, causing the grass to deteriorate rapidly; where it is very dry, causing the grass to die; and where the turf is under heavy use. Artificial turf pitches are also increasingly common on the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], due to the amount of snow during the winter months. The strain put on grass pitches by the cold climate and subsequent snow clearing has necessitated the installation of artificial turf in the stadia of many top-tier clubs in Norway, Sweden and Finland. The latest artificial surfaces use rubber crumbs, as opposed to the previous system of sand infill. Some leagues and football associations have specifically prohibited artificial surfaces due to injury concerns and require teams' home stadia to have grass pitches. All artificial turf must be green and also meet the requirements specified in the FIFA Quality Concept for Football Turf.&lt;ref name=LOTGp6&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2011/2012|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12e.pdf|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=12 August 2011|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=artturf&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Quality Concept for Football Turf|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/pitchequip/fqc_football_turf_folder_342.pdf|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Quality Concept|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/pitchequip/fqc_football_turf_folder_342.pdf|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Football can also be played on a dirt field.  In most parts of the world, dirt is only used for casual recreational play.

The following is a glossary of traditional English-language terms used in the three overarching [[cue sports]] disciplines: ''[[carom billiards|carom (or carambole) billiards]]'' referring to the various {{gli|carom}} games played on a [[billiard table]] without {{gli|pockets}}; ''[[Pool (cue sports)|pool (pocket billiards)]]'', which denotes a host of games played on a table with six pockets; and ''[[snooker]]'', played on a large pocket table, and which has a sport culture unto itself distinct from pool. There are also hybrid pocket/carom games such as [[English billiards]].
{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=y}}

==Definitions and language==
The term "{{gli|billiards}}" is sometimes used to refer to all of the cue sports, to a specific class of them, or to specific ones such as English billiards; this article uses the term in its most generic sense unless otherwise noted.

The labels "[[British English|British]]" and "[[United Kingdom|UK]]" as applied to entries in this glossary refer to terms originating in the UK and also used in countries that were fairly recently part of the [[British Empire]] and/or are part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], as opposed to [[US English|US]] (and, often, [[Canadian English|Canadian]]) terminology.  The terms "American" or "US" as applied here refer generally to North American usage.  However, due to the predominance of US-originating terminology in most internationally competitive pool (as opposed to snooker), US terms are also common in the pool context in other countries in which English is at least a minority language, and US (and borrowed French) terms predominate in carom billiards. Similarly, British terms predominate in the world of snooker, English billiards and blackball, regardless of the players' nationalities.

The term "blackball" is used in this glossary to refer to both [[Blackball (pool)|blackball and eight-ball pool]] as played in the Commonwealth, as a shorthand.  Blackball was chosen because it is less ambiguous ("eight-ball pool" is too easily confused with the related "[[eight-ball]]"), and blackball is globally standardized by an [[International Olympic Committee]]-recognized [[Sports governing body|governing body]], the [[World Pool-Billiard Association]] (WPA); meanwhile, its ancestor, eight-ball pool, is largely a folk game, like North American {{gli|bar pool}}, and to the extent that its rules have been codified, they have been done so by competing authorities with different rulesets.  (For the same reason, the glossary's information on eight-ball and [[nine-ball]] draws principally on the stable WPA rules, because there are many competing amateur leagues and even professional tours with divergent rules for these games.)

Foreign-language terms are generally not within the scope of this list, unless they have become an integral part of billiards terminology in English (e.g. {{gli|massé|{{lang|fr|massé|nocat=y}}}}), or they are crucial to meaningful discussion of a game not widely known in the English-speaking world.

==A==
{{Glossary}}

{{Term| above }}
&lt;dd&gt; Used in [[snooker]] in reference to the position of the {{gli|cue ball}}. It is above the {{gli|object ball}} if it is off-straight on the {{gli|baulk cushion}} side of the imaginary line for a straight {{gli|pot}} (e.g. "he'll want to finish above the {{gli|blue ball|blue}} in order to go into the {{gli|pink ball|pink}} and {{gli|red ball|reds}}"). It is also common to use the term {{gli|high}} instead.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| action }}

{{Term|term= ahead race |content=ahead race {{anchor|ahead session|ahead-race|ahead-session}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; ''Also '''ahead session'''.''
A {{gli|match}} format in which a player has to establish a lead of an agreed number of {{gli|frame|frames}} ({{gli|game|games}}) in order to win (e.g. in a ten ahead race a player wins when she/he has won ten more {{gli|rack (noun)|racks}} than the opponent).&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; ''Contrast {{gli|race|race [to]}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| aiming line }}
&lt;dd&gt; An imaginary line drawn from the desired path an {{gli|object ball}} is to be sent (usually the center of a {{gli|pocket}}) and the center of the object ball.&lt;ref name="Idiot"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Ewa Mataya Laurance]] and Thomas C.

{{Term| anchor }}
&lt;dd&gt; To {{gli|frozen|freeze}} a ball to a {{gli|cushion}}; such a ball may be said to be '''anchored''' (British: {{gli|tight}}).  This term is largely obsolete [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline billiards]] jargon.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{rp|9}} &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| anchor nurse }}
&lt;dd&gt; A type of {{gli|nurse|nurse shot}} used in [[carom billiards]] games. With one {{gli|object ball}} being {{gli|anchor|anchored}} ({{gli|frozen}}, British: {{gli|tight}}) to a {{gli|cushion}} and the second object ball just slightly away from the cushion, the {{gli|cue ball}} is gently grazed across the face of both balls, freezing the away ball to the rail and moving the frozen ball away the same distance its partner was previously, in an identical but reversed configuration, in position to be struck again by the cue ball from the opposite side to repeat this pattern, back and forth.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{rp|9}} ''Compare {{gli|cradle cannon}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| anchor space }}
&lt;dd&gt; A {{convert|7|in|adj=on}} square box drawn on [[Billiard table|the table]] in [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline billiards]], from the termination of a {{gli|balkline}} with the {{gli|cushion}}, thus defining a restricted space in which only 3 {{gli|point|points}} may be scored before one ball must be driven from the area. It developed to curtail the effectiveness of the {{gli|chuck nurse}}, which in turn had been invented to thwart the effectiveness of {{gli|Parker's box}} in stopping long, repetitive runs using the {{gli|anchor nurse}}.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| angle of incidence }}
&lt;dd&gt; The angle at which a ball approaches a {{gli|cushion}}, as measured from the [[perpendicular]] to the cushion.&lt;ref name="Knuchell"/&gt;{{rp|120}}  The phrase has been in use since as early as 1653.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| angle of reflection }}
&lt;dd&gt; The angle from which a ball rebounds from a {{gli|cushion}}, as measured from the [[perpendicular]] to the cushion.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knuchell"/&gt;{{rp|120}} &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= angled ball |content=angled ball {{anchor|angled}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; In [[snooker]] and [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]], a {{gli|cue ball}} situated in the {{gli|jaws}} of a pocket such that a/the {{gli|ball-on}} cannot be struck directly.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;{{rp|32}} ''Compare {{gli|corner-hooked}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| arc }}
&lt;dd&gt; The extent to which the {{gli|cue ball}} curves as a result of a {{gli|semi-massé|semi-{{lang|fr|massé|nocat=y}}}} or {{gli|massé|{{lang|fr|massé|nocat=y}} shot}}. &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= apex |content=apex {{anchor|apex ball|apex of the triangle|apex of the diamond|apex of the rack|apex of the pack}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; {{ghat|Also '''apex ball''', '''apex of the triangle''', '''apex of the diamond''' or '''apex of the rack'''.}}
The ball placed at the front of a group of {{gli|rack|racked}} {{gli|object ball|object balls}} (i.e., toward the {{gli|break|breaker}} and furthest from the racker), and in most games situated over the table's {{gli|foot spot}}.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;{{rp|32}} &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| around the table }}
&lt;dd&gt; In carom games, a shot in which in attempting to score, the cue ball contacts three or more {{gli|cushion|cushions}}, usually including both {{gli|short rail|short rails}}.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| around the houses }}
&lt;dd&gt; Used in snooker to describe the path that the {{gli|cue ball}} must take into and out of {{gli|baulk}} as a result of poor {{gli|position|position play}}, specifically coming around the {{gli|baulk colours}} off 3 or more {{gli|cushion|cushions}}, normally on a shot on the {{gli|blue ball|blue}} to finish on a {{gli|red ball|red}} as a result of finishing {{gli|low}} on the blue. &lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt; A {{gli|cut shot}} in which if a line were drawn from the {{gli|cue ball}} to the {{gli|rail}} behind the targeted {{gli|object ball}}, perpendicular to that rail, the object ball would lie beyond the line with respect to the {{gli|pocket}} being targeted.&lt;ref name="Brandt"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brandt | first = Dale | year = 2006 | title = A Pool Player's Journey | publisher = Vantage Press, Inc | location = [[New York, NY]]| isbn = 978-0-533-15176-9 |pages= 86, 91–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt; {{Main|Baize}}
A coarse woolen cloth used to cover billiard tables, usually green in colour. Sometimes called [[felt]], based on a similarity in appearance, though very different in makeup.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| balance point }}
&lt;dd&gt; The point, usually around 18 in. from the bottom of a {{gli|cue}}, at which the cue will balance when resting on one hand.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;{{rp|32}} &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| balk }}
{{Defn|1=
{{ghat|Also '''balk space'''.}}
1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;An area defined on a [[billiard table]] by one or more {{gli|balkline|balklines}}.  In the eponymous game of [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline billiards]], there are eight balks defined by perpendicular balklines, in which only a set number of {{gli|carom|caroms}} may be scored before at least one ball must leave the area.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{Rp|15}}  In the earlier (and short-lived) "[[Balkline and straight rail#The ascendancy of balkline|champions' game]]", there were four triangular balks, one at each corner, defined by single diagonal balklines. ''Not to be confused with {{gli|baulk}}, but see second definition.'' }}
{{Defn|no=2|1=An area defined on a [[billiard table]], in games such as [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]], [[snooker]], [[English billiards]] and [[bagatelle]], by a single {{gli|balkline}} (drawn or imaginary) that runs across the table near the {{gli|head}} ({{gli|bottom}}) end; exactly where depends upon table type and size. This balk is where the cue ball is placed in {{gli|lag|lagging}} for lead, for making the opening {{gli|break}} shot, and sometimes for other purposes, depending upon the game.  This usage of "balk" is strictly technical, and rarely used in practice. In pool, this area is called the {{gli|kitchen}} and is divided from the rest of the table by the {{gli|head string}}, while in snooker, English billiards and [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]] it is the somewhat differently sized and delimited {{gli|baulk}}, defined by the {{gli|baulk line}}. On baulk tables, which have {{gli|"D", the|a "D"}} inside baulk, and on pool tables with a {{gli|break box}} in the kitchen, the actual area from which to shoot is even smaller than the baulk or kitchen, respectively – a balk within the balk. }}

{{Term| balkline }}
{{Defn|1=
{{ghat|Also '''balk line'''.}}
1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A line drawn horizontally from a point on a [[billiard table]]'s {{gli|rail}} to the corresponding point on the opposite rail, thus defining a region (a {{gli|balk}}). In the eponymous [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline billiards]] there are four balklines, drawn parallel to and typically 14 or 18&amp;nbsp;inches from the cushions of the table, dividing it into nine compartments or divisions, of which the outside eight are the balks. in which only a set number of caroms may be scored before at least one ball must leave the area.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{Rp|15}} ''Not to be confused with {{gli|baulk line}}, though the concepts and etymologies are related. See {{gli|balk}}, second definition.'' }}
{{Defn|no=2|1=Formerly, in "[[Balkline and straight rail#The ascendancy of balkline|the champions' game]]", a line drawn diagonally from a {{gli|long rail|long}} to a {{gli|short rail}} at the corners of the [[Billiard table|table]], defining a triangular {{gli|balk|balk space}} at each. }}
{{Defn|no=3|1=A type of [[carom billiards]] game, called [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline billiards]], created to eliminate very high {{gli|run|runs}} in [[Balkline and straight rail|straight-rail]] that relied on repetitive {{gli|nurse|nurse shots}}.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{Rp|15}} }}

{{Term|term= ball-and-pocket |content=ball-and-pocket {{anchor|ball and pocket}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; ''Same as {{gli|call-shot}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= ball-in-hand |content=ball-in-hand {{anchor|ball in hand|cue ball in-hand|cueball in-hand|cue ball in hand|cueball in hand|cue-ball-in-hand|cueball-in-hand}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; ''Also '''cue ball in-hand'''.''
The option of placing the {{gli|cue ball}} anywhere on the table prior to shooting, in a game of [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]]. Usually only available to a player when the opposing player has committed some type of {{gli|foul}} under a particular game's rules&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;{{rp|32, 36}} (cf. the [[free throw]] in [[basketball]] by way of comparison). ''See also {{gli|in-hand}} for the [[snooker]] definition.'' A common variation, used in games such as [[straight pool]] and often in {{gli|bar pool}}, is ball-in-hand "behind the head string", also "behind the line" or "from the kitchen", meaning the ball-in-hand option is restricted to placement anywhere behind the {{gli|head string}}, i.e., in the area of [[Billiard table|the table]] known as the {{gli|kitchen}}. &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= ball-on |content=ball-on {{anchor|ball on|balls-on|balls on|on ball|on-ball|on balls|on-balls}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; {{ghat|Not always hyphenated. Plural: '''balls-on'''.&lt;ref name="WEPFRules"/&gt; Also '''on[-]ball'''.}}
Any legally strikeable ball on the table in snooker and generally British terminology.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; For example, in [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]],&lt;ref name="WEPFRules"/&gt; if a player is playing {{gli|yellow ball|yellows}}, any yellow ball (or any solid, from 1 to 7, if using a solids-and-stripes ball set) can be the ball-on until they are all {{gli|pot|potted}}, in which case the 8 ball is the ball-on. In [[snooker]], at the beginning of a player's turn, unless all are already potted, any {{gli|red ball}} can be the ball-on.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;  ''Compare {{gli|object ball}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;A collection bin mounted below the foot end of a table, to which balls potted in any pocket will return by means of gravity-assisted gutters or troughs running from each pocket opening to the bin; these are the '''ball-return mechanism''', which may be internal to the table or an external gutter system. Ball returns have been in use since at least the 1700s. Pockets which simply collect balls are known as {{gli|drop pockets}}.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; A table without a ball return may be called a "drop pocket table", while a table featuring a ball return may be called a "gully table".&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;{{rp|37, 39}} Coin-operated {{gli|bar table|bar tables}} have ball-return mechanisms that separate the {{gli|cue ball}} from the {{gli|object ball|object balls}} so that the object balls are captured when pocketed until the game ends, then released when paid for again, while the cue ball is continually returned for continued play after {{gli|scratch|scratches}}. This type of table can use a variety of methods to distinguish the cue ball from object balls including the {{gli|Magnetic cue ball}}, the dense ceramic "{{gli|rock}}" and the oversized "{{gli|grapefruit}}" ball. Ball return mechanisms have also been devised that use a smaller, lighter cue ball, instead of a magnetic or heavier one. There are tables that use optical sensors to distinguish a standard cue ball from object balls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.diamondbilliards.com/CommercialTables/SmartTable.aspx |title=The Smart Table Coin-op |publisher=Diamond Billiard Products |work=DiamondBilliards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt; A rule variant common in {{gli|bar pool}} versions of [[eight-ball]], in which the 8-ball must be pocketed on a {{gli|bank shot}} (generally this would either be accomplished via a bank shot proper or a {{gli|kick shot}}); shooting the 8 straight in is a loss of game. Players may agree before the game begins to invoke this rule, or one player may challenge another player (who might accept or refuse) to conclude the game in this manner after it is already under way. Playing bank-the-8 can be considered rude if many other players are waiting to use the table, since it often makes the game last considerably longer. Often on bar tables three scratches determines a loss. The same with last-pocket.&lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= bar player |content=bar player {{anchor|bar players|bar league|bar league player}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; ''Also '''bar league player'''.''
A player that predominantly plays in [[bar (establishment)|bars]]/[[Public house|pubs]], or is in a bar-based pool league. Often used pejoratively by [[pool hall]] players to refer to a perceived lesser skill level of such players. ''See also {{gli|bar pool}}, {{gli|bar table}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= bar pool |content=bar pool {{anchor|bar rules|pub pool|pub rules|tavern pool}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; {{ghat|Also '''bar rules''', '''pub pool''', '''tavern pool'''.}}
[[Pool (cue sports)|Pool]], almost always a variant of [[eight-ball]], that is played by {{gli|bar player|bar players}} on a {{gli|bar table}}. Bar pool has rules that vary from region to region, sometimes even from venue to venue in the same city, especially in the U.S. Wise players thus ensure understanding of and agreement to the rules before engaging in a {{gli|money game}} under bar rules. Typical differences between bar pool and tournament eight-ball are the lack of {{gli|ball-in-hand}} after a {{gli|foul}}, the elimination of a number of fouls, and (with numbered ball sets) the requirement that most aspects of a shot be {{gli|call shot|called}} (including {{gli|cushion|cushions}} and other {{gli|object ball|object balls}} to be contacted) not just the {{gli|target ball}} and {{gli|pocket}}. Bar pool has evolved into this "nitpicky" version principally to make the games last longer, since bar pool is typically played on coin-operated tables that cost money per-game rather than per-hour. Competitive league pool played on bar tables, however, usually uses international, national or local/regional league rules, and is not what is usually meant by "bar pool". ''Not to be confused with the game of [[bar billiards]].'' &lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dd&gt; {{ghat|Also '''bar box''', '''pub table''', '''tavern table''', '''coin-operated table''', '''coin-op table'''.}}
A distinctive size of pool table found in [[bar (establishment)|bars]]/[[Public house|pubs]]/[[tavern]]s as well as various other venues such as [[family entertainment center]]s and [[Video arcade|arcade rooms]] at [[bowling alley]]s. These are smaller than the full-size tables found in [[pool halls]]. While typical professional and competition tables are {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} × {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} or {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} × {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}}, bar boxes are typically {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} × {{convert|3.5|ft|m|abbr=on}}. However, 4×8 and even 3×6 examples can sometimes be found. In bars they are almost always coin-operated. Most North American brands of bar tables have pocket proportions opposite those of regular tables in that the side pockets are remarkably tight while the corners are more generous and are therefore considered irregular. Another factor is the cue ball; these tables capture {{gli|object balls}} to minimize replays, but selectively return the cue ball by identifying it mechanically to allow complete games. To do this they employ one of two mechanisms to return a {{gli|scratch|scratched}} cue ball; these are oversized or extra-dense. Because these cue balls do not play as competition cue balls (especially with regard to {{gli|cut shot|cut}} (due to their larger size) and {{gli|stop shot|stop}}/{{gli|draw shot|draw}} shots (due to their larger mass) respectively, they change the characteristics of the cue ball and are therefore deprecated by aficionados. {{gli|smash-through}}). However, modern bar tables make use of a magnetic core with a regulation or near-regulation size and weight paired with a magnet mechanism within the table's {{gli|ball return}} system that separates out the cue ball without requiring cue ball characteristics that affect play.&lt;ref name="RGivens"&gt;{{cite book

''Not to be confused with the carom billiards concept of a {{gli|big ball}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| big ball }}
&lt;dd&gt; A [[carom billiards]] metaphor, it refers to an object ball positioned and being approached in such a manner that a near miss will rebound off a cushion and still score. It is ''as if'' the ball were larger than normal, making it easier to contact. Normally a ball a couple inches from a rail is a big ball, but only if being approached from an angle and if all the prerequisite rails have already been contacted. A ball near a corner can effectively be a foot wide.
Not to be confused with the eight-ball term "the big balls". In older British usage the concept was referred to as "large ball".&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; ''See also "{{gli|big pocket}}".'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| big pocket }}
&lt;dd&gt; A [[pocket billiards]] and occasionally [[snooker]] term (inherited from carom billiards by way of "{{gli|big ball}}", above), it is a metaphor for a shot that is very difficult to miss pocketing for any of a number of reasons, most commonly either because the object ball is positioned such that a near miss on one side of it will likely cause the cue ball to rebound into the object ball off the rail and pocket it anyway, or another ball is positioned such that if the target ball does not go straight in, it is still likely to go in off the other ball in a {{gli|kiss}}. It is ''as if'' the pocket, for this one shot, had become larger. The term can also refer to the angle of shot toward a pocket, especially a side pocket; the pocket is said to be "bigger", for example, on a shot that is only a 5-degree angle away from straight on, than on a 45-degree angle shot which is much more likely to hit one of the cushion points and bounce away. &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| calcutta }}
&lt;dd&gt; A player's auction at a pool tournament. Each player is called and players and spectators bid on the player. The highest bidder(s) pays their bid to the calcutta, and by doing so invest in that player's success. If a player wins or places in the tournament, those who "bought" the player receive a percentage of the total calcutta payout, usually tracking the percentage payout of the tournament prize fund. Typically, players have the option of purchasing half of themselves when the high bid is won by a third party.  Like {{gli|english|{{Not a typo|english}}}} and {{gli|scotch doubles}}, usually not capitalized. &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| call }}
&lt;dd&gt; Any instance of a player having to say what they are about to do. For example, in [[straight pool]] a player must ''call'' the pocket in which a ball is intended to be potted. More formal terms, used in rule books and instructional materials, include {{gli|designate}} and {{gli|nominate}}. ''Contrast {{gli|fish}}, {{gli|slop}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term|term= call-safe |content=call-safe {{anchor|called-safe|call safe|called safe|call-safety|called-safety|call safety|called safety}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; {{ghat|Also '''called-safe'''}}
Applies specifically to games that enforce "{{cuegloss|call-pocket}}/call-safe" rules, which require the player to either call the ball and pocket, or call a {{cuegloss|safety}} on every shot.  After a legal shot, where a called ball is not pocketed as designated, the incoming player has the option to pass the shot back to the player who missed the called shot.  If a player calls "safe", then after a legal shot, the incoming player must accept the next shot, and may not pass the shot back to the player who called "safe".&lt;ref name="ABC rulebook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rulebook: Guidelines for American Rotation (AR)|url= http://AmericanBilliardClub.com/play/rulebook/ |work=AmericanBilliardClub.com  |publisher=American Billiard Club |first=Joe |last=Tucker|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A call-shot/call-safe [[nine-ball]] example: Player A calls the {{cuegloss|ball-on}}, the 3 ball in this case, in the corner pocket but misses the shot.

Describes any game in which during normal play a player must call the ball to be hit and the intended pocket; "eight-ball is a call-shot game."&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; Sometimes referred to as "call[ed]-pocket", "{{gli|ball-and-pocket}} rules", etc., to distinguish it from the common North American {{gli|bar pool}} practice of requiring every ''aspect'' of shots to be called, such as {{gli|carom|caroms}}, {{gli|kick|kicks}}, and {{gli|cushion|cushions}} to be contacted (this is sometimes also ambiguously referred to as "call-shot", but more  accurately termed "call-everything" or "call-it-all"). Commonly in bar rules terminology, call-shot indicates how the shot will be made as compared to call-pocket which means simply that the ball must go into that pocket, details unnecessary. Though technically all shots are called shots, obvious shots are seldom actually called; however, you must still make what was intended.

{{Term|term= cheat the pocket |content=cheat the pocket {{anchor|cheat-the-pocket|cheating the pocket|cheating-the-pocket}}}}
&lt;dd&gt; To aim at an object ball such that it will enter one side or the other, rather than the center, of a pocket. This permits the cue ball to strike the object ball at a different contact point than the most obvious one. Cheating the pocket is employed for {{gli|position play}}, to allow a ball to pass another partially obscuring the path to the pocket, and to prevent {{gli|scratch|scratches}} on dead-straight shots in cases where draw is not desirable (or may not be dependable, e.g. because of distance from the pocket or {{gli|smash-through}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capelle|first=Philip B.|title=Play Your Best Pool|publisher=Billiards Press|year=1995|page=17|isbn=978-0-9649204-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| check side }}

''Compare {{gli|break and run}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| cling }}
&lt;dd&gt; Phenomenon where two balls, (usually the {{gli|cue ball}} and an {{gli|object ball}}) have some foreign material (often residual {{gli|chalk}} or dirt picked up from unbrushed cloth) between them at the point of contact, resulting in the struck object ball being thrown offline from the expected trajectory, and often also affecting the post-impact path of the cue ball. A typical precaution against cling is to ask for the cue ball and/or object ball to be cleaned by the referee in order to remove chalk that is already on the ball prior to the shot. The table cloth should also be clean. However, no precaution can ward against cling resulting from chalk transferred from the cue tip to the cue ball during a single shot. Coincidental cling can therefore cause unpredictable play and occasionally lead to rudimentary shots being missed at even the highest levels of the game.&lt;ref name="BBC4304501"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/video_and_audio/help_guide/4304501.stm BBC Sport video] investigating the cause of {{gli|cling}} (a.k.a. {{gli|kick|kicks}} or {{gli|skid}}); retrieved 4 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  "Cling" (and derived words like "clung", "clinger", "clinging", etc.) may be used as a mass noun, less commonly as a count noun, as a verb, and rarely as an adjective ("cling is annoying", "two clings in one frame", "they clung", "unintentional cling shot", respectively).

{{Term| cloth }}
&lt;dd&gt; The [[baize]] cloth covering the tables playing surface and rails, usually made from wool or a wool-nylon blend. In use since the 15th century, cloth is traditionally green-colored, chosen for its evocation of grass. Sometimes cloth is improperly referred to as "felt." The properties of the cloth used to cover a table, as well as environmental conditions that can affect it—notably humidity, the degree it has been stretched when installed, and its level of cleanness—have a profound effect on play.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt;{{rp|53}} ''See also {{gli|fast}}.'' &lt;/dd&gt;

{{Term| draw }}
{{Defn|1= Also known as {{gli|back spin}}, a type of spin applied to the {{gli|cue ball}} by hitting it below its {{gli|equator}}, causing it to spin backwards even as it slides forward on the cloth. Back spin slows the cue ball down, reduces its travel, and narrows both the {{gli|carom|carom angle}} after contact with an {{gli|object ball}}, and {{gli|angle of reflection}} off a {{gli|cushion}}. There are several variant terms for this, including "bottom" and "bottom spin" in the US and "screw" in the UK.

{{Term| eight-ball |content=eight-ball {{anchor|eight-ball|eightball|eight ball}}}}
{{Defn|1= One of several games ultimately derived from a game called B.B.C. Company pool, promulgated by the [[Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company]] from around 1900 to the 1920s. They have in common the use of a {{gli|rack}} of fifteen {{gli|object ball|object balls}} and a single {{gli|cue ball}}, a hard {{gli|break}} from behind the {{gli|head string}} or {{gli|baulk line}}, and a goal of {{gli|pocket|pocketing}} ({{gli|pot|potting}}) all of one's own {{gli|suit}} of balls then finally the black 8 ball.  There are three general types of this game:
* [[eight-ball]], an originally American and now internationally standardized professional version, also subject to competitive team play in numerous leagues. It is the most-played form of competition pool in the world, though not for professionals, among whom [[nine-ball]] dominates.  Uses a set of {{gli|stripes|striped}} and {{gli|solids|solid}} numbered balls. Ball-and-pocket are {{gli|call pocket|called}} for each shot, with {{gli|foul|fouls}} ({{gli|fault|faults}}) resulting in {{gli|ball-in-hand|cue ball in-hand}} for the opponent, anywhere on the table.
* [[Blackball (pool)|blackball]] a.k.a. eightball pool, an originally British variant, also favoured in many Commonwealth countries, and parts of Continental Europe, with amateur and professional leagues.  The two names reflect slightly variant rulesets, which differ primarily in handling of {{gli|fault|faults}} ({{gli|foul|fouls}}). Shots are not {{gli|call shot|called}}. Uses a set of {{gli|yellows|yellow}} and {{gli|reds|red}} balls. {{gli|Pub pool}} usually consists of minor local variations on one of these two standardised rule sets.
* "straight eight" a.k.a. {{gli|bar pool}}, a widely divergent set of variations on standard eight-ball, and also using the stripes-and-solids ball set.  Usually requires a very strict version of {{gli|called-shot}} play, in which every aspect of a shot must be pre-specified, including {{gli|kiss|kisses}}, {{gli|carom|caroms}}, {{gli|kick|kicks}}, and {{gli|bank|banks}}, with loss of turn resulting from any deviation. Outright {{gli|foul|fouls}} ({{gli|fault|faults}}) result in {{gli|ball-in-hand|cue ball in-hand}} for the opponent, behind the {{gli|head string}} only. Rules may vary from venue to venue even within the same city.  These variants arose primarily to drag out the game on coin-operated tables ("{{gli|bar box|bar boxes}}").  In North America, many casual recreational players are unaware any other form of pool exists beyond bar pool.

{{Term| foul }}
{{Defn|1=
{{ghat|Sometimes interchangeable with {{gli|scratch}}, though the latter is often used only to refer to the foul of pocketing the cue ball.}}
A violation of a particular game's rules for which a set penalty is imposed. In many pool games the penalty for a foul is ball-in-hand anywhere on the table for the opponent. In some games such as straight pool, a foul results in a loss of one or more points. In one-pocket, in which a set number of balls must be made in a specific pocket, upon a foul the player must return a ball to the table. In some games, three successive fouls in a row is a loss of game. In straight pool, a third successive foul results in a loss of 16 points (15 plus one for the foul).&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt;

[[File:Snooker Freeball.png|thumb|right|200px|Freeball situation. Red is snookered, Blue can be called.]]
A situation where a player has {{gli|foul|fouled}}, leaving the opponent {{gli|snooker|snookered}}. In [[Eight-ball#UK|UK eight-ball]] this would normally give the opponent the option of one of two plays: (1) {{gli|ball-in-hand}} with {{gli|two shots}}; (2) being allowed to contact, or even {{gli|pot}}, a ball other than one from his/her set from the snookered position (although the black may not be potted), with the loss of the first shot.  In addition, some variations of the game allow the player to pot one of the opposition's balls, on the first visit only, without the loss of a "free shot".

In [[snooker]] it allows a player to call any ball as the ball she/he would have wanted to play, potting it for the same number of points, or the opponent can be put back in without the same privilege, having to play the ball snookered on. The definition of ''snooker'' on this occasion means the opponent cannot strike both extreme edges of the {{gli|object ball}} (or a cluster of touching balls).&lt;!-- Not sure this agrees with what is said at [[#two shots]] and [[#two-shot carry]]. --&gt; }}

An informal approach to the "call-everything" variation of {{gli|call-shot}}, common in {{gli|bar pool}}.

{{Term| ghost ball }}
{{Defn|1= A common aiming method in which a phantom ball is imagined {{gli|frozen}} to the object ball at the point where an imaginary line drawn between their centers is aimed at the desired target; the cue ball may then be shot at the center of the "ghost" ball and, ideally, impact the object ball at the proper aiming contact point.&lt;ref name="Brandt"/&gt; The ghost ball method of aiming results in misses where adjustment is not made for {{gli|collision-induced throw|collision induced throw}}. }}

{{Term| grapefruit }}
{{Defn|1= Colloquial term for an unusually large, heavy {{gli|cue ball}} made of the same [[phenolic resin]] or other modern, resilient plastic as the {{gli|object ball|object balls}}. "Grapefruit" cue balls are frequently found on older coin-operated {{gli|bar table|bar tables}} that do not have magnetic {{gli|ball return|ball-return}} mechanisms. As with excessively dense, ceramic "{{gli|rock}}" cue balls, the ball return works because the cue ball is considerably heavier than, and thereby distinguishable from, the object balls. Unlike "rocks", grapefruit balls are not prone to excessive equipment wear and tear.  But because of their unusually large size, they have a very strong affect on the {{gli|tangent line}} and thus on the accuracy of {{gli|cut|cut shots}}. Their weight also has a notable effect on play, as they are somewhat more difficult to {{gli|draw}} ({{gli|screw}}), {{gli|stop shot|stop}} and {{gli|stun}} compared to standard and {{gli|magnetic cue ball|magnetic cue balls}}, but not to the extent of the much less resilient rock balls.

{{Term| half-ball hit }}
{{Defn|1= [[File:Billiards half-ball striking diagram.png|thumb|right|350px|Half-ball striking]]A shot aimed so that the center of the cue ball is in line with the edge of the object ball, eclipsing half of the ball. "Hit it just a little thinner than half-ball." Assuming a {{gli|cling}} does not occur, the shot will impart post-contact momentum on the object ball in a direction 30° (which is &lt;math&gt;\arcsin(1-x)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of object ball eclipsed: {{frac|1|2}} in this case) off the direction of the cue-ball's pre-contact momentum. Also notable because the carom angle the cue ball takes is more consistent than at other contact points. }}

{{Term| half-century }}
{{Defn|1= In [[snooker]] and other British usages, a {{gli|break}} of 50–99 points (100 points or more being called a century), which involves {{gli|pot|potting}} at least 12 consecutive balls (i.e. the last 3 reds with at least 2 blacks and a pink, followed by all the colours). }}

Said of a ball, to come to rest partially over the edge of a {{gli|pocket}}'s {{gli|fall}} but still resting on the table {{gli|bed}}.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999"/&gt;{{rp|121}}  Because of ball curvature, if the very bottom of the ball is not over the sharp rim or beveled slope (depending on table type) of the pocket's fall, the ball will not drop into the pocket. As much as approximately 49% of a ball's diameter can be hanging over the sharp drop of a standard snooker table fall, but considerably less on a typical pool table, with beveled falls.&lt;!--This is basic physics and geometry logic, requiring no citation.--&gt;  A ball '''hanging''' in the pocket – a "{{gli|hanger}}" – is nearly unmissable&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999"/&gt;{{rp|121}} (though {{gli|foul|fouling}} by {{gli|scratch|scratching}} the {{gli|cue ball}} into the pocket right after the {{gli|object ball}} is a common mistake.

{{Term| hazard }}
{{Defn|no=1|1=Literally, a {{gli|pocket}}, but generally used in the phrases {{gli|losing hazard}} – {{gli|pot|potting}} ({{gli|pocket|pocketing}}) the {{gli|cue ball}} off another ball – and {{gli|winning hazard}} – using the cue ball to pot another ball – the two types of legal shots that pocket balls in games in which the term is used at all, which is very few today. The term principally survives in [[English billiards]], in which both types of shots are {{gli|point}}-scoring.  Formerly, a large number of different games made use of the two types of hazards as point scorers or losers in various ways (thus their suggestive names).  The term ultimately derives from holes or pockets in the table to be avoided, in very early forms of billiards.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999"/&gt;{{rp|121, 148, 275}}  While the terms are disused in [[pocket billiards]] today, their lingering effect is obvious, as the vast bulk of such games focus on making winning hazards and avoiding losing hazards (a notable exception being [[Russian pyramid]] in which both are legal shots). }}
{{Defn|no=2|1=In [[golf billiards]], an area of the table (sometimes marked) that a player will be penalized for entering if their ball does not leave.  Derives from the use of the term in the outdoor game of [[golf]].&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999"/&gt;{{Rp|120}} }}

{{Term| head }}

{{Term| head spot }}
{{Defn|1= The intersection of the {{gli|head string}} and {{gli|long string}}, which is usually not marked on a table with a spot decal or other mark, unlike the {{gli|foot spot}}, though some [[pool hall]]s mark both spots so that racking can be done at either end of the table, and wear on {{gli|cloth|the cloth}} from racking and breaking is more evenly distributed.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; ''Compare {{gli|baulk spot}}.'' }}

{{Term| head string }}
{{Defn|1= A line, sometimes imaginary (especially in American [[Pocket billiards|pool]]), sometimes drawn on the cloth, that runs horizontally across the table from the second {{gli|diamond}} (from the {{gli|head rail}}) on one {{gli|long rail}} to the corresponding second diamond on the other long rail.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; In most pool games, the opening break shot must be performed with the center (base) of the cue ball behind the head string (i.e. between the head string and head rail). The head string intersects the {{gli|long string}} at the {{gli|head spot}}, and delimits the {{gli|kitchen}} (and, in European [[nine-ball]], the outer boundary of the {{gli|break box}}).  The head string's position is always determined by the diamonds, in contrast to the similar but different {{gli|baulk line}}, the position of which is determined by measurement from the {{gli|bottom cushion}} ({{gli|head cushion}}). }}

{{Defn|no=2|1=With {{gli|follow}}, as in "I shot that high left", meaning "I shot that with follow and with left {{gli|english|{{Not a typo|english}}}}". Derives from the fact that one must aim above the {{gli|cue ball}}'s equator, i.e. "high" on the ball, to impart follow.

Jump shots must be performed by hitting the {{gli|cue ball}} into the table's surface so that it rebounds from the {{gli|cloth}}.

{{Term| kitchen }}
{{Defn|1= The area on the table behind the {{gli|head string}}.&lt;ref name="BCA"/&gt; The origin of the term has been the subject of some speculation but the best explanation known is that in the 1800s, many homes did not have room for both a billiard table and a dining room table. The solution was a billiards table that had a cover converting it into a dining table. Kept in the dining room, play on such a table was often restricted by the size of the room, so it would be placed so that the head rail would face the connected kitchen door, thus affording a player room for the backswing without hitting a wall. A player was therefore either half or sometimes fully (literally) "in the kitchen" when breaking the balls.&lt;ref name="TIEOB"/&gt; ''See also {{gli|baulk}}.'' }}

{{Defn|1= Also '''the lag''' (as a noun) '''lagging''', '''lag for the break''' and '''lagging for the break'''. 
To determine the order of play, players (representing only themselves, or sometimes teams) each near simultaneously shoot a ball from the {{gli|kitchen}} (or in British games, from the {{gli|baulk line}}) to the {{gli|end rail}} and back toward the {{gli|bottom rail}}. Whichever shooter's ball comes to rest closest to the bottom rail gets to choose who {{gli|break|breaks}}.&lt;ref name="Shamos 1999"/&gt;{{Rp|139}} It is permissible but not required for the lagged ball to touch or rebound from the bottom rail, but not to touch the side rails. Lagging is usually a two-party activity, though there are games such as [[cutthroat (pool)|cutthroat]] in which three players might lag. In the case of a tie, the tying shooters re-lag. The lag is most often used in tournament play or other competitions.
In hard-break games like [[nine-ball]] and [[eight-ball]] the winner of the lag would normally take the break, while in soft-break games like [[straight pool]] would likely require the loser of the lag to break, since breaking would be a disadvantage.  ''See also {{gli|string-off}}.'' }}

{{Term|term= last-pocket |content=last-pocket {{anchor|last pocket|lastpocket}}}}

The variant is not extremely common in the United States or the UK, but is near-universal in much of Latin America (where two {{gli|cue ball}} {{gli|scratch|scratches}} are permitted when attempting the 8 ball shot and count as simple fouls, with only a third scratch constituting a loss of game).

{{Term| league }}
{{Defn|1= An organization that promotes competitive, usually team, amateur cue sports, most commonly [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]], especially [[eight-ball]] and [[nine-ball]], although there are also well-established [[snooker league]]s.  Some leagues, many of which are decades old, are entirely local and either informal or [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]], and may use their own local rules or may have adopted more widely published rulesets, such as those of the [[World Pool-Billiard Association|WPA]].  Other leagues are organized on a multi-regional or even international level, and may be non-profit or for-profit enterprises, usually with their own fine-tuned rule books. Despite differences, the largest leagues are increasingly converging toward the WPA rules, with the exception of the [[American Poolplayers Association|APA/CPA]], which retains rules much closer to [[United States|US]]-style {{gli|bar pool}}.  At least four major pool leagues hold international championships in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] annually (APA/CPA, [[Billiard Congress of America|BCAPL]], [[Valley National 8-Ball League Association|VNEA]] and [[American CueSports Alliance|ACS/CCS]]). Some leagues also offer {{gli|one-on-one}} tournaments, {{gli|scotch doubles}} events, [[artistic pool]] competition, and other non-team activities.

A legal ''shot'' is one in which no foul of any kind was involved (e.g. there was not a {{gli|double hit}} by the cue, the player's {{gli|bridge}} hand did not move a ball, etc.).  A legal ''stroke'' is one in which the [[Cue stick|cue]] {{gli|stroke}} obeyed the rules (e.g. the shooter did not perform an illegal {{gli|jump shot}} by scooping under the cue ball with the cue {{gli|cue tip|tip}}).  A legal ''ball'' is a {{gli|ball-on}}, an object ball at which it is permissible for the player to shoot.  And so on.

{{Term| miss }}
{{Defn|1= In [[snooker]], a shot where a player {{gli|foul|fouls}} by missing the ball on altogether. The miss rule allows for his opponent to have the player play exactly the same shot again, or at least as accurately as the {{gli|referee}} is able to reproduce the ball positions. A miss usually occurs when a player makes an unsuccessful attempt at escaping from a snooker. It is a controversial rule aimed at formally discouraging {{gli|deliberate foul|deliberate fouls}}. In professional snooker, a referee will almost always call a miss on any foul where the player misses the ball on altogether, regardless of how close the player comes to hitting it. If a player is called for a miss three times in a single visit while not snookered, he forfeits the frame; to avoid this, players almost always play an easy hit on their third attempt, even if it is likely to leave a chance for the opponent. }}

{{Defn|1= {{ghat|Also '''nurse shot''', '''nursery shot''', '''nursery cannon'''.}}
In carom games such as [[Balkline and straight rail|straight rail]], [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline]] and [[cushion caroms]], where all the balls are kept near each other and a cushion, and with very soft shots, can be "nursed" down a rail on multiple successful shots that effectively replicate the same ball setup so that the nurse shot can be repeated again (and again, etc.).

Excessive use of nurse shots by players skilled enough to set them up and pull them off repeatedly at will is what led to the development of the [[Balkline and straight rail|balkline]] [[carom billiards]] game variations, and repetitive shot limitation rules in [[English billiards]].  A clear example of why: In 1907, [[Tom Reece]] scored a record {{gli|break}} of 499,135 consecutive {{gli|point|points}} over a period of five weeks, without a miss, using the {{gli|cradle cannon}} nurse shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Richard Holt | title = Sport And the British: A Modern History | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-19-285229-9 | page = 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Defn|1= {{ghat|Also '''pro side of the pocket'''; sometimes "of the pocket" is left off the phrase.}}
The {{gli|long rail|long-rail}} side of a {{gli|corner pocket}}.  To "aim for the profession side of the pocket" is to slightly {{gli|overcut}} a difficult corner-pocket {{cuegloss|cut shot}}, to {{cuegloss|cheat the pocket}}, rather than {{gli|undercut|undercutting}}, especially in [[nine-ball]]. Erring too much in this direction is "missing on the professional side of the pocket."  It is so called because experienced players understand that on a thin cut, overcutting the object ball to a corner pocket will far more often leave the object ball in an unfavorable position, i.e. along the {{gli|short rail}} for the incoming opponent than will an undercut, which often leaves the object ball sitting in front of or nearby the pocket it had been intended for on a miss.&lt;ref&gt;[[ESPN]] broadcast of 2007 WPBA Great Lakes Classic, second semi-final.

By contrast, in [[eight-ball]], except when both players are shooting at the {{cuegloss|8 ball}}, the incoming player after a miss is shooting for different object balls, so this maxim does not apply, and the opposite may be good strategy as, if the object ball stays near the pocket through an undercut, it is advantageously positioned for a subsequent turn and may block the opponent's use of the pocket.&lt;ref name="RGivens"/&gt;}}

{{Term| push out }}
{{Defn|1= ''As an adjective or compound noun: '''push-out'''.''
A rule in many games (most notably [[nine-ball]], after and only after the break shot), allowing a player to "push out" the cue ball to a new position without having to contact any ball, much less pocket one or drive it to a {{gli|cushion}}, but not counting any pocketed ball as valid (other foul rules apply, such as {{gli|double hit|double hits}}, {{gli|scratch|scratching}} the cue ball, etc.), with the caveat that the opponent may shoot from the new cue ball position or give the shot back to the pusher who must shoot from the new position.  In nine-ball particularly, and derived games such as [[seven-ball]] and [[ten-ball]], pocketing the {{gli|money ball}} on a push-out results in that ball being {{gli|spot (verb)|respotted}} (which can be used to strategic advantage in certain circumstances, such as when the break leaves no shot on the {{gli|ball-on}}, and failure to hit it would give the incoming player an instant-win {{gli|combination|combination shot}} on the money ball).{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}&lt;!--If in nine-ball I pocket the 5 ball on a push-out, does it also get respotted, in Intl.

{{Term| push shot }}

The terms may be used comparatively, as in "this is a really fast table", or "I don't like cloth this slow".

Some serious players bring their own, in a bottle or a porous bag that can be patted on the bridge hand.  Many players prefer a {{gli|pool glove}}.  Talc is frequently mistakenly referred to as "{{gli|hand chalk}}", despite not being made of [[chalk]]. }}

{{Term| tangent line }}
{{Defn|1= The imaginary line drawn perpendicular to the impact line between the cue ball and an object ball.

''See also {{gli|stun shot}}.'' }}

{{Term| taper }}
{{Defn|1= The profile of the shaft of the cue as it increases in diameter from the tip to the joint. A "fast" or "slow" taper refers to how quickly the diameter increases. A "pro" taper describes a shaft that tapers rapidly from the joint size to the tip size so as to provide a long, untapered stroking area. }}

{{Term| tapper }}
{{Defn|1= A {{gli|tip tool}} with fine, sharp points used to roughen the {{gli|cue tip}} to better hold {{gli|chalk}} after it has become hardened and smooth from repeated impacts with the {{gli|cue ball}}.

{{Term| three-foul rule }}
{{Defn|1= The three-foul rule describes a situation in which a player is assessed a defined penalty after committing a third successive foul. The exact penalty, its prerequisites and whether it is in place at all, vary depending on the games. In [[nine-ball]] and [[straight pool]], a player must be the told he is on two fouls in order to transgress the rule, and if violated, results in a loss of game for the former and a special point penalty of a loss of fifteen points (plus one for the foul itself) in the latter together with the ability to require the violator to rerack and rebreak. In [[Irish standard pool]] and [[English billiards]], it is a loss of game if a player commits a third foul while shooting at {{gli|black ball|the black}}. In [[snooker]], three successive fouls from a non-{{gli|snooker|snookered}} position result in forfeiting the frame. Repeat fouls from a snookered position are quite common – [[Dave Harold]] holds the record in a competitive match, missing the same shot 14 successive times. }}

{{Term| throw }}

{{Term| time shot }}

{{Term| top-of-the-table play}}
{{Defn|1= This technique involves all three balls being grouped in close proximity at the top end of the table and scoring with a succession of short range pots and cannons.  A typical starting point is with the red placed on its spot, object white on or near the centreline somewhere between the spot and the top cushion, and the cueball posed nearby to pot the red or make a gentle cannon.  If the pot, then it should be played so as to leave the cueball in a good position for the next shot.  If the cannon, then the purpose is to disturb the object white as little as possible and finish clear to pot the red which has been left near the corner pocket.  Then in potting the red the cueball must again be left in a good position for the next shot, and so on.  This form of play makes it possible to compile really big breaks in relatively short time. }}

In [[snooker]], the situation in which the {{gli|cue ball}} is resting in contact with an {{gli|object ball}}.

{{Term| training template }}
{{Defn|1= [[File:Training template.png|thumb|right|Training template]]
A thin sheet of rigid material in the size and shape of a [[Rack (billiards)|physical ball rack]] (e.g. a {{gli|diamond}} for [[nine-ball]]), with holes drilled though it, which is used to make permanent {{gli|divot|divots}} in the [[Baize|cloth]] of the [[Billiard table|table]], one at a time for each [[Billiard ball|ball]] in the {{gli|rack|racking}} pattern, by placing a ball in one of the holes in the carefully placed template and tapping it sharply from above to create the cloth indentation.  The holes are spaced slightly closer than the regulation ball width of 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;inch (57.15&amp;nbsp;mm) apart, so that when the balls settle partially into their divots, the outer sides of these indentations create ball-on-ball pressure, pushing the balls together tightly.  The purpose of the template is to do away with using a physical rack, with racking instead being performed simply by placing the balls into position, and the divots aligning them into the tightest possible formation automatically. This prevents accidental loose racks, and also thwarts the possibility of cheating by carefully manipulating the ball positions while racking. The [[European Pocket Billiard Federation]] (EPBF, Europe's [[World Pool-Billiard Association|WPA]] affiliate organization) has adopted this racking technique for its professional Euro-Tour event series.&lt;ref name="Varner BD 2008-02"&gt;{{BDMag|first=Nick|last=Varner|date=February 2008|title=Killing Me Softly?: The Outbreak of the Soft Break Threatens the Game of 9-ball|volume=30|issue=3|pages= 34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also {{gli|racking template}}, {{gli|pocket template}}.'' }}

{{Term| umbrella shot }}
{{Defn|1= A [[three cushion billiards]] shot in which the cue ball first strikes two cushions before hitting the first object ball then hits a third cushion before hitting the second object ball.

Due to the longevity of the [[Indianapolis 500]], numerous traditions surrounding the race have developed over the years. Traditions include procedures for the running of the race, scheduling, and pre-race and post-race festivities. For many fans, these traditions are an important aspect of the race, and they have often reacted quite negatively when the traditions are changed or broken.

As part of the [[Memorial Day]] holiday weekend, the pre-race ceremonies of the Indianapolis 500 feature several patriotic songs. Like most other sporting events, the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] is performed before the race by a notable vocalist. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the annual singing of "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]," and the victory lane bottle of [[milk]].

== Month of May ==
The two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as "the month of May [at Indianapolis]". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. The policy was typically to make the track available for practice no later than May 1, although in most years, few if any competitors would be on the grounds yet. In some years, the track would be available for practice and testing as early as April. For instance, in 1932, cars began to arrive on April 6, and in 1969, the first day of practice was April 28. In very early years, it was not uncommon for the track to be closed on Sunday during practice, or be open for only competitors with the gates were closed to the public. In 1974, due to the [[1973 oil crisis|energy crisis]], the schedule was reduced, and the track opened instead three weeks before race day. The change was well-received, and the new schedule was made permanent, with various tweaks over the years.

In [[2014 IndyCar Series season|2014]], a [[IndyCar Grand Prix|second race at Indianapolis]] was introduced to the IndyCar Series schedule, conducted on the track's road course. The new event is held two weeks before the 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavin|first=Curt|title=IndyCar officials provide details for revised 2.434-mile IMS road course|url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20131001/SPORTS0107/310010048/IndyCar-officials-provide-details-revised-2-434-mile-IMS-road-course|work=Indianapolis Star|publisher=Gannett Company|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though not part of the month of May, since the mid-2010s, '''Founders Day''' has been recognized and celebrated at the Speedway each year on March 20. That coincides with the date in 1909 in which the Speedway was incorporated. Since 2017, Founders Day is the date in which inductees to the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum#Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame|Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame]] are announced.

===Memorial Day===
The race has always been scheduled in conjunction with [[Memorial Day]]. Through 1970, the race was held on Memorial Day proper (May 30), regardless of the day of the week, unless it fell on Sunday. In those cases it was scheduled for Monday May 31. After the [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]] took effect in 1971, the race was scheduled as part of the [[Long weekend|three-day]] Memorial Day weekend - either the Saturday, the Sunday, or the Monday of the holiday weekend. Since 1974, the race has been scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, and has been held on a Sunday with only two exceptions due to rain delays.

Sundays were [[Blue laws in the United States|avoided]] for scheduling race activity dating all the way back to pre-500 races in 1909 and 1910. In early decades, Sundays were occasionally used for practice and/or qualifying, but were used sparingly in pre-World War II years. In some early years, practice may have been permitted on Sundays, but the gates might not be open to the public. When [[Tony Hulman]] bought the Speedway after World War II, Speedway management continued to refuse to schedule the race on a Sunday, a policy that stayed in place through 1973. Qualifying and practice, however, were regularly held on Sundays during those years, with no days closed to spectators.
*From 1911 to 1970, the race was scheduled for May 30, regardless of the day of the week. If May 30 fell on a Sunday, the race was scheduled for Monday May 31.
**For the first 500 in [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]], May 30 fell on a Tuesday.
**In [[1915 Indianapolis 500|1915]], May 30 fell on a Sunday, and the race was initially scheduled for Saturday May 29. Heavy rains fell in the days leading up to the race flooding the grounds and made some roads leading to the track impassible. A few days before the race was to be held, officials decided to postpone the race until Monday May 31 in order to allow time for the grounds to dry out.
**The final race under that scheduling format (1970) happened to fall on a Saturday.
*In 1971 and 1972, the race was scheduled for the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. 
*In 1973, the race was scheduled for Memorial Day Monday. However, rain delayed it until Wednesday.
*Since 1974, the race has been scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.
*In case of a rainout on Sunday, the race will be rescheduled for the following day, Monday - the Memorial Day federal holiday. Monday is the prioritized make-up date, however, if it rains again on Monday, the race will be shifted to the next available day. 
*The [[1986 Indianapolis 500|1986 race]] was scheduled for Sunday May 25, but was it rained out on both Sunday, and Monday. It was postponed to the following weekend, and held on Saturday May 31.
*The [[1997 Indianapolis 500|1997 race]] was scheduled for Sunday May 25, but rain washed out the day. The race began the next day, on Memorial Day (Monday May 26), but rain showers moved back into the area. The race was halted after 15 laps, and could not be restarted. Short of the 101 laps needed for an official race, track officials elected to resume the race on the following day (Tuesday May 27). The race was run to completion, as laps 16–200 were completed on Tuesday.

[[Armed Forces Day#United States|Armed Forces Day]] also falls during the month of May, and usually coincides with one of the weekends of time trials. Since 1978 at the Speedway, that weekend is often filled with activities honoring the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]], including an [[United States Armed Forces oath of enlistment|oath of enlistment ceremony]].

===Practice and qualifying===
[[Image:Castroneves Pole 20070512.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hélio Castroneves]] makes his pole-winning qualification run in [[2007 Indianapolis 500|2007]] during "Happy Hour". Note the shadows cast on the racing surface.]]

* '''Opening Day:''' The first day of practice is traditionally referred to as "Opening Day." From 1911 to 1973, Opening day was traditionally May 1st, although oftentimes the track was made available for practice much earlier than that date. Since 1974, the "Opening Day" practice session has been scheduled either three weeks or two weeks prior to race day. The day is usually marked with festivities and for many years was popularly attended. The battle to be the ''First Driver on the Track'' for the month was a spectacle of Opening Day for many years. Teams and drivers would battle to get their cars prepped and cranked up as soon as officials opened the track, hoping to be the first car to leave the pits, and likewise the first car to complete a lap for the month. The effort usually attracted the attention of the smaller teams, as it was seen as a way to draw headlines for the day. The race to be first on the track was usually friendly, although in some years it became heated, drawing the ire of the officials. For a time, it became a tradition that the cars of the Bryant Heating &amp; Cooling Team, and later [[Dick Simon Racing]], were usually the first cars on the track. In recent years, Opening Day might include separate sessions for Rookie Orientation and Refresher tests, proceeding or following a full-field, veteran driver practice session. One of the long-standing traditions of Opening Day is the ceremonial handing over of the keys to the [[Indianapolis 500 pace cars|pace car]] from the manufacturer to the track officials.

*'''Rookie Orientation Program:''' Starting in [[1936 Indianapolis 500|1936]] all rookies were required to take a rookie test prior to being allowed to compete. The test traditionally consists of multiple phases, each increasing in speed, under the close observation of officials, driver coaches, and both current and former IndyCar Series drivers. Rookie drivers are required to exhibit adequate car control and proper driving lines, among other requirements. After several decades of conducting the tests during normal session of practice (usually early in the month), officials decided to organize the sessions. Since [[1981 Indianapolis 500|1981]], the Rookie Orientation Program (ROP) has been held in April or early May. The program allows newcomers the opportunity to take their first laps at the Speedway and acclimate themselves to the circuit in a relaxed environment. It would be held without the pressure of veteran drivers crowding the track, without the distraction of spectators, and with minimal media coverage. Currently, drivers can complete all phases of their rookie tests during ROP if conditions allow. The ROP has traditionally been held prior to opening day, however, in some years it served as opening day. Drivers with exceptional driving experience at high levels of motorsports can occasionally receive waivers for participation in ROP, but must still pass their rookie test at a later date before they can practice during normal sessions. 

*'''Refresher Tests:''' In addition to Rookie Orientation Program, veteran Indy 500 drivers who have not been behind the wheel of a race car for a considerable amount of time, as determined by the officials, may be required to complete a refresher test prior to competing. The "Refresher Test" typically consists of the latter two phases of the rookie test, and is used to re-acclimate drivers to Indy car racing and the Speedway. Refresher test participants usually are drivers that have not driven in an Indy car, particularly on a superspeedway, since the previous year's Indy 500 (or longer). This usually applies to part-time drivers and drivers who have been away from the sport for an extended period of time. Full-time drivers in the IndyCar Series (that are not rookies) are almost universally exempt from taking refresher tests. Track time for refresher tests is usually offered during the Rookie Orientation Program, but they can also be completed on regular practice days.  Currently, the final two phases of the rookie tests are required for the Refresher test.

*'''Practice:''' Since the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911, the track has been opened for practice early in the month for competitors. Through 1973, it was a tradition that the track was made available for practice beginning on May 1. In some years the track opened as early as mid-April. In 1974, the schedule was cut back to three weeks prior to race day. Since 2010, the track typically opens for practice about two weeks before race day. In the early years, practice began each day as early as 9:00 a.m., but in modern times, the track typically opens at 11 a.m. or 12 p.m. Traditionally, the track closes at 6:00 p.m. 

* '''Happy Hour:''' The final hour of practice and qualifying each day is referred to as "[[Happy Hour]]". Due to the large double-deck grandstands on the frontstretch, large shadows are cast over a good portion of the track, cooling the asphalt surface. A lower ambient air temperature, along with a lower track surface temperature, usually translates into faster speeds. Since Indiana began observing [[Daylight Saving Time]] in 2006, this phenomenon has been somewhat diminished.

* '''Fast Friday:''' The final practice session before pole day qualifying is nicknamed "Fast Friday". The fastest speeds of the month are commonly observed on Fast Friday, as teams and drivers make their final preparations and look for final "bragging rights" before the run for the pole position. Since the current engine formula was adopted in 2012, elevated [[turbocharger]] "[[Turbocharger#Pressure increase / boost|boost]]" levels have been permitted on Fast Friday, reflecting the increased level allowed during time trials. Drivers who have been "[[Sandbagging (racing)|sandbagging]]" during the week may chose to reveal their speed, in an effort to distance themselves from the competition. Sometimes the speeds turned in on Fast Friday are overachieved by the respective drivers' due to [[Drafting (aerodynamics)|a tow]]. Though "Fast Friday" has been a fixture since the 1950s–1960s, the nickname was not coined until about 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url =http://www.motorsport.com/news/article.asp?ID=5296&amp;FS=INDYCAR| title =Indianapolis practice notes 96–05–10| publisher =Motorsport.com| date = 1996-05-10| accessdate = 2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Track records set on Fast Friday (as well as other practice sessions) are considered unofficial. The sanctioning body only recognizes speeds set during the officially competitive sessions of qualifying and the race.

* '''Pole Day:''' The first day of time trials traditionally was referred to as "[[List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters|Pole Day]]." The fastest qualifier on pole day wins the highly coveted [[pole position]]. Over the years, the "race for the pole" was often regarded as a race in itself, a speed contest, and was ''advertised as'' the second-largest single day sporting event (second only to race day itself). Though crowds have diminished for pole day as of late, and rules changes have curtailed speeds, the nickname "The Fastest Day in Motorsports" is still sometimes used. Since 2014, a special two-day format has been utilized for time trials, and the pole position is actually not determined until the conclusion of the second day. The term "pole day" is still widely used, however, it is now being used to reference the second day in particular. 

* '''Bump Day:''' The final day of qualifying, when the final starting field is set, was traditionally known as "Bump Day" (or "Bubble Day"). Drivers who are removed from the starting grid of 33 by being out-qualified by faster cars are said to have been "bumped." The driver with the slowest speed in the field of 33, the first in line to be bumped, is said to be "on the bubble."&lt;ref name="Evolved"&gt;Mittman, Dick. [http://www.indy500.com/news/story.php?story_id=3569 Indianapolis 500 Qualifying Has Evolved Over The Years], Indy500.com, September 22, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Unqualified drivers attempt to bump their way into the field and "burst the slower driver's bubble." Prior to World War II, the term typically used for drivers being knocked out of the field was "crowded out." Since the early 2000s, smaller entry lists have led to fewer cars, or even zero cars, being bumped from the starting grid. With the adoption of the special two-day qualifying format in 2014, the bumping procedure, if it occurs, actually would occur on the first day (Saturday) of time trials. As such, the term "Bump Day" disappeared from use for a few years. In 2018, the term "Bump Day" was brought back, and widely used as the nickname for the first day of time trials. 

*'''Post-qualifying practice''': Beginning in 2014, an additional practice session has been scheduled on the Monday after qualifying. After schedule overhauls, as well as a substantial format changes for qualifying, this 3{{frac|1|2}} hour session is utilized specifically for race practice, particularly multi-car "group" practice. Previously teams would utilize weekdays, and very often, loosely utilize the down times of the final day of time trials for such practice. Due to the format changes of time trials, adequate time is no longer available to practice during down times on the last day of time trials due to the lengthy post-qualifying technical inspection, and the general lateness of the day that the starting grid is finalized. This extra practice period is also sometimes used by teams to reach maximum mileage for engines, as they install a fresh engine for Carb Day and race day.  Under current INDYCAR rules, an engine must reach 2,550 miles (or 4,100 km) during the season in order to be eligible for a fresh engine.

*'''Indy Lights''': * The [[Indy Lights]] series began holding a support race, the [[Freedom 100]], during the month of May in 2003. For the first two years, it was held on the second weekend of time trials. In 2005, it was moved to Carb Day. The first practice, since 2014 changes, is held on the Monday of post-qualifying practice shortly after the finish of the 3 1/2 hour session for the IndyCar Series.  The second practice and time trials are held on Thursday, the day before Carb Day. IndyCar teams are not permitted to practice on Tuesday through Thursday, however, they may conduct pit stop practice. In addition, the time is spent setting up their respective pit areas.

* '''Carb Day:''' The final practice session before the race, currently held on the Friday before race day, is called "Carburetion Day" (shortened to "Carb Day" since 2000). The name originally came from the fact that it was the final session where teams could tune their [[carburetors]] in conditions similar to those that might be encountered on race day. The name has remained despite the fact that no qualified car has used a carburetor since 1963.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; The day is now similar to most motorsport weekends, as the final practice is accompanied by the a [[Pit Stop Challenge|pit stop contest]], a [[Card (sports)|support race]], and a concert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indy500.com/schedule/ Indianapolis 500 Schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013144337/http://www.indy500.com/schedule/ |date=2008-10-13 }}, Indy500.com&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pit Stop Challenge]] debuted in 1977, the [[Indy Lights]] [[Freedom 100]] moved to Carb Day in 2005, and the concerts have been held since 1998. In 1969–1972, Carb Day was held the Wednesday before the race. From 1973 to 2004, Carb Day was held the Thursday before the race. It was moved to Friday before the race beginning in 2005, at which time the Indy Lights race was moved to that day. Prior to 1969, Carb Day was not on a fixed day of the week, instead it was simply scheduled for a nondescript day midway between the final day of time trials and race day, and was sometimes closed to the public.

===Radio===
The longtime flagship of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS Radio Network]] is [[WFNI]] AM 1070 (formerly [[WIBC (FM)|1070 WIBC]]). The network dates back to 1952, and was initially launched using WIBC talent. Since the late 1960s and early 1970s, the station has featured extensive daily coverage of practice, qualifications, as well as pre-race and post-race coverage on race day.

Since 1971, the most popular and most traditional daily show during the month of May has been Donald Davidson's ''[[Donald Davidson (historian)#The Talk of Gasoline Alley|The Talk of Gasoline Alley]]''.&lt;ref name="One on One"&gt;{{cite episode|title=May 10, 2009 |series=One on One With Mark Montieth |url=http://www.1070thefan.com/oneonone/ |network=[[WFNI]] |airdate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717160855/http://www.1070thefan.com/oneonone/ |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last Row Party===
[[File:FelipeGiaffone2005Indy500.jpg|thumb|Driver [[Felipe Giaffone]] wearing his "Last Row Party" jacket at the [[2005 Indianapolis 500|2005 race]].]]
A few days before the race, the "Last Row Party" has been held for charity since 1972. It is a scholarship benefit organized by the Indianapolis Press Club Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indypressfoundation.org/last-row-party|title=Indianapolis Press Club Foundation|website=Indianapolis Press Club Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually held the Thursday evening or Friday evening before the race. Currently it is held at one of the suites in the Pagoda, and previously it was held at the Speedway Motel. The event is conducted as a [[Roast (comedy)|roast]] and [[cocktail party]] for the final three qualifiers in the 500, who will be starting on the eleventh and final row (positions 31, 32, and 33). Due to the complex [[List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters#Qualifying procedure|qualifying procedure]] for the race, these three drivers are usually, but not always, the slowest three cars in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/irl-ims-details-on-the-33rd-annual-last-row-party/|title='Last Row Part' Celebrates 33 Years of 11th-Row Merriment on May 27|publisher=Motorsport.com|work=IMS Press Release|first=Eric|last=Powell|date=April 22, 2005|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Mr. Irrelevant]], often some of these drivers are obscure, and several have been race rookies. Some are noted for a dramatic last-minute qualifying effort to secure a spot in the lineup, while others may have survived a Bump day scare, or an otherwise tumultuous month of May, to hold on to make the field. Nine former or eventual race winners have participated in the honor at some time during their career ([[Johnny Rutherford|Rutherford]], [[Gordon Johncock|Johncock]], [[Tom Sneva|Sneva]], [[Eddie Cheever|Cheever]], [[Buddy Lazier|Lazier]], [[Ryan Hunter-Reay|Hunter-Reay]], [[Tony Kanaan|Kanaan]], [[Takuma Sato|Sato]], [[Alexander Rossi|Rossi]]).

In addition to being on the receiving end of numerous good-natured jokes and jabs, the three drivers are presented with a special jacket, various gifts, and checks for 31[[Penny (United States coin)|¢]], 32¢, and 33¢, respectively. The group becomes known as the "11th Row Society", an enjoys a [[buffet]] dinner, [[Apéritif and digestif|apéritif]], [[cocktail]]s, and [[hors d'oeuvre]] with attendees. Later they may sign autographs and pose for pictures, in what is generally a fun and laid-back environment. The emcee for the event is usually a media figure, and past hosts include [[Bob Jenkins]], [[Robin Miller (journalist)|Robin Miller]], [[Jack Arute]], [[Dave Wilson (radio personality)|Dave Wilson]], and Laura Steele. The 2015 and 2016 co-emcees were Curt Cavin (''[[Indianapolis Star]]'') and Chris Hagen ([[WXIN]]). [[Lindy Thackston]] hosted the event for 2017 and 2018. The 2013 reception was not held but a brief ceremony was held on Carb Day to recognize the honorees.

Recent honorees include:
*2014: [[Sage Karam]], [[Sebastián Saavedra]], [[Buddy Lazier]]

===Public drivers' meeting and Legends Day===

[[File:2012Indy500LegendsDay.jpg|thumb|150px|Legends Day in [[2012 Indianapolis 500|2012]]]]
The day before the race, a ceremonial drivers meeting is held at the track, which is open to the public, and is popularly attended. This tradition dates back many decades. During the meeting, the 33 starting drivers are presented with their starter's ring and various awards and trophies are handed out (such as trophies from the previous year's race, qualifying awards, lifetime achievement awards, etc.) The drivers are usually seated on a platform situated in the eleven rows of three, and numerous other celebrities and special guests may be honored or give remarks. Rules clarifications, instructions for the race, and other pertinent information is also discussed in the open forum. Drivers who can not attend due to scheduling conflicts (e.g., participating in another race) will usually have another team member or family member participate on their behalf.

This drivers meeting is separate from the official drivers meeting, organized by race stewards. That meeting, held the morning of the race, is strictly closed to the public and the media.

Starting in 1998, the days leading up to the race have included ceremonies and activities honoring former drivers. In some years, each day during the week would have a featured Indy legend, and might feature the driver taking ceremonial laps around the track in one of his winning race cars, or in a pace car. Other years utilized Opening Day as an opportunity to honor Indy legends. In addition, the day before the race was expanded to include an autograph session featuring the 33 starting drivers, former drivers, Q&amp;A sessions, car displays, a "fanfest" midway, a memorabilia show, and other festivities. Starting 2011, the events of the day before the race have been officially themed "Legends Day," and features a designated honoree. In addition, Legends Day showcases the classic cars of the 500: fans are able to get close looks and take photos of the machines, with a number of historic race cars also running laps of the circuit.

===500 Festival Parade===
[[File:Race to Indy!.jpg|thumb|The '''500 Festival Parade''' is one of the nation's largest, regularly drawing 300,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.500festival.com/parade/history|title=Parade history|author=500 Festival|accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''500 Festival'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.500festival.com/|title=500 Festival|author=|date=|work=500Festival.com|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1957 to organize various civic events in the city of [[Indianapolis]] leading up to the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.500festival.com/festival/ | title =Welcome to The 500 Festivalname|publisher =500Festival.com| access-date = April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two largest events are the [[OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon]] in early May, and the 500 Festival [[Parade]] the day before the race. Other events have included "Community Day" at the track, memorial services, luncheons, and the annual Snake Pit [[Ball (dance)|Ball]], a [[black tie]] [[socialite]] gathering downtown.

In many years, the parade grand marshal has been a celebrity with ties to Indiana or the Indianapolis area, particularly Indianapolis-area sports figures. In many cases, the grand marshal of the parade is also honored during pre-race festivities on race morning. The organizing committee boasts the parade as one of the largest in the nation. In 1997, a fire swept through the storage hangar housing the floats for that year's parade, threatening to cancel the event. Only four floats were spared, and [[Buddy Lazier]]'s [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996 winning car]] escaped the fire only because the museum had decided to wait a few extra days before delivering it to the float staging area. The parade went on as scheduled, but in a slightly retooled format.&lt;ref name="Star05-22-1997a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Challenge at hand: saving the parade (part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9406953//|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 22, 1997|access-date=March 8, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star05-22-1997b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Challenge at hand: saving the parade (part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9406962//|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=10|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 22, 1997|access-date=March 8, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Track lore==
[[File:Indy500GoldenBrick.JPG|thumb|250px|A ceremonial golden brick was installed at the start/finish line of the track to commemorate the 100th anniversary]]
[[File:GASOLINEALLEY1984.jpg|thumb|right|Gasoline Alley in 1984.]]
[[File:GASOLINEALLEY1993.jpg|thumb|right|The new Gasoline Alley opened in 1986.]]
The atmosphere at the track during the month of May and on race day has long been a source of traditions.
===The Brickyard===
The nickname of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the "Brickyard." When the track opened in August 1909, the surface was composed of crushed stone and tar. This surface quickly was deemed unsuitable and dangerous after multiple accidents. In the fall of 1909, the track was paved in brick. In just over two months, 3.2&amp;nbsp;million bricks were hand laid on a bed of sand and the gaps were filled with mortar. Before the work was completed, locals nicknamed the track the "Brickyard".&lt;ref name="IMShistory1"&gt;{{cite web|title=IMS Milestones: 1906–1911 – Indianapolis Motor Speedway|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/history/35207-1906-1911-Milestones|publisher=Indianapolismotorspeedway.com|date=March 26, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510020733/http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/history/35207-1906-1911-Milestones/|archivedate=May 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1930s, portions of the track were paved over in asphalt. By the late 1950s, only a portion of the mainstretch remained brick.

Following the 1961 race, the remaining part of the mainstretch was paved over, and the entire track was now covered in asphalt. One yard of bricks was left exposed at the start/finish line. The vast majority of the original 3.2&amp;nbsp;million bricks remain in place, several inches underneath the asphalt. Some bricks have been unearthed from the track over the years, namely in the locations where the infield access tunnels have been constructed. Subsequent repavings of the track in 1976, 1988, 1995, and 2004, have also kept the bricks in place underneath. However, the yard of bricks exposed at the start/finish line has been dug up in those instances, and different bricks - ostensibly bricks that were dug up at one point from other parts of the track - were cleanly laid in place.

In 2000 when the new Pagoda and Pagoda Plaza were built, the yard of bricks was extended from the track surface across the pit lane and then through to the spectator areas in the new Pagoda Plaza.

===Gasoline Alley===
The garage area at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is known as "Gasoline Alley." The nickname dates back to the early decades of the race, and for a time, referred specifically to one particular spot in the back where cars would refuel. Though the exact origin of the name is unclear, it may be loosely linked to the eponymous [[Gasoline Alley|comic strip]]. Later, the nickname was used for the main corridor of the garage area, and eventually was used colloquially for the entire garage complex. The use of [[gasoline]] at the Indy 500 was phased out in favor of [[methanol]] beginning in [[1965 Indianapolis 500|1965]] (and later [[ethanol]] in [[2006 Indianapolis 500|2006]]), but the nickname nonetheless remained. Gasoline was not used again at Indy until [[NASCAR]] arrived for the [[Brickyard 400]] in [[1994 Brickyard 400|1994]].

The first garage area consisted of one double-sided bank of garages running east-west. It was in the same general location as the present day complex. In the very early years, the foreign entries were housed in a second garage complex outside of turn two. In 1929, a second row of garages was constructed alongside the first, creating the soon-to-be familiar Gasoline Alley corridor. The original garages were known for their signature green and white barn doors, and were sometimes visually compared to [[horse]] [[Stable|stables]], as the complex loosely resembled a [[horse racing]] [[paddock]].

One of the fixtures of the garage area was Tom Bealle's [[diner]], an outdoor [[restaurant]] and [[gathering place]], popular with drivers, mechanics, officials, and fans. Bealle often allowed drivers to run up a tab during the month of May, allowing them to pay their bill once they received their prize money at the end of the month.

A fire swept through the garage area on the morning of the [[1941 Indianapolis 500|1941 race]], and burned down a significant portion of the south bank of garages. They were replaced, and eventually the complex expanded to 88 stalls. As the sport grew, and the cars and teams became larger and more sophisticated, work space was increasingly limited in the garages. Amenities were simple, corridors were heavily congested, and by the 1980s, the cars and teams had outgrown the aging facility. 

Despite their lack of modern amenities, the garages had a nostalgic quaintness admired by participants and fans, and they also served important intrinsic purposes for the teams. For many years, the entry fee for the Indianapolis 500 provided a garage stall to the competitors not just for the month of May, but for the entire offseason as well.&lt;ref name="Star08-09-1985a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedway's new 96 garages will accent spaciousness (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14338545/gasoline_alley_1985/|first=Jep|last=Cadou Jr.|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=August 9, 1985|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star08-09-1985b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedway's new 96 garages will accent spaciousness (Part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14338719/gasoline_alley_1985/|first=Jep|last=Cadou Jr.|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=8|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=August 9, 1985|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a valuable asset to some teams, especially small-budget teams without a large [[Workshop|race shop]]. Even larger, more established teams still might use the garage stall for storage or as a staging location for cross-country trips to other races.

Following the [[1985 Indianapolis 500|1985 race]], the original Gasoline Alley garage area was [[1986 Indianapolis 500#Garage area|torn down and replaced]] with a [[state-of-the-art]], multimillion dollar garage complex. The nickname "Gasoline Alley" remained when the new complex opened in [[1986 Indianapolis 500|1986]]. In 2000, an additional row of garages was constructed alongside the pit lane on the main stretch, in preparations for the [[United States Grand Prix#Indianapolis (2000–2007)|U.S. Grand Prix]]. Although the pitside garages are used during the [[Brickyard 400]] for NASCAR inspection and top Cup Series teams (lower teams and the Xfinity Series teams use Gasoline Alley), they are specifically not considered part of Gasoline Alley.

===The Snake Pit===
[[File:1988Indy500timetrials.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Turn 4 infield ("Snake Pit II") seen on pole day in 1988.]]
The [[infield]] of the track in the vicinity of turn one was known as the "Snake Pit." Long known for a reputation of rowdiness, [[Binge drinking|heavy alcohol consumption]], [[Outlaw motorcycle club|bikers]], [[streaking]], [[Exhibitionism|flashing]], and an overall [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]]/[[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]]-esque atmosphere, the Snake Pit was a popular location for college-age fans to spend time at the track, many of whom had little or no interest in the actual racing activities. Like the [[Kentucky Derby#Traditions|infield at the Kentucky Derby]], the Snake Pit was often considered a rite of spring, and an excuse to party with abandon. Arrests for [[public intoxication]], [[disorderly conduct]], [[Assault|fights]], and [[drug possession]] were frequent and common.

In periods of rain, the area usually became overwhelmed with mud, and [[mud wrestling]] was commonly observed. Bonfires and burned cars were also noted.

In 1980, a fatality occurred in the area after a [[Jeep]] flipped over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spectator killed, but Indy driver survives accident|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NuwtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-TIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3898%2C3613086|newspaper=[[Rome News-Tribune]]|date=May 23, 1980|agency=United Press International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, track management decided to take steps to curtail the [[:wikt:revelry|revelry]]. For the 1981 race, [[bleachers]] were erected in the turn one infield. In addition, capital improvements that included the new Gasoline Alley, a place for competitors to park motor homes, new support buildings, new restroom buildings, and other changes to the site, gradually and deliberately scaled back the size of the area. As a result, for the better part of the 1980s, the patrons migrated to the infield of turn four, and the less-intense '''Snake Pit II''' emerged. By the 1990s, the intensity of the rowdiness had dropped substantially, due largely to third-generation management at the Speedway ([[Tony George]]) and beefed up law enforcement. By the end of the 20th century, it almost disappeared completely.

The turn four infield was razed in 1999 to make room for the infield road course. The race day party scene migrated again, this time to its current location, the turn three infield.&lt;ref name="Star05-16-2010pgb6"&gt;{{cite news|title=Volunteers' jobs aren't ordinary|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18345581/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=B6|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 16, 2010|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Snake Pit eventually became more of a festive [[party]] zone. Later, the original turn one location was also razed to make room for road course modifications, a section sometimes referred to as the "Snake Pit" section. In 2010, the turn three infield was officially named the '''[New] Snake Pit''', and began to be organized and officially marketed by management.&lt;ref name="Star05-27-2010pgI18"&gt;{{cite news|title=Snake's Alive!

While rock music typically headlines the Carb Day concert, and country music headlines the Legends Day concert, [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] is featured at the Snake Pit. In the mid-2010s, the revelry in the Snake Pit has somewhat re-intensified, however, not to the levels witnessed in the 1970s and early 1980s.

===Coke Lot===
Similar to the aforementioned "Snake Pit," the Coke Lot which is located outside the track, is the most noteworthy and popular [[camping]] location on the grounds of the Speedway. Officially designated Lot 1C, it has been nicknamed the "[[Coca-Cola|Coke]] Lot" for decades due to the presence of a [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] [[Bottling company|bottling plant]] located on an adjacent property.

The lot is an open field situated just to the northwest of the track, outside of turn 4 of the oval, off of Georgetown Road. Long known for intense revelry and all-night partying (particularly on the night before the race), the Coke Lot is a festive area and party scene for [[Recreational vehicle|RVs]] and [[Travel trailer|campers]], as well as [[tent|tent campers]]. The lot typically opens a few days before the race and allows fans to stay through the entire race weekend.

While the Coke Lot is the most notorious camping area, several other camping lots are also situated around the vicinity of the Speedway, some focusing on family-friendly environments, while others are considered premium lot for high-end RV'ers.

In years past, another camping area called the "North 40" (named due to its size of approximately 40 [[acres]]) was another scene of intense overnight revelry. In the 1970s, its revelry surpassed that of the Coke Lot. Located directly north of the track off of 30th Street, in close proximity to the Speedway's golf course, and backed up against a neighborhood of homes, it is no longer used for camping. Currently it is only utilized for daytime car parking, and employee parking. During its peak, security had to begin using giant [[searchlight]]s to keep North 40 campers from illegally wandering onto the golf course property late into the night.

===Food===

A traditional food of choice at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] is the [[pork tenderloin sandwich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/news/3550/Party_At_Brickyard_Crossing_To_Feature_Food_Network_Show| title =Party At Brickyard Crossing To Feature Food Network Show| publisher =Indy500.com| date = 2004-09-14| accessdate = 2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Beer]] (largely [[Beer in the United States|domestic]]) is consumed in considerable amounts at the track. Unlike most sports stadiums and arenas, at Indianapolis (and most speedways), spectators are allowed to [[BYOB|bring their own alcoholic beverages]] into the track for consumption. Beer is also sold at concessions. Glass bottles, however, are strictly prohibited at the track. Broken glass is considered an extreme hazard to the race cars (cut tires) on the track.

[[Peanut]]s are considered bad luck. An ambiguous, long-standing [[superstition]] against eating peanuts at the race track has dominated Indianapolis dating back to at least the 1940s. Legend says, though unconfirmed, that a crashed car was found with peanut shells in the cockpit. As of 2009, however, peanuts are sold at trackside concessions, and the myth has lost a lot of its following.

From the mid-1960s until her death in 1975, Mary Catherine "Mom" Unser (mother of [[Jerry Unser|Jerry]], [[Bobby Unser|Bobby]], and [[Al Unser|Al]]) was a well-known fixture at the race. She became famous for her [[Chili con carne|spicy chili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/life/food/2014/05/01/mom-unsers-chili-hot-indy-tradition/8577767/|title=Mom Unser's chili: A hot Indy 500 tradition|publisher=IndyStar|first=Amanda|last=Bell|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, she would treat the participants to a cook-out in the garage area.

Several local restaurants, both current and former, have been popular gathering places for participants and fans during the month of May. Establishments include [[St. Elmo Steak House]], Charlie Brown's Pancake and Steak House, Mug-n-Bun Drive-in Restaurant, and Long's Bakery. The aforementioned Tom Bealle's diner was a fixture of the garage area for many years. Redevelopment of Main Street in [[Speedway, Indiana|Speedway]] has created a area of popular establishments and nightlife, including [[Sarah Fisher]]'s 1911 Grill, and [[A. J. Foyt]]'s Foyt Wine Vault. A [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] used to stand across the street from the track, as did a [[Steak 'n Shake]], but both have since been demolished. From the 1930s to the 1960s, Mate's White Front Tavern was a popular hangout for drivers and crews. Located just a few blocks east of the Speedway, it was sold to new management in the early 1960s, and was kept open until the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Star05-23-2015a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Racers, cheap booze at White Front (part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9873450/|first=Will|last=Higgins|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=A3|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 23, 2015|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star05-23-2015b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Racers, cheap booze at White Front (part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9873484/|first=Will|last=Higgins|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=A10|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 23, 2015|accessdate=March 28, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Taco Bell]] just east of the Speedway has gained subtle notoriety with fans after Indy drivers [[Scott Dixon]] and [[Dario Franchitti]] were mugged in the parking lot in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/sports/autoracing/scott-dixon-taco-bell-robbery.html|title=Scott Dixon Reflects on Fast-Food Robbery|first=The Associated|last=Press|date=23 May 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superstitions===
[[File:Indy500PitStall12A.jpg|thumb|275px|In the pit area at Indianapolis, there is no pit stall #13. It is substituted with #12A.]]
Numerous [[superstition]]s have developed at the Indianapolis 500 over the years. Most date back many decades, although some have lost a considerable amount of following. Among the prevailing superstitions in the modern day include the ongoing "[[Andretti curse]]" and "Curse of the Smiths" (see below).

Older superstitions that have been popular at Indianapolis include some of the following:
*'''Number 13''': [[Triskaidekaphobia]] - fear of the use of the [[13 (number)|Number 13]] - has prevailed at Indianapolis dating back to the [[1911 Indianapolis 500|first 500]] in 1911.&lt;ref name="Star05-30-1951pg36"&gt;{{cite news|title=Freddy Agabashian Fights Hard Against "13 Jinx" Bad Omen Haunts California Driver|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19991579/indy_superstitions/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=36|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 30, 1951|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, the car assigned 13 did not make the race. Only one driver carried #13 on their car for the remainder of the 20th century. In [[1914 Indianapolis 500|1914]], [[George Mason (racing driver)|George Mason]] started 13th and finished 23rd. From 1926 to 2002, the use of #13 was officially disallowed by the rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Best By Number|publisher=[[Sporting News]]|year=2006|chapter=13 And Indy 500 Are Like Oil And Water|page=61|isbn=0-89204-848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most drivers avoided the use of number 13, however after changes in the rules, [[Greg Ray]] used the number in [[2003 Indianapolis 500|2003]]. It was only the second time the number 13 had been used over the first 87 editions of the race. Subsequently only two other drivers have used #13: [[E. J. Viso]] ([[2009 Indianapolis 500|2009]]) and [[Danica Patrick]] ([[2018 Indianapolis 500|2018]]). Both Viso and Patrick dropped out of the respective races.
*'''Green cars''': A long-time superstition at Indianapolis has been against painting cars the color [[green]].&lt;ref name="Star05-30-1951pg36"/&gt; Many drivers and team prefer not to allow the color green on their cars, even if just on small decals or pinstriping. Apropos to that, there have been two green winning cars ([[1920 Indianapolis 500|1920]] and [[1965 Indianapolis 500|1965]]).
*'''Peanuts''': [[Peanuts]] are considered bad luck (see Food above). An ambiguous, long-standing superstition against eating peanuts at the race track has dominated Indianapolis dating back to at least the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Star05-30-1951pg36"/&gt;
*'''Miscellany''': Numerous other and sometimes ambiguous superstitions have been promulgated by a myriad of drivers. However, many have lost much if not all of their following. Some included not allowing women and children near the cars, entering and exiting the cockpit on a particular side, not allowing photographs prior to going out on the track, and carrying [[good luck charm]]s.

===Curse of the Smiths===
[[File:Mark Smith Long Beach Grand Prix 1993 Indy car race CART.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Mark Smith (American racing driver)|Mark Smith]] failed to qualify.]]
Among the over [[:Category:Indianapolis 500 drivers|766 drivers]] who have participated in the Indy 500, none have had the last name [[Smith (surname)|Smith]], the most common surname in the United States. Several Smiths have attempted to make the race, the last being [[Mark Smith (American racing driver)|Mark Smith]] who failed to qualify in 1993 and 1994,&lt;ref&gt;Mittman, Dick. [http://www.indy500.com/news/3747/_Curse_Of_The_Smiths__Remains_Part_Of_Indianapolis_500_Lore 'Curse Of The Smiths' Remains Part Of Indianapolis 500 Lore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625011350/http://www.indy500.com/news/3747/_Curse_Of_The_Smiths__Remains_Part_Of_Indianapolis_500_Lore |date=2009-06-25 }}, Indy500.com, November 4, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; despite finishing 5th at the Michigan Superspeedway in a 1994 CART race. By contrast there have been eight different drivers with the last name [[Jones (surname)|Jones]], and four with the last name [[Johnson]].

Only two drivers with the surname Smith have ever competed in professional races at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, albeit in different events. [[Regan Smith]] drove in the [[Brickyard 400]] from 2008 to 2013 (with a best finish of 3rd in 2011). He also has competed in the [[Lilly Diabetes 250]]. Motorcyclist [[Bradley Smith (motorcyclist)|Bradley Smith]] competed in the [[Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|Red Bull Indianapolis GP]], with best finish of second in [[2009 Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix|2009]].

A German language translation of Smith has participated, with [[Sam Schmidt]] making three starts.

===Rabbits===
A longstanding legend at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway involves bunny [[rabbit]]s.&lt;ref name="News05-30-1959pg1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedway Rabbit Finally Captured|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19100000/|newspaper=The Indianapolis News|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 30, 1959|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1911-1993, there was only one race held annually at the Speedway. Activity outside the month of May was limited to semioccasional tire testing. Thus for eleven months out of the year, the grounds were noticeably quiet, green and lush, particularly after nine holes of a golf course were built in the spacious infield in 1929. The well-manicured grounds naturally became a home for [[fauna]], particularly rabbits and other small [[vermin]]. As the race participants would arrive in the spring, they would often be greeted by numerous rabbits roaming the grounds, oftentimes running out on the track. The rabbits were thought to be welcome and some considered them symbols of good luck. However, they were sometimes a nuisance, causing yellows for running out on the track and evading capture. [[Al Unser|Al Unser, Sr.]] famously ran over a rabbit during the [[1988 Indianapolis 500|1988 race]].&lt;ref name="Star05-30-1988pg2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Even rabbit's foot can't help Unser|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19100378/|first=Rick|last=Shaffer|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=2|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 30, 1988|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The well-known presence of rabbits at the Speedway even began a tradition that a rabbit would appear somewhere in the race program each year.

[[File:Indy500MilitaryAppreciation.jpg|thumb|Military Appreciation Lap at the 2015 Indianapolis 500.]]
* At 6 a.m., and in some years as early as 5 a.m., an [[Salute (pyrotechnics)|aerial bomb]] is set off to signal the opening of the gates.
* At 8 a.m., the "Parade of Bands" marches around the racing circuit. Numerous [[marching band]]s from nearby and neighboring high schools and universities entertain the early arriving fans. This tradition dates back to 1922, and celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2015.&lt;ref name="Bands2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500/news-multimedia/all/2015/01/26/indianapolis-500-parade-of-bands-90-anniversary?startrow=4|title=Indianapolis 500 Parade of Bands Recognized by Indianapolis House/Senate Resolution|publisher=Indianapolis Motor Speedway|first=Tom|last=Surber|date=January 26, 2015|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the bands in attendance also participate in the 500 Festival Parade downtown the day before. Traditional participants include the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band]] (along with the [[Purdue Big Bass Drum|World's Largest Drum]] which is driven around the track) and [[Speedway Senior High School|Speedway High School]].
* The [[Purdue University]] [[Purdue All-American Marching Band|All-American Marching Band]] plays several pre-race songs, including "[[On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away|On the Banks of the Wabash]]" and "[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]."
*In the 1960s to the 1990s, early arriving spectators would be entertained by [[Big band]] music. Songs by well-known Hoosier band leader George Freije and the Freije All Star Band were played over the public address system from roughly 6 a.m. to 8 a.m.&lt;ref name="Star05-26-1974pg1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Race Timetable|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19099606/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 26, 1974|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1991, and in most years since about 2002, a special military appreciation lap has been held. Military personnel who have recently returned from active service overseas are honored in a parade around the track. In 1991, hundred of troops who had returned from [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] marched around the course on race morning. In the 2000s, troops (namely from [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]) have been paraded around in trucks and saluted by fans.
* About an hour or two before the race, there is a parade around the track (typically in convertible festival cars) of the 500 [[Beauty pageant|Festival Queen]] and her court of 500 Festival Princesses. Likewise, a similar parade of former race winners, celebrities in attendance, and other VIPs is conducted.
* In many years, a ceremonial lap of vintage race cars and/or vintage pace cars is conducted. In some cases, the original drivers (or surviving relatives) are behind the wheel.
* Starting in 2016, a new tradition was introduced, the "march to the bricks." The [[Borg-Warner Trophy]] is paraded through the infield to the start/finish line.
* Finally, driver introductions take place. They are usually in reverse starting order with the front row being introduced last. This is followed by the drivers being paraded around the track similar to the Festival Queen, her court, and other VIPs.

The pre-race ceremonies usually go in the following order:
* Invocation
* "[[Taps]]"
* "[[America the Beautiful]]" and "[[God Bless America]]"
* "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]"
* "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]" accompanied by a balloon release
* Starting command

===Grand marshal===
In some years, a [[grand marshal]] has been named for the race. The duties of the grand marshal may include greeting drivers and dignitaries during pre-race ceremonies, delivering the "drivers to your cars" message, and riding in the pace car. This person may or may not be the same grand marshal as the 500 Festival Parade. Unlike other races, the grand marshal will not give the starting command.
*1991: [[Norman Schwarzkopf]]
*2015: [[Nastia Liukin]]
*2016: [[Florence Henderson]] (her final appearance)
*2018: [[Nick Goepper]]

===National anthem===
''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' has been performed before the start of the Indy 500 in most years. Up through the 1970s and early 1980s, the song was typically played by the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band]] without a vocalist. However, in some rare occasions, a vocalist was used. In 1976, [[Tom Sullivan (singer)|Tom Sullivan]] and [[Up with People]] were invited to sing, as a gesture to the [[United States Bicentennial|U.S. Bicentennial]].

By the mid-1980s, the Speedway began inviting notable artists to perform the national anthem. In nearly all cases, they would be backed by the [[Purdue All-American Marching Band|Purdue Band]]. In 1983, James A. Hubert flubbed the lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;1983 Indianapolis 500 Radio Broadcast, [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; He omitted the line ''"O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?"'' and instead repeated the second line ''"What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming"'', stumbling on the word "twilight" the second time around.

After the national anthem is performed, the public address announcer or the grand marshal gives the command "Drivers, to your cars!"

In 2001, [[Steven Tyler]] of [[Aerosmith]] caused a controversy&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Bruce. [http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12050217 Aerosmith's Steven Tyler Angers Vets At Indy 500], Yahoo! Music, May 29, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; after he [[2001 Indianapolis 500#National anthem controversy|changed the lyrics]] of the song. Recent performers include:

===Other songs===
In most years since 1991, the songs "[[America the Beautiful]]" and/or "[[God Bless America]]" have been performed. [[Florence Henderson]], a native Hoosier, was a friend of the Hulman-George family that owns the Speedway. Henderson performed one of the two songs numerous times, book-ending years when she performed the national anthem instead. Her performances were usually not televised.

The performance of "America the Beautiful" was introduced for the race's 75th anniversary running in 1991, in part due to [[Operation Desert Storm]]. Henderson switched to the national anthem for 1993–1997, then resumed "America the Beautiful" in 1999. In 2003, her performance was switched to "[[God Bless America]]," which became more popular in the post-9/11 era. She continued through 2015, then served as grand marshal for her final race in 2016. Henderson died six months after the 2016 race. Henderson routinely sang the entire song, including the prologue, and in some years sang the chorus a second time.

By 2009, "America the Beautiful" was re-added to the ceremonies, with a different artist each year. In 1999, [[Lee Greenwood]] did a special performance of "[[God Bless the USA]]", and in 2003, [[Darryl Worley]] performed "[[Have You Forgotten? (song)|Have You Forgotten?]]". In 2005, [[3 Doors Down]] did a special performance of [[Kryptonite (3 Doors Down song)|"Kryptonite"]] from the Pagoda, as part of the driver introductions.

===Invocation===
Starting in 1974, the Indy 500 was moved to the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. As a gesture, the Speedway added an [[invocation]] to the pre-race ceremonies. In most years since 1980, the Speedway has invited a representative of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis]]. In selected years, others have been invited including nationally famous clergymen [[Oral Roberts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZHVhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-voDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4159,7848240&amp;dq=jim%20mckay%201975%20indianapolis&amp;hl=en|title=Lakeland Ledger – Google News Archive Search|author=|date=|work=Google.com|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Billy Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = | title = IRL: Indy 500 – Billy Graham to give Race Day Invocation | url = http://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/irl-indy-500-billy-graham-to-give-race-day-invocation/ | publisher = motorsport.com | access-date = November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Most Reverend]] [[Archbishop]] [[Edward Thomas O'Meara|Edward T. O'Meara]] participated several times until his death in early 1992. Archbishop [[Daniel M. Buechlein]] then took over as the traditional clergy starting in 1993. Buechlein customarily ended his invocation with the word "[[wikt:Godspeed|Godspeed]]" in the languages of all of the participating drivers. Buechlein's final year at the race was 2009, and he died in 2018 after a lengthy illness.

===Taps===
In remembrance of [[Memorial Day]], "[[Taps]]" is played, and a U.S. military aircraft does a [[Flypast|fly-by]]. In some years, multiple aircraft participate, executing the [[missing man formation]]. Traditionally, a member of the public address announcing team recited a [[preamble]] honoring those who have died in combat, and [[List of racing drivers who died in racing crashes|those who have perished in automobile racing]]. The preamble dated back to at least 1965. Jim Philippe recited the preamble until he died in 2003. Dave Calabro said it in 2006, and Jerry Baker reprised it in 2012. Since 2000, a notable military or government official has also offered a tribute or remarks.

The traditional preamble goes as follows:
{{quotation|''"On this Memorial Day weekend, we pause in a moment of silence, to pay homage to those individuals who have given their lives—unselfishly, and unafraid—so that we may witness as free men and women, the world's greatest sporting event. We also pay homage to those individuals, who have given their lives—unselfishly, and without fear—to make racing, the world's most spectacular spectator sport."''}}

In the 1960s and 1970s, "Taps" was typically performed by a combined [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] [[Colour guard|color guard]]. Then from the about 1980 through 2005, it was usually played by the full Purdue Band. In 1986 and 1997, due to rain delays, the Purdue Band was unable to stay for the pre-race ceremonies. In those years, a substitute performer(s) was used. Since 2006, "Taps" has been rendered as a trumpet solo. In 2016, the trumpeter moved from the trackside victory podium near the pits to the starter's stand outside the main stretch.

==="Back Home Again in Indiana"===
[[File:Jim Nabors.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Jim Nabors]] at the 2000 Indianapolis 500]]
The most traditional performance is the singing of "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]".&lt;ref name="Star05-08-1985pg29"&gt;{{cite news|title=Back home again in Indiana - 30 Days in May|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18898177/|first=Dan|last=Luzadder|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=29|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 8, 1985|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition has accompanied the race since 1946. [[Jim Nabors]], accompanied by the Purdue Marching Band, notably performed the song in most years from 1972 to 2014. The song has long been the last event in the order of the day, immediately preceding the command to start engines.

During the song, thousands of multicolored [[Balloon release|balloons are released]] from an infield tent. The balloon release also dates back to 1946, but initially it did not coincide with the song.

The song, which was first published in 1917, is reported to have been first played at the race in 1919. A track side brass band played the song as Indiana-born [[Howdy Wilcox]] was finishing the final laps to victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/indy500/history/35196-Indy-500-Traditions/|title=Indianapolis Motor Speedway|author=|date=|work=IndianapolisMotorSpeedway.com|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the race was rained out on Sunday, and the start was rescheduled for Monday. Nabors (as well as the Purdue band), had left the grounds by Monday morning. Rather than find a last-minute replacement, Nabors suggested that the Speedway utilize a recording of one of his previous performances. The Speedway replayed his 1993 rendition, and it was well-received by the fans. Two days before the 2007 race, Nabors canceled his appearance due to an illness. On race morning, Nabors recorded a special video greeting to the fans from his Hawaii home, which was streamed over the Internet. Fans were invited to sing along with the Purdue band,&lt;ref name="traditions"&gt;[http://www.indy500.com/traditions/ Indianapolis 500 Traditions] Indy500.com&lt;/ref&gt; and a "get well soon" message was displayed for Nabors. In 2008, Nabors made a well-received return, and received a standing ovation at the public driver meeting.

Nabors again missed the race in 2012 due to an illness. This time, the Speedway sent a television crew to his home in Maui, and recorded a performance that was played on the video boards on race morning. In March 2014, Nabors announced that the 2014 race would be his final performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/default/news/show/52543-nabors-to-sing-and-39-indianaand-39-for-the-final-time-at-2014-indianapolis-500/|title=Nabors To Sing 'Indiana' For The Final Time at 2014 Indianapolis 500|work=[[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]|date=March 25, 2014|access-date=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Jim Cornelison]] was invited to sing, and his performance was critically praised. He was invited to return in 2018.&lt;ref name="jimc"/&gt;

===Starting command===
The call for the engines to start has been traditionally made by stating "Gentlemen, start your engines!" When female drivers have competed, the call has been amended to "Lady and gentlemen..." or "Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines." Beginning in 2017, the command has been recited as "Drivers, start your engines." The starting command is customarily recited by a ranking member of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] [[board of directors]], who also is a member of the [[Tony Hulman|Hulman]]-[[Mari Hulman George|George]] family.

The exact origin of the phrase is unclear, and there have been several conflicting accounts of who was the first to recite it, and what the exact wording of it was.&lt;ref name="TOGA 05-09-08"&gt;{{cite episode|title=May 9, 2009|series=The Talk of Gasoline Alley |author=[[Donald Davidson (historian)|Donald Davidson]]|url=http://www.1070thefan.com/|station=WFNI |location=Indianapolis |airdate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to World War II, it was commonplace for an aerial bomb to signal the start of the engines.&lt;ref name="TOGA 05-09-08"/&gt; Seth Kline was the official starter of the "500" in 1925–1926 &amp; 1934–1953. Kline is thought to have made an informal "Gentlemen, start your motors!" command as early as 1948 to accompany the bomb.&lt;ref name="TOGA 05-09-08"/&gt; The first documented case was in 1950, and that was recited by prolific public address announcer John Francis "Irish" Horan.&lt;ref name="TOGA 05-09-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clymer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Floys Clymer's 500 Yearbooks|date=1946–1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kline was again reported as saying it in 1951,&lt;ref name="30 Days 05-09-08"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sid Collins' 30 Days in May |series=The Talk of Gasoline Alley
|serieslink=Donald Davidson (historian)|url=http://www.1070thefan.com/|station=WFNI |location=Indianapolis |airdate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though some report it was Horan&lt;ref name="Clymer"/&gt;) Either Kline&lt;ref name="TOGA 05-09-08"/&gt; or Horan said it again in 1952.&lt;ref name="Clymer"/&gt; It was around that time the command was changed from ''"...[[Electric motor|motors]]!"'' to ''"...[[Internal combustion engine|engines]]!"'' The participants and officials alike, preferred the more technical term "[[Internal combustion engine|engines]]" to describe their machines. [[Sid Collins]] stated that chief steward [[Harlan Fengler]] explained to him "there are no motors in the race, just engines."&lt;ref name="30 Days 05-09-08"/&gt;

[[Wilbur Shaw]], president of the Speedway in 1946–1954, was once believed to be the person who coined the phrase, and it was erroneously claimed in his autobiography that he recited it in all the post-World War II years until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw |first=Wilbur |authorlink=Wilbur Shaw |author2=Albert W. Bloemker |title=Gentlemen, Start Your Engines |publisher = Coward-McCann|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speedway historian [[Donald Davidson (historian)|Donald Davidson]], however, believes Shaw only recited it twice, in 1953 and 1954.

After Shaw's death, [[Tony Hulman]] started reciting the command, and made it popular and famous. The normally soft-spoken and shy Hulman had a proud and vociferous version of the command annually. Hulman would rehearse the line, perfecting it for [[Showmanship (performing)|show]], and was even known to work with radio broadcaster Luke Walton to draft cue cards to know when to stress certain words and syllables. After Hulman's death in 1977, his widow [[Mary Fendrich Hulman|Mary F. Hulman]] took over the honor, followed by their daughter [[Mari Hulman George|Mari George]].

In 1977, [[Janet Guthrie]] became the first [[List of female Indianapolis 500 drivers|female driver]] to qualify for the Indy 500. Controversy surrounded the command, because the Speedway management did not want to alter the traditional phrase.&lt;ref name="1977 TV"&gt;1977 Indianapolis 500 Telecast: ABC-TV, May 29, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; During the week before the race, the management announced that they would not change the wording of the command. Looking for an excuse, they insisted that the cars were actually started by male crew members with an electric hand-held starter from behind the car. Guthrie and her crew were quite displeased by the stubbornness of the Speedway management, considering her unprecedented accomplishment. The crew reacted by assigning Kay Bignotti&lt;ref name="1977 TV"/&gt; (wife of George Bignotti) as the crew member to operate the inertial starter at the back of Guthrie's car. The Speedway's argument fell apart, and they decided upon a special amended command for that year. They did not announce beforehand what the special command would be,&lt;ref name="1977 TV"/&gt; and [[Tony Hulman|Hulman's]] highly anticipated phrase was the following:

{{cquote|In company with the first lady ever to qualify at Indianapolis, gentlemen, start your engines.}}

In 1978–1979, when Guthrie again qualified for the race, the command was simply amended to "Lady and gentlemen, start your engines." In 1992, [[Lyn St. James]] became the second female to qualify for the race. She publicly requested, albeit not contentiously, that the command be changed to "Drivers, start your engines."&lt;ref name="Star05-24-1992pg1"&gt;{{cite news|title='92 call to start as much a mystery as race's winner|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18898752/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 24, 1992|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request was dismissed, and the command used was the now customary "Lady and gentlemen..." variation. That variation, along with "Ladies and gentlemen..." were used many times over the next two decades. In 2017, [[Pippa Mann]] was the lone female driver in the field, and [[Tony George]] gave the command as "Drivers, start your engines." This was the first time that this variation of the command was used for the race.

For many years, the traditional location for giving the command was at the pace car in the front of the starting grid. Public address announcer Jim Philippe normally introduced the command, describing it as the "traditional command" or the "famous four words." Phillippe's final ''500'' was 2003. Likewise, for many years through 1989, Luke Walton traditionally introduced the command on the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|radio network]] broadcast. Since 2004, current public address announcer Dave Calabro introduces the command normally by calling it the "most famous words in motorsports."

In most cases, [[Tony Hulman]] would give the command, then ride in the [[Indianapolis 500 pace cars|pace car]] during the pace laps. [[Mary Fendrich Hulman|Mary F. Hulman]] would give the command near the pace car, but rarely rode in the pace car due to her age and declining health. Eventually, the location was moved to near the start/finish line, and in 2001, it was moved to the new Victory Podium stage adjacent to the Pagoda. In 2011 only, [[Mari Hulman George|Mari George]] moved back to the front of the starting grid to give the command, and then she rode in the pace car with [[A. J. Foyt]]. In 2014, as a special gesture to [[Jim Nabors]]'s final performance at Indy, the starting command was given in unison by both Mari George and Nabors, marking the first time a non-member of the Hulman-George family had given the command for the 500 since 1954. In 2016 for the [[2016 Indianapolis 500|100th Indianapolis 500]], now-matriarch Mari was joined by three subsequent generations of the Hulman-George family, who gave the command together. Due to her advanced age, the 2016 race would be Mari's final turn giving the command. Later that same year, [[Tony George]] gave the starting command for the [[Brickyard 400]], his first time giving a command since a restart command in 1986. For the [[2017 Indianapolis 500]], the duty was permanently assigned to [[Tony George]]. In that year, Tony George began using the phrase "Drivers, start your engines" instead of the more familiar "Lady and gentlemen..." variation.

On occasions when an accident or rain has halted the race, a second command has typically been given. Years include: 1967, 1973, 1982, 1986, 1997, 2004, 2007. The amended command, "gentlemen, re-start your engines," has usually been used. In 1986, this restart command was given by [[Tony George]]. In 1997, it was given by [[Mari Hulman George]]. In 1982 and 2004 the command was given by public address announcer [[Tom Carnegie]].

In 1981, Mary F. Hulman was unable to recite the starting command due to an illness. In that year, Mari George recited, her first time performing the honor.&lt;ref name="News05-23-1981pg1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wild, Early Dash For 500-Mile Lead Expected|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19099078/|first=Wayne|last=Fusion|newspaper=The Indianapolis News|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 23, 1981|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the starting command has been adopted to start all sorts of auto racing in the United States, including but not limited to [[NASCAR]]. However, in many venues outside of Indy, the phrase "Drivers, start your engines" appears to be the preferred version.

===Honorary starter===
[[File:Reggie Miller Indianapolis 500-2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Reggie Miller]] in the starter's stand in [[2005 Indianapolis 500|2005]]]]
A recently-added tradition is the use of an honorary starter. A special guest has been invited in recent years to wave the green flag to start the race. Starting in 2013, the tradition was expanded where another celebrity or special guest(s) arrives on race morning by helicopter to ceremoniously deliver the green flag or the checkered flag. The official starter (or "flagman"), however, is a trained race official, and handles the remainder of the flagging duties during the race. In 2010, due to two early caution periods, honorary starter [[Jack Nicholson]] elected to stay in the starter's perch for an additional few minutes, and was able to drop the green for the two subsequent restarts as well.

===Celebrity guests===
Since the early years of the race, [[Celebrity|celebrities]] from all walks of fame have been invited to the race, some have returned for many years or even decades. Television and [[movie star]]s, recording artists, sports figures, [[politician]]s, and military, are among the many dignitaries invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2016/05/24/wahlberg-cheech-epps-kardashian-hasselhoff-nicholson-gable-indianapolis-speedway/84507360/|title=Indy 500: Ranking top 33 celebs who attended 99 races|publisher=IndyStar.com|first=David|last=Lindquist|date=May 24, 2016|accessdate=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the pre-race, a parade of stars is conducted around the track, usually in convertibles. In numerous years, celebrities have been invited to drive the [[Indianapolis 500 pace cars|pace car]] at the start of the race.
[[File:LindaVaughn1997Indy500.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Linda Vaughn at the 1997 Indianapolis 500]]

[[Clark Gable]] is seen in a famous photograph of the [[1947 Indianapolis 500|1947 race]]. Among the many celebrities who attended or have attended multiple Indy 500s include [[Jim Nabors]], [[James Garner]] (who drove the pace car in 1975, 1977 and 1985), [[David Letterman]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Florence Henderson]], Linda Vaughn, and many others. [[Paul Newman]], who starred in the Indy-related film ''[[Winning]]'', attended the race many times, and in 1983–1995, and then again in 2008, was at the race as co-owner of [[Newman/Haas Racing]]. [[Joyce DeWitt]], who grew up in the [[Speedway, Indiana|Town of Speedway]], and graduated from [[Speedway Senior High School]], once worked at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway ticket office.&lt;ref name="Star05-23-1981"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joyce DeWitt back home again for '500'|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7312378//|first=Donna S.|last=Mullinax|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=9|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 23, 1981|accessdate=November 4, 2016}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least three former [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]] (and one future President) has attended the Indianapolis 500. [[Gerald Ford]] attended the [[1979 Indianapolis 500|1979 race]], serving also as the [[grand marshal]] of the 500 Festival Parade.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/indy500/news/show/36511-president-ford-had-unique-connection-to-indianapolis-500/ |title=President Ford Had Unique Connection To Indianapolis 500|publisher=Indianapolis Motor Speedway|first=Paul|last=Kelly|date=2007-01-02|accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton]] attended the [[2003 Indianapolis 500|2003 race]], the first time in Indy history that two former presidents were at the same race.&lt;ref name="Daily Trackside Report"&gt;2003 Indianapolis 500 – Daily Trackside Report&lt;/ref&gt; It was the elder Bush's second visit to the Speedway; he previously presided over the opening ceremonies of the [[1987 Pan American Games]], which was held at the track. Future President [[Donald Trump]] attended the race in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Post-race commentary by Chris Economacki on the 2002 Indianapolis 500 radio broadcast on the IMS Radio Network&lt;/ref&gt; Trump was selected to drive the pace car for the 2011 race, but withdrew the duty after drawing controversy from fans. In 1971, tentative plans were made for sitting president [[Richard Nixon]] to attend the race, as part of the NATO Conference on Urban Affairs that was being held in the city. Nixon was even rumored to be giving the starting command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nixon Expected At 500, May Circle Track|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17293719/1971_indy_500_richard_nixon/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=March 25, 1971|accessdate=February 9, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon would have been the first, and only to-date, sitting president to attend the race. However, the visit was later cancelled.

At least two presidential candidates have visited the Speedway during their respective election campaigns, owning much to the fact that the Indiana [[United States presidential primary|primary]] is usually held May. [[Ronald Reagan]] visited the track during the month of May 1976, while he was in town campaigning for the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]] [[Indiana]] [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1976|Republican primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/at-reagan-library-the-gipper-as-gearhead/?_r=1|title=At Reagan Library, the Gipper as Gearhead|publisher=New York Times|work=|first=Ronald|last=Ahrens|date=July 14, 2011|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://outlet.historicimages.com/products/dfpa89731|title=1976 Press Photo Ronald Reagan Drives Car Indy Raceway|publisher=Historic Images Outlet|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Hillary Clinton]] visited the track while campaigning for the [[Indiana Democratic primary, 2008|2008 Indiana primary]] and met with driver [[Sarah Fisher]].

At least three former [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidents]] have attended the race. The aforementioned Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and Indiana native [[Dan Quayle]]. Qualye has attended the race numerous times, including three times as sitting Vice President (1989–1991). Current Vice President [[Mike Pence]] has reportedly attended the race over 30 times, most recently in 2016, while he was the sitting [[List of Governors of Indiana|Governor of Indiana]] and again in 2017 while he was sitting Vice President. In 2018, Pence visited the track during practice, but not on race day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wthr.com/article/vp-pence-visits-ims-as-andretti-again-tops-speed-chart-at-indy-500-practice|title=VP Pence visits IMS as Andretti again tops speed chart at Indy 500 practice|publisher=WTHR|date=May 18, 2018|accessdate=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Letterman]] worked as a reporter for ABC Sports during the [[1971 Indianapolis 500|1971 race]], and attended the race many times as a spectator. Since 2002, he has attended the race as co-owner of [[Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing|Rahal Letterman Racing]]. The team won the race in [[2004 Indianapolis 500|2004]] with driver [[Buddy Rice]]. At the [[2015 Indianapolis 500|2015 race]], Letterman was honored on the famous scoring pylon during the pre-race; just four days after he retired from the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]''.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, several [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]s from the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Apollo program]]s were among invited guests.

* For the entire history of the 500 mile race, the official winner of the race has been defined as the driver who completes the 500 mile distance first, sans penalties. A winner is declared with a finishing time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Finishers behind the winner were given additional time – upwards of an hour in early years – to complete the 500 mile distance. In very early years, completing the full 500 miles was a requirement to receive prize money. Later, it was because completing the 500 mile distance at an average speed of over 100 mph earned a driver a spot in the prestigious Champion Spark Plug [[100 mph Club]]. In 1964 as live television arrived, this "extra time" was reduced to about five minutes, and after 1974, when raucous fans ran out on the track at the checkered flag, extra time was eliminated. 1975 was the first year in which the lap the winner finishes the race is the final lap for ''all'' competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://doctorindy.com/2015/10/28/the-fastest-500s-part-1/#comment-301|title=The Fastest 500s (Part 1)|date=2015-10-28|work=JI500|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Gordon Johncock]] was said to have completed the 500 miles in lesser elapsed time than winner [[Graham Hill]], second place [[Jim Clark]], and even third place [[Jim McElreath]]. However, Johncock had suffered minor damage during the first lap accident, and restarted the race in the pit lane due to the crew changing the nose cone. USAC officials did not score his first lap out of the pit lane, and he effectively ran all day carrying a one lap penalty to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* The cars begin the race in a rolling start, traditionally in eleven rows of three, for a field of 33 total cars. Most other automobile races have two cars per row. The 33-car field derives from a 1919 [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] mandate of one car for every 400 feet (120 m) of track. Early races, however, saw varying numbers of starters, from as low as 21, to as high as 42. The number of cars in each row also varied, with as many as five abreast. Since 1933 there have only been the following exceptions to having a field of 33 racers:
** In 1941, 33 cars initially qualified for the field during time trials. [[Sam Hanks]] was injured in a practice crash the day before the race and withdrew. Then on the morning of the race, [[George Barringer]]'s car was destroyed in a fire that swept through the garage area, thus only 31 cars lined up to start the race.
** In 1947, only 30 cars qualified. A boycott over the purse led to the smaller field.
** In [[1979 Indianapolis 500|1979]], after a rules dispute over turbocharger inlets, and after controversy regarding the refusal of some entries from members of the [[Champ Car|CART]] series, a special fifth day of qualifying was added. However, only two cars ran sufficient speeds to be added to the field, and 35 cars lined up to start the race. Heavy attrition early on saw one car fail to complete a lap, and 7 cars out by lap 22.
** In [[1997 Indianapolis 500|1997]], which used an "all exempt tour" concept similar to the [[PGA Tour]] since 1983, the top 25 teams headed in Indy Racing League team entry points standings earned exemptions into the field, with the top nine non-exempt cars making the race on speed. Some exempt teams bumped out other non-exempt cars that had actually qualified with faster speeds, but their teams were not in the top 25 of League points. Two bumped cars were restored to the field to ensure that the "33 fastest entries" were part of the field, for a total of 35 starters. Ironically on the pace lap, three cars crashed out together, while two suffered mechanical problems, and only 30 cars took the green flag. (A similar rule was used at the [[Brickyard 400|Crown Royal presents the Your Hero's Name Here 400]] from 2005 to 2012 and the [[Lilly Diabetes 250]] from 2012 to 2014. Both were NASCAR races which guaranteed a position for the top 35 drivers in the owners standings in the [[Sprint Cup Series]] and top 30 drivers for the [[Xfinity Series]].)

* [[Tom Carnegie]] announced on June 9, 2006 that the previous month's race, would be his last as official chief track announcer. Having called the race since 1946 on the [[public address system]], he is best known for his lines, "He's/She's on it!" (signaling the start of a qualifying attempt), "It's a new track record!" (when a driver surpasses either a one- or four-lap track record in qualifications), and "He's slowing down on the backstretch!" or "Andretti is slowing down!" (The latter for the [[Andretti Curse|Andretti family's historical misfortune]] at Indianapolis.).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Paul. [http://www.indy500.com/news/story.php?story_id=6828 Legendary P.A.

After Carnegie's retirement, '''Dave Calabro''', sports director of Indianapolis' NBC affiliate [[WTHR]], became the second chief PA announcer in the Hulman-George era for the 2007 race and ever since.
* With the race scheduled for the month of May, the on-track activities are often at the mercy of [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] springtime rain showers. Numerous practice days, qualifying days, and race days, over the years have been halted, [[Rainout (sports)|delayed or washed out]] due to inclement weather. Since the cars can not race on a wet or damp course, rainy weather (and even rainy forecasts) are often despised by fans and competitors. Track owner [[Tony Hulman]] was said to have loathed rainy weather at the track, quipping that if he woke up on race day to rainy weather he "would just assume crawl under the bed and stay there". Days at the track that feature plentiful sunshine, warm, pleasant temperatures, and no precipitation, are said to be experiencing "Tony Hulman weather".

===Victory Lane===
[[File:IndianapolisMotorSpeedwayVictoryLane.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Victory Lane at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.]]
[[File:IMSMasterControlTower1988.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Victory lane platform used from 1986-1993.]]
[[File:Takuma Sato at Indy500 2017.jpg|thumb|right|250px|2017 Indy 500 winner [[Takuma Sato]] celebrates his victory.]]

Immediately after taking the checkered flag, the race winner drives to Victory Lane. The celebration to honor the winner begins with the car being wheeled onto a black and white checkered periphery. The driver is presented with the [[Borg-Warner Trophy]], which is situated behind the car in a prominent location. A floral wreath is placed around the winners neck, and the winner is presented with the traditional bottle of milk for refreshment. Interviews are taken for television, radio, and over the public address system. The driver's crew and team owner(s) also are invited to celebrate in victory lane, and are joined by numerous dignitaries, including the 500 Festival Queen and Princesses court, track and series personalities, celebrities, and various sponsor representatives. The Indianapolis 500 notably does not utilize a [[Podium#Usage in motorsport|podium]] for the top-three finishers as is customary in other forms of racing, as well as at most other IndyCar events. Only the winning driver and team participate in victory lane celebrations, believed to be an homage to horse racing's Winner's Circle.

In the early years, victory lane was located at the far south end of the pit area, near the entrance to Turn One. For many years, it was identified by a large black and white checkered carpet. This location was used through 1970. In 1971, victory lane was moved to the horseshoe area located in front of the Master Control Tower. The car would be rolled up two checkered ramps, to a raised platform a few feet above the ground. In 1986, a new victory lane was constructed, which was a hydraulic lift in the pit lane. In 1994, after the pit lane was reconstructed, victory lane was moved back to the horseshoe area, this time on a large cylindrical platform.

The current victory lane is located beneath the Victory Podium stage, adjacent to the Pagoda. The [[Podium|podium]], which was originally built for the U.S. Grand Prix to serve as a 1st-2nd-3rd podium for that event, is not used as a podium for the Indy 500 or for the Brickyard 400. Instead it is utilized as a stage for pre-race ceremonies.

===Bottle of milk===
A long-standing tradition of the Indianapolis 500 is for the winner to drink a bottle of milk immediately after the race. This tradition dates back to 1936 after victor [[Louis Meyer]] asked for a glass of buttermilk, something his mother had encouraged him to drink on hot days. Meyer also reportedly drank milk after his victory in 1933, as did a few others in the immediate years afterward. The young tradition quickly went away, and for a time after World War II, was replaced by "Water From Wilbur" – a silver [[jug (container)|jug]] (resembling an ice bucket) filled with icy-cold water, presented by then-Speedway president, and three-time former winner [[Wilbur Shaw]].

By 1956, the milk returned as a ritual as milk companies became sponsors of the race purse and handed a bottle of milk to the winner to promote their product.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; A [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] of currently $10,000 now paid out by the [[American Dairy Association]] if the winner sips the milk in victory lane. In [[1993 Indianapolis 500|1993]], [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] drank [[orange juice]] instead of milk after his victory. The snub drew considerable ire from fans. Later he took a sip of milk, at the urging of his car owner Roger Penske. Fittipaldi owned citrus farms in Brazil, and wished to promote his industry. As a result, he was booed in driver's introductions the following week by the crowd in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], in the heart of "[[Dairy farming|America's Dairyland]]." In 1981, [[Bobby Unser]] also did not drink the milk in victory lane.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donald Davidson (historian)|The Talk of Gasoline Alley]]'' – [[WFNI]], April 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After Unser was tentatively stripped of his victory, [[Mario Andretti]] sipped from a bottle of milk the next morning during the traditional photo shoot.

===Borg-Warner Trophy===
{{main|Borg-Warner Trophy}}
A [[bas-relief]] sculpture of the winner's face, along with his name, average speed, and date of victory is added to the [[Borg-Warner Trophy]]. The trophy has been in use since 1936.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt; A smaller replica of this trophy has been officially presented to the winner after the race since 1988 and team principal since 1997, usually in a press conference either at the Speedway or in Detroit at the [[North American International Auto Show]] at the [[BorgWarner]] exhibit, except for the 2011 race because of extenuating circumstances ([[Dan Wheldon|the winning driver]] had died in a crash at an aborted INDYCAR race; [[Bryan Herta|the winning team principal]] and the driver's widow were presented with the respective trophies in the ensuing January). Prior to that, winners received a replica mounted on a chestnut plaque.

===Other celebrations===
*The Gordon Pipers [[bagpipes]] marching band has performed traditionally at the Indianapolis 500 since 1962. The band marches and performs during the 500 Festival Parade, during pre-race ceremonies, and plays while the winner is being wheeled into victory lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wishtv.com/top-video/55-years-of-tradition-inside-the-indianapolis-500-gordon-pipers/1064214175|title=55 years of tradition: Inside the Indianapolis 500 Gordon Pipers|publisher=WISHTV.com|date=March 7, 2017|accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Celebratory [[Burnout (vehicle)|burnouts]] or "[[Doughnut (driving)|donuts]]," while not specifically prohibited by the rules, are generally discouraged and frowned upon at the Indianapolis 500. Burnouts in IndyCar racing in general are often prohibited by the teams themselves, as they potentially inflict damage on the engines, which are subject to strict mileage usage and rebuild intervals.
*Impromptu celebrations at locations other than the formal victory lane area are also discouraged, and sometimes considered a breach of tradition. The lone exception in the past many years has been [[Hélio Castroneves]], who made a signature of climbing the catchfence after his victories. In 2016, [[Alexander Rossi]] ran out of fuel on his cool down lap, and his car coasted to a halt out on the track. He then sprung from his car to wave to fans in turn four. He was quickly towed to victory lane, and the formal celebrations began as normal.
*At some point after the victory lane celebration, the winner is whisked away and rides for a lap around the track in the pace car to salute the fans.
*The tradition of the winning driver and crew kissing the yard of bricks that mark the start/finish, started by [[Dale Jarrett]] at the [[1996 Brickyard 400]], appears to have carried over to the Indy 500, starting with [[Gil de Ferran]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13020015/ Hornish Jr. ruins Andrettis’ ‘fairytale’ Indy], Associated Press, May 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selected awards===
*'''Pace car''': The race winner has been awarded one of the [[pace car]]s, or a replica, almost every year since 1936. In 1941, there were only six copies of the special [[Chrysler Newport]] Phaeton, and no production models created. The co-winners did not receive it. In 1946, an [[oil painting]] and a trip&lt;ref name="Star05-09-1946f"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Air Trip Is "500" Prize|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5855731/1946_indianapolis_500/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 9, 1946|access-date=July 11, 2016}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; was substituted as the award, but winner [[George Robson (racing driver)|George Robson]] died in a motor sports accident before he received it. In 1971, [[Al Unser]] received a [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]] from Palmer Dodge in the Indianapolis area, after the [[Dodge Challenger]] pace car was damaged in the start crash. Palmer repaired the car and kept it until selling in 2006 to local car collector Steven Cage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021233428/http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2014/10/20/infamous-1971-dodge-challenger-to-take-part-in-largest-ever-display-of-indy-500-pace-cars/|title=Infamous 1971 Dodge Challenger to take part in largest-ever display of Indy 500 pac - Hemmings Daily|date=21 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the [[Dodge Viper]] was still a prototype vehicle, and only two were in existence. Winner [[Rick Mears]] was awarded instead a [[Dodge Stealth]], which was to be the original pace car but after protests by the [[UAW]] (because the Stealth was a [[captive import]] built by Mitsubishi in Japan), they were instead used at the track for festival cars.&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt;
*'''Rookie of the Year''': Since 1952, the [[Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award has been presented for the most outstanding performance by a rookie (first year) driver. The award is voted on by a panel of experts, and does not necessarily go to the highest finishing rookie.
*'''Louis Schwitzer Award''': The [[Louis Schwitzer Award]] is presented annually to an engineer, or a team of engineers, for excellence in the design, development and implementation of new, innovative motorsports technology concepts for use in the Indianapolis 500.
*'''Jigger Award''': The [[Leon Sirois#The Jigger Award|Jigger Award]] is presented by the American Auto Racing Writers &amp; Broadcasters Association (AARWBA) for the "hard-luck" driver during time trials. It is in reference to the infamous qualifying gaffe of [[Leon Sirois|Leon Duray "Jigger" Sirois]] at the [[1969 Indianapolis 500|1969 race]]. Selection criteria is very loose, and sometimes lighthearted, but the recipient is usually one of the last drivers bumped from the field, or a driver who fails to qualify (especially if he/she made several unsuccessful attempts).
*'''Quilt''': Among the numerous awards presented to the winner is the traditional Winner's [[Quilt]]. Since 1976, Jeanetta Holder has hand-crafted a special quilt blanket for the winner, which features an Indy-related design. She presents the quilt to the winning driver the morning after the race, during the traditional winner's photo shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motorsport.com/#/indycar/news/granny-s-quilts-keep-indy-500-winners-warm/?v=3&amp;f=1&amp;s=1&amp;i=1|title=Granny's Quilts Keep Indy 500 Winners Warm|publisher=Motorsport.com|date=June 4, 2011|access-date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Winner's photo''': The morning after the race, the winning driver and team participates in the traditional winner's photo shoot at the start-finish line. The 1981 photo shoot is notable in that race winner [[Bobby Unser]] was stripped of the victory when official results were posted. Second place [[Mario Andretti]] was elevated to the win, and Andretti took part in the photo shoot. Later in the year, Unser was reinstated the victory, having never sat for a session of official winner photographs. In 2009, heavy rain on Monday morning forced [[Hélio Castroneves]]' photo shoot to take place indoors.
*'''Victory Banquet''': The night after the race, the prizes are distributed at the annual 500 Victory Banquet. The traditional awards banquet dates back many decades. In 1972, the black-tie gala was moved to the [[Indiana Convention Center]], and was held there until the mid-2000s. In more recent years, it has been held at a pavilion on the grounds of the Speedway. The 1973 banquet was cancelled due to the rain delay and tragic circumstances surrounding the event. For a brief time (2000–2001), the banquet was held on Sunday night, a few hours after the conclusion of the race. The 2000 race did not end until nearly 6 p.m. due to a rain delay, and participants had to rush downtown to make the banquet on time. In 2002, the banquet was moved back to Monday night. In 1986, the race was delayed until the following Saturday due to rain, and the banquet was cancelled due to scheduling concerns. A private victory luncheon for the top three finishers was held the day after the race at the Speedway Motel.

===Official standings===
For many years, the results of the race were considered unofficial until the following day. Immediately after the race, the sanctioning body would begin reviewing the scoring serials, as well as examine video tapes and film, in order to confirm the results, correct scoring errors, make judgements on rules infractions, and assess penalties (or rescind penalties) if necessary. It was not unusual for the vetting process to go late into the evening, beyond midnight, and into the early hours of the next morning. Traditionally, [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] would post the official results at 8&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time the morning after the race. Revisions were not unusual, as assessed penalties and scoring corrections would be announced in the official standings. However, most corrections were relatively minor, and seldom did drivers lose or gain positions in the final standings. A brief protest period would open for the teams to formally submit complaints, and if there were no protests, the official results would stand as published.

This policy was often a source of controversy, as in earlier years, this made officials apt to document rules infractions as they occurred, but not assess penalties until ''after'' the race – rather than during the race. Drivers and teams were sometimes not made fully aware of rules infractions until after they were issued a penalty the next morning. This prevented teams from being able to strategize and make up the penalty deficits during the race itself. In some cases, the penalty dropped them one or more positions in the final standings. By the early to mid-1990s, in-race penalties became the preferred method of assessment, namely the [[Glossary of motorsport terms#S|stop &amp; go penalty]], and currently the [[Glossary of motorsport terms#D|drive-through penalty]].

The most famous instances of protest occurred in [[1981 Indianapolis 500|1981]] and [[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002]].{{Says who|date=March 2017}}

Starting in 1990, a new electronic scoring system was implemented, simplifying the scoring process.&lt;ref name="Star05-25-1991a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Splitting Seconds – Time runs out foor stopwatches at speedway (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13403042/|first=Joseph T.|last=Hallinan|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=27|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 25, 1991|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star05-25-1991b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Splitting Seconds – Time runs out foor stopwatches at speedway (Part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13403053/|first=Joseph T.|last=Hallinan|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=28|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 25, 1991|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, officials were done compiling the official standings very early Sunday evening, but still withheld the official release until 8 a.m. the next day. By 1993, the rules were amended such that the official standings would be released approximately six hours following the conclusion of the race (rather than the next morning).&lt;ref name="Star05-29-1993"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indy 500 facts|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13575939/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=44|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 29, 1993|accessdate=September 5, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was largely because computer and [[GPS]]-based scoring systems had automated the process, and barring any equipment malfunctions (as happened at [[Firestone 600|Texas]] in 1997), serial scoring errors were almost non-existent; and significantly more accurate and reliable than previous hand-scoring methods. Manually-assessed penalties (such as one-lap penalties assessed for violations that occurred very late in the race) are occasionally a focus of post-race analysis and scoring revision, as those penalties are typically unable to be served before the race concludes.

'''Indoor cycling''', often also called '''spinning''', as an organized activity, is a form of exercise with classes focusing on endurance, strength, intervals, high intensity (race days) and recovery, and involves using a special stationary [[exercise bicycle]] with a weighted flywheel in a classroom setting.

== Class content and goals ==
[[File:Home cycling trainer 1897.jpg|thumbnail|"All the delight of outdoor cycling enjoyed at home" - article from 1897 describing indoor spin.]]
Classes generally use specialized [[exercise bicycle|stationary bicycle]]s. Features include a mechanical device to modify the difficulty of pedalling, specially shaped handlebars, and multiple adjustment points to fit the bicycle to a range of riders. Many have a weighted [[flywheel]], which simulates the effects of inertia and momentum when riding a real bicycle. The pedals are equipped with toe clips as on sports bicycles to allow one foot to pull up when the other is pushing down. They may alternatively have [[bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless]] receptacles for use with cleated [[cycling shoe]]s. Padded shorts aid comfort and avoid the chafing caused by the sewn seams in underwear.

If the exercise is not done correctly or the rider's position is bad, injuries can occur; problems with the lower back and knees are most common. To avoid injury and aid comfort it is important to make sure the bio-mechanical position of the rider is correct. Group cycling bikes have a wide range of adjustment, and it is essential to obtain the correct setup prior to riding. The seat position must be right for the participant's height. The height of the seat should be in level with the hip when the participant is standing next to the cycle. Horizontally, the seat should be set in order for the front of the knee to be directly in vertical line with the [[Ball (anatomy)|ball of the foot]] when the pedal is pointing forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bodybike.dk/inspiration/good-advice|title=Good advice {{!}} BODY BIKE indoor cycles|website=www.bodybike.dk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://caloriesburnedhq.com/img/Spinner-Bike-Setup.pdf|title=Spin Shoes - Guide to Indoor Cycling Shoes|last=Chapman|first=Gareth|date=2017-02-12|work=Calories Burned HQ - Zumba Calories Burned, Calories Burned Walking|access-date=2017-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a position where the knee is slightly bent at an angle between 25% and 35% when the leg is extended with the foot resting flat at the bottom of the pedal stroke. Handlebar height can be adjusted for comfort; less experienced riders may want to set them higher to ease lower back discomfort. A reasonable reference point is to set it in level with the seat.

A typical class involves a single instructor at the front of the class who leads the participants through routines that are designed to simulate terrain and situations similar to riding a bike outdoors. Some of the movements and positions include hill climbs, sprints and [[interval training]]. A well-trained instructor uses [[music]], [[motivation]], visualization and enthusiastic coaching to lead students through a ride that best suits their fitness level and goals. Most instructors will lead what is called an interval ride, where students will sprint, run, climb, and jump all in the same ride, but there will not be definable pattern to the exercises. In the early 2000s, "terrain-based" classes that simulate outdoor conditions (e.g., wind resistance) were introduced. Terrain-based classes are designed to improve a rider's outdoor skill set and increase endurance while providing an intense cardio-based workout.

Participants set goals based on their [[heart rate]], which can be measured by hand or using a [[heart rate monitor]] and ride simulated variations in terrain by altering resistance and cadence. Some participants choose to maintain a moderate, [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] intensity level, with a heart rate of between 50 and 85% of max while others drive their heart rates higher in intervals of [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] activity to levels of between 85 and 92%.

One of the major advantages of indoor cycling is that each participant can exactly control his/her level of intensity to suit ability or fitness level but still remain as a group together. The classes can therefore be heterogeneous. As an alternative, participants can judge their level of exertion relative to a perceived exertion scale. The instructor should advise a recommended exertion scale from 1 (no exertion at all) to 10 (maximum exertion). Each rider is permitted to dictate how hard he/she chooses to work with the instructor providing active and dynamic encouragement together with technical and practical advice throughout the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Besides burning (on average) between 300-500 kcal in 60 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;Darling, A. "Be Fit: The Science of Health: Part 2: Exercise: Feel the burn: Which workout is best for you? Andy Darling is your guide." Guardian, The. 2005, January 15: 28.&lt;/ref&gt; indoor cycling also strengthens the muscles of the lower body. It tones the [[quadriceps]] and [[hamstring]]s, along with working the back and hips. It can be difficult to stay at the moderate level in a class that is geared towards more intensity. The difficulty of the workout is modulated in two ways:

#By varying the resistance on a [[flywheel]] attached to the pedals. The resistance is controlled by a knob, wheel or lever that the rider operates, causing the flywheel brake (a common bicycle brake, a friction wheel, a magnetic eddy-current brake, a viscoelastic fluid brake, or a strap running around the flywheel) to tighten. On most bikes the brake can be adjusted from completely loose, providing no resistance to pedaling beyond the inertia of the flywheel, to so tight that the rider can not move the pedals. Usually riders who can't pedal at the resistance called out by the instructor are encouraged to ride at a level at which they feel comfortable yet challenged.
#By changing the cadence (the speed at which the pedals turn). Pedaling at a higher rate expends more energy than pedaling at a lower rate with the same resistance. Correct cadence is between the range of 80 to 110 RPM for seated flat, standing flat (running) and jumping and 60 to 80 RPM for seated climb, standing climb, running with resistance and jumps on a hill. Sprints are taken under hill resistance building cadence up to no more than 110 RPM. Seated sprints are most suitable as the rider maintains full control of posture at all times and will avoid falling due to exhaustion. A correct sprint should last from 10 to 25 seconds, leaving the rider exhausted in the 85 to 92% max heart rate range.
[[File:Foundation-20F9-0353.jpg|thumb|Typical fixed wheel ergonomically adjustable variable resistance bike]]
There are five core movements in the Spinning programme.
*'''Seated flat''', with hands at the center part of the handlebars. This is hand position one. This position should be used only when seated, for flat road simulations and during the warm-up and cool down. Cadence between 80 and 110 RPM.
*'''Standing flat''' (also known as '''running'''), with hands wide on the back 12-14" part of the handlebars that crosses the rider's body. This is hand position two. Proper form for standing while running requires the body to be more upright and the back of the legs touching or enveloping the point of the saddle, with the center of gravity directly over the crank. The pressure of body weight should never rest excessively on the handlebars. Cadence is between 80 and 110 RPM
*'''Jumps''', (also known as '''lifts'''), a combination of seated and standing with riders hands at position two for durations of between two and eight seconds. Cadence between 80 and 110 RPM.
*'''Seated climb''' with hands at position two, increased resistance and lower cadence of 60-80 RPM.
*'''Standing climb''' with hands wide and forward so the thumb tips are touching the far end of the handlebars (hand position three). The rider is canted slightly forward so that maximum force can be exerted onto the pedals with heavy resistance and a cadence of 60-80 RPM.

These five movements each work a different part of the body and focus on different leg muscle groups. The rider should always maintain control of the flywheel by having resistance applied and remaining below a cadence of 110 RPM. Not all bikes have a freewheel, or 'smart release', and it is possible that the flywheel will 'run away' with the rider with the potential for causing injury. The rider should be able to maintain perfectly even pedal rotations at high resistance. This becomes difficult below 60 RPM cadence and failing to make 'perfect circles' increases the risk of knee and hip injury. A road cyclist will normally have a natural pedal cadence, of about 85 RPM and will control changes in terrain by changing gear to maintain this rate. The goal of the spinning programme is not to exceed this natural rate by more than 25 RPM higher (110 RPM) or lower (60 RPM)
There are five further advanced movements based on those listed above.
*'''Running with resistance'''
*'''Jumps on a hill'''
*'''Seated flat sprint'''
*'''Seated hill sprint'''
*'''Standing hill sprint'''

Most indoor cycling classes are coached with [[music]]. Riders may synchronize their pedalling to be in time with the rhythm of the music, thus providing an external stimulus to encourage a certain tempo. Often, the music chosen by the instructor is [[dance music]] or [[rock music]] set to a dance beat (i.e. 4/4 time), but not necessarily. This tends to help motivate participants to work harder than they might otherwise. The instructor also may choose specific songs for sprints, climbs, and jumps. While the music provides a tempo cue, the cadence does not need to be a multiple of the beat in order for the rider to feel in rhythm; the music therefore helps a rider maintain any constant cadence, not just a cadence that matches the beat. It may depend on the level of exertion whether or not someone changes position or the instructor can tell the class to change.

A variation known as "aqua cycling" or "hydrospinning" also exists. In this, the stationary bicycles are underwater in a pool.&lt;ref name="Landreth"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-swimming-blog/2014/jan/21/hydrospinning-fitness-spin-class-cycling-underwater|title=Hydrospinning: the fitness craze that makes your spin class look easy|last=Landreth|first=Jenny|date=21 January 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/08/29/aqua-cycling-new-underwater-workout/|title=Aqua cycling: A new underwater workout|date=29 August 2013|work=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
Kinesiological stretching isolates muscles' actions one by one. It concentrates mainly on the muscles which are tighter than the others. This stretching method goes deeper and also helps in acquiring flexibility and strength faster than other methods of stretching.&lt;ref name="EASY"&gt;Paul Zaichik, [https://www.easyflexibility.com/blogs/news/10176749-what-is-the-kinesiological-stretching-technique "What is the Kinesiological Stretching technique?"], ''easyflexibility.com'', November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Muscolino, [https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=08fjDAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y "Kinesiology: The Skeletal System and Muscle Function"], .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and advantages==
The basic use of this technique is to train and stretch a particular muscle, whereas the traditional methods like [[dynamic stretching]], [[static stretching]], [[PNF stretching]] etc. are mostly concerned with more than just one muscle simultaneously.&lt;ref name="ELASTIC"&gt;[http://www.elasticsteel.net/Articles.asp?ID=419 "ElasticSteel Professional Fast Flexibility Training Certification"], ''elasticsteel.net'',.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayne R. Jensen, [https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=hvdqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;dq=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y "Applied Kinesiology and Biomechanics"], .&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinesiological stretching is used to train particular muscles to attain motion beyond the normal range. Generally there are various limiting factors for different muscles to attain a range of motion beyond the normal range, and these limiting factors are known as passive limiting factors. Kinesiological stretching eliminates these passive limiting factors.&lt;ref name="NWA"&gt;Matt Parrott,[http://www.nwaonline.com/news/2016/dec/26/strength-training-stretches-keep-knees-/ "Strength training, stretches keep knees in shape"], ''nwaonline.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Patricia Hamilton, Kathryn Luttgens, [https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=fdELAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;dq=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y "Kinesiology: scientific basis of human motion - Page 414"],.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinesiological stretching is used to avoid the stretch reflex, while increasing the range of motion of a specific muscle. This is strikingly different from previously known stretching techniques, which look to increase the ROM (or [[Range of motion]]) in a specific degree of freedom of a joint or group of joints.&lt;ref name="ELASTIC"/&gt; The stretching method is also used in the treatment of abnormal [[scapulothoracic joint]] combined with the patient's awareness of his/her postural faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neumann |first=Donald A. |title=Kinesiology of the musculoskeletal system : foundations for rehabilitation|date=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location=St. Louis, Mo. |isbn=0323039898 |edition=2nd |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen S. Clippinger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PCKxhwL1sSQC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=Kinesiology+stretching&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Kinesiology%20stretching&amp;f=false "Dance Anatomy and Kinesiology - Page 229"],.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages== 
Just like other types of stretching exercises, Kinesiological stretching can lead to injuries especially when performed in a hurry. Engaging in the stretching method without completing the required motion properly can lead to muscle strains or tears.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Crowe,[http://livehealthy.chron.com/disadvantages-stretching-7925.html "The Disadvantages of Stretching"], ''livehealthy.chron.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fitness-science.org/pros-cons-different-stretching-methods/ "The pro’s and cons of different stretching methods"], ''fitness-science.org'',January 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lexa W.

== Criticism of Davis Cup ==
Kosmos partnership with the International Tennis Federation to revamp the Davis Cup has been criticized by the tennis community. Many claim that the partnership will take away from the traditions of the 118-year-old tennis event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/22595981/davis-cup-revamp-plans-hold-event-one-location-seven-days-november-get-mixed-response|title=Davis Cup revamp plans get mixed response|website=Espn.com|access-date=2018-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523172112/http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/22595981/davis-cup-revamp-plans-hold-event-one-location-seven-days-november-get-mixed-response|archive-date=2018-05-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a secret meeting held in Orlando, Florida, on August 16, 2018, the changes proposed by Kosmos received a 71 percent approval at the International Tennis Federation annual general meeting.

[[Image:Black Latex Catsuit 777.jpg|thumb|300px|A woman wearing a black [[latex]] [[catsuit]] and [[thigh-high boot]]s.]]    

'''Latex''' [[rubber]] is used in many types of '''clothing'''. Rubber has traditionally been used in protective clothing, including [[gas mask]]s and [[Wellington boot]]s. Rubber is now generally being replaced in these application by plastics. [[Mackintosh]]es have traditionally been made from rubberized [[cloth]]. 

[[Latex]] rubber as a [[clothing]] material is common in [[fetish fashion]] and among [[BDSM]] practitioners, and is often seen worn at [[fetish club]]s. Latex is sometimes also used by [[couturier]]s for its dramatic appearance. Latex clothing tends to be [[skin-tight]]. There are several magazines dedicated to the use and wearing of it. Less commonly, latex clothing can be loose-fitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.picturepush.com/photo/a/2192822/img/2192822.jpg |title=Image of loose latex clothing |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a handful of companies around the world which manufacture latex rated as suitable for contact with human skin. These firms supply sheet (in the vast majority) to a larger number of smaller fashion clothing companies. In the past, some marketplaces suffered from de facto monopoly [[Supply (economics)|supply]] conditions, where a sheet supplier could impose restrictive ordering requirements. Only being able to order half-kilometre long batches of sheet in the colour and thickness they wanted, meant that designers and clothing producers often had to co-operate, or face long delays in supplying their customers, if they wanted to be in the rubber clothing business.

Since 2000, however, the sheet market has been exposed to competition from international suppliers courtesy of the Internet. This has produced an explosion in [[cottage industry]] scale latex fetish clothing manufacturers.

Latex sheet-based clothing is constructed by a three-stage process. First a pattern for a specific garment is selected, and adjusted carefully to suit the measurements supplied by the customer. Then the sheet latex is cut out on a flat board, by hand: lastly latex glue (generally rubber cement solvent-based adhesives) is used to join seams together. Skilled latex makers can build a stocking, shaped to match the contours of a specific person's leg, made from latex only 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick, in under an hour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} It is possible to use water-based glues such as Copydex to make latex clothes; however, the long-term durability of items made this way is somewhat dubious.

Latex moulded clothing is produced by dipping a mould into a vat of liquid rubber. Dealing with raw liquid latex is more difficult because of the extra effort that must be put in to keep the thickness of the latex itself consistent.  Because of this, improper molding techniques can lead to inconsistent thickness in the latex, causing it to fail at the weak points faster than items made from sheet latex.  This has led to a major stigma against molded latex garments, in favor of sheet latex versions.  Unfortunately, this stigma has been detrimental to those few latex providers who have proper mold-making techniques.  When done properly, a molded latex garment is just as durable as sheet latex, and it is a preferred method for skilled individuals making items with heavy contours like hoods or gloves.  Despite any attempt to use sheet latex to make hoods and gloves, it is impossible to get solid sheets to fit complex contours as well as a molded latex item can.  The belief that all sheet latex is superior to all molded latex is completely false, and ultimately it depends on the abilities of the creator, as even poorly made sheet latex can fall apart easily.  Sheet latex is the preferred method for items like catsuits, that do not need such perfect form fitting, and are easier to create with sheets compared to the large molds required for body suits.

While there is little difference in latex clothing made from liquid latex versus sheet latex in the hands of a skilled artisan, it should be noted liquid latex is cured via air drying while sheet latex is cured by being vulcanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/ArticlesP/art52064.asp|title=body art 186 - Body Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V98YjsZsJ8IC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=how%20is%20%22sheet%20latex%22%20made%20vulcanization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8em8V5rqlC&amp;sig=v59T5ZzW6RtyWJrWOGM9AkHeNbY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xY_ZUO3pNYr9qQHkmID4Cw&amp;ved=0CG8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20is%20%22sheet%20latex%22%20made%20vulcanization&amp;f=false|title=Latex 2002|date=24 February 2017|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does make the two forms slightly different. Due to the difference in curing, liquid latex can be applied to sheet latex clothing to add unique patterns and designs which can be peeled off the sheet latex afterwards.

Neither moulded, nor sheet-based, latex is amenable to large-scale mass production. Skilled manual artistry is an integral part of the process; this means that made-to-measure and special designs are much more accessible to the general buyer, in looking at fetish latex, than is the case with regular textiles.{{fact|date=March 2017}}

== Use in clothing ==

Latex has been used to make [[leotard]]s, [[bodysuit]]s, [[stocking]]s and [[glove]]s, besides other garments. Latex is also often used to make specialist fetishistic garments like hoods and rubber cloaks.

Latex clothing is generally made from large sheets of latex which are delivered in rolls. The "classic" colour for fetishistic latex clothing is black, but latex is naturally translucent and may be dyed any colour, including metallic shades or white. It can come in thicknesses which generally range from about 0.18&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm. Instead of being sewn, latex clothing is generally glued along its seams.

Because latex sheet is relatively weak, latex clothing needs special care to avoid tearing. While latex can be repaired using materials similar to those provided in a bicycle repair kit, the result is rarely as attractive as the original appearance of the garment.

Latex clothing is often polished to preserve and improve its shiny appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.otleyrunfancydress.co.uk/2012/03/01/latex-care/|title=Latex Care Guide by Otley Run Fancy Dress|date=1 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Putting on latex clothing can be difficult, because latex has high friction against dry skin. To make it easier to put on, wearers often use [[talc]] to reduce friction against the skin when putting the clothes on; then, because stray talc is very visible against the rubber, wearers generally polish off any visible talc. Another method of dressing is using lubricant (or 'lube') which provides a slippery surface for the latex to glide over.  A third method of reducing or eliminating the high friction of latex when dressing is to chlorinate the rubber.  [[Chlorine]] in gaseous form is generated by the reaction of hydrochloric acid and sodium hypochlorite.  This chlorine bonds to the first few molecules on the surface of the [[isoprene]] (latex) and transforms them into [[neoprene]].{{fact|date=July 2016}} This process affects metallic colours, but does not affect strength.

Latex may also be painted directly onto the body as latex in liquid form, which is also sometimes used to close seams in the creation of latex clothing. Removal of a painted on liquid latex garment can result in painful hair removal.  Wearers avoid this by preparing the skin by prior hair removal, the use of release agents to prevent the latex adhering to the hair, or using products such as [[orange oil]] to weaken the latex during removal.

Use of latex clothing has been popularized by media appearances, such as the outfit of [[Catwoman]], a [[cat burglar]], in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' or the outfits in [[The Matrix]] which are mostly made of latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevedietgoedde.com/bloggy/2008/05/catwoman.html|title=The Artistic Pursuits of Steve Diet Goedde: Catwoman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Use in fetish community ==

Latex clothing is a popular feature of the [[BDSM]] community. Pioneered by prominent [[Dominatrix|dominatrixes]] such as [[Saffron Taylor]].

{{Olympic Games sidebar}}

This is a list of '''international sports federations''', each of which serves as a [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] [[sports governing body|governing body]] for a given [[sport]] and administers its sport at a world level, most often crafting rules, promoting the sport to prospective [[spectator sport|spectators]] and [[fan (person)|fans]], developing prospective players, and organizing world or [[continent]]al championships. Some international sports federations like the [[FINA|International Swimming Federation]] and the [[International Skating Union]] may oversee multiple activities referred to in common parlance as separate sports: FINA, for example governs swimming, diving, synchronised swimming, and water polo as separate 'disciplines' within the single 'sport' of Aquatics.

International sports federations form an integral part of the Olympic and Paralympic movements. Each [[Olympic sport]] is represented by its respective international sport federation, which in turn help administer their respective events during the Games. For a sport to become an Olympic sport, its respective international sport federation must be recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Sports/|title=Olympic Sports|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, an international sports federation must be recognized by the [[International Paralympic Committee]] for its sport to become a [[paralympic sport]], though in the latter case, several Paralympic Sports are governed by a dedicated committee of the International Paralympic Committee itself, under the ''World Para'' branding, for example track and field athletics for disabled athletes is governed by the IPC itself, under the name '''World Para Athletics'''. Other Paralympic sports are governed within the structure of the able-bodied equivalent: for example, the UCI governs both able-bodied and paralympic cycling.

[[File:Ball-bin-P1080178.jpg|thumb|A MUGA surrounded by noise reducing earth walls.]]
A '''Multi Use Games Area''' (abbreviated MUGA) is usually a steel anti vandal outdoor fenced area with built in goal post units for various types of sports games, such as [[football pitch|football]], [[basketball]] or [[tennis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/new-multi-use-games-area-1711810|title=New sports area for football, basketball and tennis opens in Harlow|first=Charlotte|last=Page|date=26 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer fencing makes it easier to keep the ball in play. MUGAs are often installed at [[school]]s. MUGAs can be supplied in Half court (Open one end with one combination goal unit), Full court (Fully enclosed with two end goal units) and Key area (Open single goal end with key line markings).

[[File:Multipurpose Sports Court.PNG|thumb|A multi use games area with line markings for sports.]]
MUGAs are often supplied as ready-made solutions by various manufacturers. Sports MUGAs usually consist of a steel goal post and basketball goal post combination. This can be senior, junior or match quality for basketball. Sports played on MUGAs are varied, hence the term Multi Use. Basketball, football, hockey, netball, volleyball are usually provided for with appropriate floor line markings for each sport, which are lined in different coloured paints. Multi Use Games Area MUGAs are placed into the ground around a sports surface area including natural grass, artificial sports surfaces, sports tiles, tarmac or concrete. Some MUGAs are open ended, partially closed or fully enclosed. Sizes vary from Key Area 6m x 7.5m. Tarmac key lined. Half Court 7.5m x 15m. Full Court 15m x 30m.

The intense activity in a MUGA can increase [[noise pollution|noise]] and complaints from neighbours. The noise level depends on the material used for the fencing, and by the location. Positive results from United Kingdom local authorities can provide good evidence &lt;ref&gt;Citation?&lt;/ref&gt; that placements of anti vandal Multi Use Games Areas can reduce anti social behaviour and increase fitness within early teen age groups in both cities and parish localities.

The '''North American Association of Sports Economists''' (NAASE) is an organization that promotes and facilitates research and teaching in the economics of sports. NAASE was founded in 2007.  The organization emerged from the many sessions focused on sports economics at the Western Economic Association International (WEAI) meetings held throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.  NAASE maintains a close relationship to the WEAI and the annual NAASE business meeting takes place at this conference.  Although many NAASE members are academics, membership is open to anyone with an interest in sports economics, and NAASE counts undergraduate and graduate students in economics and other related disciplines like sport management as members, as well as non-economists with an interest in sports economics.  Despite the regional scope implied by its name, NAASE has members from around the world, and many past and current officers have been from outside North America. NAASE currently has around 100 members.

==Journals==
The ''[[Journal of Sports Economics]]'' has been published in association with NAASE since 2008, and NAASE members receive discounted subscriptions to the journal.  Beginning in February 2009, the ''Journal of Sports Economics'' began publishing an annual volume dedicated to papers from NAASE sponsored sessions at the Western Economic Association annual conference.

==Officers==

* President: Brad R. Humphreys, [[West Virginia University]]
* Past-President: Dennis Coates, [[UMBC]]
* President-Elect: [[David Berri]], [[Southern Utah University]]
* Secretary: Stacy Brook, [[University of Iowa]]
* Treasurer: John Solow, [[University of Iowa]]
* Vice Presidents: Peter von Allmen, [[Moravian College]], Craig Depken, [[University of North Carolina - Charlotte]], Anthony Krautmann, [[DePaul University]], Michael Leeds, [[Temple University]], Robert Simmons, [[Lancaster University]]

==Activities==
NAASE sponsors sessions at numerous academic conferences, including the Western Economic Association International conference, the [[Southern Economic Association]] conference and the Eastern Economic Association conference.  NAASE also sponsors a listserv to promote interaction among researchers in sports economics.

NAASE, in conjunction with the International Association of Sports Economists, operates a working paper series that is part of Research Papers in Economics ([[Repec]]).

==Awards==
NAASE confers an award every four years, the Larry Hadley Service Award, to recognize outstanding service to the field of sports economics.  The first Larry Hadley Service Award will be given at the WEAI Annual Conference in Portland, Oregon in July 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="92534">A '''perfect season''' is a sports [[season (sports)|season]] including any requisite playoff portion, in which a team remains and finishes undefeated and untied. The feat is extremely rare at the professional level of any team sport, and has occurred more commonly at the collegiate and scholastic levels in the United States. A '''perfect regular season''' (known by other names outside the United States of America) is a season ''excluding'' any playoffs, where a team remains undefeated and untied; it is less rare than a complete perfect season but still exceptional.

A perfect season may be part of a multi-season [[winning streak (sports)|winning streak]].

[[Exhibition game]]s are generally not counted toward standings, for or against. For example, the 1972 Miami Dolphins (below) lost three of their preseason ("exhibition" games in 1972 NFL vernacular) games but are considered to have had a perfect season.

==American football==

===National Football League===
{{Main|1972 Miami Dolphins season}}
Since the [[National Football League]] began in [[1920 NFL season|1920]], only one team has played a complete perfect season (both regular season and playoffs): [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|the 1972 Miami Dolphins]], who won all fourteen of their regular season games and three postseason games, including [[Super Bowl VII]], to finish the season 17–0–0.

The Dolphins briefly extended their winning streak before losing to [[1973 Oakland Raiders season|the Oakland Raiders]] on September 23, 1973. It has often been reported that the surviving members of the 1972 Dolphins would, every season, either gather to drink champagne when the final undefeated team earned its first loss of the year, or send a case of champagne to the team who beat this final undefeated team. The head coach of the 1972 Dolphins, [[Don Shula]], denied this in a 2007 interview with ESPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wojciechowski|first=Gene|title=Shoes ... The Jaw ... by any name, Shula still the king|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&amp;id=2750571|publisher=ESPN|date=February 1, 2007|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 20, 2013, four decades after their accomplishment, President [[Barack Obama]] hosted the 1972 Dolphins noting that they "never got their [[White House]] visit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er3z00blcec&amp;t=1m |title=President Obama Honors the 1973 Super Bowl Champion Miami Dolphins  |publisher=YouTube.com/user/whitehouse |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NFL undefeated seasons (with ties) prior to 1932====
Prior to the development of a playoff system in the NFL in [[1932 NFL season|1932]], there were four teams who completed seasons undefeated, but with one or more tied games: [[1920 Akron Pros season|the 1920 Akron Pros]], [[1922 Canton Bulldogs season|the 1922 Canton Bulldogs]], [[1923 Canton Bulldogs season|the 1923 Canton Bulldogs]], and [[1929 Green Bay Packers season|the 1929 Green Bay Packers]]. According to the 2012 NFL Record &amp; Fact Book, under NFL practices at the time, from 1920 to 1971 tie games were not included in winning percentage (there was also no [[overtime (sports)|overtime]] to settle ties in the regular season until 1974) so, these four teams were recorded with perfect win percentages of 1.000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Past_Standings_2011.pdf | title=2012 NFL Record &amp; Fact Book | publisher=NFL | accessdate=18 September 2013 | pages=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1921 Buffalo All-Americans season|The 1921 Buffalo All-Americans]] were controversially denied a similar type of near-undefeated season, when they believed that their final game, [[Staley Swindle|a 10-7 loss to the Chicago Staleys]], was an exhibition game which would not count in the final standings; the NFL records that game as official, and Buffalo's record as 9–1–2.

====Other NFL perfect regular seasons====
{{Main|1934 Chicago Bears season|1942 Chicago Bears season|2007 New England Patriots season}}
Apart from the 1972 Dolphins, three NFL teams have completed undefeated and untied regular seasons: [[1934 Chicago Bears season|the 1934 Chicago Bears]], [[1942 Chicago Bears season|the 1942 Chicago Bears]], and [[2007 New England Patriots season|the 2007 New England Patriots]].

In 1934, the Bears played a 13–0–0 regular season and became the first NFL team to complete an undefeated regular season without tied games, but lost the [[1934 NFL Championship Game]] against [[1934 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]]. Despite losing several players and head coach [[George Halas]] to military service in World War II, the 1942 Bears finished 11–0–0 but again lost the [[1942 NFL Championship Game|NFL Championship Game]], this time against [[1942 Washington Redskins season|the Washington Redskins]].

The 2007 Patriots became the first team after the NFL expanded its regular season to sixteen games in [[1978 NFL season|1978]] to finish the regular season undefeated. The Patriots then won their divisional and conference playoff games, but were upset by [[2007 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]] in [[Super Bowl XLII]], giving them a final record of 18–1.

===Pre-NFL era and competing leagues===
NFL predecessors such as the [[Ohio League]], [[New York Pro Football League]] and [[Western Pennsylvania Professional Football Circuit]]  had many perfect seasons. In Ohio, the [[Massillon Tigers]] (1904, 1905), [[Akron Indians]] (1909), [[Shelby Blues]] (1911), and [[Dayton Triangles]] (1918) all had perfect seasons during this era. In New York, the [[Buffalo (NFL)|Buffalo Niagaras]] went 5–0–0 (6–0–0 including a forfeit) in a league that consisted of teams entirely from the city of Buffalo in 1918. In 1920, the [[Union Club of Phoenixville]], located in eastern Pennsylvania, played in a league mostly consisting of local teams and earned a perfect season, claiming for itself a [[mythical national championship]]. In western Pennsylvania, the [[1900 Homestead Library &amp; Athletic Club football team|1900]] and [[1901 Homestead Library &amp; Athletic Club football team|1901]] Homestead Library and Athletic Club teams, as well as the 1903 [[Franklin Athletic Club]], all had perfect seasons.

The caliber of talent was neither as high nor as consistent between teams at the time, the seasons were generally shorter (7 to 11 games), and it was not uncommon for top teams to play all their games at home while lesser teams played all of their games on the road. In 1918, Dayton and Buffalo had the additional advantage of having its strongest competitors suspend operations due to the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] and the [[World War I|First World War]], restrictions that also prevented the two teams from playing each other. Thus, it was much easier to earn a perfect season than it would become in the NFL.

====1937 Los Angeles Bulldogs====
The [[Los Angeles Bulldogs]] were a member of the [[American Football League (1936)|second American Football League]], who joined the league in 1937 after the [[Cleveland Rams]] defected to the NFL. Playing a combination of AFL teams and independent franchises (such as the [[Providence Steam Roller]] and the [[Salinas Packers]]), the team went 16–0, with 8 of those wins coming against AFL teams. The Bulldogs’ dominance is cited as one of the key factors in the AFL's demise,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and the next season as an independent with a 10–2–2 record including a 2–1–2 record against NFL teams, several of the team's players were invited to play on the "Pro All Stars" team in the NFL's first [[Pro Bowl|Pro All-Star Game]] in Los Angeles. The Bulldogs are considered to be one of the few independent teams to have ever achieved parity with the NFL.

====1948 Cleveland Browns====
The [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]] were a member of the [[All-America Football Conference]], a professional football league that played from 1946 to 1949.  In 1948, the Browns won all fourteen regular season games and the [[All-America Football Conference#1948|1948 AAFC championship]] to post a 15–0–0 record. Cleveland's perfect 1948 season was part of a longer string of 29 straight wins, which stretched from 1947 to 1949 and included both the 1947 and 1948 title games.  Overall, the Browns won all four AAFC championship games and were accepted into the NFL when the two leagues merged after the 1949 season.

Neither the NFL nor the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] recognizes the Bulldogs’ perfect season; the Hall of Fame recognizes the Browns’ perfect season but the NFL does not.

===Close to perfect===
Since the NFL expanded to a fourteen-game regular season in [[1961 NFL season|1961]], eleven teams have had regular seasons with one loss and no ties (or better) while failing to achieve a perfect season:
{| class="wikitable sortable"

|-
|[[2015 Carolina Panthers season|2015 Carolina Panthers]] || 15 || 1 || Won two playoff games before losing [[Super Bowl 50]] || 17–2
|}

Most of these teams suffered their regular-season loss early in the year and, other than the 2007 Patriots (finished regular season 16–0), only the 1962 Packers (10–0), 1985 Bears (12–0),  2011 Packers (13–0), and 2015 Panthers (14–0) were on track for a perfect season when they lost. Coincidentally, the 1985 Bears’ lone loss came to the Miami Dolphins.

The best start from an NFL team who failed to complete a perfect regular season is shared by two teams: the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|2009 Indianapolis Colts]], who started 14–0 before losing their final two regular season games to the [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] and the [[2009 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] to finish 14–2, and the [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|2015 Carolina Panthers]], who went 14–0 before losing to the [[2015 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] and going on to finish the regular season 15–1. The 2009 Colts, having clinched the top seed in the AFC, sacrificed their chances at a perfect regular season and instead [[resting the starters|rested their starters]] the final two games to protect them for the playoffs. The Colts would go on to [[Super Bowl XLIV]] but lost to the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. The 2015 Panthers were not resting their starters at the time of their loss (at the time, the [[2015 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] were 13–2 and still had an opportunity to surpass the Panthers for the top seed in the NFC).

Four other teams have started 13–0 before losing their fourteenth game: the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998 Denver Broncos]], [[2005 Indianapolis Colts season|2005 Indianapolis Colts]], [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|2009 New Orleans Saints]] and [[2011 Green Bay Packers season|2011 Green Bay Packers]] (Of those near-perfect seasons, the 2011 Packers are the only team that did not win a single playoff game). The 1998 Broncos, 2005 Colts and 2009 Saints lost at least two of their final three games but the Broncos and Saints recovered to win the Super Bowl. The [[1953 Cleveland Browns season|1953 Cleveland Browns]] and [[1969 Los Angeles Rams season|1969 Los Angeles Rams]] started 11–0 in twelve- and fourteen-game seasons respectively; both lost their only playoff game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballgeography.com/?p=3190|title=Last Undefeated NFL Team(s) in Each Season » FootballGeography.com|website=www.footballgeography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other leagues===
The following is a list of teams in minor or alternate leagues that compiled perfect seasons of six games or more, including postseason games, with no ties:

*The Hollywood Bears, a member of the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]], went 8–0–0 in 1941.
*The Hollywood Rangers were a member of the [[American Football League (1944)|American Football League of 1944]] (formerly the Northwest War Industries League), a short-lived competitor to the [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]] on the West Coast. In their 1944 season, they went 11–0–0 and defeated the PCPFL champion San Diego Bombers (who had also had a perfect season in their league, going 9–0–0) in a two-game series.
*The Charleston Rockets of the [[Continental Football League]] won all 14 games of the league's inaugural season in 1965, going on to defeat the [[Toronto Rifles]] in the league's championship.
*The Hartford Knights went 17–0–0 in 1972 as a member of the [[Seaboard Football League]], including a victory over the [[Chambersburg Cardinals]] in the league's championship. The Knights, unhappy with the level of competition (many of the Knights games had margins of victory of 40 points or more), quit the league the following year.

In [[indoor American football|indoor football]], the following teams have had perfect seasons:

*The [[Quad City Steamwheelers]] went undefeated in the [[2000 AF2 season|inaugural season]] of [[AF2|arenafootball2]], accruing a record of 19–0–0 including playoffs and an [[ArenaCup I]] win.
*The [[Ohio Valley Greyhounds]] of the [[National Indoor Football League]] accrued a perfect season in 2003.
*The [[Sioux Falls Storm]] of [[United Indoor Football]] won back-to-back perfect seasons in 2006 and 2007, winning the United Bowl championship both years.
*The [[Fayetteville Guard]] won a perfect season in 2007 in the NIFL.
*The [[Rochester Raiders]] won a perfect season in [[2008 Continental Indoor Football League season|2008]] in the [[Continental Indoor Football League]], but withdrew from that league during the playoffs in a dispute.
*The [[Baltimore Mariners]] won a perfect season in [[2010 American Indoor Football Association season|2010]] in the [[American Indoor Football Association]].
*The [[Erie Explosion]] won a perfect season in [[2013 Erie Explosion season|2013]] in the Continental Indoor Football league, winning all ten regular season games, a semifinal playoff, and the CIFL Championship.

At least twenty-three other semi-professional football teams have had perfect seasons, seven of them being at least 17 games long. The [[Chambersburg Cardinals]] won a record 72 straight games between 1977 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Brainerd (2010). [http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teamgame.htm Minor league football records - Winning streaks].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been no perfect seasons (or even perfect regular seasons) in the [[American Association (football)|American Association]], [[World Football League]], [[United States Football League]], [[XFL]], or, to date, the [[Arena Football League]]. The [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]] has had two perfect regular seasons, but neither qualify for the list: [[2009 Florida Tuskers season|the 2009 Florida Tuskers]] finished 6–0, but that team lost the subsequent [[2009 UFL Championship Game|championship game]]; the [[2012 Las Vegas Locomotives season|2012 Las Vegas Locomotives]] had a record of 4–0 when the league abruptly suspended operations halfway through the season.

The 1933 [[Providence Huskies]] (possibly a successor to the [[Providence Steam Roller]]) played arguably the most perfect season ever recorded by a professional or semi-professional team: a ten-game season in which they won every game and did not concede a single point during any game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semiprofootball.org/minor/records/teampnts.htm |title=Semi-pro Football / Minor League Football – Team Points Records |publisher=Semiprofootball.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leagues outside North America===
In the [[2014 German Football League]] the [[Braunschweig Lions]] compiled a perfect season (12–0 postseason 3–0), losing only in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] which is a different competition. They crowned the season with another German Bowl triumph. Similarly in the [[2016 German Football League]] the [[Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns]] achieved a perfect regular season with a 14–0 record, similarly their lone defeat came in the [[BIG6 European Football League]] which is not considered for league standings. However, unlike Braunschweig before them, Schwäbisch Hall ultimately lost the [[German Bowl]], in this case to Braunschweig. In the [[2017 German Football League]] season, Schwäbisch Hall once more compiled a perfect season (14-0) but this time also won the [[German Bowl]], again against Braunschweig. Interestingly, their opponent in the final had also entered the game with a 14-0 regular season record.

==Canadian football==
A true perfect season (no losses and no ties through the regular season and playoffs) has never been achieved in professional Canadian football. Only one team, the 1948 [[Calgary Stampeders]], has completed a perfect regular season.

The current [[Canadian Football League]] schedule would require a team to win 20 games (18 regular season, 1 playoff after bye week, and the Grey Cup championship) to post a perfect record.

===1948 Calgary Stampeders===
Under head coach [[Les Lear]], the 1948 [[Calgary Stampeders]] completed a perfect regular season with a record of 12–0; they had two wins and a tie during the playoffs to finish with a record of 14–0–1, the only undefeated complete season in Canadian pro history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&amp;id=208] Grey Cup History (CFL.ca), Accessed December 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Interprovincial Football Union]] championship (a home-and-home [[Playoff format#Total points series (aggregate)|aggregate]] series decided on total points) against the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders|Regina Roughriders]], the first leg was tied 4–4, and the Stampeders won the second 21–10, to win the aggregate 25–14. The Stampeders then defeated the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 12–7 for the [[36th Grey Cup]].

Despite the Stampeders' title, their achievement was only lightly regarded in the East. At the time, the Eastern and Western unions played separate regular seasons and only met in the Grey Cup. The Western union was openly regarded to be a weaker competition in the East, and Calgary's win (only the third for a Western team up to that time) was dismissed as a fluke.

==Lacrosse==
In professional [[lacrosse]], the [[1993 MILL season|1993]] [[Buffalo Bandits]] are the only team to have won a perfect season in the [[National Lacrosse League]]. The Bandits won all ten of their regular season games and won the championship in a two-round tournament; the season was the continuation of a multi-season winning streak that dated to the Bandits’ successful run for the [[1992 MILL season|previous year's]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.buffalonews.com/sports_ink/2011/07/three-former-bandits-among-six-nominated-for-nll-hall.html |title=Three former Bandits among six nominated for NLL Hall – Sports, Ink &amp;#124; The Buffalo News |publisher=Blogs.buffalonews.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Major League Lacrosse]], which began play in 2001, [[2013 Denver Outlaws season|the 2013 Denver Outlaws]] were the first team to complete a perfect regular season, winning all fourteen of their games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/lacrosse/ci_23837209/denver-outlaws-beat-hamilton-finish-season-undefeated-at ‘Denver Outlaws beat Hamilton, finish season undefeated at 14–0’]; ''[[Denver Post]]'', 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After beating [[2013 Hamilton Nationals season|the Hamilton Nationals]], the Outlaws had a sequence of twenty consecutive regular season wins despite losing [[2012 MLL season|the 2012 championship]]. However, the Outlaws lost in the first round of the playoffs [[2013 Charlotte Hounds season|to the Charlotte Hounds]], who had only gone 7–7 in the regular season.

==Other North American professional sports leagues==
In North America's three other major professional sports leagues ([[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]]) it is almost impossible for a team to play a “perfect” season, primarily because there are substantially more games in the regular season (82 in the NBA and NHL, and 162 in Major League Baseball). The [[Women's National Basketball Association]]‘s season has been between 28 and 34 games long, and it too has never produced a perfect season.

It is possible for a baseball [[pitcher]] to achieve a perfect season, taking at least one win and any number of no-decisions throughout the year. This has happened 1813 times in baseball's history, though the majority (1171) were 1–0 seasons, mostly by [[relief pitcher]]s. The best perfect season belongs to [[Tom Zachary]] of the 1929 [[New York Yankees]], who posted a 12–0 record in 119.2 innings. No pitcher has ever achieved a perfect season while qualifying for the [[Earned run average|ERA]] title.

In the NBA, the [[1985–86 NBA season|1985–86]] [[1985–86 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] played a nearly perfect home season. During the regular season, they were 40–1 (.976) in front of their home crowd. The [[Boston Celtics|Celtics']] only regular-season home loss occurred on December 6, 1985, to [[1985–86 Portland Trail Blazers season|the Portland Trail Blazers]], by the score of 121–103. The Celtics would also win all 10 of their home games in the postseason, to finish 50–1 at home. The [[2015–16 NBA season|2015–16]] [[2015–16 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]] also played a nearly perfect home regular-season with a 40-1 (.976) record in front of their home crowd, with their only home loss occurring on April 10, 2016 vs. the [[Golden State Warriors]] by the score of 92-86. The Spurs were eliminated in the Western Conference Semi-Finals by the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] in the [[2016 NBA Playoffs]].  The Spurs played a total of 5 home games in the post season, finishing 43-3 at home, losing twice to the Thunder. The three-on-three basketball league [[BIG3]], which featured an eight-game regular season and two-round playoff, had a perfect team in its inaugural season when [[Trilogy (basketball)|Trilogy]] swept all ten games on their schedule.

===Individual professional sports===
For other sports leagues for individuals, such as the [[PGA Tour]] or [[NASCAR]], a perfect season would represent winning every event in a season. Considering the number of tournaments or races in those leagues, and the fact that each individual faces over 40 opponents as opposed to one, a perfect season is almost impossible.

Golf instead considers the [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]], a sweep of the four [[men's major golf championships]] deemed to be the most difficult contests in professional golf, to be analogous to perfection. The only time the Grand Slam has been swept in any given year was 1930, when [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] won all four majors (at the time, [[The Amateur Championship|The (British) Amateur Championship]] and [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] were still considered majors); since 1934, when [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] was added as a major, no player has won all four in one year. [[Tiger Woods]] is the only professional golfer to win four consecutive professional majors; he did so over two years in 2000 and 2001. The record for most consecutive wins in professional golf is 11, set [[Byron Nelson]] in 1945; Nelson would win 18 tournaments overall that year, a year when wartime manpower shortages were still limiting the number and quality of professional golfers for Nelson to compete against.

In [[Formula One]], [[Michael Schumacher]] was the 2004 champion with 13 wins in 18 races. In IndyCar, [[A. J. Foyt]] won 10 out of 13 races. In [[NASCAR]], [[Richard Petty|Richard "The King" Petty]] holds most of the records for most wins in a season; he won 27 races out of 48 appearances in 1967, 10 of them consecutive. Since a format change in 1972, Petty also holds the modern-era record for most wins in a season, with 13, a record he shares with [[Jeff Gordon]].&lt;ref name=Daytona&gt;{{cite book|title=Daytona: From the Birth of Speed to the Death of the Man in Black|last=Hinton|first=Ed|year=2001|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-52677-0|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional motorcycle racer [[Ricky Carmichael]] had perfect seasons in 2002 and 2004. In 1997, [[road racing|road racer]] [[Tommy Kendall]] started the 13-race [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] [[Trans-Am Series]] season 11–0, the longest documentable win streak in worldwide professional road racing.&lt;ref name="Deepthrottle"&gt;{{cite news

==American collegiate sports==

=== NAIA Football ===
In 1966 Waynesburg College went 11–0 after a 9–0 regular season record.
In December 1966 Waynesburg defeated New Mexico Highlands in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the playoff game, 
and, defeated Whitewater Wisconsin in the NAIA Champion Bowl at Tulsa Oklahoma.
This was, and still is a college football rarity. 
Very few college football teams have won a College National Football Championship (including playoff games)
with an undefeated  record.

===NCAA Football===
{{Main|List of undefeated NCAA Division I football teams}}
Due to relatively short seasons through most of [[college football]] history, the [[List of undefeated NCAA Division I football teams|list of undefeated Division I football teams]] includes dozens of teams.&lt;ref name=Dolphin&gt;[http://www.dolphinsim.com/ratings/ Dolphin Historical Football Rankings] Retrieved December 7, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest level of college football, the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (introduced as Division I-A in 1978), did not use a playoff to determine a champion prior to the introduction of the four-team [[College Football Playoff]] (CFP) in [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]]. The system replaced by the CFP relied on a combination of polls and computer rankings to choose two teams to play one [[BCS National Championship Game|title game]] in a system known as the [[Bowl Championship Series]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcsfootball.org/ Home page of the Bowl Championship Series]

The record for most wins in an undefeated FBS season is 14–0, accomplished in 2002 by [[2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], twice in [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009]] by [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] and [[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], in [[2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2010]] by [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], and in [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013]] by [[2013 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]].

===NCAA Division I Basketball===

====Men====
Before the establishment of the [[National Invitation Tournament]] in 1938 and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] in 1939, perfect seasons were more common; each season consisted of fewer games and top teams from different parts of the country might never meet.

Eight teams have completed perfect seasons, including postseason tournament victories, since the tournament era began in 1938:
* [[LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds men's basketball|1939 LIU Blackbirds]] (24–0) — [[1939 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] champion, which at the time was more prestigious than the NCAA tournament
* [[1955–56 San Francisco Dons men's basketball team|1956 San Francisco Dons]] (29–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1956–57 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|1957 North Carolina Tar Heels]] (32–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1963–64 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1964 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1966–67 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1967 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1971–72 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1972 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1972–73 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|1973 UCLA Bruins]] (30–0) – NCAA champion
* [[1975–76 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1976 Indiana Hoosiers]] (32–0) – NCAA champion

In addition, four other teams in the tournament era had unbeaten records, but did not play in any postseason tournament:
* 1940 [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]] (19–0) — not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or NIT.
* 1944 [[Army Black Knights men's basketball|Army Cadets]] (15–0) — not invited to either the NCAA Tournament or NIT. (Given that this season was during World War II, it is also possible that Army chose to turn down tournament invitations.)
* [[1953–54 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|1954 Kentucky Wildcats]] (25–0) — declined a bid to the NCAA Tournament due to an NCAA ruling that graduate students could not compete.
* 1973 [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|NC State Wolfpack]] (27–0) — ineligible for postseason competition due to rule violations earlier that season.

The UCLA Bruins are the only team to have back-to-back perfect seasons (1971–1972, 1972–1973), and all four of the college’s perfect seasons were under Hall of Fame head coach [[John Wooden]].

The following teams completed a perfect regular season, but lost in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] or other postseason action:
*[[1939 National Invitation Tournament|1939]] [[Loyola Ramblers men's basketball|Loyola Ramblers]] (finished regular season 20–0 and lost in the NIT final to LIU to finish 21–1)

*[[1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team|1979 Indiana State Sycamores]] (finished regular season 29–0, but lost in the [[1979 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|championship game]] to [[1978–79 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]]. Finished 33–1.)

====Women====
In the women’s game, the following national championship teams have had perfect records since the [[AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament|AIAW]] began sponsoring a championship tournament in 1972 (which was followed by the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship|NCAA]] tournament in 1982):

===NCAA Ice Hockey===
Among schools in the top level of men’s ice hockey, the 1969–70 [[Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey|Cornell Big Red]] went 29–0–0 in the University Division (the predecessor to today’s Division I) en route to a national championship.

Since Cornell’s 29–0–0 season in 1969–70, the closest Division I Men’s Ice Hockey Team to having a perfect season was the 1992–93 [[Maine Black Bears men's ice hockey|Maine Black Bears]], who finished that year at 42–1–2, including a national title game victory against [[Lake Superior State Lakers men's ice hockey|Lake Superior State]]. Their only loss came on February 19, 1993, against [[Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey|Boston University]], where they lost 7-6 in overtime, and their only ties were on October 24 against [[Providence Friars men's ice hockey|Providence]], 3-3, and on January 15 against [[Clarkson Golden Knights men's ice hockey|Clarkson]], 4-4.

The last men’s team to finish unbeaten and untied and be national champions was the 1983–84 [[Bemidji State Beavers men's ice hockey|Bemidji State Beavers]] (31–0–0), who were then competing in [[NCAA Division II|Division II]], a level of competition that no longer conducts a championship.

The 1955–56 Clarkson Golden Knights were undefeated and untied (23–0–0), but skipped the NCAA tournament because as the team had seniors with four years of college play which was against NCAA tournament rules at the time (not regular season rules).

The 1967–68 [[Iona Gaels men's ice hockey|Iona Gaels]] went 16–0–0 in their inaugural season as an independent in Division III, but did not participate in a national championship as none existed for Division III at that time.

The most recent unbeaten and untied season in NCAA ice hockey at the highest level was in [[2012–13 Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey season|2012–13]] when [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|the Minnesota Golden Gophers]] became the first NCAA women’s team ever to accomplish the feat (41–0–0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/9094220/minnesota-golden-gophers-get-first-ever-perfect-season-ncaa-women-hockey-title |title=Gophers get first perfect season |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=March 24, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ACHA Hockey===
The 2007–08 [[University of Illinois]] [[Fighting Illini]], a club team, are the only [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] team to record a perfect season with a record of 38–0–0.

==Canadian collegiate sports==
=== U Sports Canadian Football ===
====1975 University of Ottawa Gee Gees====
In 1975 the number-one-ranked University of Ottawa Gee Gees had the first Canadian Interuniversity Sport (now U Sports) undefeated season. After completing their perfect regular season at 8–0, the Gees Gees won their first play-off defeating the number-two-ranked Toronto Varsity Blues 14–7. The Gees Gees then demolished the Windsor Lancers 45–6 to win the Yates Cup and the right to play for the national championship and the Vanier Cup. The undefeated season was completed on November 21, 1975, when the Gee Gees defeated the University of Calgary Dinos 14–9 at CNE Stadium in Toronto. That night the Gee Gees became the first undefeated team in CIS and Vanier Cup history. The 1975 Gees Gees roster had a big impact on the CFL. Gee Gee Players from the 1975 team played in the CFL for a cumulative total of 96 years and throughout their professional careers in the CFL accomplished: one Canadian Football Hall of Fame Inductee, one Grey Cup Canadian MVP,  two Frank M. Gibson Trophies for Outstanding Rookie Eastern Division, two CFL Leo Dandurand Trophy Outstanding Lineman Eastern Division, twenty CFL and Divisional All-Star Selections, twenty-three Grey Cup Appearances and a total of twelve Grey Cup rings.

==== 2003, 2005 Saskatchewan Huskies ====
In 2003 and 2005, the [[Saskatchewan Huskies football|Saskatchewan Huskies]] completed perfect regular seasons. However, in both years they lost in the playoffs: in the [[Vanier Cup]] to the [[Laurier Golden Hawks]] in 2005, and in the Canada West semi-final to [[Alberta Golden Bears football|Alberta Golden Bears]] in 2003.

==== 2007 Manitoba Bisons ====
A perfect season was attained in 2007 by the [[Manitoba Bisons football|Manitoba Bisons]], the football squad representing the [[University of Manitoba]], located in [[Winnipeg]]. The Bisons were undefeated in [[Canada West Universities Athletic Association]] play during the 8-game schedule.  In the playoffs, Manitoba comfortably handled the [[Calgary Dinos]] 27–5 in the opening round.  The Bisons followed up with a 48–5 defeat of the [[Regina Rams]] in the [[Hardy Trophy]] and a strong 52–20 showing against the perennial contenders from the [[University of Western Ontario]], the [[Western Ontario Mustangs]], in the [[Mitchell Bowl]].  On Friday, November 23, 2007, two days before the 95th Grey Cup game in [[Toronto]], the Bisons defeated the [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's University]] squad, known as the [[Saint Mary's Huskies]], 28–14 to claim their first [[Vanier Cup]] championship since 1970, and third overall title.

==Australian rules football==
===Australian Football League (AFL)/Victorian Football League (VFL) ===
The [[Australian Football League|VFL]] began in 1897. Based entirely in the state of Victoria, before it expanded through the 1980s, and 1990s to become the top level national league (AFL) in the sport of Australian rules football. The length of a complete season (including finals matches) has typically been between 18 and 26 games. Throughout the history of the league, no team has ever completed a perfect season. One team, {{AFL Col}} in [[1929 VFL season|1929]], completed a perfect home-and-away season, finishing with a record of 18–0; the club won the premiership, but did not complete a perfect season after losing the [[Second amended Argus system|second semi-final]] against {{AFL Ric}}.

===South Australian National Football League (SANFL)===
{{main|1914 Port Adelaide Football Club season}}
The SANFL has existed since 1877 within South Australia, and until the latter part of the twentieth century was of equivalent standard to the VFL. The only perfect season to be completed was by the 1914 [[Port Adelaide Magpies|Port Adelaide]] team, known as the "Invincibles". Port won all four of its pre season matches. It finished the minor round with a 12–0 record, before winning both finals to finish with a 14–0 record and a perfect season. They also won the Championship of Australia against VFL premiers [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], to extend that record to 15–0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/stats/Port+Adelaide+Magpies/318/1914|first=John|last=Devaney|publisher=Australian Football|title=Port Adelaide Magpies 1914 results|accessdate=28 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this the club played a combined team from all the other SAFL clubs and won to extend the record to 16–0. The closest any team got to Port Adelaide was [[North Adelaide Football Club|North Adelaide]], losing by 21 points in Round 10. This is the only instance in [[The Big Three (Australian football)|The Big Three]] Australian football leagues (VFL/SANFL/WAFL) where a club has gone undefeated in the pre-season, season main and post season.

In 1912, Port Adelaide had a perfect minor round and then beat [[West Torrens Football Club|West Torrens]] in its semi-final but lost both the final and Grand Final to [[West Adelaide Football Club|West Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/stats/Port+Adelaide+Magpies/318/1912|first=John|last=Devaney|publisher=Australian Football|title=Port Adelaide Magpies 1912 results|accessdate=28 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Australian Football League (WAFL)===
The [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] has existed since 1885 within Western Australia, and until the latter part of the 20th century was of equivalent standard to either the VFL or SANFL. The [[1946 WANFL season|1946]] [[East Fremantle Football Club|East Fremantle]] team was the first club in senior WAFL football{{efn| In the [[1944 WANFL season|1944 under-19 wartime competition]] that replaced the senior competition between [[1942 WANFL season|1942]] and that season due to the player drain of World War II, [[East Perth Football Club|East Perth]] managed a perfect season, winning all nineteen home-and-away games plus two finals.}} to have managed a perfect season or even a perfect home-and-away season, winning all twenty-one of its games; it is noted that the playing lists of many of its opponents had been seriously depleted by World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Devaney, John; ''Full Points Footy's WA Football Companion''; pp. 69-70. {{ISBN|9780955689710}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only loss for the season came against Collingwood in a post season match. The [[2018 WAFL season|2018]] [[Subiaco Football Club|Subiaco]] team won all of it's 18 games in the minor round before winning both their second-semi-final against [[South Fremantle Football Club|South Fremantle]] and the Grand Final against [[West Perth Football Club|West Perth.]]

===Victorian Football Association (VFA/VFL)===
The Victorian Football League, known until 1996 as the Victorian Football Association, began in 1877 and was Victoria's premier football league until 1897, and has been the second-tier league in the state since. Perfect seasons have been completed on four occasions in VFA/VFL history:
#by [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] during a war-shortened [[1915 VFA season|1915]], with a record of 15–0
#by North Melbourne in [[1918 VFA season|1918]], which was also shortened by the war, with a record of 12–0;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianfootball.com/clubs/bio/North+Melbourne/13 |title=North Melbourne Football Club |publisher=Australianfootball.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also cases of teams going undefeated through the season in the nineteenth century, but none completed perfect seasons because some of their matches were drawn. Of those, {{AFL Gee}} could be interpreted as having been perfect in [[1879 VFA season|1879]]; it had a record of 15–0–1, and the draw came by agreement when a match was abandoned due to inclement weather.&lt;ref name="review1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|date=18 October 1879|title=The Football Season of 1879 – Part 1|author=Peter Pindar|publication-place=Melbourne|page=493|issue=707|volume=XXVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four other teams have completed perfect home-and-away seasons, but subsequently lost finals matches:&lt;ref&gt;Fiddian, Marc; ''The VFA: a history of the Victoria Football Association 1877–1995''; pp. 226-299. Published 2004 by On-Demand Pty Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Williamstown in [[1957 VFA season|1957]] won all twenty home-and-away games before losing to [[Moorabbin Football Club|Moorabbin]] in the second semi final, and being eliminated by Port Melbourne in the preliminary final.

==Rugby league==
===National Rugby League===
The [[National Rugby League]] has existed since 1908, being originally known as the New South Wales Rugby League and before the [[Super League]] war of 1995 as the Australian Rugby League. In its history, only one team has completed a perfect season: the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] in [[1925 NSWRFL season|1925]], who won all twelve games contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season 1925|publisher=Rugby League Tables|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1925.html|accessdate=3 Jun 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417012749/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1925.html|archivedate=2011-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brisbane Rugby League===
The [[Brisbane Rugby League premiership]] began in 1909 and continued in varying forms until 1996, after which it was superseded by the [[Queensland Cup]]. Between the 1930s and the 1960s it was of comparable standard to the New South Wales Rugby Football League, but subsequently a huge drain of players to Sydney eroded the standard of play. Before [[World War II]] seasons were typically no more than twelve games long; however as the competition grew it was expanded to 21 games by 1960. The only BRL teams to manage a perfect season were:

===British Rugby League===
Whilst no rugby league team in Britain has completed the perfect season in the top flight, this has been achieved on two occasions in lower divisions, once in the 2nd division and once in the 3rd. [[Hull F.C.]] achieved this feat in the [[1978–79 Northern Rugby Football League season|1978–79 Season]], where they won 26 from 26 games, gaining promotion to the top division for the second time in three seasons. This was also achieved by the [[Dewsbury Rams]] in [[2009 Championship 1|2009]] during their [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship 1]] (third division) season where they won all 18 games from a possible 18, winning promotion immediately after being relegated the previous season where they won just two games. Since their 2009 promotion, the Rams have so far stayed in the sports' second division, including two play off finishes.

In [[2017 League 1|2017]], the [[Toronto Wolfpack]] completed the regular reason with a perfect 15–0 record, however after the [[2017 League 1 results#Super 8s|Super 8s]] finished with a 22-1-1 record.

==Rugby union==

===International Rugby===
The [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand All Blacks]] were the first professional rugby team to produce a perfect rugby test season in 2013. They successfully defeated {{nrut|France}} four times, {{nrut|Australia}} three times, {{nrut|South Africa}} and {{nrut|Argentina}} twice and also beat {{nrut|Japan}}, {{nrut|England}} and {{nrut|Ireland}} in their incredible winning run. They produced a record of 14–0–0, defeating the top 5 ranked teams below them in the IRB world rankings. {{nrut|England}} have matched this feat after producing a perfect test season in 2016 after recovering from getting knocked out of their own [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] in [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]].

===Super Rugby===
The Southern Hemisphere's principal team competition, [[Super Rugby]], established as Super 12 in 1996 and later known as Super 14 before adopting its current name in 2011, has seen only one perfect season. The [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]], based in [[Christchurch]] and representing a large portion of the [[South Island]] of New Zealand, finished the [[2002 Super 12 season]] with an 11–0–0 record and went on to win both of their finals matches to claim the season crown unbeaten.

One other team has won a championship unbeaten: in [[1997 Super 12 season|1997]], the [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Auckland Blues]] (known simply as "Blues" since 2000), which at the time represented the central and southern parts of the [[Auckland]] area plus some adjacent regions to the south, finished the regular season with one draw from 11 matches. They also won both of their finals matches to claim the title.

==Association football==

===Domestic teams===
Many [[association football]] teams have also had perfect seasons, however doing so in a season of 20 or more matches is very rare. Clubs to have achieved this include: [[Dresdner SC]] of Germany in 1942–43 (23 wins out of 23), [[Ferencvárosi TC|Ferencvárosi]] of Hungary in 1931–32 (22), [[Sunrise Flacq United]] of [[Mauritius]] in 1995–96 (22), and [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] of [[Uruguay]] in 1941 (20).&lt;ref name="rsssf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/unbeaten.html |title=Unbeaten |publisher=Rsssf.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ahly]] (of Egypt) hold the record of going a whole season being unbeaten, in all possible competitions they were involved in (46 matches in total played in: Egyptian Premier League, Egyptian Cup, Egyptian Super Cup and CAF Champions League between 2005 and 2006). The longest winning streak of any team over multiple seasons was [[Sparta Prague]]'s run of at least 51 wins in a row, between 1920 and 1923.&lt;ref name="rsssf"/&gt;

Teams finishing a season unbeaten (i.e. having won or drawn every match) are more common. [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[2003–04 FA Premier League|2003–04 English Premier League season]], finished with no losses from 38 games over 100 years after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] unbeaten streak in 22 league games and all of its FA Cup games in [[1888–89 in English football|1888–89]]. At the same time, AFC Wimbledon finished with a [[2003–04 AFC Wimbledon season|record]] of 42 wins, 4 draws and 0 defeats out of 46 games in their [[Combined Counties League Premier Division]] season. In Belgium, From 1933 to 1935  [[Royale Union Saint-Gilloise]]  played 60 consecutive matches undefeated, setting a still unbeaten record in Belgium. In Italy, [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] ([[1978–79 Serie A|1978–79]]), [[A.C. Milan]] ([[1991–92 Serie A|1991–92]]), and [[Juventus F.C.]] ([[2011–12 Serie A|2011–12]]) have been undefeated. In Turkish soccer, [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in the [[1985–86 1.Lig|1985–86]] season completed the season unbeaten but finished as runners-up, although having the same points as [[Beşiktaş J.K.]], who won, but had an inferior goal difference to their rival. [[Beşiktaş J.K.]] in [[1991–92 1.Lig|1991–92]] completed the season unbeaten and became Turkish League's only ever champions without defeat. In Portugal, [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] ([[1972–73 Primeira Liga|1972–73]]) was the first club to do so and won 28 matches – 23 consecutively – out of 30, and drew two. They also went undefeated in [[1977–78 Primeira Liga|1977–78]] but finished second to [[F.C. Porto|Porto]], who lost once that season. Porto finished the [[2010–11 Primeira Liga|2010–11]] and [[2012–13 Primeira Liga|2012–13]] seasons unbeaten, with a respective win–draw record of 27–3 and 24–6. In Saudi Arabia, [[Al-Hilal FC]] finished a 26-game season in the [[2010–11 Saudi Professional League|2010–11]] with 19 wins and 7 draws, whilst in [[Iraq]], [[Al-Shorta FC]] went the entire [[1980–81 Iraqi League]] season undefeated. Greek club [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] finished the [[1963–64 Alpha Ethniki|1963–64 season]], Hungarian club [[Debreceni VSC]] finished the [[2011–12 Nemzeti Bajnokság I|2011–12 season]], Norwegian club [[Rosenborg BK]] finished the [[2010 Norwegian Premier League|2010 season]] undefeated. The only unbeaten champion in [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazil]] was [[Sport Club Internacional|SC Internacional]], who won the [[1979 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|1979 season]] with 16 victories and 7 ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colunas.globoesporte.com/memoriaec/2008/12/23/inter-79-unico-campeao-brasileiro-invicto/|title=Internacional 1979: único campeão brasileiro invicto|language=Portuguese|publisher=[[Rede Globo|Globo Esporte]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] finished the [[1993–94 Maccabi Haifa F.C. season|1993–1994]] season (a 39-game season) in the Israeli Premier League with 28 wins and 11 draws.

[[Egyptian Premier League]] giants [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]] are the only African club to have ever completed an entire domestic season unbeaten, let alone twice, having won their 30th league title in the [[2004–05 Egyptian Premier League|2004–05 season]] with a record of 24 wins and 2 draws and their 31st league title the [[2005–06 Egyptian Premier League|following season]] with a slightly worse record of 23 wins and 3 draws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahly surrender unbeaten record in Egypt |url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/109/374/index.html |agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, [[2014 Úrvalsdeild|2014]] eventual Icelandic champions [[Stjarnan men's football|Stjarnan]] who were unbeaten faced an [[FH Hafnarfjördur|FH]] side in an away game which was the last game of the season, coincidentally before the match, FH were also unbeaten. In a closely fought match Stjarnan emerged victorious courtesy of a 94th-minute penalty from [[Ólafur Karl Finsen]] to knock FH out of first place and secure Stjarnan's first Icelandic championship.

[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] went domestically unbeaten across the [[2016–17 Celtic F.C. season|2016–17 season]] over all 38 league games in [[Football in Scotland|Scotland]], finishing 30 points clear of second-place [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] with 34 wins and 4 draws. Celtic also won the [[2016–17 Scottish League Cup]] and the [[2016–17 Scottish Cup]], giving them the accolade of being the only club to win a domestic treble unbeaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Forsyth|first=Roddy|title=Brendan Rodgers salutes Celtic's 'Invincibles' after they dig deep against Hearts|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/21/brendan-rodgers-salutes-celtics-invincibles-dig-deep-against/|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pattullo|first=Alan|title=Gordon Strachan: Celtic "invincibles" will boost Scotland|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/gordon-strachan-celtic-invincibles-will-boost-scotland-1-4453829|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIFA World Cup===

The likelihood of a national team in the [[FIFA World Cup]] to win all of its matches in regulation time to become the champion is much higher than most clubs in their domestic league, as the finals tournament in its current format only lasts seven games — although this feat has only happened twice, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on both instances in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. This is not counting the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying round]] of the tournament, which lasts over a year and has had a varied format since [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]]. Only the Brazilian team of 1970 has won every game in the qualification and final rounds of a single tournament, a total of 13 games.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/results/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/preliminaries/preliminary=28/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] came very close achieving the same feat as Brazil did in 1970. The Netherlands won 8 out of 8 qualifying games and went on to win the next 6 [[FIFA World Cup 2010|World Cup]] matches in regulation time only to lose in [[overtime (sports)|extra time]] to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the final, ending with a 14–0–1 record.

===FIFA Women's World Cup===
Through [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011]], the likelihood of a national team winning all of its matches in the [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] was slightly greater than in the men's version. The Women's World Cup began in [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]] with 12 teams and expanded to 16 effective in [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999]]. Under both structures, the winning team only had to win six games (three in group play and three in the knockout stage) to win the title unbeaten. The tournament expanded to 24 teams in [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup|2015]], at which time the number of games that the champion must play increased to seven (the same total as in the men's World Cup).

The 2011 event, won by [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]], was the first in which the champion lost in group play; the other finalist, the [[United States women's national soccer team|USA]], had also lost in group play. Each previous team to have won the title — the USA in 1991 and 1999, [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] in [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup|1995]], and [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]] in [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003]] and [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007]] — won all of its group stage matches. In fact, only one of these teams, the USA in 1999, had a knockout match go to extra time—specifically the final against [[China women's national football team|China]], which ultimately went to a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Germany won all of its matches in the 2007 final tournament without giving up a goal, becoming the first team in either the men's or women's World Cup to accomplish this feat. The USA's third championship team in 2015 had one draw in the group stage.

Three Women's World Cup champions also went through their qualifying stage without a loss or draw:
* USA, 1991 ([[1991 CONCACAF Women's Championship|5 wins]])
* Germany, 2003 ([[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|6 wins]])
* Germany, 2007 ([[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|8 wins]])

Of the other two teams to win the Women's World Cup without a loss or draw in the finals:
* Norway went through their 1995 qualification campaign with 8 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss.
* The USA automatically qualified for the 1999 edition as host.

==Handball==
===Germany===
In 2011/2012, German handball champion [[THW Kiel]] achieved a perfect season of as many as 34 matches. Additionally, the team also won the national DHB Cup and the international [[EHF Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyota-handball-bundesliga.de/handball/tabelle.php?liga=1&amp;menuid=215&amp;topmenu=214 Toyota Handball Bundesliga - final table] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609080844/http://www.toyota-handball-bundesliga.de/handball/tabelle.php?liga=1&amp;menuid=215&amp;topmenu=214 |date=June 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
In the [[Liga ASOBAL]] the [[FC Barcelona Handbol]] had 4 consecutive perfect seasons from the [[Liga ASOBAL 2013–14|2013-14]] season to the [[Liga ASOBAL 2016–17|2016-17]] season.

===Croatia===
In the [[Premijer liga]] the [[RK Zagreb]] is unbeaten for 11 years, they won 190 consecutive games, last time they lost against [[Osijek Motormodul]] (38:39) on 14.4.2007. In that 190 games they just have one tie with [[RK Poreč]] (31:31), after that game they won 178 games in a row and that row is still active.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080812031321/http://sport.hrt.hr:80/htvsport/rukomet/06_07/m_IIdio.html]

==Netball==

===Commonwealth Bank Trophy===
The Commonwealth Bank Trophy was the main national netball competition in Australia from 1997 to 2007. There were eight teams in a double round robin format and finals.

The Sydney Swifts were the only team to achieve a perfect season, winning all fourteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 16–0.

===ANZ Championship===
The ANZ Championship, the principal netball competition for Australia and New Zealand was established in 2008 to replace the Commonwealth Bank Trophy. Comprising ten teams (five from Australia and five from New Zealand) there has so far been one perfect season, by the Mission Queensland Firebirds, based in [[Brisbane, Queensland]] in 2011. The Firebirds won thirteen regular season games and both their finals matches for a record of 15–0. In 2010, the New South Wales Swifts managed to win all thirteen regular season games, but lost both of their finals matches and ended with a 13–2 for that year.

==Cricket==
===County cricket===
English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[county cricket]] has existed as the top tier of domestic cricket in England since the middle nineteenth century, and until the 1950s it was up to the highest standard of the game. Seasons have varied in length: before the 1880s, they were generally less than ten matches in length and some "first-class" counties played only against one or two different opponents, so that a team winning all its games was not implausible. Between [[1887 English cricket season|1887]] and [[1929 English cricket season|1929]], seasons were gradually increased in length to a standard twenty-eight matches for all counties. However, because of the development and popularity of one-day cricket, seasons have been reduced to twenty-four games in [[1969 English cricket season|1969]] and twenty in [[1972 English cricket season|1972]], though this was increased by two in [[1977 English cricket season|1977]] and [[1983 English cricket season|1983]]. With an increase to four days for all games, sixteen or seventeen games have been played since [[1993 English cricket season|1993]].

Also, because of improvements to pitches via the [[heavy roller]] and covering to protect from rain, the proportion of games "drawn" (not finished) has steadily risen since the 1870s.

Since tables of results have been kept in [[1864 English cricket season|1864]],&lt;ref name="rigby"&gt;Wynne-Thomas, Peter; ''The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records''; pp. 53 to 67. {{ISBN|072701868X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only team to have competed a true perfect season – winning outright every game – was [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] in [[1867 English cricket season|1867]] when led by [[George Freeman (cricketer)|George Freeman's]] and [[Tom Emmett]]'s deadly fast bowling on uncovered and unrolled pitches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1867_f_Bowling_by_Average.html |title=First-Class bowling for Yorkshire in 1867 |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; they won all seven county games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/1867_f.html |title=Yorkshire 1867 season summary |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essex CCC achieved the feat in the Summer of 2017, with the bowling combination of Simon Harmer and Jamie Porter doing most of the damage. Ryan Ten Doeschate captained the side,

Since 1868 numerous county teams in longer schedules have finished a season unbeaten,&lt;ref name="rigby"/&gt; but none have managed to win every single game outright:

'''Ping-pong diplomacy''' ({{zh|乒乓外交}} ''Pīngpāng wàijiāo'') refers to the exchange of [[table tennis]] (ping-pong) players between the [[United States]] and [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in the early 1970s. The event marked a thaw in [[China–United States relations|Sino-American relations]] that paved the way to a [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to Beijing by President Richard Nixon]].

== History ==
=== Background ===
The United States viewed the People's Republic of China as an aggressor nation and enforced an economic containment policy including an embargo on the PRC, following its entry into the [[Korean War]] in 1950. After approximately 20 years of neither diplomatic nor economic relations, both countries finally saw an advantage in opening up to each other: China viewed closer relations with the United States as a beneficial counter to its increasingly tense relationship with the Soviet Union, while the U.S. sought closer relations with China as leverage in its peace negotiations with North Vietnam.

"[T]he thirty-first World Table Tennis Championships, held in Nagoya, Japan, provided an opportunity for both China and the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution|last=Jiaqi|first=Yan|last2=Gao|first2=Gao|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8248-1695-7|pages=433|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===
The U.S. Table Tennis team was in [[Nagoya, Japan]] in 1971 for the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships|31st World Table Tennis Championships]] on April 6 when they received an invitation to visit China. From the early years of the People's Republic, sports had played an important role in diplomacy, often incorporating the slogan "Friendship First, Competition Second". During the isolationist years, athletes were among the few PRC nationals who were allowed to travel overseas.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} On April 10, 1971, the team and accompanying journalists became the first American delegation to set foot in the Chinese capital since 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was facilitated by the [[National Committee on United States – China Relations]]. Prior to the visit by the American table tennis players, eleven Americans were admitted into the PRC for one week because they all professed affiliation with the [[Black Panther Party]] which followed a [[Maoist]] political line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/workers/black-panthers/|title=History of the Black Panther Party|last=Baggins|first=Brian|date=2002|website=marxists.org|access-date=May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was unusual, given that high-profile American citizens such as Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] expressed interest in visiting China after the 1968 presidential election, but even he could not have a trip arranged for him despite his office.

According to ''History of U.S. Table Tennis'' by [[Tim Boggan]], who went to China along with the U.S. Table Tennis Team, three incidents may have triggered their invitation from China. [[Wales|Welshman]] [[H. Roy Evans]], then President of the [[International Table Tennis Federation]], claimed that he visited China prior to the 31st World Table Tennis Championship and suggested to non-Chinese sports authorities and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] that China should take steps to get in contact with the world through international sport events after the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Furthermore, the American player [[Leah Neuberger|Leah "Miss Ping" Neuberger]], the 1956 World Mixed Doubles Champion and nine-time U.S. Open Women's Singles Champion, was traveling at the time with the Canadian Table Tennis Team that had been invited by China to visit the country. China diplomatically extended its approval of Leah Neuberger's application for a visa to the entire American team. The third incident, perhaps the most likely trigger, was the unexpected but dramatic meeting between the flamboyant American player [[Glenn Cowan]] and the Chinese player [[Zhuang Zedong]], a three-time world champion and winner of many other table tennis events. Zhuang Zedong described the incident&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The events leading up to the encounter began when Glenn Cowan missed his team bus one afternoon after his practice in [[Nagoya]] during the 31st World Table Tennis Championship. Cowan had been practicing for 15 minutes with the Chinese player, [[Liang Geliang]], when a Japanese official came and wanted to close the training area. As Cowan looked in vain for his team bus, a Chinese player{{who|date=May 2014}} waved to him to get on his Chinese team bus. Moments after his casual talking through an interpreter to the Chinese players{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, Zhuang Zedong came up from his back seat to greet him and presented him with a silk-screen portrait of [[Huangshan Mountains]], a famous product from Hangzhou. Cowan wanted to give something back, but all he could find from his bag was a comb. The American hesitantly replied, "I can't give you a comb. I wish I could give you something, but I can't." This World Table Tennis Championships marked the return of China's participation after a six-year absence. When the Chinese team and Cowan walked off the bus, journalists who were following the Chinese team took photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamusa.org/News/2008/June/12/From-Ping-Pong-Diplomacy-to-the-Beijing-Games|title=From Ping Pong Diplomacy to the Beijing Games|publisher=Team USA|date=Jun 12, 2008|accessdate=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the political climate of the 1960s, the sight of an athlete of Communist China with an athlete of the United States was sure to garner attention. Glenn Cowan later bought a T-shirt with a red, white and blue [[peace symbol|peace emblem]] flag and the words "[[Let It Be]]," which he presented to Zhuang Zedong at another chance meeting.

When a journalist asked Cowan, "Mr. Cowan, would you like to visit China?", he answered, "Well, I'd like to see any country I haven't seen before--Argentina, Australia, China, ... Any country I haven't seen before." "But what about China in particular? Would you like to go there?" "Of course," said Glenn Cowan.

During an interview in 2002 with the famous TV personality [[Chen Luyu]], [[Zhuang Zedong]] told more of the story: "The trip on the bus took 15 minutes, and I hesitated for 10 minutes. I grew up with the slogan 'Down with the American imperialism!' And during the [[Cultural Revolution]], the string of class struggle was tightened unprecedentedly, and I was asking myself, 'Is it okay to have anything to do with your No. 1 enemy?'" Zhuang recalled remembering that Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] met [[Edgar Snow]] on the Rostrum of [[Tiananmen]] on the [[National Day]] in 1970 and said to Snow that China should now place its hope on American people.
Zhuang looked in his bag and first went through some pins, [[Chairman Mao badge|badges with Mao's head]], silk handkerchiefs, and fans. But he felt these were not decent enough to be a good gift. He finally picked the silk portrait of Huangshan Mountains. On the following day, many Japanese newspapers carried photographs of Zhuang Zedong and Glenn Cowan.

When the Chinese Department of Foreign Affairs received a report that the U.S. Table Tennis Team hoped to get invited to visit China, the Department declined as usual. [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Mao Zedong]] initially agreed with the decision, but when [[Mao Zedong]] saw the news in ''[[Dacankao]]'', a newspaper accessible only to high-ranking government officials, he decided to invite the U.S. Table Tennis Team. It was reported that Mao Zedong said, "This Zhuang Zedong not only plays table tennis well, but is good at foreign affairs, and he has a mind for politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1971, nine American players, four officials, and two spouses stepped across a bridge from [[Hong Kong]] to the Chinese mainland and then spent their time during April 11–17 playing fun matches, touring the [[Great Wall]] and [[Summer Palace]], and watching a [[ballet]].

===Legacy===
*During the week of July 8, 1971, a three-day ping-pong diplomacy event was held at the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum]] in Yorba Linda, California. Original members of both the Chinese and American ping-pong teams from 1971 were present and competed again.
*In 1988, table tennis became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport.
*Ping-pong diplomacy was referenced in the 1994 film ''[[Forrest Gump]]''. After suffering injuries in battle, Forrest develops an aptitude for the sport and joins the U.S. Army team—eventually competing against Chinese teams on a goodwill tour.

==Reactions==
Upon his return to the United States, one of the American players told reporters that the Chinese were very similar to people in the U.S. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The people are just like us. They are real, they're genuine, they got feeling. I made friends, I made genuine friends, you see. The country is similar to America, but still very different. It's beautiful. They got the Great Wall, they got plains over there. They got an ancient palace, the parks, there's streams, and they got ghosts that haunt; there's all kinds of, you know, animals. The country changes from the south to the north. The people, they have a, a unity. They really believe in their Maoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Nixon's visit==
[[File:Nixon at an athletic exhibition in Peking - NARA - 194757.tif|thumb|right|250px|Nixon attending a ping-pong exhibition in Beijing.]]
{{Main|1972 Nixon visit to China}}
Two months after Richard Nixon's visit, [[Zhuang Zedong]] visited the U.S. as the head of a Chinese table-tennis delegation, April 12–30, 1972. Also on the itinerary were [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]. However, China's attempts to reach out to countries through "ping-pong diplomacy" were not always successful, such as when the All Indonesia Table Tennis Association (PTMSI) refused China's invitation in October 1971, claiming that accepting the PRC's offer would improve the PRC's reputation. Because neither [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] athletes nor journalists appeared in China following the appearance of the American players and journalists, one speculation is that the act showed the equal scorn of both countries towards the USSR.

== Result ==
Ping-pong diplomacy was successful and resulted in opening the U.S.-PRC relationship, leading the U.S. to lift the embargo against China on June 10, 1971. On February 28, 1972, during President Nixon and Henry Kissinger's visit to Shanghai, the [[Shanghai Communiqué|Shanghai Communique]] was issued between the U.S. and the PRC. The Communique noted that both nations would work towards the normalization of their relations. Furthermore, the U.S. recognized that Taiwan is a part of China and agreed not to interfere in issues between China and Taiwan.

== 1991 united Korean Team ==
Another example of Ping Pong Diplomacy occurred during the [[World Table Tennis Championships|1991 World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba]], Japan, where a unified Korean team played together for the first time since the Korean War.

The diplomatic efforts leading to the formation of this unified team were led by then-[[International Table Tennis Federation|International Table Tennis Federation President]], [[Ichiro Ogimura]].

Prior to the championships, Ogimura visited [[South Korea]] 20 times and traveled to [[North Korea]] 15 times to plead for a unified team from the [[Korean Peninsula|Korean peninsula]]. Ogimura also worked with local Japanese government heads to create joint training camps in the cities of Nagano, Nagaoka and Chiba, and secured agreement from the [[ITTF]] for North Korea and South Korea to compete under the unified name of “Korea”.

The Korean team played under a white flag depicting the Korean peninsula in blue and used the Korean [[Folk music|folksong]], [[Arirang]], rather than the national anthem of either the North or the South.

The competition saw the Korean team win one gold medal, one silver and two bronze medals.

This action has since been repeated. At the 2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships, the two Koreas entered separate teams in the competition but, when they were paired against each other at the quarter-final of the women's event, they negotiated instead to field a joint team for the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/column/g00550/|title=Table Tennis Diplomacy that Brought the Koreas Together|date=2018-06-12|work=nippon.com|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''play-in game'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22542306/zach-lowe-real-possibility-nba-playoffs-play-tournament (Feb 22, 2018) Retrieved Oct 10, 2018, from http://www.espn.com&lt;/ref&gt;'' is a game at the beginning of a tournament that forces the lowest qualifiers for the tournament to play each other before the main portion of the tournament begins. This gives an added advantage to the higher qualifiers, allowing them to rest, while the lower teams extend themselves by playing. Further, teams that participate in the play-in must usually play the next game against the highest qualifier in the tournament and play on the road. Having a play-in game allows for a tournament to have a number of teams that is not a [[power of two]], and gives an extra advantage for teams to play for, as they try to win to avoid having to play in the extra game.

'''Podiuming''' is a [[slang]] term for the action of finishing a contest within the first three places. It is often used during sporting event television broadcasting, especially [[Olympic Games]] coverage. The term is commonly heard at [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] events, bicycling races, [[marathons]] and other large-entrant number events. It is also commonly found on various social media posts by users of all backgrounds.

==Controversy==
Podiuming is not an officially recognized word in the [[English language]]. Many people do not even recognize the term as slang, but the words of ignorance. Even the use of the word [[podium]] as a verb instead of noun is controversial. The New York Times &lt;ref&gt;"Zimmer, Ben" [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/magazine/07FOB-onlanguage-t.html?_r=0], "The New York Times", Feb. 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; wrote on the very subject of the correct use of the word podium during its Winter Olympic coverage in 2010.

It should be noted that newspapers and magazines are not above using the term to develop headlines or other "hooks" in writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/157327629?versionId=171504296 "National Library of Australia"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Letter to the editor" [http://valleyreporter.powershifthosting.com/index.php/en/news/letters/7391], "The Valley Reporter", Sept. 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sport]], '''racing''' is a [[competition]] of [[speed]], against an objective criterion, usually a [[clock]] or to a specific point. The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of [[time]]. Typically this involves [[:wikt:traverse|traversing]] some [[distance]], but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal.

A race may be run continuously  to finish or may be made of several segments called heats, [[Race stage|stage]]s or legs. A heat is usually run over the same course at different times. A stage is a shorter section of a much longer course or a [[Individual time trial|time trial]].

Early records of races are evident on [[pottery]] from [[ancient Greece]], which depicted running men vying for first place. A [[chariot racing|chariot race]] is described in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''.

==Etymology==
The word ''race'' comes from a [[Old Norse|Norse]] word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=race|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Norse word arrived in [[France]] during the invading of [[Normandy]] and gave the word ''raz'' which means "swift water" in [[Brittany]], as in a [[mill race]]; it can be found in "[[Pointe du Raz]]" (the most western point of France, in Brittany), and "''raz-de-marée''" ([[tsunami]]). The word race to mean a "contest of speed" was first recorded in the 1510s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=race&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Race|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A race and its name are often associated with the place of origin, the means of transport and the distance of the race. As a couple of examples, see the [[Dakar Rally]] or the [[Athens Marathon]].

==Forms==
{{Further information|List of forms of racing}}

[[Running]] a distance is the most basic form of racing, but races may be conducted in [[vehicle]]s, such as [[Boat racing|boats]], [[Auto racing|car]]s, [[Bicycle racing|cycles]] and [[Air racing|aircraft]]; or with [[animal]]s such as [[Horse racing|horses]] or [[Dog racing|dogs]]. Races may also be conducted with other modes of transport such as [[ski racing (disambiguation)|skis]], [[kicksled]], [[Speed skating|skates]] or [[Wheelchair racing|wheelchair]]; or other forms of movement such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] or [[Racewalking|walking]]. In a [[relay race]] members of a [[team]] take turns in racing parts of a circuit or performing a certain racing form.

[[Orienteering|Orienteering races]] add an additional task of using a map and [[compass]] to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain.

A race can also involve any other type of goal like [[eating]]. A common race involving eating is a [[hot dog]] eating race, where contestants try to eat more hot dogs than the other racers.

Racing can also be done in more humoristic and entertaining ways such as the [[Sausage Race]], the [[Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix]] and [[wok racing]]. Racing can be entertained from around the world.

{{clarify|date=December 2016}}

== Swimming ==
One form of racing is through [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]. There are numerous ways to perform a good swim stroke:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.swimoutlet.com/guides/swimming-rules-regulations|title=Swimming Rules &amp; Regulations|website=SwimOutlet.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; breaststroke, freestyle, butterfly and backstroke. In the racing form of swimming there are many rules that one must follow to perform fairly in a competition. 

Freestyle-  In freestyle the racers start off on a block start and can perform either an open turn (When the swimmer just turns in the other direction in the water on the same plane) or a flip turn (when a swimmer flips over underwater and pushes off the wall with their feet. While they do a flip turn they can only touch the wall with their feet, and at the finish with only one hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Breaststroke- For breaststroke, all limbs must move in a similar motion at the same time, remaining underwater most of the race with the racers heads bobbing up and down for air. For every arm stroke they are only allowed one leg kick.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Butterfly- Butterfly racing begins with a forward dive and after each lap, the racer must touch the wall with both hands at the same time. After the turn they must do dolphin kicks and allow their head to break the surface of the water within the first 15 meters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Backstroke-  Backstroking in a race is often thought of an upside-down freestyle. These races start with the swimmers already in the water and they must maintain being on their back throughout the duration of the race. If they move their shoulders more than 90 degrees they will become disqualified from the race. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Automobile Racing ==
There are many different types of racing in the automotive field such as [[NASCAR]], [[FIA World Endurance Championship|endurance racing]], [[drag racing]], and [[Formula One]]. While these all are races, the specific rules, regulations, and themes are unique to each series.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nascar.com/news-media/2018/02/01/2018-nascar-rules-updates/.|title=2018 rules updates: 'Stabilization mode' entering new season {{!}} NASCAR.com|date=2018-02-01|work=Official Site Of NASCAR|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

--'''NASCAR''' is possibly the most recognizable form of racing, especially in the [[United States]]. The cars used are generally analogue and have little [[downforce]]. The race tracks take the general form of an oval such as the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] and are raced counter-clockwise such that every turn is leftwards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

--'''Formula One''' is a series of open-wheel [[formula car]]s. [[Formula 1 car]]s are the fastest regulated cars to drive [[race track]]s due to the very high amount of downforce and [[Traction (engineering)|mechanical grip]].

--'''Drag racing''' is a highly variable form of racing in which two cars or motorcycles attempt to cross a set finish line before the other. The most common form is the quarter-mile race. It can be done in anything from an everyday commuter to a [[Top Fuel]] dragster capable of accelerating to 300 mph in as little as 4.5 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davis, Jr. |first1=David |title=Unimaginable Acceleration |url=https://www.automobilemag.com/news/top-fuel-dragsters/ |website=Automobile |publisher=Motor Trend Group, LLC |accessdate=4 November 2018 |language=English |date=25 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Speed Skating ==
Speed skating is performed on an ice rink and is usually done through the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] or other large organizations that perform in winter sports such as this. There are a lot of factors that go into having a fair, proper and safe ice race.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/speed-skating-101-rules.|title=Olympics 2018|work=NBC Olympics|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''--The Draw''' happens before any race and take place there needs to be a qualifying round, or the draw, to determine the place in which the racers will start in for their desired heat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''--'''Before '''the Start''' of the race, the racers’ names are called and they must appear to the starting line within the given time or they will not be allowed to race. Once at the starting line, they must approach the line saying “ready” but at no point touch the line with their skate or with any other body part until the gun is shot.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''--False Starting''' for the race happens If the racer takes the starting line before saying ready or if they leave the starting line before the gun has been fired, they will receive a false start. They are given a warning at first and if they false start again then the racer whose fault it was will be disqualified from the race.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Crossovers-''' During the race, each racer must switch lanes one time during each lap. This is due to the inner lop being shorter than the outer loop so it is only fair to have the racers switch each lap. Skaters can be disqualified for cutting the lines or leaving the inner curve.

'''Cutting lines-''' When the racer is making the turn they must not cross the inner line as they will be cutting the loop shorter, even though it is not that much of a distance, it will still differ on the racers finishing times.

'''--'''When '''Leaving the inner curve,''' if for some reason the racer cannot hold the inner curve and for some reason interferes with the other racer, he or she will be disqualified.

'''--''' At '''the Finish,''' when they are approaching the finish line, the only way to complete the race is when the tip of their skate crosses the finish line. If they fall short and slide through the finish, time will not be recorded until the tip of the skate is through the finish line.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Sprint finishes ==
A sprint finish is a racing tactic used in many forms of racing where a competitor accelerates towards top speed in the final stages of a race. This tactic is mostly associated with long-distance forms of [[running]] and [[cycling (sport)|cycling]], which often feature large groups of competitors racing at a slower pace for much of the race – this slower [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] racing allows for the subsequent [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] activity required for sprinting.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J Maughan, &amp; Michael Gleeson (20 May 2010). [https://books.google.com/books?id=xT6cAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;ots=OOMScgHaWA&amp;dq=%22anaerobic%22%20%22sprint%20finish%22&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q=%22anaerobic%22%20%22sprint%20finish%22&amp;f=false "Energy Supply"]. ''The Biochemical Basis of Sports Performance'' (pg. 129). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199208289}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tactic relies upon keeping greater [[Energy balance (biology)|energy reserves]] than your opponent until the last part of the race in order to be able to reach the finish point first. It is the opposing tactic to keeping a steady optimal [[Pace (speed)|pace]] throughout a race to maximise your energy efficiency (see [[running economy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Roy. [http://www.multibriefs.com/briefs/exclusive/developing_a_fast_finish.html#.U1AWms73Gt8 Developing a fast finish for your road races]. Multi Briefs. Retrieved on 2014-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[track and field]], distances from [[1500 metres]] upwards often feature sprint finishes. They can also be found in [[cross country running|cross country]] and [[road running]] events, even up to the [[marathon]] distance.

In cycling, sprint finishes are an integral part of the sport and are used in both [[track cycling]] and [[road cycling]]. [[Sprint (cycling)|Cycling sprints]] are often highly tactical, particularly on the track, with cyclists occasionally coming to a near halt at points before reaching a high speed finish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/cycling/get_involved/4261874.stm The individual sprint ].

The original scale introduced by Gunnar Borg rated exertion on a scale of 6-20. Borg then constructed a category (C) ratio (R) scale, the Borg CR10 Scale. This is especially used in clinical diagnosis of breathlessness and dyspnea, chest pain, angina and musculo-skeletal pain. The CR-10 scale is best suited when there is an overriding sensation arising either from a specific area of the body, for example, muscle pain, ache or fatigue in the quadriceps or from pulmonary responses.

The Borg scale can be compared to other linear scales such as the [[Likert scale]] or a [[visual analogue scale]]. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the results are broadly very similar, although the Borg may outperform the Likert scale in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grant | first1 = S. | last2 = Aitchison | first2 = T. | last3 = Henderson | first3 = E. | last4 = Christie | first4 = J. | last5 = Zare | first5 = S. | last6 = McMurray | first6 = J. | last7 = Dargie | first7 = H. | title = A Comparison of the Reproducibility and the Sensitivity to Change of Visual Analogue Scales, Borg Scales, and Likert Scales in Normal Subjects During Submaximal Exercise | doi = 10.1378/chest.116.5.1208 | journal = Chest | volume = 116 | issue = 5 | pages = 1208–1217 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10559077| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Set points on the RPE scale==
The Borg RPE scale is a numerical scale that ranges from 6 to 20,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/measuring/exertion.html|publisher=CDC|title=Measuring Physical Activity Intensity}}&lt;/ref&gt; where 6 means "no exertion at all" and 20 means "maximal exertion." When a measurement is taken, a number is chosen from the following scale by an individual that best describes their level of exertion during physical activity.
*6&amp;nbsp;– No exertion at all
*7&amp;nbsp;– Extremely light
*8
*9&amp;nbsp;– Very light

'''Sailing wear''' is a type of [[clothing]] for [[sailing]]. It protects the [[sailor]] from water and insulates the body on board a [[Ship|vessel]].

There are different types in use, the most premier sailing wear is the offshore set used for the open seas. Usually offshore sailing wear consists of special shoes or [[Wellington boot]]s, a [[Trousers|pant]] with [[suspenders]], a [[jacket]] with a high [[Collar (clothing)|collar]], and other increasingly technical layers worn underneath this outerwear. In addition, specially designed [[glove]]s made with synthetic leathers are worn for protection and to increase holding power on sheets.

Marine footwear is extremely important in order to stay safe while sailing. Sailing wet-boots are designed to keep the sailor's feet dry and can be either rubber moulded or more technical. The most common range of fabrics are [[Gore-Tex]] and leather. All of the 100% waterproof marine boots have non marking, slip-resistant soles in order to avoid any damage to the vessel's deck. All boots require thermal socks as the rubber does not provide enough warmth. Technical boots have a minimal insulating lining which is why socks are well advised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailingclothingstore.co.uk/buyers_guides/marine_footwear.aspx|title=A guide to marine footwear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shuai Shou Gong''' ({{zh|t=甩手功|s=甩手功|p=Shuǎishǒu gōng|l=Swinging hand workout}})
is a hand-swinging exercise pioneered by [[Taiwan]] [[Qigong]] (气功）[[cmn:李鳳山|master Li Feng-shan  ('''李鳳山'''）]]

Standing with both legs apart at a width roughly equal to that of the shoulder, Shuai Shou Gong involves moving both arms in parallel, swinging first to the front of the body until they are the same height as the shoulder, then swinging the arms back with a little effort until both arms are behind the body. On every fifth swing, the knee should slightly bend down and spring back quickly - once when the arms are swinging towards the back of body and another on the return swing to the front of body.

This exercise should be carried out 3 times a day and last at least 10 minutes each time. It will help to improve the blood circulation and starts the healing process if there are any ailments. It is recommended to avoid drinking cold water immediately after the exercise.

Shuai Shou Gong is claimed to cure many ailments including cancer, with anecdotal cases reported in Taiwan. However, there is a lack of peer reviewed evidence supporting these claims, which likely arose due to the [[placebo]] effect.

A '''sports league''' is a group of [[sports team]]s that compete against each other in a specific [[sport]]. At its simplest, it may be a local group of [[amateur sports|amateur]] athletes who form teams among themselves and compete on weekends;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1/sports-exercise/adultsports-exercise|title=Adult Sports &amp; Exercise · WHAT PARK DID YOU HANG OUT AT? · Somerville Archives|author=|date=|website=somervillearchives.omeka.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006011940/http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1/sports-exercise/adultsports-exercise|archivedate=2015-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its most complex, it can be an international [[professional sports league organization|professional]] league making large amounts of money and involving dozens of teams and thousands of players.

==Terminology==

===Synonyms===
In many cases, organizations that function as leagues are described using a different term, such as [[National Basketball Association|association]], [[Conference (sports)|conference]], [[Division (sport)|division]], [[league table|leaderboard]], or [[Playoff format|series]]. This is especially common in individual sports, although the term "league" is sometimes used in amateur individual sports such as [[golf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_46/b3908601.htm|title=A Golf League of Their Own|author=|date=|website=businessweek.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223083227/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_46/b3908601.htm|archivedate=2009-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "league" is also sometimes applied to competitions that would more traditionally be called [[tournaments]], such as the [[UEFA Champions League]], which is organized with multiple small round-robin competitions followed by a single elimination tournament to choose an overall winner.

===Leagues and league systems===
"League" and its synonyms may be used to encompass either a single competition or a related group of competitions.

Many groups use [[promotion and relegation]], where the best-ranked team(s) in the ''lower [[division (sport)|division]]'' are ''promoted'' to the ''higher division'' for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the ''higher division'' are ''relegated'' to the ''lower division'' for the next season. Under this system, the term "league" may be used to refer both to a [[league system]], a group of leagues that are tied together in a hierarchical fashion by promotion and relegation, and to the individual leagues within the league system. For example, in [[Football in England|English association football]], the [[English Football League]] (EFL) is a league system, while the term "National League" refers both to [[National League (division)|the league]] immediately below the EFL in the English pyramid and to [[National League (English football)|its associated league system]].

An alternate system of league organization which is used primarily in Australia, Canada, and the United States is a closed model which always has the same teams playing, with occasional admission of [[expansion teams]] and [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation of existing teams]]. There is no team movement between the higher [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|''major league'']] and the lower ''[[minor league]]s''.

In many of these closed-model leagues in Canada and the United States, they are divided into subdivisions on historical or geographical lines. These may be referred to as ''conferences'' or ''divisions''. For example, the [[National Football League]] (NFL) is divided into the [[National Football Conference]] and [[American Football Conference]]; the latter conference was formed largely from the remnants of the [[American Football League]] after it [[AFL–NFL merger|merged with the NFL]], though it now contains three original NFL teams and three expansion teams. Both the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) are divided into Eastern and Western Conferences. The conferences in the NFL, NBA, and NHL are further divided into subsets, all of which are called "divisions." These are geographically based, and teams play their divisional opponents more than any others, and then play the other clubs in their conference more than their non-conference opponents.

Baseball has a unique nomenclature, with "[[Major League Baseball]]" (MLB) the name of the overall grouping of 30 teams in two "major leagues", the [[American League]] (AL) and the older [[National League]] (NL). They are titled leagues rather than conferences for several reasons. The National League predates the American by 25 years and was considered a "major" league in comparison to its early competitors, and in a sense it simply extended this recognition to the AL, the only league of similar financial clout. In addition, the leagues played no interlocking schedule of any kind until 1995, and then added only a small amount of [[interleague play]], with the main AL-NL competition occurring between their champions in the [[World Series]]. Thus the two leagues played mostly separate competitions within the larger framework of MLB. Finally, until 2000, they were actually separate legal entities, unlike the conferences of other leagues. [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] in Japan has a similar history, with the [[Central League]] and [[Pacific League]] not founded together.

Due to this naming custom, it is common to use slightly different terms to discuss MLB. Where someone might refer to "the best [[quarterback]] in the league" and be understood to mean the overall NFL, a similar mention of "the best [[outfielder]] in the league" is almost always a reference to the American ''or'' National League, and "all of baseball" or similar is used to denote the larger status. Each of the major leagues also has its own [[List of Major League Baseball awards|set of awards]] to recognize the separation between the two, which means there are two [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVPs]], two [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] winners, etc. And since its name is constructed differently—a description of the status of two leagues rather than the title of one—it is common to hear "MLB" without "the" attached to it, as in "the most home runs in MLB this year," since one would not say "the Major League Baseball."

==League organization==
The common thread between all sports leagues is a structure that allows teams or individuals to compete against each other in a nonrandom order on a set schedule, usually called a "season," with the results of the individual competitions being used to name an overall champion.

A league championship may be contested in a number of ways. Each team may play every other team a certain number of times in a [[round-robin tournament]]. Usually, teams play equal number of games or matches at their own stadium and at other teams', because [[home advantage]] is a major factor in many sports. When teams competing for a tournament championship do not play the same teams the same number of times, it is known as an unbalanced schedule.

In such a set-up, the team with the best record becomes champion, based on either a strict win-loss-tie system or on a points system where a certain number of points are awarded for a win, loss, or tie, while bonus points might also be added for teams meeting various criteria. Many leagues also use [[playoffs]], where after teams compete in a regular season in a league format, the top teams (possibly determined by conference or division) advance to the playoffs. In some such leagues having the best regular season record is relatively unimportant, though top-seeded teams in some leagues, such as the [[NFL]], can gain byes to later rounds of the playoffs, and teams finishing with the best records usually have the advantage of playing the weakest teams that have advanced to the playoffs.

==Alternatives to traditional league organization==
While round-robin and modified round-robin competitions are the most common form of league organization, there are a number of ways to organize a sporting competition, almost all of which may be described as a "league". Many sports organizations fall on a continuum between a total lack of organization, as in a pick-up game, and a formal league such as is common at the highest level of professional team sports.

===Non-league sports===
The simplest form of competition is to allow teams to play each other whenever they see fit. In some sports, such as [[horse racing]], the main goal of the entrants is to win individual [[Purse (horse racing)|purses]], and there is little or no ranking or competition outside winning certain major races. A small amount of league organization may be imposed on these non-league sports by way of a series or [[tournament]] tying several individual events together, such as the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]].

Even in team sports that normally use a traditional league format, some teams often exist outside any league; these teams are generally known as [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] teams and either schedule games against local professional or amateur competition or bring their own competition, such as the barnstorming [[Harlem Globetrotters]] did when they toured with the [[Washington Generals]]. As with the Globetrotters, barnstorming teams sometimes emphasize spectacle over athletic competition.

In Europe, the term "cup competition" is used to describe [[single elimination]] or [[Tournament#Knockout tournaments|knock-out]] tournaments, where the pairing of teams in each round is determined by a "draw" (see for example, the [[FA Cup#The draw|FA Cup]] in England), to distinguish it from league competition, in which every club in the [[Professional sports league organization#Structure of European leagues|league or division]] plays the other teams a pre-determined number of times in a season, usually on a home and away basis.

Further, in England, the term [[non-league football]] is used for historical reasons to describe [[association football]] teams that play in organized leagues, but not in the [[English Football League]] or [[Premier League]], the two highest levels of competition in that sport in that country.

[[Independent baseball]] is used similarly in the United States to describe [[baseball]] teams that play in leagues other than those sanctioned by [[Major League Baseball]]. These teams do play in leagues and should not be confused with barnstorming teams that play truly non-league schedules.

===Rankings and leaderboards===
Individual sports often use an alternative type of league organization where competitors are ranked against each other. In the simplest cases, such as [[boxing]], the rankings mean little and the major competition is to crown a champion in a title fight.

In other sports, the rankings and leaderboards gain importance when they are used in [[seed (sports)|seed]]ing tournaments.

In some sports, points are assigned to results at individual competitions, and the resulting points are used to generate a season rankings and determine the season champion. While not usually referred to as "leagues", but "tours" or "series", these season-long competitions with set events are very similar to league structures in team sports. Examples of this are [[motorsport]], [[tennis]], [[golf]], [[skiing]], [[beach volleyball]] and [[rugby sevens]].

===Conferences and informal leagues===
American [[college sports]] are traditionally organized into groups of teams known as "conferences."&lt;ref&gt;Some conferences, though, use "league" instead of "conference." [http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/history/overview About The Ivy League] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903051415/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/history/overview |date=2011-09-03 }}. The Ivy League official website. Council of Ivy Group Presidents. Retrieved 2011-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt; These conferences ordinarily keep league tables and crown champions within the conference, as other sports leagues do, but the individual school also schedule a certain number of "non-conference" games that are organized independently between two schools in different conferences, or between a conference team and a non-conference team. Also, national championships in some college sports are determined by a ranking or playoff system that is independent of the individual conferences.

==Round-robin sports leagues==
Most major team sports play some form of round-robin schedule, where the goal is for each team to play a relatively balanced schedule with each other team in the league or in its league subdivision.  Within this structure, there are a few significant differences between leagues, a few of which are set forth below.

===Single-table versus unbalanced schedule===
The simplest way to organize a sports league, and still one of the most common, is in a double round-robin format where each team plays each other team twice, once at home and once away.  This ensures that every team plays an equally difficult schedule and that no team has undue [[home field advantage]].  This organization is still used in many team sports around the world.

One potential drawback of this simple double round-robin format is that the number of teams in the league determines the schedule.  Larger leagues may not be able to play as many games as such a system would require, and smaller leagues may want more games.  In addition, leagues whose teams are geographically spread out over a wide area (a common situation for leagues in North America) may face significant travel costs.  One solution is to play an unbalanced schedule, with some teams playing additional games against some other teams; this is the way [[Major League Soccer]] has traditionally been scheduled, with the additional games being played against local rivals.  Some leagues also break the league into subunits, often known as "divisions" and "conferences," each of which may itself play a balanced or unbalanced schedule.

===Cups, tournaments and playoffs===
Many sports leagues also participate in a single-elimination tournament each year.  In the United States, Mexico, and some other countries, these tournaments are commonly called "playoffs" and are played at the end of the season, with the teams qualifying for the playoffs based on their performance during the season.  In Europe, "cup" competitions are more common, with all teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that takes place during and parallel with the regular season.

In sports, '''stat padding''' is an action that improves a player's [[statistics]] despite being of little benefit to his or her team or its chance of winning. An example would be a [[gridiron football]] player throwing long passes with an empty backfield on first down in the fourth quarter of a game in which his team was already leading by a large margin.

Stat padding is also noticeable in [[online game|online computer games]]. A group of players might perform a series of actions which generally require little skill in order to raise a player's statistics. For example, in [[first person shooter]]s, two or more players might join different teams and constantly kill one another, usually followed by a heal, revive, or [[respawn]]. Actions such as these are usually done on password-protected or empty [[game server]]s. An example of this in the popular online computer game [[Battlefield 2]] would be when three players collude, one as a medic, another from the other team as a killer, and another person from the medic's team, called the "dummy", to be the victim. The killer shoots the dummy, and the medic then heals or revives his teammate. The killer shoots the dummy again and the process continues. 

It is also possible to stat pad by completing objectives or performing actions in an empty server, or by co-operating with a player on another team. While co-operating with players on another team may pad stats, this is widely considered a form of [[cheating]].

'''Strength training''' is a type of [[physical exercise]] specializing in the use of resistance to induce [[muscular contraction]] which builds the [[physical strength|strength]], [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic endurance]], and [[Muscle hypertrophy|size]] of [[skeletal muscle]]s.

When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being, including increased [[bone]], muscle, [[tendon]], and [[ligament]] strength and toughness, improved [[joint]] function, reduced potential for injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shaw| first = I. |author2=Shaw, B.S. | year = 2014| title = Resistance Training and the Prevention of Sports Injuries. In: Hopkins, G. (Ed.). Sports Injuries: Prevention, Management and Risk Factors| publisher = Nova Science Publishers, Hauppauge, NY| isbn = 978-1-63463-305-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; increased [[bone density]], increased [[metabolism]], increased fitness&lt;ref name="Shaw2009"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=Effect of resistance training on cardiorespiratory endurance and coronary artery disease risk|journal=Cardiovascular Journal of South Africa|volume=16|issue=5|pages=256–59|pmid=16307157|author=Shaw, B.S.|author2=Shaw, I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw2009a"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Compatibility of concurrent aerobic and resistance training on maximal aerobic capacity in sedentary males|journal=Cardiovascular journal of Africa|volume=20|issue=2|pages=104–06|pmc=3721256|pmid=19421643|author=Shaw, B.S.|author2=Shaw, I.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improved [[cardiac]] function. Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases and uses a variety of exercises and types of [[:Category:Weight training equipment|equipment]] to target specific muscle groups. Strength training is primarily an [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] activity, although some proponents have adapted it to provide the benefits of [[aerobic exercise]] through [[circuit training]].

Strength training is typically associated with the production of lactate, which is a limiting factor of exercise performance. Regular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which can prevent lactate levels from rising during strength training. This is mediated via activation of PGC-1alpha which alter the LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) isoenzyme complex composition and decreases the activity of the lactate generating enzyme LDHA, while increasing the activity of the lactate metabolizing enzyme LDHB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Summermatter|first=Serge|last2=Santos|first2=Gesa|last3=Pérez-Schindler|first3=Joaquín|last4=Handschin|first4=Christoph|date=2013-05-21|title=Skeletal muscle PGC-1α controls whole-body lactate homeostasis through estrogen-related receptor α-dependent activation of LDH B and repression of LDH A|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=21|pages=8738–43|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212976110|issn=1091-6490|pmc=3666691|pmid=23650363|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.8738S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports where strength training is central are [[bodybuilding]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[powerlifting]], [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], [[Highland games]], [[shot put]], [[discus throw]], and [[javelin throw]]. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably [[tennis]], [[American football]], [[wrestling]], [[track and field]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[lacrosse]], [[basketball]], [[pole dancing]], [[hockey]], [[professional wrestling]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], and [[soccer]]. Strength training for other sports and physical activities is becoming increasingly popular.

== Uses ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
The benefits of weight training include greater muscular strength, improved muscle tone and appearance, increased endurance and enhanced bone density.

=== Increased physical attractiveness ===
Many people take up weight training to improve their [[physical attractiveness]]. There is evidence that a body type consisting of broad shoulders and a narrow waist, attainable through strength training, is the most physically attractive male attribute according to women participating in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mautz|first=Brian S.|last2=Wong|first2=Bob B. M.|last3=Peters|first3=Richard A.|last4=Jennions|first4=Michael D.|date=2013-04-23|title=Penis size interacts with body shape and height to influence male attractiveness|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/17/6925|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=110|issue=17|pages=6925–30|doi=10.1073/pnas.1219361110|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3637716|pmid=23569234|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.6925M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most men can develop substantial muscles; most women lack the [[testosterone]] to do it, but they can develop a firm, "toned" (see below) physique, and they can increase their strength by the same proportion as that achieved by men (but usually from a significantly lower starting point). An individual's [[Genetics|genetic]] make-up dictates the response to weight training stimuli to a significant extent.  Training can not exceed a muscle's intrinsic genetically determined qualities though polymorphic expression does occur e.g., Myosin heavy chains&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Applications|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Metabolic Monitoring for Military Field|date=2004-01-01|title=Physiological Biomarkers for Predicting Performance|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215705/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies also show that people are able to tell the strength of men based on photos of their bodies and faces, and that physical appearance indicates cues of strengths that are often linked to a man's physical formidability and, therefore, his attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sell|first=Aaron|last2=Cosmides|first2=Leda|last3=Tooby|first3=John|last4=Sznycer|first4=Daniel|last5=Rueden|first5=Christopher von|last6=Gurven|first6=Michael|date=2009-02-07|title=Human adaptations for the visual assessment of strength and fighting ability from the body and face|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1656/575|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=276|issue=1656|pages=575–584|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.1177|issn=0962-8452|pmid=18945661}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is aligned with studies that reveal those who undergo strength training attain more [[self-esteem]] and [[body cathexis]] when compared to individuals who do not undergo training or exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Resistance Training|last=Stone|first=Michael|last2=Stone|first2=Meg|last3=Sands|first3=William|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2007|isbn=9780880117067|location=Champaign, Illinois|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people who undergo strength training tend to have a more favorable [[body image]] even than those who also engage in regular [[Exercise|physical activities]] such as [[walking]] and [[running]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Body Image Workbook: An Eight-Step Program for Learning to Like Your Looks|last=Cash|first=Thomas|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781608826179|location=Oakland, CA|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; More women are also increasingly revealed to be dissatisfied with their body today than those surveyed in 1984 and they often turn to exercise such as strength training to improve their [[body shape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tighten Your Tummy in 2 Weeks: Lose up to 14 Inches &amp; 14 Pounds of Fat in 14 Days!|last=Darden|first=Ellington|publisher=Rodale|year=2015|isbn=9781623365714|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workouts elevate [[metabolism]] for up to 14 hours following 45-minutes of vigorous exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Shanely|first2=R.

=== Increased general physical health ===
Strength training also provides functional benefits. Stronger muscles improve posture, provide better support for [[joint]]s, and reduce the risk of [[injury]] from everyday activities. [[Old age|Older]] people who take up weight training can prevent some of the loss of muscle tissue that normally accompanies [[aging]]—and even regain some functional strength—and by doing so become less frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Gordon|first2=P. M.|year=2011|title=Resistance Exercise for the Aging Adult: Clinical Implications and Prescription Guidelines|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|volume=124|issue=3|pages=194–98|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.08.020|pmid=21396499|last1=Peterson|first1=M. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be able to avoid some types of [[physical disability]]. Weight-bearing exercise also helps to prevent [[osteoporosis]] and to improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="pmid21360219"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bergmann|last3=Boonen|last4=Boutsen|last5=Bruyere|last6=Devogelaer|last7=Goemaere|last8=Hollevoet|last9=Kaufman|year=2011|title=Non-pharmacological management of osteoporosis: a consensus of the Belgian Bone Club|journal=Osteoporos Int|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2769–88|doi=10.1007/s00198-011-1545-x|pmc=3186889|pmid=21360219|author=Body JJ, Bergmann P, Boonen S, Boutsen Y, Bruyere O, Devogelaer JP, Goemaere S, Hollevoet N, Kaufman JM, Milisen K, Rozenberg S, Reginster JY|last10=Milisen|last11=Rozenberg|last12=Reginster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of weight training for older people have been confirmed by studies of people who began engaging in it even in their 80s and 90s.

Though strength training can stimulate the [[cardiovascular system]], many exercise [[physiologist]]s, based on their observation of maximal [[oxygen]] uptake, argue that [[aerobics]] training is a better cardiovascular stimulus. Central [[catheter]] monitoring during resistance training reveals increased [[cardiac output]], suggesting that strength training shows potential for [[cardiovascular exercise]]. However, a 2007 meta-analysis found that, though aerobic training is an effective therapy for heart failure patients, combined aerobic and strength training is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Liang|last3=Pechter|last4=Jones|last5=McAlister|last6=Clark|date=2007-06-19|title=A meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on left ventricular remodeling in heart failure patients: the benefit depends on the type of training performed|journal=J Am Coll Cardiol|volume=49|issue=24|pages=2329–36|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.055|pmid=17572248|author=Haykowsky MJ, Liang Y, Pechter D, Jones LW, McAlister FA, Clark AM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training may be important to metabolic and cardiovascular health. Recent evidence suggests that resistance training may reduce metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. Overweight individuals with high strength fitness exhibit metabolic/cardiovascular risk profiles similar to normal-weight, fit individuals rather than overweight unfit individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lee|first2=M. M.|last3=Katiraie|first3=M|last4=Krell|first4=S. L.|last5=Angadi|first5=S. S.|last6=Chronley|first6=M. K.|last7=Oh|first7=C. S.|last8=Ribas|first8=V|last9=Harris|first9=R.

K.|last10=Hevener|first10=A. L.|last11=Croymans|first11=D. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For rehabilitation or to address an impairment ===
For many people in [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] or with an acquired [[disability]], such as following stroke or orthopaedic surgery, strength training for weak muscles is a key factor to optimise recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Dorsch|first2=S.|last3=Canning|first3=C. G.|year=2006|title=Strengthening interventions increase strength and improve activity after stroke: A systematic review|journal=Australian Journal of Physiotherapy|volume=52|issue=4|pages=241–48|doi=10.1016/S0004-9514(06)70003-4|pmid=17132118|last1=Ada|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For people with such a health condition, their strength training is likely to need to be designed by an appropriate health professional, such as a [[physiotherapist]] or an [[occupational therapist]].

=== Increased sports performance ===
Stronger muscles improve performance in a variety of sports. Sport-specific training routines are used by many competitors. These often specify that the speed of [[muscle contraction]] during weight training should be the same as that of the particular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Phillips N | year = 1997 | title = Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning | url = | journal = Physiotherapy | volume = 83 | issue = 1| page = 47 | doi = 10.1016/s0031-9406(05)66120-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For the pleasure of the activity ===
One side effect of intense exercise is increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[norepinephrine]], which can help to improve mood and counter feelings of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (It should be noted that dopamine and serotonin were not found to be increased by resistance training).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 2001|title=Effects of physical exercise on anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=21|issue=1|pages=33–61|doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(99)00032-X|pmid=11148895|last1=Salmon|first1=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exercise and Depression|url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comprehensive Physiology|year=2013|isbn=9780470650714|volume=3|pages=1337–62|chapter=Muscle as a Secretory Organ|doi=10.1002/cphy.c120033|pmid=23897689|issue=3|author1=Pedersen|first1=B. K.|journal=Comprehensive Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
The basic principles of strength training involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions (reps), sets, tempo, exercises and force to cause desired changes in strength, endurance or size  by overloading of a group of muscles. The specific combinations of reps, sets, exercises, resistance and force depend on the purpose of the individual performing the exercise: to gain size and strength multiple (4+) sets with fewer reps must be performed using more force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Kargarfard|first2=M.|last3=Danaee|first3=M.|last4=Bahri Mohd Tamrin|first4=S.|year=2015|title=Intensive Resistance Exercise and Circadian Salivary Testosterone Concentrations Among Young Male Recreational Lifters|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|volume=29|issue=1|pages=151–58|doi=10.1519/JSC.0000000000000632|pmid=25051005|last1=Shariat|first1=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A wide spectrum of regimens can be adopted to achieve different results, but the classic formula recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine reads as follows:
* 8 to 12 repetitions of a resistance training exercise for each major muscle group at an intensity of 40% to 80% of a one-repetition max (RM) depending on the training level of the participant.
* Two to three minutes of rest is recommended between exercise sets to allow for proper recovery.
* Two to four sets are recommended for each muscle group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2013|title=High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment|journal=ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal|volume=17|issue=3|pages=8–13|doi=10.1249/fit.0b013e31828cb1e8|author=Klika, Brett|author2=Jordan, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically failure to use good form during a training set can result in injury or an inability to meet training goals – since the desired muscle group is not challenged sufficiently, the threshold of [[#Progressive overload|overload]] is never reached and the muscle does not gain in strength. There are cases when cheating is beneficial, as is the case where weaker groups become the weak link in the chain and the target muscles are never fully exercised as a result.

=== Terminology ===
Strength training has a variety of specialized terms used to describe parameters of strength training:
* [[Physical exercise|Exercise]] – different movements which involve rotating joints in specific patterns to challenge muscles in different ways.
* [[Form (exercise)|Form]] – each exercise has a specific form, a topography of movement designed to maximize safety and muscle strength gains.
* Rep – short for repetition, a rep is a single cycle of lifting and lowering a weight in a controlled manner, moving through the form of the exercise.
* [[Weight training|Set]] – a set consists of several repetitions performed one after another with no break between them with the number of reps per set and sets per exercise depending on the goal of the individual. The number of repetitions one can perform at a certain weight is called the Rep Maximum (RM). For example, if one could perform ten reps at 75&amp;nbsp;lbs, then their RM for that weight would be 10RM. [[1RM]] is therefore the maximum weight that someone can lift in a given exercise – i.e. a weight that they can only lift once without a break.
* [[Tempo]] – the speed with which an exercise is performed; the tempo of a movement has implications for the weight that can be moved and the effects on the muscle.

=== Realization of training goals ===
For developing endurance, gradual increases in volume and gradual decreases in intensity is the most effective program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1519/1533-4287(2003)017&lt;0082:ACOLAD&gt;2.0.CO;2| title = A Comparison of Linear and Daily Undulating Periodized Programs with Equated Volume and Intensity for Local Muscular Endurance| journal = The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research| volume = 17| pages = 82| year = 2003| last1 = Rhea | first1 = M.

Sets of thirteen to twenty repetitions develop anaerobic endurance, with some increases to muscle size and limited impact on strength.&lt;ref name="pollock"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|title=Strength Training.

Beginning weight-trainers are in the process of training the neurological aspects of strength, the ability of the brain to generate a rate of [[neuron]]al [[action potential]]s that will produce a muscular contraction that is close to the maximum of the muscle's potential.

Weights for each exercise should be chosen so that the desired number of repetitions can just be achieved.

=== Progressive overload ===
In one common method, weight training uses the principle of progressive overload, in which the [[muscle]]s are overloaded by attempting to lift at least as much weight as they are capable. They respond by growing larger and stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brooks | first = G.A. | author2 = Fahey, T.D. &amp; White, T.P. | year =1996 | title = Exercise Physiology:  Human Bioenergetics and Its Applications | publisher = Mayfield Publishing Co | isbn = 0-07-255642-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure is repeated with progressively heavier weights as the practitioner gains strength and endurance.

However, performing exercises at the absolute limit of one's strength (known as [[One rep maximum|one rep max]] lifts) is considered too risky for all but the most experienced practitioners. Moreover, most individuals wish to develop a combination of strength, endurance and muscle size. One repetition sets are not well suited to these aims. Practitioners therefore lift lighter (sub-maximal) weights, with more repetitions, to fatigue the muscle and all fibres within that muscle as required by the progressive overload principle.

Commonly, each exercise is continued to the point of momentary muscular failure. Contrary to widespread belief, this is not the point at which the individual thinks they cannot complete any more repetitions, but rather the first repetition that fails due to inadequate muscular strength. [[Training to failure]] is a controversial topic with some advocating training to failure on all sets while others believe that this will lead to [[overtraining]], and suggest training to failure only on the last set of an exercise.&lt;ref name="Stoppani"&gt;Stoppani, Jim (October 2004). [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-980825861.html Fail – to be strong.] ''Joe Weider's Muscle &amp; Fitness''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners recommend finishing a set of repetitions just before reaching a personal maximum at a given time. Adrenaline and other hormones may promote additional intensity by stimulating the body to lift additional weight (as well as the neuro-muscular stimulations that happen when in "fight-or-flight" mode, as the body activates more muscle fibres), so getting "psyched up" before a workout can increase the maximum weight lifted.

Weight training can be a very effective form of strength training because exercises can be chosen, and weights precisely adjusted, to safely exhaust each individual muscle group after the specific numbers of sets and repetitions that have been found to be the most effective for the individual. Other strength training exercises lack the flexibility and precision that weights offer.

=== Split training ===
Split training involves working no more than three muscle groups or body parts per day, instead spreading the training of specific body parts throughout a training cycle of several days. It is commonly used by more advanced practitioners due to the logistics involved in training all muscle groups maximally. Training all the muscles in the body individually through their full range of motion in a single day is generally not considered possible due to caloric and time constraints. Split training involves fully exhausting individual muscle groups during a workout, then allowing several days for the muscle to fully recover. Muscles are worked roughly twice per week and allowed roughly 72 hours to recover. Recovery of certain muscle groups is usually achieved on days while training other groups, i.e. a 7-day week can consist of a practitioner training trapezius, side shoulders and upper shoulders to exhaustion on one day, the following day the arms to exhaustion, the day after that the rear, front shoulders and back, the day after that the chest. In this way all mentioned muscle groups are allowed the necessary recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kraemer, William J. |author2=Zatsiorsky, Vladimir M. |title=Science and Practice of Strength Training, Second Edition |publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers |location=Champaign, Ill |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWSn4iKgNo8C&amp;pg=PP12&amp;dq=strength+training+weekly |isbn=0-7360-5628-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page= 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intensity, volume, and frequency ===
Three important variables of strength training are intensity, volume, and frequency. Intensity refers to the amount of [[mechanical work|work]] required to achieve the activity and is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[mass]] of the weights being lifted. Volume refers to the number of muscles worked, exercises, sets, and reps during a single session.  Frequency refers to how many training sessions are performed per week.

These variables are important because they are all mutually conflicting, as the muscle only has so much strength and endurance, and takes time to recover due to [[microtrauma]]. Increasing one by any significant amount necessitates the decrease of the other two, e.g. increasing weight means a reduction of reps, and will require more recovery time and therefore fewer workouts per week. Trying to push too much intensity, volume and frequency will result in [[overtraining]], and eventually lead to injury and other health issues such as chronic soreness and general [[lethargy]], illness or even acute trauma such as [[avulsion fracture]]s. A high-medium-low formula can be used to avoid overtraining, with either intensity, volume, or frequency being high, one of the others being medium, and the other being low. One example of this training strategy can be found in the following chart:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Type!!High!!Med!!Low
|-
| Intensity (% of [[One rep maximum|1RM]])||80–100%||40–70%||0–40%
|-
| Volume (per muscle)||1 exercise||2 exercises||3+ exercises
|-
| Sets||1 set||2–3 sets||4+ sets
|-
| Reps||1–6 reps||8–15 reps||20+ reps
|-
| Session frequency||1 p/w||2–3 p/w||4+ p/w
|}

A common training strategy is to set the volume and frequency the same each week (e.g. training 3 times per week, with 2 sets of 12 reps each workout), and steadily increase the intensity (weight) on a weekly basis. However, to maximize progress to specific goals, individual programs may require different manipulations, such as decreasing the weight, and increase volume or frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Luecke|first2=T.|last3=Wendeln|first3=H.|last4=Toma|first4=K.|last5=Hagerman|first5=F.|last6=Murray|first6=T.|last7=Ragg|first7=K.|last8=Ratamess|first8=N.|last9=Kraemer|first9=W.|year=2002|title=Muscular adaptations in response to three different resistance-training regimens: Specificity of repetition maximum training zones|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=88|issue=1–2|pages=50–60|doi=10.1007/s00421-002-0681-6|pmid=12436270|last1=Campos|first1=G.|last10=Staron|first10=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making program alterations on a daily basis (daily undulating periodization) seems to be more efficient in eliciting strength gains than doing so every 4 weeks (linear periodization),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|title=A comparison of linear and daily undulating periodized programs with equated volume and intensity for strength|journal=J Strength Cond Res|volume=16|issue=2|pages=250–55|doi=10.1519/1533-4287(2002)016&lt;0250:ACOLAD&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid=11991778|author=Rhea MR|author2=Ball SD|author3=Phillips WT|author4=Burkett LN}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for beginners there are no differences between different periodization models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=A comparison of periodization models during nine weeks with equated volume and intensity for strength|journal=J Strength Cond Res|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1245–50|doi=10.1519/R-20446.1|pmid=18076234|author=Buford TW|author2=Rossi SJ|author3=Smith DB|author4=Warren AJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Periodization ===
There are many complicated definitions for periodization, but the term simply means the division of the overall training program into periods which accomplish different goals.

Periodization is the modulating of volume, intensity, and frequency over time, to both stimulate gains and allow recovery.

In some programs for example; volume is decreased during a training cycle while intensity is increased. In this template, a lifter would begin a training cycle with a higher rep range than he will finish with.

For this example, the lifter has a 1 rep max of 225&amp;nbsp;lb:

{| class="wikitable"

! 4,125!!87%!!78%
|-
| 5||165&amp;nbsp;lb x 4reps||170&amp;nbsp;lb x 4reps||175&amp;nbsp;lb x 4reps||180&amp;nbsp;lb x 4reps||185&amp;nbsp;lb x 4reps

! 2,775!!92%!!87%
|}

This is an example of periodization where the number of repetitions decreases while the weight increases.

== Practice of weight training ==

=== Methods and equipment ===
{{See also|Weight training#Types of exercises|l1=Weight training: Types of exercises}}
There are many methods of strength training. Examples include [[weight training]], [[circuit training]], [[isometric exercise]], [[gymnastics]], [[plyometrics]], [[Parkour]], [[yoga]], [[Pilates]], [[Super Slow]].

Strength training may be done with minimal or no equipment, for instance [[bodyweight exercise]]s. [[Exercise equipment|Equipment]] used for strength training includes [[barbells]] and [[dumbbells]], [[weight machine]]s and other [[exercise machine]]s, [[weighted clothing]], [[resistance band]]s, [[:Category:gymnastics apparatus|gymnastics apparatus]], [[Swiss ball]]s, [[wobble board (exercise)|wobble boards]], [[indian club]]s, [[pneumatic exercise equipment]], [[hydraulic exercise equipment]].

=== Aerobic exercise versus anaerobic exercise ===
Strength training exercise is primarily [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]].&lt;ref name="kraemer"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2003|title=Strength training basics: Designing workouts to meet patients' goals|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=8|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.08.457|pmid=20086485|author1=Kraemer|first1=W. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even while training at a lower intensity (training loads of ~20-RM), anaerobic glycolysis is still the major source of power, although [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] metabolism makes a small contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2003|title=What is exercise? A primer for practitioners|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=3|pages=31–49|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.03.247|doi-broken-date=2018-05-05|pmid=20086460|author1=Knuttgen|first1=H. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weight training is commonly perceived as anaerobic exercise, because one of the more common goals is to increase strength by lifting heavy weights. Other goals such as rehabilitation, weight loss, body shaping, and bodybuilding often use lower weights, adding aerobic character to the exercise.

Except in the extremes, a muscle will fire fibres of both the aerobic or anaerobic types on any given exercise, in varying ratio depending on the load on the intensity of the contraction.&lt;ref name=Kraemer /&gt; This is known as the energy system continuum. At higher loads, the muscle will recruit all muscle fibres possible, both anaerobic ("fast-twitch") and aerobic ("slow-twitch"), in order to generate the most force. However, at maximum load, the anaerobic processes contract so forcefully that the aerobic fibers are completely shut out, and all work is done by the anaerobic processes. Because the anaerobic muscle fibre uses its fuel faster than the blood and intracellular restorative cycles can resupply it, the maximum number of repetitions is limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chiroweb.com/archives/18/07/06.html "Muscle Metabolism: Aerobic vs. Anaerobic"]. chiroweb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aerobic regime, the blood and intracellular processes can maintain a supply of fuel and oxygen, and continual repetition of the motion will not cause the muscle to fail.

[[Circuit weight training]] is a form of exercise that uses a number of weight training exercise sets separated by short intervals. The cardiovascular effort to recover from each set serves a function similar to an aerobic exercise, but this is not the same as saying that a weight training set is itself an aerobic process.

=== Exercises for specific muscle groups ===
{{Main|Weight training exercises}}
[[File:RomanChairBackExtension.JPG|thumb|right|400px|A ''back extension''.]]
Weight trainers commonly divide the body's [[List of muscles in the human body|individual muscles]] into ten major muscle groups. These do not include the [[hip]], [[neck]] and [[forearm]] muscles, which are rarely trained in isolation. The most common exercises for these muscle groups are listed below.

The sequence shown below is one possible way to order the exercises. The large muscles of the lower body are normally trained before the smaller muscles of the [[Upper body strength|upper body]], because these first exercises require more mental and physical energy. The core muscles of the [[torso]] are trained before the [[shoulder]] and [[arm]] muscles that assist them. Exercises often alternate between "pushing" and "pulling" movements to allow their specific supporting muscles time to recover. The stabilizing muscles in the [[waist]] should be trained last.

=== Advanced techniques ===
A number of techniques have been developed to make weight training exercises more intense, and thereby potentially increase the rate of progress. Many weight lifters use these techniques to bring themselves past a plateau, a duration where a weightlifter may be unable to do more lifting repetitions, sets, or use higher weight resistance.

==== Set structure ====

===== Drop sets =====
A drop set is an easy method of strength training where you perform a set of any exercise to failure or right before failure, and then reduce the weight and continue to lift for more repetitions with the decreased weight.

===== Pyramid sets =====
Pyramid sets are weight training sets in which the progression is from lighter weights with a greater number of repetitions in the first set, to heavier weights with fewer repetitions in subsequent sets.

A reverse pyramid is the opposite in which the heavier weights are used at the beginning and progressively lightened.

===== Burnouts =====
Burnouts combine pyramids and drop sets, working up to higher weights with low reps and then back down to lower weights and high reps.There are a few different ways one could perform burnout sets but the main idea is to perform an exercise until failure. You should start with a weight that is 75% of the amount of the maximum amount of weight you can lift for 1 rep. Once you’ve performed the exercise to exhaustion, reduce the weight and perform another set until failure, which will usually consist of much fewer repetitions. Burnout sets sound very similar to supersets but there are differences in the results they produce. Supersets help increase muscle mass, but are more efficient for producing muscle definition and shape. Burnout sets help increase muscle growth because of the buildup of lactic acid in the muscle when it’s forced to the point of failure.

===== Diminishing set =====
The diminishing set method is where a weight is chosen that can be lifted for 20 reps in one set, and then 70 repetitions are performed in as few sets as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Ross, Don (1988). ''Muscleblasting! Brief and Brutal Shock Training''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. {{ISBN|0-8069-6758-7}}. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Rest-pause =====
The rest-pause training method takes one whole set and breaks it down into a few mini sets. There are two different goals that are associated with rest-pause training, you could use it to increase hypertrophy or increase strength. To increase hypertrophy you would perform a set with weight you are comfortable lifting for 6-10 reps and then set the weight down. Next, take 15 seconds worth of deep breaths and pick the weight back up and lift to failure. Lastly, repeat step two as many times as you want but it is commonly done twice. In order to increase strength using rest-pause method first you would choose a weight that is 85-95% of your one rep max. Then you would perform 1 rep with this weight and follow that up with a 30-45 second break. Then you could repeat this process as many times as you’d like.

===== Giant set =====
The Giant set, is a form of training that targets one muscle group (e.g. the triceps) with four separate exercises performed in quick succession, often to failure and sometimes with the reduction of weight halfway through a set once muscle fatigue sets in. This form of intense training 'shocks' the muscles and as such, is usually performed by experienced trainers and should be used infrequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2000|title=Heat Shock Protein Expression is Increased in Cardiac and Skeletal Muscles of Fischer 344 Rats After Endurance Training|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-445X.2000.01894.x/full|journal=Experimental Physiology|volume=85|issue=1|pages=97–102|doi=10.1111/j.1469-445X.2000.01894.x|last1=Samelman|first1=T. R.|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Superset}}Combined sets ====
;Supersets: Supersets combine two or more exercises with similar motions to maximize the amount of work of an individual muscle or group of muscles.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The exercises are performed with no rest period between the exercises. An example would be doing bench press, which predominantly works the pectoralis and triceps muscles, and then moving to an exercise that works just the triceps such as the triceps extension or the pushdown.

;Push-pull supersets: Push-pull supersets are similar to regular supersets, but exercises are chosen which work opposing muscle groups. This is especially popular when applied to arm exercises, for example by combining biceps curls with the triceps pushdown. Other examples include the shoulder press and lat pulldown combination, and the bench press and wide grip row combination.

;Pre-exhaustion: Pre-exhaustion combines an isolation exercise with a compound exercise for the same muscle group. The isolation exercise first exhausts the muscle group, and then the compound exercise uses the muscle group's supporting muscles to push it further than would otherwise be possible. For example, the triceps muscles normally help the pectorals perform their function. But in the "bench press" the weaker triceps often fails first, which limits the impact on the pectorals. By preceding the bench press with the pec fly, the pectorals can be pre-exhausted so that both muscles fail at the same time, and both benefit equally from the exercise.

;Breakdowns: Breakdowns were developed by [[Frederick Hatfield]] and [[Mike Quinn (bodybuilder)|Mike Quinn]] to work the different types of [[muscle fiber]]s for maximum stimulation. Three different exercises that work the same muscle group are selected, and used for a superset. The first exercise uses a heavy weight (~85% of [[1 rep max]]) for around five reps, the second a medium weight (~70% of 1 rep max) for around twelve reps, and finally the third exercise is performed with a light weight (~50% of 1 rep max) for twenty to thirty reps, or even lighter (~40% of 1 rep max) for forty or more reps. ([[Training to failure|Going to failure]] is discouraged.) The entire superset is performed three times.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Ross, Don (1988). ''Muscleblasting! Brief and Brutal Shock Training''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. {{ISBN|0-8069-6758-7}}. pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Beyond failure ====
;Forced reps: Forced reps occur after momentary muscular failure. An assistant provides just enough help to get the weight trainer past the [[sticking point]] of the exercise, and allow further repetitions to be completed. Weight trainers often do this when they are [[spotting (weight training)|spotting]] their exercise partner. With some exercises forced reps can be done without a training partner. For example, with one-arm ''biceps curls'' the other arm can be used to assist the arm that is being trained.

;Cheat reps: [[Cheating#Strength training|Cheating]] is a deliberate compromise of [[Form (exercise)|form]] to maximize reps. Cheating has the advantage that it can be done without a training partner, but compromises [[Strength training#Safety|safety]]. A typical example of cheat reps occurs during biceps curls when, beginning with the load at the waist, the exerciser swings the barbell or dumbbell forward and up during the concentric phase utilizing momentum to assist their bicep muscles in moving the load to a shortened muscle position. Momentum assistance during the concentric phase allows them to move greater loads during the more difficult concentric phase. The objective can be to position greater loads of resistance to the biceps in preparation of performing the eccentric phase than the more difficult concentric phase would otherwise allow. Replacing a typical function of a training partner with a solo exerciser performing cheat reps facilitates forced reps or [[negative repetition|negative reps]] when training alone.

Number Setting: Weight stripping is a technique used after failure with a normal resistance in certain exercises, particularly with easily adjustable machines, whereby the weight trainer or a partner gradually reduces the resistance after a full set is taken to failure. With each reduction in resistance, as many possible reps are completed and the resistance is then reduced again. This is continued until the resistance is approximately half the original resistance.

;Negative reps: [[Negative repetition|Negative reps]] are performed with much heavier weights. Assistants lift the weight, and then the weight trainer attempts to resist its downward progress through an eccentric contraction. Alternatively, an individual can use an exercise machine for negatives by lifting the weight with both arms or legs, and then lowering it with only one. Or they can simply lower weights more slowly than they lift them: for example, by taking two seconds to lift each weight and four seconds to lower it.

;Partial reps: Partial reps, as the name implies, involves movement through only part of the normal path of an exercise. Partial reps can be performed with heavier weights. Usually, only the easiest part of the repetition is attempted.

;Burns: Burns involve mixing partial reps into a set of full range reps in order to increase intensity. The partials can be performed at any part of the exercise movement, depending on what works best for the particular exercise. Also, the partials can either be added after the end of a set or in some alternating fashion with the full range reps.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Robert and Weis, Dennis (1986) ''Mass!, New Scientific Bodybuilding Secrets''. Contemporary Books. {{ISBN|0-8092-4940-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, after performing a set of ''biceps curls'' to failure, an individual would cheat the bar back to the most contracted position, and then perform several partial reps.

==== Other techniques ====
;Progressive movement training: Progressive movement training attempts to gradually increase the [[range of motion]] throughout a training cycle. The lifter will start with a much heavier weight than they could handle in the full range of motion, only moving through the last 3–5" of the movement.  Throughout the training cycle, the lifter will gradually increase the range of motion until the joint moves through the full range of the exercise.  This is a style that was made popular by Paul Anderson.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

;Time under tension: Time under tension or TUT repetitions are performed with lighter weights. Time under tension refers to the amount of time your muscle under stress during a set. This consists of the time spent in the concentric or the shortening phase, peak contraction phase, as well as the eccentric or the lengthening phase. For example, if you go perform a set of 10 reps and each rep takes 3 seconds to complete, your muscle is under tension for a total of 30 seconds. If you were to perform the same exercise but if you spent 2 seconds in the concentric phase, 1 second to stop during peak contraction, and 3 seconds to lower the weight during the eccentric phase of the rep, the same 10 reps would end up putting your muscles under tension for about 60 seconds.

[[File:WristStrap.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Using a wrist strap.]]

;Wrist straps: Wrist straps (lifting straps) are sometimes used to assist in gripping very heavy weights. Wrist straps can be used to isolate muscle groups like in "lat pull-downs", where the trainee would primarily use the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back rather than the biceps. They are particularly useful for the ''deadlift''. Some lifters avoid using wrist straps to develop their [[grip strength]], just as some go further by using thick bars. Wrist straps can allow a lifter initially to use more weight than they might be able to handle safely for an entire set, as unlike simply holding a weight, if it is dropped then the lifter must descend with it or be pulled down. Straps place stress on the bones of the wrist which can be potentially harmful if excessive.

== Combined techniques ==
Strength training may involve the combining of different training methods such as weight training, plyometrics, bodyweight exercises, and ballistic exercises. This is often done in order to improve a person's ability to apply their strength quickly. Or in other words, to improve their ability to apply explosive power.

=== Loaded plyometrics ===
Loaded plyometrics involve the addition of weights to jumping exercises. The weights may be held or worn. For instance, vertical jumps whilst holding a trap bar or jumping split squats whilst holding dumbbells. This helps to enhance the explosive power of the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Derek, Kennelly, Steve, 'Equipment' in ''Plyometric Anatomy'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex training ===
Complex training, also known as contrast training, involves the alternation of weight training and plyometric exercises. Ideally, both sets of exercises should move through similar ranges of movement; such a pairing is called a complex, or contrast, pair. For instance, a set of heavy back squats at about 85-95% 1RM followed by a set of jumping exercises. The intention is to utilise the intense nervous system activation and increased muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy lift in the plyometric exercise; thereby increasing the power with which it can be performed. Over a period of training, this may result in the athlete being able to perform the plyometric exercise more powerfully, without the requirement of the preceding heavy lift.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Steven J. &amp; Kraemer, William J., ‘Complex Training, or Contrast Loading’ in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Human Kinetics: Leeds, 2013, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Working on the same principles, a sports specific action may be incorporated instead of the plyometric exercise; the intention, in this case, being to increase the athlete's ability to perform the sports specific action more powerfully.

=== Ballistic training ===
Ballistic training, sometimes referred to as power training, is based upon the principle of maximising the acceleration phase of the exercise and minimising the deceleration phase; this helps to improve the athlete's explosive power. On this basis, ballistic training may include exercises which involve the throwing of a weight, such as a medicine ball, or jumping whilst holding or wearing a weight.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Steven J. &amp; Kraemer, William J., 'Ballistic Training' in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Human Kinetics:Leeds, 2013, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contrast loading ===
Contrast loading is the alternation of heavy and light loads i.e. a heavy bench press set at about 85-95% 1RM followed by a light bench press set at about 30-60% 1RM. The heavy set should be performed fast with the light set being performed as fast as possible. The joints should not be locked as this inhibits muscle fibre recruitment and reduces the speed at which the exercise can be performed. A loaded plyometric exercise, or ballistic exercise, may take the place of the light lift.

Similarly to complex training, contrast loading relies on the intense nervous system activation and enhanced muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy lift to help improve the power with which the subsequent exercise can be performed.&lt;ref&gt;McGuigan, Mike, ‘Contrast Training’ in ''Developing Power'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017, 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; This physiological effect is commonly referred to as post-activation potentiation, or the PAP effect. By way of explanation, if a light weight is lifted, and then a heavy weight is lifted, and then the same light weight is lifted again, then the light weight will feel lighter the second time it is lifted. This is due to the increased PAP effect from the heavy lift allowing for greater power to be applied and thus making the subsequent lighter lift feel even lighter than before. Explosive power training programmes are frequently designed to specifically utilise the PAP effect.

== Risks and concerns ==
{{Howto|section|date=July 2009}}
Strength training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are controlled, and carefully defined. Or some safety measures can also be taken before the training. However, as with any form of exercise, improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury. A helmet, boots, gloves, and back belt can aide in injury prevention. Principles of [[Weight training#Safety|weight training safety]] apply to strength training.

=== Bodybuilding ===
{{Main|Bodybuilding}}
[[Bodybuilding]] is a sport in which the goal is to increase muscle size and definition. Bodybuilding increases the endurance of muscles, as well as strength, though not as much as if it were the primary goal. Bodybuilders compete in bodybuilding competitions, and use specific principles and methods of strength training to maximize muscular size and develop extremely low levels of [[adipose tissue|body fat]]. In contrast, most strength trainers train to improve their strength and endurance while not giving special attention to reducing body fat below normal. Strength trainers tend to focus on compound exercises to build basic strength, whereas bodybuilders often use isolation exercises to visually separate their muscles, and to improve muscular [[symmetry]]. Pre-contest training for bodybuilders is different again, in that they attempt to retain as much muscular tissue as possible while undergoing severe [[dieting]]. However, the bodybuilding community has been the source of many strength training principles, techniques, vocabulary, and customs.

=== Nutrition ===
It is widely accepted that strength training must be matched by changes in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] in order to be effective. Although aerobic exercise has been proven to have an effect on the dietary intake of macronutrients, strength training has not &lt;ref name="IS2008"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Self-reported dietary intake following endurance, resistance and concurrent endurance and resistance training|journal=Journal of Sports Science &amp; Medicine|volume=7|issue=2|pages=255–59|pmc=3761454|pmid=24149458|author=Shaw, B.S.|author2=Shaw, I.|author3=Brown, G.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an increase in dietary [[protein]] is generally believed to be required for building skeletal muscle.

A review of 49 research studies found that supplementation of protein in the diet of healthy adults increased the size and strength of muscles during prolonged resistance exercise training; protein intakes of greater than 1.6 g/kg/day did not additionally increase fat-free mass or muscle size or strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morton RW, Murphy KT, McKellar SR, Schoenfeld BJ, Henselmans M, Helms E, Aragon AA, Devries MC, Banfield L, Krieger JW, Phillips SM |title=A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults |journal=Br J Sports Med |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=376–384 |date=March 2018 |pmid=28698222 |pmc=5867436 |doi=10.1136/bjsports-2017-097608 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein that is neither needed for cell growth and repair nor consumed for energy is converted into urea mainly through the deamination process and is excreted by the kidneys. It was once thought that a high-protein diet entails risk of [[kidney]] damage, but studies have shown that kidney problems only occur in people with previous [[kidney disease]]. However failure to properly hydrate can put an increased strain on the kidney's ability to function.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Lisa.

L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A light, balanced meal prior to the workout (usually one to two hours beforehand) ensures that adequate energy and amino acids are available for the intense bout of exercise. The type of nutrients consumed affects the response of the body, and [[nutrient timing]] whereby protein and carbohydrates are consumed prior to and after workout has a beneficial impact on muscle growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2004|title=Influence of nutrition on responses to resistance training|url=http://www.purdue.edu/swo/nutrition/KnowItAll/HealthyWeightGain/InfluenceOfNutritionOnWtGain.pdf|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=36|issue=4|pages=689–96|doi=10.1249/01.mss.0000121944.19275.c4|pmid=15064597|author1=Volek|first1=J. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is consumed throughout the course of the workout to prevent poor performance due to [[dehydration]]. A protein shake is often consumed immediately&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hayes|year=2006|title=Effects of supplement timing and resistance exercise on skeletal muscle hypertrophy|url=http://eprints.vu.edu.au/1436/1/MSSE2006_(3).pdf|journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc|volume=38|issue=11|pages=1918–25|doi=10.1249/01.mss.0000233790.08788.3e|pmid=17095924|author=Cribb PJ, Hayes A}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the workout, because both protein uptake and protein usage are increased at this time.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Glucose (or another simple sugar) is often consumed as well since this quickly replenishes any [[glycogen]] lost during the exercise period.
To maximise muscle protein anabolism, recovery drink should contain glucose (dextrose), protein (usually [[whey]]) hydrolysate containing mainly dipeptides and tripeptides, and [[leucine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Hyperinsulinaemia, hyperaminoacidaemia and post-exercise muscle anabolism: the search for the optimal recovery drink|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=40|issue=11|pages=900–05|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.030031|pmc=2465040|pmid=16950882|author=Manninen AH.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some weight trainers also take [[ergogenic aid]]s such as [[creatine]] or [[steroid]]s to aid muscle growth. However, the effectiveness of some products is disputed and others are potentially harmful.

=== Sex differences in mass gains ===

Due to the androgenic hormonal differences between males and females, the latter are generally unable to develop large muscles regardless of the training program used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://us.commercial.lifefitness.com/content.cfm/strengthtrainingforwomen_1 |title=Strength Training for Women |publisher=IDEA Personal Trainer |last=Freedson |first=PS |accessdate=2008-02-06 |date=2000-07-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716223517/http://us.commercial.lifefitness.com/content.cfm/strengthtrainingforwomen_1 |archivedate=July 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the most that can be achieved is a look similar to that of a [[fitness and figure competition|fitness model]]. Muscle is [[density|denser]] than fat, so someone who builds muscle while keeping the same body weight will occupy less volume; if two people weigh the same (and are the same height) but have different lean body mass percentages, the one with more muscle will appear thinner.&lt;ref name="Ebben"&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1998|title=Strength training for women: Debunking myths that block opportunity|journal=The Physician and Sportsmedicine|volume=26|issue=5|pages=86–97|doi=10.3810/psm.1998.05.1020|pmid=20086816|author=Ebben, W.P.|author2=Jensen, R.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, though bodybuilding uses the same principles as strength training, it is with a goal of gaining muscle bulk.  Strength trainers with different goals and programs will not gain the same mass as a professional bodybuilder.

=== Muscle toning ===
{{More citations needed|date=February 2012}}
Some weight trainers perform light, high-repetition exercises in an attempt to "tone" their muscles without increasing their size.

The word tone derives from the Latin "tonus" (meaning "tension"). In anatomy and physiology, as well as medicine, the term "muscle tone" refers to the continuous and passive partial contraction of the muscles, or the muscles' resistance to passive stretching during resting state as determined by a deep tendon reflex. [[Muscle tone|Muscle tonus]] is dependent on neurological input into the muscle. In medicine, observations of changes in muscle tonus can be used to determine normal or abnormal states which can be indicative of pathology. The common strength training term "tone" is derived from this use.

What muscle builders refer to as a ''toned physique'' or "muscle firmness" is one that combines reasonable muscular size with moderate levels of body fat, qualities that may result from a combination of diet and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Lies, Damned Lies, and Muscle Tone | publisher = CrossFit Impulse|url=http://crossfitimpulse.com/lies-damned-lies-and-muscle-tone/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscle tone or firmness is derived from the increase in [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross filaments in the [[sarcomere]]. When this occurs the same amount of neurological input creates a greater firmness or tone in the resting continuous and passive partial contraction in the muscle.

Exercises of 6–12 reps cause hypertrophy of the [[sarcoplasm]] in [[Skeletal muscle#Skeletal muscle fiber types|slow-twitch and high-twitch muscle fibers]], contributing to overall increased muscle bulk. This is not to be confused with [[myofibril]] hypertrophy which leads to strength gains. Both however can occur to an extent during this rep range. ''Even though most are of the opinion that higher repetitions are best for producing the desired effect of muscle firmness or tone, it is not.'' Low volume strength training of 5 repetitions or fewer will increase strength by increasing [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross filaments thereby increasing muscle firmness or tone. The low volume of this training will inhibit the hypertrophy effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1995|title=Capillary growth in chick skeletal muscle with normal maturation and hypertrophy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034568795000607|journal=Respiration Physiology|volume=102|issue=2–3|pages=293–301|doi=10.1016/0034-5687(95)00060-7|pmid=8904020|last1=Snyder|first1=Gregory K.|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowered-calorie diets have no positive effect on [[muscle hypertrophy]] for muscle of any  fiber type. They may, however, decrease the thickness of [[subcutaneous fat]] (fat between muscle and skin), through an overall reduction in body fat, thus making muscle striations more visible.

=== Weight loss ===
Exercises like sit-ups, or abdominal crunches, performs less work than whole-body aerobic exercises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.physsportsmed.com/issues/1997/06jun/sit_up.htm | last = Stamford | first = B | year = 1997 | title = The right way to do sit-ups | journal = The Physician and Sportsmedicine | volume = 25 | issue = 6|doi=10.3810/psm.1997.06.1433| doi-broken-date = 2018-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby expending fewer calories during exercise than jogging, for example.

Hypertrophy serves to maintain muscle mass, for an elevated [[basal metabolic rate]], which has the potential to burn more calories in a given period compared to aerobics. This helps to maintain a higher metabolic rate which would otherwise diminish after metabolic adaption to dieting, or upon completion of an aerobic routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=R.E.|year=2003|title=Physical activity and weight management: Building the case for exercise|journal=The Physical and Sportsmedicine|volume=31|issue=9|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.11.557|pmid=20086447|author2=Jakicic, J.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight loss also depends on the type of strength training used. Weight training is generally used for bulking, but the bulking method will more than likely not increase weight because of the diet involved. However, when resistance or circuit training is used, because they are not geared towards bulking, women tend to lose weight more quickly. Lean muscles require calories to maintain themselves at rest, which will help reduce fat through an increase in the [[basal metabolic rate]].

== History ==
[[File:EarlyBarbell.png|right|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Saxon]] performing a [[Two Hands Anyhow]] with an early [[kettlebell]] and plate-loaded [[barbell]].]]
Until the 20th century, the history of strength training was very similar to the history of weight training. With the advent of modern technology, materials and knowledge, the methods that can be used for strength training have multiplied significantly.

[[Hippocrates]] explained the principle behind strength training when he wrote "that which is used develops, and that which is not used wastes away", referring to muscular [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] and [[Atrophy#Muscle atrophies|atrophy]]. Progressive resistance training dates back at least to [[Ancient Greece]], when legend has it that wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] trained by carrying a newborn [[calf]] on his back every day until it was fully grown. Another Greek, the physician [[Galen]], described strength training exercises using the [[halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]] (an early form of [[dumbbell]]) in the 2nd century.  Ancient [[Persia]]ns used the [[Indian club|''meels'']], which became popular during the 19th century as the Indian club, and has recently made a comeback in the form of the clubbell.

The dumbbell was joined by the [[barbell]] in the latter half of the 19th century. Early barbells had hollow globes that could be filled with [[sand]] or [[lead shot]], but by the end of the century these were replaced by the plate-loading barbell commonly used today.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite journal |last=Todd |first=Jan |year=1995 |format=PDF |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/IGH/IGH0306/IGH0306c.pdf |title=From Milo to Milo: A History of Barbells, Dumbells&lt;!--sic--&gt;, and Indian Clubs |journal=Iron Game History |volume=3 |issue=6 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training with [[isometric exercise]] was popularised by [[Charles Atlas]] from the 1930s onwards. The 1960s saw the gradual introduction of [[exercise machine]]s into the still-rare strength training gyms of the time. Strength training became increasingly popular in the 1980s following the release of the bodybuilding movie ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' and the subsequent popularity of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name=U.S.C.D.P.&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13956966/ "Sculpted trend spurs women to pump iron"].

=== Safety concerns related to children ===
[[File:Kids power training.jpeg|thumb|Properly supervised strength training for children.]]
[[Orthopedic surgery|Orthopaedic]] specialists used to recommend that children avoid weight training because the [[growth plate]]s on their [[bone]]s might be at risk. The very rare reports of growth plate fractures in children who trained with weights occurred as a result of inadequate supervision, improper form or excess weight, and there have been no reports of injuries to growth plates in youth training programs that followed established guidelines.&lt;ref name = KH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/nutrition_fit/fitness/strength_training.html | title = Strength Training and Your Child | publisher = kidshealth.org | last = Dowshen | first = S |author2=Homeier B  | accessdate = 2008-01-18 | date = 2005-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NSCA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-01-18 |publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association |last=Faigenbaum |first=AD |title=Youth Resistance Training |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717045321/http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the National Strength and Conditioning Association is that strength training is safe for children if properly designed and supervised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf |format=pdf |title=Position statement:  Youth Resistance Training |publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association |accessdate=2008-01-18 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717045336/http://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger children are at greater risk of injury than adults if they drop a weight on themselves or perform an exercise incorrectly; further, they may lack understanding of, or ignore the safety precautions around weight training equipment.  As a result, supervision of minors is considered vital to ensuring the safety of any youth engaging in strength training.&lt;ref name = KH /&gt;&lt;ref name = NSCA /&gt;

==== Australia's stance on pre-adolescence strength training  ====
Strength training is the fourth most popular form of fitness in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, S. (2015). [http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/top-fitness-trends-for-2015-20150106-12j220.html Top fitness trends for 2015]. ''The Sydney Morning Herald''&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its popularity amongst all ages, there is great scepticism on what the appropriate age to commence strength training in young athletes is. Some points of the opposing view of strength training in young adolescence are stunted growth, health and bone problems in later stages of life and unhealthy eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Stenson, J. (2003). [http://www.nbcnews.com/Default.aspx?id=3076614&amp;p1=0#.VzrQuJF97ic Should kids pump iron?]. msnbc.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by Australian experts that have been recognised by the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) have debunked these myths. There is no link between any prolonged health risks and strength training in pre-adolescence if the procedures of strength training are followed correctly and under suitable supervision. Strength training for pre-adolescents should focus on skills and techniques. Children should only work on strengthening all the big muscle groups, using free weight and body weight movements with relatively light loads. The benefits of these practices include increased strength performance, injury prevention and learning good training principles.&lt;ref&gt;Sibte, N.

In setting up an exercise program for an older adult, they should go through a [[Baseline (medicine)|baseline]] fitness assessment to determine their current limits. Any exercise program for older adults should match the intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise that the person can perform. The program should have a goal of increased strength as compared to the baseline measurement.&lt;ref name="APTAfive" /&gt;

Recommended training for older adults is three times a week of light strength training exercises. Exercise machines are a commonly used equipment in a gym setting, including treadmills with exercises such as walking or light jogging. Home-based exercises should usually consist of body weight or elastic band exercises that maintain a low level of impact on the muscles. Weights can also be used by older adults if they maintain a lighter weight load with an average amount of repetitions (10–12 reps) with suitable supervision. It is important for older adults to maintain a light level of strength training with low levels of impact to avoid injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Progressive resistance strength training can reduce physical disability in older adults|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=46|issue=5|pages=323–24|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2012-091018|pmid=22442190|author1=Keuerleber, J.|author2=Henschke, N.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older people who exercise against a resistance or force become stronger .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Progressive resistance training (PRT)  also improves physical functioning in older people, including the performance of  simple (e.g.: walking, climbing stairs, rising from a chair more quickly) and complex daily activities (e.g.: bathing, cooking).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Caution is recommended when transferring PRT exercises for clinical populations, as adverse effects are unclear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Ashes Urn 1921.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Ashes urn in 1921 when it was still owned by Lord Darnley (Ivo Bligh).]]

'''The Ashes urn''' is a small [[urn]] made of [[terracotta]] and standing 11&amp;nbsp;cm high, believed to contain the ashes of a burnt [[bail (cricket)|cricket bail]]. It was presented to [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]], the captain of the [[England cricket team]], as a personal gift after a friendly match hosted at [[Rupertswood]] mansion in [[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]] during the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1882–83|1882–83 tour in Australia]]. After his death the urn was presented to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], which has it on display at [[Lord's]] cricket ground in London. The urn has come to be strongly associated with '[[The Ashes]]', the prize for which England and [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] are said to compete in [[Test cricket|Test series]] between the two countries.

==The origin of the urn==
[[File:DeathofEnglishCricket.jpg|thumb|The death notice that appeared in ''[[The Sporting Times]]'']]
[[File:English cricket team 1883.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An etching of the English cricket team that toured Australia in 1882-83 in the Australasian newspaper of 1882.]]
[[File:The Ashes English Team 1883.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The English Cricket Team that toured Australia in 1882-83. They were captained by Ivo Bligh. Standing: William Barnes, Frederick Morley, Charles Thomas Studd, George Frederick Vernon, Charles Frederick Henry Leslie.

On 29 August 1882 Australia defeated England in a cricket match played at [[The Oval|Kennington Oval]], [[London]]. There was a great deal of dismay felt by the English about this loss and a few days later a mock obituary notice written by [[Reginald Shirley Brooks]] appeared in the [[The Sporting Times|Sporting Times]] which read:

"In affectionate remembrance of English Cricket which died at the Oval on 29 August 1882. Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances. RIP. NB. The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia."&lt;ref&gt;The Sporting Times, 31 August 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time the term 'the ashes' had been mentioned.

It had previously been arranged that a cricket team captained by [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]] would tour Australia in 1882-83 and this team became the English hope of victory. Before leaving England for Australia, Bligh pledged to bring back "The Ashes of English cricket".&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 “In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes”. page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main Test matches were played. The first was in [[Melbourne]] and was won by [[Australia]]. The second was also in Melbourne and won by the English. The third match was in [[Sydney]] and was again won by the English. After this it was generally acknowledged that the English were the victors. 

After the conclusion of the Test series, a match was played in Sydney in which a United Australian Eleven defeated The Hon. Ivo Bligh's Eleven by four wickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page1415649 The International Cricket Match. England v. United Australia] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 22 February 1883, p. 10, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to have given rise in Melbourne to some debate about whether it should have counted as a Fourth Test.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 “In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes”. pages 24-27&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' made it very clear that this game was not part of the international "rubber" which had in fact been won by England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13529090 Cricket. The International Matches] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 22 February 1883, p. 11, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; There were also other matches played between the English and the individual State cricket teams over the tour.

The urn was made during the 1882-83 tour. It is a very small red terracotta artefact which some believe could be a perfume bottle. Two labels are pasted on it: the top label says "The Ashes"; the lower label is a verse cut out from ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'' magazine of 1 February 1883 which reads:

:''"When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn;''
:''[[Studd brothers|Studds]], [[A. G. Steel|Steel]], [[Walter Read|Read]] and [[Edward Tylecote|Tylecote]] return, return;''
:''The welkin will ring loud,''
:''The great crowd will feel proud,''
:''Seeing [[Dick Barlow|Barlow]] and [[Billy Bates|Bates]] with the urn, the urn;''
:''And the rest coming home with the urn.''"

These names are some of the men in the English team. Many of them are shown in the pictures above.

There is also an associated red velvet bag with a Victor’s Olive Crown embroidered on it in yellow silk cotton with the emblem “1883” in the middle of it. This bag was made by Mrs Anne Fletcher, wife of the [[John Walter Fletcher|manager]] of the NSW team, in early 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 “In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes”. page 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The presentation of the urn==
[[File:Lady Janet Clarke circa 1880.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Janet Clarke|Janet, Lady Clarke]], was one of the women who presented the urn to Bligh.]]
[[File:Rupertswood circa 1890.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Rupertswood]], where the Ashes urn originated]]
[[File:Florence Morphy 3.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Florence Morphy (later Lady Darnley) who also presented the Ashes urn to Bligh.]]
[[File:Ivo Bligh circa 1890.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Ivo Bligh (later Lord Darnley) who was the recipient of the Ashes urn.]]
Reports have established that the estate of [[Rupertswood]] in [[Sunbury, Victoria]] is the birthplace of the Ashes urn legend. According to a 1908 newspaper report in the ''Hobart Mercury'', an unnamed writer from the ''Westminster Gazette'' recalled that a group of Melbourne ladies which included [[Janet Clarke|Janet, Lady Clarke]], and [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], presented "a tiny silver urn, containing what they termed 'the ashes of Australian (''sic'') cricket.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12673335 Cricket] ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|Hobart Mercury]]'', 4 June 1908, p.8, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|The Hon. Ivo Bligh]], captain of the English touring team after one of the three Tests in 1882-83.
 
Rupertswood was the home of [[Sir William Clarke, 1st Baronet|Sir William Clarke]] and [[Janet Clarke|Janet, Lady Clarke]]. Sir William was president of the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]]. At Christmas 1882 and again at Easter 1883, the members of the English cricket team were his guests.&lt;ref&gt;Munns, Joy 1994 "Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes", pages 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

A divergent story about the presentation of the urn is that on Christmas Eve, prior to the start of the three-test series, and after a friendly match between the English cricketers and a combination of staff and guests held at Rupertswood, the urn was presented by Lady Clarke to Bligh in a joking fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Munns, Joy 1994 "Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes", page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Also present on this occasion was the Clarkes' music teacher, Florence Morphy, who was later to marry Ivo Bligh.

There has been some disagreement with this version of events mainly because of three issues. Firstly the verse on the urn was not published in Punch until 1 February 1883 which is five weeks after the Christmas event. Secondly there are statements by both Lord Darnley and Lady Darnley that the presentation happened sometime after the Third Test.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Darnley’s statement is in Cricket Field, 30 June 1894. Lady Darnley’s statement was given to Lady Mildred Allsop and quoted in Munns, Joy 1994 "Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes", page 62&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Test finished in Sydney on 30 January 1883. Thirdly the accompanying red velvet bag made by Mrs Anne Fletcher, was not made until early 1883.

Joy Munns has taken these problems into account and has concluded that there were two quite separate presentations of the same urn. It was presented firstly at Rupertswood at Christmas and was merely the perpetuation of a joke. The second and most documented event was at Easter (which was around 25 March 1883) at Rupertswood after all the formal matches had finished. On this occasion Joy Munns says the verse was pasted on the urn, it was placed in the red velvet bag and given to Bligh.&lt;ref&gt;Munns, Joy 1994 "Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The Birthplace of the Ashes", page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Clarke and Florence Morphy were both present on this occasion. This version of the presentation being in late March is supported by a statement made by Lord Darnley who said in 1921 that he was presented with the urn by "some ladies of Melbourne after the final defeat of his team".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66512851?searchTerm="cobham hall" urn&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=192 International Cricket: The Ashes] ''[[Geraldton Guardian]]'', 15 February 1921, page 1, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; England in fact won the series 2-1.&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154318.html |title=England in Australia, 1882–83|publisher=[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]|accessdate=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bligh's 'final defeat' refers to a non-Test game in Melbourne on 12 March 1883 when they were defeated by the Victorian cricket team in the last formal match of the tour.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 "In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes". page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Easter many of the English team were guests at Rupertswood and did not embark on the return voyage to England until 29 March. Ivo Bligh stayed for another five weeks during which time it is believed he became engaged to Florence Morphy. He sailed for England on 5 May but returned to Australia in February 1884. Four days after his arrival, on 9 February,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63185850 Summary of Events] ''[[The Illustrated Australian News]]'', 20 February 1884, (foot of column 2) at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; he married Florence at St Mary's Church in Sunbury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article93148475 Marriage of the Hon. Ivo Bligh] ''[[The South Australian Chronicle]]'', 23 February 1884, (reproducing original report in ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)]]'' of 12 February 1884) at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding breakfast was a very lavish affair at Rupertswood.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 “In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes”. page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The urn after Rupertswood==

[[File:The Ashes Urn Replica (2016).jpg|150px|thumb|right|A modern-day replica of the Ashes Urn]]
After their honeymoon in [[Australia]] the couple went to [[England]] in August 1884 where they stayed at [[Cobham Hall]] in [[Kent]]. The English papers reported that Florence was warmly welcomed by the Bligh family on her arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Traralgon Record and Morwell, Mirboo, Toongabbie, Heyfield, Tyers and Callignee Advertiser (Traralgon, Victoria), 29 August 1884 p. 4.  http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71545607?searchTerm=ivo bligh &amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|||l-year=1884&lt;/ref&gt; They remained in England for the next 18 months and then returned to Melbourne in January 1886. It was reported at this time that they intended to stay in [[Australia]] for about one year because of Ivo Bligh’s health.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Star (Lismore, NSW ) 17 March 1886, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Melbourne]] they lived in a house called Hazelwell in Powlett St East Melbourne and in November 1886 Florence had her first child.&lt;ref&gt;The Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil (Melbourne), 4 November 1886.    http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63225550?searchTerm=hazelwell melbourne&amp;searchLimits=&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1887 the couple returned to England&lt;ref&gt;The Mercury (Hobart)  11 June 1887. Online reference   http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9134921?searchTerm=ivo bligh&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=188|||l-year=1887&lt;/ref&gt; and for some time lived at Cobham Hall.&lt;ref&gt;England Census 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 Bligh had a position in the wine merchant firm of Morgan Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Town and Country Journal (NSW)  18 January 1890  p 38. http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71106705?searchTerm="ivo bligh"&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=189&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 after the death of his brother Bligh became the Earl of Darnley and inherited [[Cobham Hall]]. The Ashes urn remained at the Hall until Bligh’s death in 1927.

Lord Darnley had an interview in 1921 with Montague Grover, a well-known Australian journalist, at his home in Cobham Hall. Grover says that the urn was kept in Darnley’s den where all his other treasured cricket memorabilia were placed. He had numerous photos of the other team players on the wall as well as a leather-bound copy of the original account of the 1882-83 cricket tour of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Geraldton Guardian 15 February 1921, page 1. Online reference http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66512851?searchTerm="cobham hall" urn&amp;searchLimits=l-decade=192&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bligh’s death Florence presented the urn to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1929. It was placed in the [[Long Room]] at the Lord’s Pavilion until 1953, when it was transferred to the Cricket Museum next to the Pavilion. A photo of the urn in the Long Room in 1929 is shown at the left.

After the urn was first displayed at Lord's it produced a gradual change in the public perception of 'The Ashes'. In 1933 it was displayed in the National Sporting Trophies Exhibition in London with some of the world’s great sporting memorabilia. To the public the urn was becoming the image and symbol of 'The Ashes'.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 "In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes". page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until after about 1950 that the cricket books and paraphernalia almost exclusively used representation of the urn to depict 'The Ashes'. From about 1989 images of the Australian Test cricketers with replicas of the urn appeared in the media.

Since 1929 the urn has returned to [[Australia]] only twice – once when it was brought to Sydney for the Bicentenary Test Match in 1988 and secondly in 2006 for the tour of the Ashes Exhibition to each state capital of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Cricket Club, 2006 "In Affectionate Remembrance: The Story of the Mythical Ashes". page 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''underdog''' is a person or group in a competition, usually in [[sport]]s and [[creative work]]s, who is popularly expected to lose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Keinan |first1= Anat |last2= Avery |first2= Jill |last3= Paharia |first3= Neeru |title= Capitalizing on the Underdog Effect |url= http://hbr.org/2010/11/capitalizing-on-the-underdog-effect |journal= [[Harvard Business Review]] |issue= November 2010 |accessdate= 13 April 2013 }}&lt;br&gt;"Everyone loves a scrappy underdog", as the article observes.&lt;/ref&gt; The party, team, or individual expected to win is called the favorite or [[wikt:top dog|top dog]]. In the case where an underdog wins, the outcome is an [[Upset (competition)|upset]]. An "underdog bet" is a [[Sports betting|bet]] on the underdog or outsider for which the [[odds]] are generally higher.

The first recorded uses of the term occurred in the second half of the 18th century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/underdog|title=Definition of UNDERDOG|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter Oxford Dictionary, Third Edition, 1983. First use 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; its first meaning was "the beaten dog in a fight".&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter Oxford Dictionary, Third Edition, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [British and [Culture of the United States|American culture]], underdogs are highly regarded. This harkens to core [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Parable|parables]] such as the story of [[Goliath|David and Goliath]] and also ancient British legends such as Robin Hood and King Arthur, and reflects the ideal behind the [[American Dream|American dream]], where someone who is poor and/or weak can use hard work to achieve victory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asian American Sporting Cultures|last=Halberstam|first=J.

Potter]] explained that underdogs are appealing to Americans not because they simply beat the odds, but overcome an injustice that explains those odds - such as the game being unfairly rigged due to privilege and power.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a story, the [[Fool (stock character)|Fool]] is often an underdog if they are the main character. Their apparent ineptitude leads to people underestimating their true abilities, and they are able to win either through luck or hidden wisdom against a more powerful, "establishment" villain. An example in film is [[The Tramp]] portrayed by [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Save the Cat!: The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need|last=Snyder|first=Blake|publisher=Michael Wiese Productions|year=2005|isbn=1615930000|location=|pages=37|chapter=Give Me The Same Thing...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">The '''vacuum exercise''' is an [[exercise]] which involves contracting some internal [[Human abdomen|abdominal muscles]], primarily the [[transverse abdominal muscle]], and not as much the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]].

Repetitions of the exercise may be used as a form of [[aerobic exercise|endurance training]], and light [[strength training]]. There is difficulty building strength in the muscle, as it is not easy to apply resistance training to the deeper internal muscles.

The reasons for performing this exercise vary. It has been done for [[aesthetic]] purposes in [[bodybuilding]] competitions (to suck the abdomen in, making it appear less bulgy). It can be done to enhance overall core stability and strength. It is used in [[belly dance]] to actively perform flutters, engaging various fibres in the muscle selectively. Some believe the pressures it exerts upon the intestines are an aid to [[digestion]]. It is used in [[reverse breathing]] upon exhalation.

People may also sometimes contract these muscles in public to reduce the appearance of their abdomen, consciously or unconsciously. "Sucking in" the stomach to appear thinner may be most common form of this exercise, but with little of the intensity or long-term purpose of the other forms.

==Performing a vacuum==
In performing a vacuum (activating the transverse abdominis), one draws one's bellybutton inward, toward the spine. Some perform a vacuum in conjunction with bending over, reaching overhead, or when lifting heavy weights, although the benefit and healthiness of this is disputed (some advocated just tensing the midsection, with primary focus more so on the lower back). Increasing the range of motion (how far it is drawn in), the intensity (very little can be done, other than resisting gravity) or the duration are the methods of making the muscles stronger. Performing flutters or Tabata intervals of high intensity and rest similar to [[kegel exercise]]s is also common. It may also be possible to vary the pressures by contorting the body or exerting various pressures on tissues connected to the transversus abdominis, although how this might be done is currently unknown.&lt;ref name="Cosmo150708"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Norins|first1=Elizabeth|title=Vacuuming Your Stomach Is the Easiest Way to Get Flat Abs|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a43027/flat-ab-hack-vacuum-your-stomach/|accessdate=29 November 2017|publisher=Cosmopolitan|date=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
People who are predisposed to [[inguinal hernia]]tion should avoid this exercise as it increases intra abdominal pressure.

==Yoga method==
In the [[Hatha yoga]] asanas known as [[cat stretch]] and [[Adho Mukha Svanasana]], the exercise can be performed while on all-Fours so that the muscles must resist gravity, making a slight difference in the resistance required.

The pranayama known as kapalabhati involves exhaling powerfully and rapidly a number of times while sitting with the legs crossed in a meditation Adana.This is known as Breath of Fire in Kundalini yoga.

Sat Kriya is fundamental to Kundalini yoga and could be practiced on its own every day for at least 3 minutes. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.spiritrisingyoga.org/kundalini-info/sat-kriya&lt;/ref&gt;
==String method==
A method of developing long-term daily endurance in the muscles is to tie a string around the waist at the [[bellybutton]] level. The string is tied at 3/4 of one's maximum vacuum point. The string should be tight, but not noticeably cutting into the skin. When the transverse abdominis relaxes, the abdominal wall (belly) expands and the string will tighten for immediate feedback, reminding the user to contract the TA.

==Hypopressive exercises==

{{main|Hypopressive exercise}}

[[Hypopressive exercise]]s also involve the [[transverse abdominal]], but they are based upon reflex contraction of the abdominal wall, rather than voluntary contractions that are a feature of traditional abdominal exercises. The significance of this is thought to be that hypopressive exercises increase the base tone of the abdominal wall (as well as the pelvic floor) and hence reduce resting waist circumference.

'''Youth sport''' (British English) or '''youth athletics''' (American English) is any [[sports]] event where competitors are younger than [[adult]] age, whether [[child]]ren or [[adolescent]]s.  Youth sport includes school sport at [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school|secondary]] level, as well as sport played outside the education system, whether informally or organized.

In [[sports studies]] and [[public policy]] contexts, an age limit of 18 (the [[age of majority]]) is usual in discussing "youth sport". Not all [[sports governing body|sports governing bodies]] define "youth" as "under-18": while the [[Youth Olympic Games]] and the [[FA Youth Cup]] are for under-18s, the [[LEN Junior Water Polo European Championship]] is for under-17s. Many youth sport programmes have multiple age levels, for example under-8, under-10, under-12, etc. It is not, however, only '''underage sport''' that may be considered as "youth" sport; for example, the existence of the [[World Rowing U23 Championships]] recognises that adults aged 18–22 have not yet reached peak condition.

Sport is one of the most popular activities among youth all over the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cote|first1=Jay|last2=Hay|first2=J|title=Children's Involvement in Sport: A developmental perspective|journal=Psychological Foundations of Sport|date=2002|pages=484–502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular sports are [[association football]] and swimming.  In 2008, a [[United Nations]]-sponsored report on "Sport for Development and Peace" stated:&lt;ref name=Sport&gt;{{cite book |author=Sport for Development and Peace International Working Group |title=Harnessing the Power of Sport for Development and Peace: Recommendations to Government |date=2008 |publisher=Right to Play |location=Toronto |chapterurl=https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/pdfs/SDP%20IWG/Final%20SDP%20IWG%20Report.pdf#page=98 |page=81 |format=PDF |chapter=Chapter 3: Sport for children and youth: fostering development and strengthening education; 1.2 Sport as a tool to promote child and youth development }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Sport can contribute significantly to international, national and local efforts to give children a healthy start. Sport can help those who haven’t received a good start, and equip youth with the information, skills, personal and social resources, and support needed to make key life transitions successfully.

According to WinterGreen Research, the size of the U.S. youth sports market has grown 55 percent since 2010 and is a $15.3 billion market in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gregory |first=Sean |title=How Kids’ Sports Became a $15 Billion Industry |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2017-08-24 |url=http://time.com/4913687/how-kids-sports-became-15-billion-industry |accessdate=2017-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of sport==

Participation in organized sports during childhood and adolescence has important benefits for physical, psychological, and [[Social determinants of health|social health]]. Sport based youth development programs outside of school promote a wide range of learning and life skill development. Involvement in youth athletics encourages youth to live a healthy and happy lifestyle, foregoing the common issues many youth face such as obesity and depression. However, sport involvement goes beyond health, other benefits allow them to form and strengthen affective relationships, teach youth to value self-improvement over winning, how to be competitive in a competitive society, and to work culturally with different peers and authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrist|first1=Chris|title=Implementing Sports-based Positive Youth Development|journal=Youth Development Initiative|date=2011|volume=1|issue=11|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the classroom, high school student-athletes are far less likely to drop out of school and 15% more likely to attend college.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atyourownrisk.org/benefits-of-sports/ At Your Own Risk&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of sport fosters young people's physical and [[Mental health|emotional health]] and builds valuable social connections.  It also offers opportunities for play and self -expression especially for those young people with few other opportunities. Sport also acts as a healthy alternative to harmful actions such as [[drug abuse]], and involvement in crime. Beyond the individual, sport involvement cuts barriers that divide societies, making it a powerful tool to support conflict prevention both symbolically on the global level and practically within communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sport as a Tool for Development and Peace: Towards Achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals|journal=UN Inter-Agency Task Force|pages=1–33|url=https://www.un.org/sport2005/resources/task_force.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns in sport participation==
The number of dropouts reaches a peak in the adolescent years and the most important reason for not playing sport are “not having enough time,” “no interest anymore,” and “other leisure activities”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Negative experiences can be created through a sport that is overly focused on competition and winning at all costs or that fails to place the healthy development of youth at the center of the experience. Such negative experiences may result in a young person's low self-esteem, involve them in negative relationships, encourage poor sportsmanship, permit aggression and violence, allow racism, perpetuate gender discrimination, or expose them to psychological, sexual and commercial exploitation and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport for Children and Youth: Fostering Development and Strengthening Education|pages=1–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these negative experiences can be avoided when parents and coaches are chosen carefully, ensuring that programs offer a positive development experience for youth.

Injuries have always been of concern in terms of sport but youth are much more susceptible to injury considering both their immature musculoskeletal system and increasingly high intensity training. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, participation in organized sports is on the rise. Nearly 30 million children and adolescents participate in youth sports just in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=JS|last2=Foss|first2=KD|title=Injury patterns in selected high school sports|journal=J Athl Train|date=1999|volume=34|pages=277–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; This high rise in sport participation has led to some startling statistics, high school athletes account for an estimated 2 million injuries, 500,000 doctor visits, and 30,000 hospitalizations each year. The most common types of sports-related injuries among youth are sprains, muscle strains, bone or growth plate injuries, and  [[overuse injuries]].

[[Early sports specialization]] has long been typical among children and teenagers in gymnastics, swimming, diving and figure skating, especially if they have aspirations of being competitive at elite levels.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergeron|first=Michael F.|last2=Mountjoy|first2=Margo|last3=Armstrong|first3=Neil|last4=Chia|first4=Michael|last5=Côté|first5=Jean|last6=Emery|first6=Carolyn A.|last7=Faigenbaum|first7=Avery|last8=Hall|first8=Gary|last9=Kriemler|first9=Susi|date=July 2015|title=International Olympic Committee consensus statement on youth athletic development|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=49|issue=13|pages=843–851|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2015-094962|issn=1473-0480|pmid=26084524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undeniably, the main purpose for athletes to specialize in sport is to become a better player in order to increase their chances of making it to the big leagues or to become an elite athlete. Unfortunately, the data does not prove that specializing as a youth will be enough to make a child into a successful athlete later on (Latorre-Roman, Pinillos, &amp; Robles, 2018). Youth athletes that are considered less specialized have been found to exhibit more all around athleticism and other advantages that specialized athletes do not benefit. (Rugg, Kador, Feley, &amp; Pandya, 2018). Studies have supported that decreasing specialization at a young age will lower the rates of injuries for the players while increasing playing times and length of careers compared to athletes who specialized as a youth (Rugg, Kador, Feley, &amp; Pandya, 2018). Still, sport specializers tend to dramatically outweigh those who stayed multi sport athletes because of the standards people place on sports and how valuable a sports career can be. As youth athletes exhibit skills at higher levels than there peers at a young age, parents, coaches, and the athletes themselves tend to focus on that sport in order to take advantage of their natural skills. parents, coaches, and athletes should know that showing promise in sport from a young age does not guarantee future success as competition levels rise and the athlete develops as a person (Latorre-Roman, Pinillos, &amp; Robles, 2018).

Noting that specializing in a sport at a young age by no means guarantees success, it is most important understand that sport specialization in youth can lead to higher injury rates throughout ones sports career (Mcguine et al., 2017). Research has found that high school athletes that specialize in one sport are more likely to be injured than athletes that play multiple sports (Mcguine et al., 2017) .Further, students who were classified to play moderate amount of sports were found to have less injuries than those who specialized in only one (McGuine et al., 2017) This helps to emphasize the importance of sport diversity in youth athletes and its impact on preventing injuries. Looking at sport specialization more in depth, researchers have suggested that athletes, coaches, and parents monitor the weekly, monthly, and yearly participation rates for youth athletes in a single sport (Post et al., 2017) It is generally recognized that athletes should not participate in more than 8 months worth of intense sport practice and no more than an athletes age in hours of practice a week (post et al., 2017). Also, experts recommend that all athletes engage in a wide variety of athletic activities, including unstructured athletic activities such as playing outside, until at least the age of 15.''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brenner|first=Joel S.|last2=Fitness|first2=Council on Sports Medicine And|date=2016-08-29|title=Sports Specialization and Intensive Training in Young Athletes|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/08/25/peds.2016-2148|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|pages=e20162148|doi=10.1542/peds.2016-2148|issn=0031-4005|pmid=27573090}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/many-kids-are-overdoing-it-when-it-comes-to-sports-and-thats-dangerous/2016/09/02/7bdad768-3a2e-11e6-9ccd-d6005beac8b3_story.html|title=Many kids are overdoing it when it comes to sports, and that’s dangerous|last=Basen|first=Ryan|date=2016-09-05|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feeley|first=Brian T.|last2=Agel|first2=Julie|last3=LaPrade|first3=Robert F.|date=January 2016|title=When Is It Too Early for Single Sport Specialization?|journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=44|issue=1|pages=234–241|doi=10.1177/0363546515576899|issn=1552-3365|pmid=25825379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

In response to the evidence of negative experiences in sport for many youth, especially low-income youth, youth of color, overweight youth, and LGBTQ youth, [[sports-based youth development]] (SBYD) emerged. Sports-based youth development is a theory and practice model for programs to place the mental and physical health of a youth over their athletic success.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Daniel F. &amp; Gil G Noam. Characteristics of sports-based youth development programs. New Directions for Youth Development, No 115. Fall 2007. Wiley Periodicals, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Programs that use SBYD to define program activities and train staff members generally provide free or reduced-cost programming to reduce the barriers low-income youth face when playing sports. These programs are typically found in low-income and under-served neighborhoods, but any sports coach or sports program can apply SBYD principles.

==Inequalities in sport==

===Social class===
[[Global South]] nations tend to have less access to organized sports because the politics of their countries do not have the resources to have leisure and entertainment influence their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coakley|first1=Jay|title=Sports in Society: Issues and Controversies|date=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children in Global South nations have less opportunity to attend school where majority of organized sport takes place.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport for Children and Youth: Fostering Development and Strengthening Education|pages=1–117|url=https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/Chapter3_SportforChildrenandYouth%281%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sport programs within the community provide children marginalized by poverty, gender, disability, family dissolution, ethno-cultural background and conflict with family, crime and other lack of opportunity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In Global North nations, the evolving and complex youth sport system requires significant resources such as time, access, and money to develop as an athlete and play competitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sagas|first1=Michael|last2=Cunningham|first2=George|title=Sport Participation Rates among Underserved American Youths|url=http://www.aspeninstitute.org|website=The Aspen Institute's Project Play|publisher=University of Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; The financial costs involved in facilitating organized sport at an elite level ranges from an average of a few thousand dollars per year, to more than 20,000 dollars per year in some sports. For these financial reasons, participation is not feasible for a majority of kids growing up in lower income families.

In recent years, youth sports have become more expensive in the United States.  The financial burden of organized sports has grown, and children from low-income families are less likely to participate.  The single greatest predictor of whether a child will start playing organized sports young, is whether their household income exceeds $100,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/9469252/hidden-demographics-youth-sports-espn-magazine|title=Hidden demographics of youth sports - ESPN The Magazine|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
{{main|Gender in youth sports}}
Gender conditioning often starts at an early age where boys and girls are taught behave differently and participate in certain activities. While there is no doubt that girls' sport participation has skyrocketed in recent decades, a [[gender inequality]] in youth sports still exists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Messner|first1=Michael|title=Gender Ideologies, Youth Sports, and the Production of Soft Essentialism|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|date=2011|volume=28.2|pages=151–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "separate but equal" ideal of [[gender in youth sports]] is very much prevalent in society and its contradictions inherent a strategy that pushes for both individual equal opportunity and categorical separation of the sexes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Team sport participation peaks at age 11 and participation in sport by girls are high and continuing to increase. However, frequent participation by both boys and girls in team sports is declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woods|first1=Ronald|title=Social Issues in Sport|date=2011|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls are more likely to enter sport later than boys and are more likely to take part in cheerleading, dance, competitive jump roping and volleyball while boys tend to stick with more traditional sports such as baseball, basketball and football. No matter the sport, the benefits of participating remain. With this said, the gender gap in the [[global south]] is much larger than that of the [[global north]] based on significant power relations and religious beliefs, specifically within Muslim communities in countries like [[Bosnia]], [[Egypt]], [[Morocco]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]. For many, [[religion]] is a way of life in which sporting and educational institutions are culturally constructed by cultural and religious dynamics, as well as political, social, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tansin|first1=Benn|last2=Pfister|first2=Gertrud|last3=Jawad|first3=Haifaa|title=Muslim Women and Sport|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|pages=1–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spatial divisions===
The gap between participation in sport in the [[global south]] and the [[global north]] can be due to a shortage of physical education, a lack of financing, few sport facilities and little equipment and no capacity to host major sporting event in the global south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barriers to Participation|url=http://www.sportanddev.org|website=Sport and Dev|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other limitations for people living in certain countries may include a lack of accessible transportation, education and lack of understanding of the sport. There are also several social and cultural barriers faced by youth living in the [[global south]] that impact sport participation. A few of these are religion, culture and language.

==Youth sports programs==
[[File:03042012Ccm gamosuma juvenilA347.JPG|thumb|Game of one of the youth divisions of the Borregos Salvages American football associated with [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]].]]

There are typically two types of youth sport programs.  One is sponsored by schools and the other is sponsored by city recreational departments and agencies. Generally school sponsored programs have qualified coaches and dedicated facilities for their sports but that is not always the case.  Requirements for coaches for school sponsored programs vary from state to state, but the standard for the head coach of a major sport is usually a teaching certificate, with some coaching experience and training.  Non-school youth sports programs operate in a different way and use volunteers as coaches.  They have to find places to practice such as open gyms.  Youths in these programs are assigned or drafted to different teams depending on the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sports Psychology Concepts and Applications|last=Cox|first=Richard|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sport for Development and Peace organization was found in research by Simon Darnell to have positive outcomes on the twelve-year-old boys participating in the program by promoting time management and personal responsibility.  This helped the boys fit into the goals of self-regulation required in [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darnell|first1=Simon|title=Power, Politics, and "Sport for Development and Peace":Investigating the Utility of Sport for International Development|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|date=2010|volume=27|pages=54–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of sport in itself also showcased leaders and those willing to make sacrifices for the sake of their team and also their families.

The Culture, Education, Sport and Ethics program (CESEP) is an international outreach initiative to engage teachers and student from different countries and cultures in the dialogue of healthy sport. This program seeks to create collaboration among teachers, students under 18, and counselors to exchange ideas about sports and culture in an educational program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture, Education, Sport and Ethics Program|url=http://globalsportsdevelopment.org/programs/cesep/|website=[[The Foundation for Global Sports Development]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Olympic Committee's Sports for Hope program, located in [[Lusaka, Zambia]], enhances national sports development through organized sports competitions, camps and clinics.  They organize seminars for coaches and sports administrators as well as community development services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sports for Hope|journal=Olympic Youth Development Centre|date=2011|pages=1–10|url=http://www.olympic.org/documents/commissions_pdffiles/sports-for-hope-brochure.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has an educational component about important societal issues, including girls’ empowerment, civic participation, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other health issues for athletes and the general public. The center offers indoor and outdoor sports fields, lockers, a gym, a boxing hall, classrooms and a variety of sports.

== History of youth athletics in 20th-century America ==
Youth Athletics were played and were popular in 20th-century America. In an attempt to “energize America’s youth and transform its fledgling bodies into healthy future citizens”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Gagen|first = Elizabeth|date = October 2004|title = Making America Flesh: Physicality and Nationhood in Early Twentieth Century Physical Education Reform|url =|journal = Cultural Geographies|page = 417|doi = 10.1191/1474474004eu321oa|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; recreation facilities for youth were created.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Muscular Christianity]] was based on the philosophy of sports and exercise strengthening the body which was the shelter of the soul.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sports in America from Colonial Times to the Twenty-First Century: An Encyclopedia|last = Gems|first = Gerald|publisher = Taylor and Francis|year = 2015|isbn = 9781315700649|editor-last = Reiss|editor-first = Steven|location = New York|pages = 25|chapter = Progressive Era, 1900-1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy shaped the creation of [[YMCA]] programs across America.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This led to the invention of basketball and volleyball in the late 19th Century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also, the YMCA had a female counterpart, the YWCA. The [[Social Gospel|social gospel]] movement, “found sports to be a useful tool to draw inner-city youth to their churches, which often housed gymnasiums.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The social gospel movement lead to the creation of settlement houses, where middle-class men and women would study the social problems of the neighbourhood and attempt to fix them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The best known settlement house was Hull house in Chicago which had a community institution which attempted to Americanize immigrants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At Hull house, “they also provided a gym and sponsored athletic teams for both boys and girls, both as part of the acculturation process and the broader goal of improving the social, mental and physical well-being of inner-city residents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Social agencies such as the  YMCA and YWCA, as well as Boys and Girls Clubs, and Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, provided most of the organized sports to youth in America prior to 1954.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Seefeldt|first = Vern|last2 = Ewing|first2 = Martha|date = 1997|title = Youth Sorts in America: An Overview|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED413324.pdf|journal = President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Research Digest|page = 3|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; While athletics was encouraged by the social gospel movement, youth sports were often organized by youth themselves through the social agencies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This shifted to adults organizing youth sports programs, which was exemplified with the advent of Little League Baseball by Carl Stotz.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Little League Baseball was formed in 1939, with a three team league, while in 1954, there were 70,000 participants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Evidently, organized youth athletics grew rapidly throughout the 20th century in America. There were multiple reasons to support youth athletics programs, but one that was mostly agreed upon was “the notion of providing wholesome, character-building activities to occupy the leisure time of children and youth, to enable them to make the transition from childhood to adulthood.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Within the 20th century, youth athletics were supported for their many believed positive aspects on youth culture. This included the fact that many believed participation in youth athletics would decrease delinquency. In 1965 Coleman wrote, “if it were not for inter-scholastic athletics or something like it, the rebellion against school, the rate of drop-out, and the delinquency of boys might be far worse than they presently are.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Seefeldt|first = Vern|last2 = Ewing|first2 = Martha|date = 1997|title = Youth Sports in America: An Overview|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED413324.pdf|journal = President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Research Digest|page = 7|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, youth athletics were a way for Jewish immigrants to disprove the stereotypes that they were bookish and weak in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Blazer|first = Annie|date = May 2012|title = Religion and Sports in America|url =|journal = Religion Compass|page = 292|doi = 10.1111/j.1749-8171.2012.00347.x|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jews pursued professional careers in sports, which provided young Jewish Americans with role models who showed, “the possibility and benefits of assimilation,”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which encouraged more participation in youth athletics. Catholic youths were interested in youth sports to, “demonstrate patriotism and morality.”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Blazer|first = Annie|date = May 2012|title = Religion and Sports in America|url =|journal = Religion Compass|page = 293|doi = 10.1111/j.1749-8171.2012.00347.x|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, both Catholics and Jews were attracted to youth athletics, to “demonstrate American-ness and experience a sense of belonging in the United States.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As well as physical fitness, sports were also seen as a way to increase social and moral development in youth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, there remained some believed negative aspects of youth athletics. This included the fact that, “premature sports insolvent may result in undesirable emotional consequences for children.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The stress placed on youths during sports could lead to frustration, discouragement and low self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Race and Sports ===

==== African Americans ====
Race has played a role within youth sports as it has enforced [[racial segregation]], but it has also given opportunities to racial minorities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In some ways, youth sports perpetrated segregation, as schools were segregated in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sport and the Color Line: Black Athletes and Race Relations in Twentieth-Century America|last = Pierce|first = Richard|publisher = Routledge|year = 2004|isbn =|editor-last = Miller|editor-first = Patrick|location = New York|pages = 224–226|chapter = More Than a Game: The Political Meaning of High School Basketball in Indianapolis|editor-last2 = Wiggins|editor-first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within African American neighbourhoods in America, there was not the same level of public and private sports facilities as in other neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sport and the Color Line: Black Athletes and Race Relations in Twentieth-Century America|last = Ruck|first = Rob|publisher = Routledge|year = 2004|isbn =|editor-last = Miller|editor-first = Patrick|location = New York|pages = 8|chapter = Sport and Black Pittsburgh, 1900-1930|editor-last2 = Wiggins|editor-first2 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the streets and vacant lots became centres for youth sports.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Segregation and prejudice kept African Americans out of sports facilities, but sports also played a positive role. While schools and subsequently sports teams were created out of segregation, athletics could bring success and accomplishment to schools.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Sports were ways that members of the African- American community could gain self- esteem and a sense of community.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Native Americans ====
Youth sports were an important way of life for Native Americans within boarding schools.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Sports for Native Americans living in boarding schools were so important that they were  on a similar level of importance as work and teaching.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://site.ebrary.com/lib/viu/reader.action?ppg=5&amp;docID=10151303&amp;tm=1455180411112.|title = To Show What an Indian Can Do, Volume 2: Sports at Native American Boarding Schools|last = Bloom|first = John|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 2000|isbn =|location = Minneapolis|pages = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; School sports such as track and field, basketball, and wrestling were activities that some Native Americans felt pride in when they participated.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://site.ebrary.com/lib/viu/reader.action?ppg=5&amp;docID=10151303&amp;tm=1455180411112.|title = To Show What an Indian Can Do, Volume 2: Sports at Native American Boarding Schools.|last = Bloom|first = John|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 2000|isbn =|location = Minneapolis|pages = 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pride was created by the appeal of competition and success, especially against white teams.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Former resident of a boarding school for Native Americans, Jeff McCloud's experiences in sports, "helped him to critically read the pain and degradation of contemporary life on and off Indian reservations as something other than a flaw in Native American character or the inevitable outcome of historical progress."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Through these experiences, sport could be a positive aspect of the lives of Native Americans.

=== Gender and Sports ===

==== Female ====

Female youth athletics was advocated for in the early 20th century because it was, “believed that sports improved young women’s health and beauty, promoted self-confidence, and offered a source of enjoyment.”&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sports in America From Colonial Times to the Twenty-First Century: An Encyclopeida|last = Gems|first = Gerald|publisher = Taylor and Francis|year = 2015|isbn = 9781315700649|editor-last = Reiss|editor-first = Steven|location = New York|pages = 31|chapter = Progressive Era, 1900-1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, girls' sports was not supported by all Americans as some believed it would lead to injuries and girls acting too aggressive and manly.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; During the early parts of the 20th century, some people felt that sport might reduce a girl's femininity and produce too much competitiveness.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780813541563/|title = Growing Girls: The Natural Origins of Girls' Organizations in America|last = Miller|first = Susan|publisher = Rutgers University Press|year = 2007|isbn =|location = New Brunswick|pages = 203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sports, such as basketball, were modified for girls' play.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These modifications included eliminating physical contact and playing half-court games to limit exhaustion.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; American girls participated in more organized sports after the passage of [[Title IX]] in 1972 as they gained more opportunities to do so.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It has been stated that, “among the many forms of sexism in sports, perhaps the most pervasive and devastating is the lack of equal opportunities for girls to compete in programs similar to those offered for boys.”&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Seefeldt|first = Vern|last2 = Ewing|first2 = Martha|date = 1997|title = Youth Sports in America: An Overview|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED413324.pdf|journal = President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Research Digest|page = 4|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls' participation remained much lower than that of boys, but it increased “from 32 percent of the male’s participation in 1973-74 to 63 percent in 1994-95.”&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; While there are barriers to girls' participation in sports, it grew sizeably{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2016}} in the 20th century.

==== Male ====
Youth athletics also affected the lives of boys as it could be used to define masculinity.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blazer|first=Annie|date=May 2012|title=Religion and Sports in America|url=|journal=Religion Compass|page=290|doi=10.1111/j.1749-8171.2012.00347.x|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports were a way to promote bravery, and were tied to masculinity through Muscular Christianity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Sports were even thought to reduce degeneracy as boys were thought to be becoming less brave than their forefathers by some.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Betty DeBerg believes that gender divisions increased as some feared that industrialization and city life were changing gender roles.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Sports were thought to be a way to increase masculinity in boys and to perpetrate social divisions. Furthermore, the masculine aspect of sports perpetrated through the 20th century, has continued an idea of homophobia.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Game: Gay Athletes and the Cult of Masculinity|last=Anderson|first=Eric|publisher=University of New York Press|year=2005|isbn=9780791465332|location=New York|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Anderson states, "in a time of greatly decreasing cultural and institutional homophobia, institutions of sport have remained steadfast in their production of a homophobic and conservative gender ideology."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In 1997, a high school football player wrote that he faced, "victimization and personal distress over the profusion of homophobia within his sport..."&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Game: Gay Athletes and the Cult of Masculinity|last=Anderson|first=Eric|publisher=University of New York Press|year=2005|isbn=9780791465332|location=New York|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This homophobic environment lead to depression for the victim.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The heightened idea of masculinity has allowed homophobia to also permeate sports. Youth sports within the 20th century enforced masculinity on boys, as well as created an environment filled with homophobia.
