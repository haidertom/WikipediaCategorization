===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994-1996)===
Poling achieved his greatest national exposure in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Werstling]] (ECW) in the mid-1990s. He debuted in ECW as an unnamed "handler" to [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] on the January 18, 1994 episode of ''[[ECW Hardcore TV|Eastern Championship Wrestling]]'' by defeating [[Chad Slivenski|Chad Austin]]. He joined [[Paul Heyman]]'s [[Dangerous Alliance]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stable|stable]] with Sabu and [[Tazz|The Tazmaniac]]. His [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] was as an enforcer of the "extreme" attitude; he was named '''911''' at ''The Night The Line was Crossed'' on February 5, where he defeated Chad Austin in a rematch. As part of his monstrous persona, he would frequently perform the [[chokeslam]] on others with little provocation, which made him quickly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#over|popular]] with the crowd as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/11/24/pf-729421.html|title=SLAM! Speaks: What we miss about ECW|author=SLAM Wrestling staff|publisher=SLAM Wrestling|accessdate=February 16, 2015|date=November 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his first title shot in ECW at ''When Worlds Collide'', where he challenged [[Mikey Whipwreck]] for the [[ECW World Television Championship|ECW Television Championship]] but got disqualified after chokeslamming the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]].  He would then enter a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] with [[Curtis Hughes|Mr. Hughes]], whom he defeated at [[Hardcore Heaven (1994)|Hardcore Heaven]]. On August 27, at the [[NWA World Title Tournament]], 911 participated in the [[ECW tournaments#NWA World Heavyweight Championship Tournament|namesake tournament]] for the vacant [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], where he defeated [[Doink the Clown]] in the quarter-final after four chokeslams, before losing to [[2 Cold Scorpio]] in the semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|author=Williams, Scott E.|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2013|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He closed the year by defeating [[The Pitbulls]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]] at [[Holiday Hell (1994)|Holiday Hell]]. Poling received the ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'' [[PWI Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award due to his enormous popularity in ECW for the year 1994.

Poling had two big matches in 1995, scoring wins over [[Ron Simmons]] at [[Hostile City Showdown (1995)|Hostile City Showdown]] and [[Jim Steele (wrestler)|Jim Steele]] at ''Barbed Wire, Hoodies and Chokeslams''. At the [[House Party (1996)|1996 House Party]] [[List of ECW supercards and pay-per-view events|event]], 911 teamed with [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Misterio, Jr.]] to defeat [[The Eliminators]] in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]], which would turn out to be his last match in ECW. He got involved in a brawl with [[Tazz|Taz]] after the match and a feud evolved between the two, but it was scrapped as Poling left the promotion by early 1996 after a falling out backstage with Paul Heyman over the former's treatment of the ring crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW|author=Williams, Scott E.|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc|year=2013|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===World Championship Wrestling (1996-1997)===

===Return to ECW===
In 1998, Poling returned to ECW at [[UltraClash (1998)|UltraClash]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, [[chokeslam]]ming [[Bill Wiles]].

They were then interrupted by [[Spike Dudley]] and had an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#impromptu match|impromptu match]], which 911 lost in [[Squash (professional wrestling)|under a minute]].

===Independent circuit===
Throughout the late 1990s, 911 appeared with the [[New Jersey]] based [[Jersey All Pro Wrestling]] promotion, winning the [[JAPW Heavyweight Championship]] on two occasions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6328">'''Acting under a description''' is a conception of the [[intentionality]] of human action introduced by philosopher [[G. E. M. Anscombe]].

==G. E. M. Anscombe==
Anscombe wrote that a human action is intentional if the question "Why?", taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application (''Intention'', par. 5-8).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Gertrude |last=Anscombe |author-link=G. E. M. Anscombe |title=Intention |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agent can answer the "Why?" question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. "To do Y" or "because I want to do Y" would be typical answers to this sort of "Why?"; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life (sections 18-21). The agent's answer helps supply the descriptions under which the action is intentional. Moreover, the act is known without observation (''Intention'', section. 28). For example, a person knows without observation that their hands are pushing upwards and when asked what they are doing, they say they are opening the window. Hence, in their hands pushing upwards, they are opening the window; opening a window being a description of the intentional act.

Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man's action (which we might observe as consisting in moving an arm up and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description "pumping water" but not under other descriptions such as "contracting these muscles", "tapping out this rhythm", etc.

==Ian Hacking==
The implications of this philosophy of intentional action were extended by [[Ian Hacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Ian |last=Hacking |author-link=Ian Hacking |title=Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personality and the Sciences of Memory |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is as follows: people talk about themselves as intentional beings. Descriptions of acts are almost always descriptions of how an act was intended. A person offers an explanation of why he or she acts thus and so. The array of descriptions available to an individual depend on the descriptions available to the society in which the individual resides. Hence, the media, the expertise of psychologists, physicians and scientists as well as the folk understandings of cultural communities all provide descriptions; descriptions that can be assumed by an individual as he or she acts.

Acting under a description has important implications for interpreting our selves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sugarman |first=Jeff |year=2009 |title=Historical ontology and psychological description |periodical=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-understanding involves understanding our acts and hence understanding the descriptions under which we act. This issue has been illustrated with discussions of particular cases such as autism and multiple personality disorder. In contemporary society, the descriptions under which people act constitute the kind of act and the kind of person that commits the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hacking |first=Ian |year= 2007 |title=Kinds of People: Moving Targets |periodical=PROCEEDINGS-BRITISH ACADEMY |volume=151 |pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Curran |first=R |year=1997 |title=HACKING, IAN. Rewriting the Soul: Multiple Personalities and the Sciences of Memory |periodical=Journal of Analytical Psychology |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=174–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; By illustration, a child pushes another child in the playground. If asked why he did that, he might answer "to show who's boss", "because I have ADHD", or "because I was provoked". Hacking is not concerned with which description best suits the act, but rather, how the descriptions under which people act depend on the descriptions available to them.

According to Hacking, selves are formed not only by humans' bio-physical constitution and the events we experience, but also by the descriptions we ascribe to the events that occur and the events we engage in. These descriptions are often causal descriptions: explanations of how we have come to be the persons that we are. A person does not come to be the person that she is simply because the events of her past caused her to be this person. Rather, the descriptions attributed to events in the past are a formative influence on her being. These explanations are replete with meaning and causal attribution. People are substantially (though not entirely) the people they understand themselves to be.

Acting under a description also has important implications for our interpretation of different societies and different eras. Hacking argues that descriptions change as the shared understandings of particular acts change. Hacking provides the following example. 17th-century courtiers tickled the genitalia of Louis XIII. Were they guilty of child abuse? The description of child abuse available in the 21st century did not exist in the 17th century. "In short, the charge of child abuse may be true of the past, but it was not true in the past. The description only becomes true with time. For Hacking, retroactive descriptions are, at the very least, controversial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sugarman |first=Jeff |year=2009 |title=Historical ontology and psychological description |periodical=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The past is indeterminate, not because acts simply may or may not have happened, but because the ascribed causes of those acts form an ever-shifting account depending on the ebb and flow of descriptions readily ascribed to those acts as the practices of society change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lynch |first=M |year=1995 |title=Review Symposium on Ian Hacking: Narrative Hooks and Paper Trails: the Writing of Memory |periodical=History of the Human Sciences |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animat''' (''third-person indicative present of the [[Latin]] verb '''animō'''''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbix.com/webverbix/go.php?D1=9&amp;H1=109&amp;T1=animo "Animo" at Verbix Latin Verb Conjugator]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning to "animate, give or bring life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/animo "Animo" at Latdict Latin Dictionary and Grammar Resources]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animats''' are artificial [[animal]]s, a contraction of [[animal]]-materials. The term includes physical robots and virtual simulations.  Animat research, a subset of [[Artificial Life]] studies, has become rather popular since [[Rodney Brooks]]' seminal paper "Intelligence without representation". The word was coined by S.W. Wilson in 1985,
in "Knowledge growth in an artificial animal", published in the first ''Proceedings'' 
''of an International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and Their Applications''.

An example using the Animat model as proposed by Wilson is discussed at some length in chapter 9 of [[Stan Franklin]]'s book, [[Artificial Minds]]. In this implementation, the animat is capable of independent learning about its environment through application and evolution of pattern-matching rules called "taxons".

In 2001 Thomas DeMarse performed studies on '[[neurally controlled animat]]'.  Every two years, the Society of Adaptive Behaviour meets and produces a proceedings on this topic.  They also have a journal, ''[[Adaptive Behavior]]''.

[[Alan H Goldstein]] has proposed that, because [[nanobiotechnology]] is in the process of creating real animal-materials, speculative use of this term should be discouraged and its application become purely phenomenological.  Based on the Animat Test (contained in the reference  "I, Nanobot.") any nonbiological material or entity that exhibits the minimum set of behaviors that define a life form is, de facto, an Animat.  Goldstein's basic premise is that in the age of nanobiotechnology it is necessary to follow the chemistry and molecular engineering rather than watching for the emergence of some pre-conceived minimum level of 'intelligence' such as an artificial neural network capable of adaptive phenomena.   Goldstein has cautioned that there is a serious disconnect between the fields of nanobiotechnology and A-life based on profound differences in scientific training, experimental systems, and the different sets of terminology (jargon) these two fields have produced.  Nanobiotechnologists (really molecular engineers who work with both biological and nonbiological molecules) are generally not concerned with complex systems per se; even when they are building molecular interconnects between such systems, e.g. neuroelectronic splices.  A-Life researchers mainly take a systems-level approach.  The enormous transformative power of novel molecular engineering has the potential to create Animats, true nonbiological life forms, whose relatively simple behavior would not fit into most standard A-Life paradigms.  As a result, Goldstein argues, the first Animats may come into being completely unrecognized by either scientific community.

===Theatre===

In 2013, he played the title role in the stage adaptation of ''Guantanamo Boy''. The play ran at the [[Half Moon Theatre]] and toured nationally at [[Middle Temple|Middle Temple Hall]], [[Almeida Theatre]], [[The Hat Factory]], [[Mercury Theatre, Colchester|Mercury Theatre]], [[Burnley Youth Theatre]] and [[The Drum (Arts Centre)|The Drum Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: Guantanamo Boy|url=https://www.halfmoon.org.uk/review-guantanamo-boy-childrens-theatre-reviews/|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Children's Theatre Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Stage]]'s Susan Elkin wrote Aakeel "is great as the distraught, anguished, terrified Khalid. The downhill spiral followed by the final return of a damaged-for-life boy to Rochdale is well handled too. He has a very expressive face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guantanamo Boy Theatre Review - WhatsonStage Susan Elkin|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/reviews/11-2013/guantanamo-boy_32626.html|accessdate=23 August 2016|publisher=WhatsonStage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he played the lead role of Artie in ''Waiting for Garbo'' at the [[Crescent Theatre]] as part of the Birmingham Theatre Festival. Love Midlands Theatre reviewed the performance, commenting his "portrayal of a brash New Yorker falling apart is utterly convincing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Waiting For Garbo Theatre Review|url=http://www.lovemidlandstheatre.co.uk/reviews/a-play-that-leaves-you-thinking|accessdate=23 August 2016|publisher=Love Midlands Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio has also performed locally with [[The Midlands|Midlands]] based theatre company Round Midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Follow me theatre play a success|url=http://redditchstandard.co.uk/news/round-midnights-follow-success-redditch/|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=The Redditch Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

is a chemical-like system that usually consists of objects, called molecules, that interact according to rules resembling chemical reaction rules. Artificial chemistries are created and studied in order to understand fundamental properties of chemical systems, including prebiotic evolution, as well as for developing chemical computing systems. Artificial chemistry is a field within computer science wherein chemical reactions—often biochemical ones—are computer-simulated, yielding insights on evolution, self-assembly, and other biochemical phenomena. The field does not use actual chemicals, and should not be confused with either synthetic chemistry or computational chemistry. Rather, bits of information are used to represent the starting molecules, and the end products are examined along with the processes that led to them. The field originated in [[artificial life]] but has shown to be a versatile method with applications in many fields such as [[chemistry]], [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[linguistics]].

==Formal definition==
An artificial chemistry is defined in general as a triple (S,R,A). In some cases it is sufficient to define it as a tuple (S,I).

*S is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of possible molecules S={s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...,s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}, where n is the number of elements in the set, possibly infinite.
*R is a set of [[arity|n-ary]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s on the molecules in S, the reaction rules R={r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...,r&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}. Each rule r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is written like a chemical reaction a+b+c-&gt;a*+b*+c*. Note here that r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are operators, as opposed to +.
*A is an [[algorithm]] describing how to apply the rules R to a [[subset]] P&lt;math&gt;\subset&lt;/math&gt;S.
*I are the interaction rules of the molecules in S.

==Types of artificial chemistries==

* depending on the space of possible molecules
** finite
** infinite
* depending on the type of reactions
** catalytic systems
** reactive systems
** inhibitive systems
* depending on the space topology
** well stirred reactor
** topologically arranged (1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional)

==Important concepts==
* The field is heavily reliant on mathematics, to include mathematical modeling. It in fact relies more on a mathematics background than a chemistry background.
* Organizations: An organization is a set of molecules that is closed and self-maintaining. As such, it is a set that does not create anything outside itself, and such that any molecule inside the set can be generated within the set.
* Closed sets
* Self-maintaining sets
* Hasse diagram of organizations

==History of artificial chemistries==

Artificial chemistries emerged as a sub-field of [[artificial life]], in particular from [[strong artificial life]]. The idea behind this field was that if one wanted to build something alive, it had to be done by a combination of non-living entities. For instance, a cell is itself alive, and yet is a combination of non-living molecules. Artificial chemistry enlists, among others, researchers that believe in an extreme bottom-up approach to artificial life. In artificial life, bits of information were used to represent bacteria or members of a species, each of which moved, multiplied, or died in computer simulations. In artificial chemistry  bits of information are used to represent starting molecules capable of reacting with one another. The field has pertained to artificial intelligence by virtue of the fact that, over billions of years, non-living matter evolved into primordial life forms which in turn evolved into intelligent life forms.

==Important contributors==

The first reference about Artificial Chemistries come from a Technical paper written by [[John McCaskill]]
.&lt;ref&gt;J.S.McCaskill. Polymer chemistry on tape: A computational model for emergent genetics. Technical report, MPI for Biophysical Chemistry, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Walter Fontana]] working with [[Leo Buss]] then took up the work developing the [[AlChemy model]]
&lt;ref&gt;W. Fontana. Algorithmic chemistry. In C. G. Langton, C. Taylor, J. D. Farmer, and S. Rasmussen, editors, Artificial Life II, pages 159–210. Westview Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was presented at the second International Conference of Artificial Life.
In his first papers he presented the concept of [[organization]], as a set of molecules that is algebraically closed and self-maintaining.
This concept was further developed by Dittrich and Speroni di Fenizio into a theory of chemical organizations

In [[Germany]], it was [[Wolfgang Banzhaf]], who, together with his students [[Peter Dittrich]] and [[Jens Ziegler]], developed various artificial chemistry models.
Their 2001 paper 'Artificial Chemistries - A Review' &lt;ref name="DZB2001" /&gt; became a standard in the field.

Among other models, [[Peter Dittrich]] developed the [[Seceder model]] which is able to explain group formation in society through some simple rules. Since then he became a professor in [[Jena]] where he investigates artificial chemistries as a way to define a general theory of [[constructive dynamical system]]s.

==Applications of artificial chemistries==

Artificial Chemistries are often used in the study of protobiology, in trying to bridge the gap between [[chemistry]] and [[biology]].
A further motivation to study artificial chemistries is the interest in constructive dynamical systems. Yasuhiro Suzuki has modeled various systems such as membrane systems, signaling pathways (P53), ecosystems, and enzyme systems by using his method, abstract rewriting system on multisets (ARMS).

'''Astrochicken''' is the name given to a [[thought experiment]] expounded by [[theoretical physicist]] [[Freeman Dyson]]. In his book ''Disturbing the Universe'' (1979), Dyson contemplated how humanity could build a small, [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a manned craft could. He attributed the general idea to [[John von Neumann]], based on a lecture von Neumann gave in 1948 titled ''The General and Logical Theory of Automata''. Dyson expanded on von Neumann's [[Automata theory|automata theories]] and added a biological component to them.

Astrochicken, Dyson explained, would be a one-kilogram [[spacecraft]] unlike any before it. It would be a creation of the intersection of biology, [[artificial intelligence]] and modern microelectronics&amp;mdash;a blend of organic and electronic components. Astrochicken would be launched by a conventional spacecraft into space, like an egg being laid into space. Astrochicken would then hatch and start growing a solar-energy collector. The solar collector would feed an [[ion drive]] engine that would power the craft. Once Astrochicken entered a planet's vicinity, it would collect material from the moons and rings of the planet, taking in nutrients. It could land and take off using an auxiliary chemical rocket similar to that used by [[bombardier beetle]]s. It would periodically transmit details of its journey when it could make radio contact with Earth.

The term "astrochicken" does not occur in Dyson's earliest essays regarding [[Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes|von Neumann-inspired automata]]. The concept was announced in a lecture Dyson was giving in [[Adelaide, Australia]] on the subject of space exploration with [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc121802.html|title=Cambridge Conference Correspondence|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audience member called out "Oh, you mean this is an astro-chicken." and the whimsical name caught on, with Dyson beginning to use it himself in subsequent essays he wrote on his theoretical biotechnology spacecraft.

Today, Dyson's Astrochicken resonates with several theories of how space exploration might proceed in the future. Computer scientist [[Rodney Brooks]] has proposed sending a multitude of cheap, bug-like robots to explore Mars instead of solitary, expensive rovers. Cheaper and smaller means of studying space have also been the primary design philosophy of [[NASA]] for many years, perhaps best exemplified by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission. Physicist and noted author [[Michio Kaku]] wrote in his work ''Hyperspace'', "Small, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space probe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive space missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space exploration. ... It will not need huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to 'eat' ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer planets".

As a noted author of essays on the possibilities of science in the future, Dyson's theories, such as the [[Dyson sphere]] and the [[Dyson tree]], have become popular in the scientific and [[science fiction]] communities. The more whimsically named "Astrochicken" has not achieved this same level of fame.

An '''autocatalytic set''' is a collection of entities, each of which can be created [[catalysis|catalytically]] by other entities within the set, such that as a whole, the set is able to catalyze its own production.  In this way the set ''as a whole'' is said to be [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]].   Autocatalytic sets were originally and most concretely defined in terms of [[molecular entity|molecular entities]], but have more recently been metaphorically extended to the study of systems in [[sociology]] and [[economics]].

Autocatalytic sets also have the ability to replicate themselves if they are split apart into two physically separated spaces. Computer models illustrate that split autocatalytic sets will reproduce all of the reactions of the original set in each half, much like cellular [[mitosis]]. In effect, using the principles of autocatalysis, a small metabolism can replicate itself with very little high level organization. This property is why autocatalysis is a contender as the foundational mechanism for complex evolution.

Prior to [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], biologists considered autocatalytic sets the way [[metabolism]] functions in principle, i.e. one [[protein]] helps to synthesize another protein and so on. After the discovery of the [[double helix]], the [[central dogma of molecular biology]] was formulated, which is that [[DNA]] is transcribed to [[RNA]] which is translated to protein. The molecular structure of DNA and RNA, as well as the metabolism that maintains their reproduction, are believed to be too complex to have arisen spontaneously in one step from a soup of chemistry.

Several models of the [[origin of life]] are based on the notion that life may have arisen through the development of an initial molecular autocatalytic set which evolved over time.  Most of these models which have emerged from the studies of [[complex system]]s predict that life arose not from a molecule with any particular trait (such as self-replicating [[RNA World|RNA]]) but from an autocatalytic set. The first empirical support came from Lincoln and Joyce, who obtained autocatalytic sets in which "two [RNA] enzymes catalyze each other’s synthesis from a total of four component substrates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lincoln TA, Joyce GF | title = Self-sustained replication of an RNA enzyme | journal = Science | volume = 323 | issue = 5918 | pages = 1229–32 |date=February 2009 | pmid = 19131595 | pmc = 2652413 | doi = 10.1126/science.1167856 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an evolutionary process that began with a population of these self-replicators yielded a population dominated by [[Genetic recombination|recombinant]] replicators.

Modern life has the traits of an autocatalytic set, since no particular molecule, nor any class of molecules, is able to replicate itself. There are several models based on autocatalytic sets, including those of [[Stuart Kauffman]]&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Stuart A. (2008) ''Reinventing the Sacred: A New View of Science, Reason, and Religion''.  [Basic Books] - {{ISBN|0-465-00300-1}}, chapter 5, especially pp.59-71&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

==Formal definition==

===Definition===

Given a set M of [[molecule]]s, [[chemical reaction]]s can be roughly defined as pairs r = (A, B) of subsets from M:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hordijk W | title = Autocatalytic Sets: From the Origin of Life to the Economy | journal = BioScience | volume = 63 | issue = 11 | pages =  877–881| year = 2013 | month = | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1525/bio.2013.63.11.6 | url = http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/63/11/877.abstract | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

  a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; → b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + b&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;

Let R be the set of allowable reactions. A pair (M, R) is a ''reaction system'' (RS).

Let C be the set of molecule-reaction pairs specifying which molecules can [[catalyst|catalyze]] which reactions:

  C = {(m, r) | m ∈ M, r ∈ R}

Let F ⊆ M be a set of ''food'' (small numbers of molecules freely available from the environment) and R' ⊆ R be some subset of reactions. We define a [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the food set relative to this subset of reactions Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) as the set of molecules that contains the food set plus all molecules that can be produced starting from the food set and using only reactions from this subset of reactions. Formally Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) is a minimal subset of M such that F ⊆ Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) and for each reaction r'(A, B) ⊆ R':

  A ⊆ Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) ⇒ B ⊆ Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F)

A reaction system (Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F), R') is ''autocatalytic'', if and only if for each reaction r'(A, B) ⊆ R':
# there exists a molecule c ⊆ Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) such that (c, r') ⊆ C,
# A ⊆ Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F).

===Example===

Let M = {a, b, c, d, f, g} and F = {a, b}. Let the set R contains the following reactions:

  a + b  → c + d, catalyzed by g
  a + f  → c + b, catalyzed by d
  c + b  → g + a, catalyzed by d or f

From the F = {a, b} we can produce {c, d} and then from {c, b} we can produce {g, a} so the closure is equal to:

  Cl&lt;sub&gt;R'&lt;/sub&gt;(F) = {a, b, c, d, g}

According to the definition the maximal autocatalytic subset R' will consists of two reactions:

  a + b  → c + d, catalyzed by g
  c + b  → g + a, catalyzed by d

The reaction for (a + f) does not belong to R' because f does not belong to closure. Similarly the reaction for (c + b) in the autocatalytic set can only be catalyzed by d and not by f.

==Probability that a random set is autocatalytic==

Studies of the above model show that random RS can be autocatalytic with high probability under some assumptions. This comes from the fact that with a growing number of molecules, the number of possible reactions and catalysations grows even larger if the molecules grow in complexity, producing stochastically enough reactions and catalysations to make a part of the RS self-supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mossel E, Steel M. | title = Random biochemical networks and the probability of self-sustaining autocatalysis | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 233 | issue = 3 | pages = 327–336 | year = 2005 | month = | pmid =  15652142| pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.10.011| url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An autocatalytic set then extends very quickly with growing number of molecules
for the same reason. These theoretical results make autocatalytic sets attractive for scientific explanation of the very early origin of life.

==Formal limitations==

Formally, it is difficult to treat molecules as anything but unstructured
entities, since the set of possible reactions (and molecules) would become infinite. Therefore, a derivation of arbitrarily long [[polymer]]s as needed to model DNA, RNA or proteins is not possible, yet. Studies of the [[RNA World]] suffer from the same problem.

==Linguistic aspects==

Contrary to the above definition, which applies to the field of [[Artificial chemistry]],
no agreed-upon notion of autocatalytic sets exists today.

While above, the notion of catalyst is secondary insofar that only the set as
a whole has to catalyse its own production, it is primary in other definitions,
giving the term "Autocatalytic Set" a different emphasis. There, ''every'' reaction
(or function, transformation) has to be mediated by a catalyst. As a consequence,
while mediating its respective reaction, every catalyst ''denotes''
its reaction, too, resulting in a self denoting system, which is interesting
for two reasons. First, real metabolism is structured in this manner.
Second, self denoting systems can be considered as an intermediate step
towards self describing systems.

From both a structural and a natural historical point of view, one can
identify the ACS as seized in the formal definition the more original
concept, while in the second, the reflection of the system in itself is
already brought to an explicit presentation, since catalysts represent
the reaction induced by them. In ACS literature, both concept are present,
but differently emphasised.

To complete the classification from the other side, generalised self
reproducing systems move beyond self-denotation. There, no
unstructured entities carry the transformations anymore, but structured,
described ones. Formally, a generalised self reproducing system consists
of two function, u and c, together with their descriptions Desc(u) and
Desc(c) along following definition:

     u : Desc(X) -&gt; X
     c : Desc(X) -&gt; Desc(X)

where the function 'u' is the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|"universal" constructor]], that constructs
everything in its domain from appropriate descriptions, while 'c' is a copy
function for any description. Practically, 'u' and 'c' can fall apart into many subfunctions or catalysts.

Note that the (trivial) copy function 'c' is necessary because though the universal constructor 'u'
would be able to construct any description, too, the description it would base on, would in
general be longer than the result, rendering full self replication impossible.

This last concept can be attributed to [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s
work on [[Self-replication|self reproducing]] automata, where he holds a self description necessary for any
nontrivial (generalised) self reproducing system to avoid interferences. Von Neumann planned to design
such a system for a model chemistry, too.

==Non-autonomous autocatalytic sets==

Virtually all articles on autocatalytic sets leave open whether the sets are
to be considered autonomous or not. Often, autonomy of the sets is silently
assumed.

Likely, the above context has a strong emphasis on autonomous self replication
and early origin of life. But the concept of autocatalytic sets is really more general and
in practical use in various technical areas, e.g. where self-sustaining tool chains are
handled. Clearly, such sets are not autonomous and are objects of human agency.

Examples of practical importance of non-autonomous autocatalytic sets can be found e.g. in the field of [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|compiler construction]] and in [[Self-hosting|operating systems]], where the self-referential nature of the respective constructions is explicitly discussed, very often as [[bootstrapping]].

[[File:Baopuzi.JPG|thumb|First Page of ''Baopuzi'' Inner Chapter 9]]
[[File:Laojunfu.gif|thumb|''Laojun rushan fu'' 老君入山符 "Lord [[Laozi|Lao]]'s amulet for entering mountains" from ''Baopuzi'' Inner Chapter 17]]
The '''''Baopuzi''''' ({{zh|s=抱朴子|t=抱朴子|p=Bàopǔzǐ|w=Pao-p'u-tzu|l=[Book of the] Master Who Embraces Simplicity}}), written by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] scholar [[Ge Hong]] 葛洪 (283-343), is divided into esoteric ''Neipian'' 內篇 "Inner Chapters" and exoteric ''Waipian'' 外篇 "Outer Chapters". The [[Daoist]] Inner Chapters discuss topics such as techniques for [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] 仙 "immortality; transcendence", [[Chinese alchemy]], elixirs, and demonology. The [[Confucianist]] Outer Chapters discuss [[Chinese literature]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], politics, and society.

==Title==
The [[eponymous]] title ''Baopuzi'' derives from Ge Hong's [[Art name|''hao'']] 號 "sobriquet; pseudonym" Baopuzi (lit. "embrace simplicity master"), which compounds ''bao'' [[Wikt:抱|抱]] "embrace; hug; carry; hold in both arms; cherish", ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' or [[Wikt:朴|朴]] "uncarved wood, [a [[Taoism#Pu|Daoist metaphor]] for a] person's original nature; simple; plain", and ''zi'' [[Wikt:子|子]] "child; offspring; master [title of respect]". ''Baopu'' is a classical allusion to the ''[[Daodejing]]'' (19, tr. Mair 1990:181), "Evince the plainness of undyed silk, embrace the simplicity of the unhewn log; lessen selfishness, diminish desires; abolish learning and you will be without worries."

Ge Hong's autobiography explains choosing his [[pen name]] Baopuzi.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been my plan to preserve regularity and not to follow the whims of the world. My speech is frank and sincere; I engage in no banter. If I do not come upon the right person, I can spend the day in silence. This is the reason my neighbors call me Simplex (''Pao-p'u''), which name I have used as a sobriquet in my writings. (tr. Ware 1966:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare these autobiography translations: (Davis and Ch'en 1941:301) "people all call me a ''pao-p'u'' scholar (i.e., one who keeps his basic nature, one who is unperturbed by the desires of the world)"; (Sailey 1978:251) "among the people of his district there were those who called him "The Scholar Who Embraces Simplicity"."  Wu and Davis (1935:224) noted, "This name has been translated ''Old Sober-Sides'', but Dr. Wu considers that it has no satirical intent and would better be translated ''Solemn-Seeming Philosopher''." Fabrizio Pregadio (2006:2) translates "Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature".

==History==
Compared with many other Daoist texts, the origins of the ''Baopuzi'' are well documented. Ge completed the book during the Jianwu 建武 era (317–318), when [[Emperor Yuan of Jin]] founded the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and revised it during the Xianhe 咸和 era (326-334).

Ge Hong's autobiography (Outer Chapter 50) records writing the ''Baopuzi''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In my twenties I planned to compose some little things in order not to waste my time, for it seemed best to create something that would constitute the sayings of one sole thinker. This is when I outlined my philosophical writing, but it was also the moment when I became involved in armed rebellion and found myself wandering and scattered even farther afield, some of my things getting lost. Although constantly on the move, I did not abandon my brush again for a dozen or so years, so that at the age of 37 or 38 [A.D. 317-18] I found my work completed. In all, I have composed ''Nei p'ien'' in 20 scrolls, ''Wai p'ien'' in 50; … [list of other writings, totaling 310 scrolls] My ''Nei p'ien'', telling of gods and genii, prescriptions and medicines, ghosts and marvels, transformations, maintenance of life, extension of years, exorcising evils, and banishing misfortune, belongs to the Taoist school. My ''Wai p'ien'', giving an account of success and failure in human affairs and of good and evil in public affairs, belongs to the Confucian school. (tr. Ware 1966:17, cf. Sailey 1978:264)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare the more literal translation of Davis and Ch'en (1941:301), "I left off writing for ten and odd years, for I was constantly on the road, until the era Chien-wu 建武 (317-318 A.D.) when I got it ready."

Ge's autobiography mentions his military service fighting rebels against the Jin Dynasty, and successfully defending his hometown of Jurong 句容 (in modern [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]]). In 330 (tr. Ware 1966:20), [[Emperor Cheng of Jin]] granted Ge the fief of "Marquis of [[Guanzhong]]" with income from 200 Jurong households. Scholars believe Ge revised the ''Baopuzi'' during this period, sometime around 330 (Komjathy 2004:22) or 332 (Wu and Davis 1935:224).

The ''Baopuzi'' consists of 70 ''pian'' 篇 "chapters; books" divided between the 20 "Inner Chapters" and 50 "Outer Chapters" (cf. the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' textual division). [[Nathan Sivin]] (1969:389) described it as "not one book but two, considerably different in theme". The ''Neipian'' and ''Waipian'' "led entirely separate physical existences; they were not combined under a single title until a millennium after Ko's time".

The (1444–1445) [[Ming Dynasty]] ''[[Daozang]]'' "Daoist canon" first printed the two ''Baopuzi'' parts together. This ''Zhengtong Daozang'' 正統道藏 "Daoist Canon of the [[Zhengtong Emperor|Zhengtong]] Era (1436-1450)" bibliographically categorized the ''Baopuzi'' under the ''Taiqing'' 太清 "Supreme Clarity" section for alchemical texts. ''Daozang'' editions encompass six ''juan'' (卷 "scrolls; fascicles; volumes"), three each for the Inner and Outer Chapters. Most received versions of ''Baopuzi'' descend from this Ming ''Daozang'' text.

==Content==
The ''Baopuzi'' Inner and Outer Chapters discuss miscellaneous topics ranging from [[esotericism]] to [[social philosophy]]. The Inner Chapters discuss techniques of [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] 仙 "immortality; transcendence", [[Chinese alchemy]], meditation, [[Daoist yoga]], [[Daoyin]], [[Taoist sexual practices|sexual techniques]], [[Chinese herbology]], demons, and [[Fulu|''fu'']] 符 "magic talismans". The Outer Chapters discuss [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], government, politics, literature, scholarship, and include Ge's autobiography, which Waley (1930:10) called "the fullest document of this kind that early China produced".

According to Ge Hong's autobiography, he divided the Inner and Outer Chapters on the distinction between [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. Ge philosophically described Daoism as the ''ben'' 本 "root; trunk; origin" and Confucianism as the ''mo'' 末 "tip; branch; end" (Inner Chapter 10, tr. Ware 1966:165). When asked, "Which has the priority, Confucianism or Taoism?" – Baopuzi replies, "Taoism is the very trunk of Confucianism, but Confucianism is only a branch of Taoism."

While the ''Baopuzi'' Inner and Outer Chapters differ in content, they share a general format with an unnamed interlocutor posing questions and Ge Hong providing answers. The conventional syntax is ''Huowen yue'' 或問曰 "Someone asked, saying" and ''Baopuzi da yue'' 抱樸子答曰 "Baopuzi answered, saying".

===Inner Chapters===
The twenty ''Neipian'' "Inner Chapters" record arcane techniques for achieving ''xian'' "transcendence; immortality". These techniques span two types of Chinese alchemy that [[Tang Dynasty]] scholars later differentiated into ''[[neidan]]'' 內丹 "internal elixir; internal alchemy" and ''[[waidan]]'' 外丹 "external elixir; external alchemy". The word ''dan'' [[Wikt:丹|丹]] "[[cinnabar]]; red; pellet; [Chinese medicine] pill" means  "[[Pill of Immortality|pill of immortality]], or [[elixir of life]]. Ge Hong details his researches into the arts of transcendence and immortality. "Internal alchemy" concerns creating an "immortal body" within the corporeal body through both physiological methods (dietary, respiratory, sexual, etc.) and mental practices (meditation, visualization, etc.). "External" or "laboratory alchemy" concerns compounding elixirs (esp. from minerals and metals), writing ''fu'' talismans or amulets, herbalism, and exorcism.

Lai outlines the Inner Chapters subjects:
&lt;blockquote&gt; (1) proofs of the ''per se'' existence of immortals and transcendent states of immortality of the body; (2) stipulation of the accessibility to the perfect state of long life to everyone, irrespective of one's social status but dependent on whether one could study deeply and strenuously cultivate the necessary esoteric methods; (3) elaboration of diverse esoteric techniques leading one to become a ''hsien''-immortal; and (4) descriptions and criticism of the diverse contemporary Taoist discourses and sects. (1998:191-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several chapters have specific themes. Chapters 4, 8, 11, and 16 describe ''waidan'' "external alchemy". Inner Chapter 18 details meditation practices. In Chapter 19, Ge Hong praises his master Zheng Yin 鄭隱 (ca. 215-ca. 302), catalogues Daoist books, and lists talismans (see Ware 1966:379-385).

Many scholars have praised the Inner Chapters. [[Joseph Needham]] (1954:437), who called Ge Hong "the greatest alchemist in Chinese history", quoted the following passage about medicines from different biological categories.
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Interlocutor'': Life and death are predetermined by fate and their duration is normally fixed. Life is not something any medicine can shorten or lengthen. A finger that has been cut off cannot be joined on again and expected to continue growing. Blood from a wound, though swallowed, is of no benefit. Therefore, it is most inappropriate to approve of taking such nonhuman substances as pine or thuya [cypress] to protract the brief span of life. &lt;br&gt;
''Ko'': According to your argument, a thing is beneficial only if it belongs to the same category as that which is treated. … If we followed your suggestion and mistrusted things of a different type, we would be obliged to crush flesh and smelt bone to prepare a medicine for wounds, or to fry skin and roast hair to treat baldness. Water and soil are not of the same substance as the various plants; yet the latter rely upon them for growth. The grains are not of the same species as living men; yet living men need them in order to stay alive. Fat is not to be classed with fire, nor water with fish, yet when there is no more fat the fires dies, and when there is no more water, fish perish. (3, tr. Ware 1966:61-62) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Needham (1954:439) evaluated this passage, "Admittedly there is much in the ''Pao Phu Tzu'' which is wild, fanciful and superstitious, but here we have a discussion scientifically as sound as anything in Aristotle, and very much superior to anything which the contemporary occident could produce."

In addition to quoting early alchemical texts, the Inner Chapters describe Ge Hong's laboratory experiments. Wu and Davis mention  the ''Baopuzi'' formula for making [[mosaic gold]] "a golden crystalline powder used as a pigment" from ''chiyan'' 赤塩 "red crystal salt" (produced from [[amethyst]], [[calcite]] [[crystal]], and [[alum]]; Ware 1966:273) and ''huizhi'' 灰汁 "[[limewater]]".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The description of one process deserves special discussion, for it evidently concerns the preparation of stannic sulfide or "mosaic gold" and is perhaps the earliest known description of the preparation of this interesting substance. Mosaic gold exists in flakes or leaflets which have the color and the luster of gold, it does not tarnish, and is used at present for bronzing radiators, gilding picture frames and similar purposes. As Ko Hung describes the process, "tin sheets, each measuring six inches square by one and two-tenths inches thick, are covered with a one-tenth inch layer of a mud-like mixture of ''Ch'ih Yen'' (Red Salt) and ''Huei Chih'' (potash-water, limewater), ten pounds of tin to every four of ''Ch'ih Yen''." They are then heated in a sealed earthenware pot for thirty days with horse manure (probably with a smouldering fire of dried manure). "All the tin becomes ash like and interspersed with bean-like pieces which are the yellow gold." The large portion of the metallic tin is converted into some ash-like compound or possibly into the ash-like allotropic modification, gray tin. A small portion of the tin is converted into bean-sized aggregates of flaky stannic sulfide. The yield is poor, for the author says that "twenty ounces of gold are obtained from every twenty pounds of tin used." (1935:232) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The authors add, "It seems likely that Ko Hung was personally experienced in the chemistry of tin, for the Chinese say that he was the first to make [[tin foil]] and that he made magic or spirit money out of it."

===Outer Chapters===
The fifty ''Waipian'' "Outer Chapters" are more diffuse than the Inner ones. Ge Hong diversely wrote essays on Jin Dynasty issues in philosophy, morality, politics, and society. This ''Baopuzi'' portion details everyday problems among Han Dynasty northerners who fled into south China after the fall of [[Luoyang]].

Some of the Outer Chapters are thematically organized. Ge Hong wrote chapters 46, 47, and 48 to dispute three adversaries. Guo Tai 郭太 (128-169) founded of the ''[[Qingtan]]'' "pure conversation" school; Ni Heng 禰衡 (173-198) was an infamously arrogant official of [[Cao Cao]]; and [[Pao Ching-yen|Bao Jingyan]] 鮑敬言 (ca. 405-ca. 466) was an early anarchist philosopher.

==Translations==
The Chinese ''Baopuzi'' has been translated into English, Italian, German, and Japanese. There are more English translations of the twenty Inner Chapters than the fifty Outer Chapters.

The Inner Chapters have several partial translations. Tenney L. Davis, professor of organic chemistry at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], collaborated on first translations of the Inner Chapters relevant to the [[history of alchemy]]. Wu and Davis (1935) translated chapters 4 "On the Gold Medicine" and 16 "On the Yellow and White" (i.e., gold and silver). Davis and Ch'en (1941) translated chapters 8 "Overcoming Obstructions" and 11 "On ''hsien'' Medicines", and provided paraphrases or summaries of the remaining Inner Chapters. The French sinologist Eugene Feifel made English translations of chapters 1-3 (1941), 4 (1944), and 11 (1946). More recently, excerpts from the Inner Chapters are quoted by Verellen (1999) and Pregadio (2006).

The Inner Chapters have one complete translation by James R. Ware (1966), which also includes Ge Hong's autobiography from Outer Chapter 50 (1966:6-21). Several reviewers censured the quality of Ware's translation, for instance, Kroll (1982:139) called it "at times misguided". Huard's and Wong's (1968) critical assessment of Ware was criticized in turn by Sivin (1969:388). "Their review, nonetheless, can only be described as perfunctory. Only the forematter and endmatter of Ware's book are evaluated, and that in a curiously cursory fashion."

Translating the fundamental Daoist word ''[[Tao|Dao]]'' or ''Tao'' "way; path; principle" as English ''[[God]]'' is a conspicuous peculiarity of Ware's ''Baopuzi'' version. The Introduction gives a convoluted Christian justification, first quoting J.J.L. Duyvendak's translation of ''[[Daodejing]]'' 25, "Its rightful name I do not know, but I give It the sobriquet ''Tao'' (= God). If a rightful name is insisted upon, I would call It Maximal." 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, upon noticing that ''Tao Te Ching'', verse 34, is willing to call the Something "Minimal," every schoolman would have understood that the Chinese author was talking about God, for only in God do contraries become identical! Accordingly, the present translator will always render this use of the term Tao by ''God''. In doing so, he keeps always in mind as the one and only definition the equation establishable from ''Exod''. 3:13-15 and ''Mark'' 12:26-27, to mention only two very clear statements. It will be recalled that in the first God says, "My name is I am, I live, I exist," while the second reads, "God is not of the dead but of the living." Therefore, God = Life or Being. (1966:1-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ware admitted his ''God'' for ''Dao'' translation cannot be applied consistently.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that the word ''tao'' appears frequently in this text not as a designation of God but of the process by which God is to be approximated or attained. In such cases I shall translate it as "the divine process." In instances where either this or "God" would be appropriate, a translator is obliged to be arbitrary. The term ''tao shih'' is rendered "processor"; ''hsien'' is translated "genie" rather than "immortal". (1966:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These Chinese words are ''daoshi'' [[Wikt:道士|道士]] "Daoist priest; Daoist practitioner" and [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] [[Wikt:仙|仙]] "immortal; transcendent". Ho Peng-Yoke, an authority in the [[History of science and technology in China]], criticized Ware's mistranslations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be true that in certain areas the concept of Tao overlaps with the definition and attributes of God, or for that matter with those of Allah, for example oneness and eternity. However, there is the danger of the analogy being pushed too far. Similarly, the reader might be warned that "Genii," as used for rendering the word ''hsien'', does not convey the concept of some supernatural slaves as found in the lamp and the ring of the ''Thousand-and-One Nights''. The reviewer prefers the terminology used by Tenny L. Davis, i.e. ''Tao'' left untranslated and "immortal" for ''hsien''. (1967:145) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nevertheless, Ho's review concluded with praise. "Professor Ware is to be congratulated for bringing out the translation of a most difficult Chinese Taoist text in a very readable form. One cannot find another text that gives so much useful and authoritative information on alchemy and Taoism in fourth-century China."

Ge Hong wrote the ''Baopuzi'' in elegant [[Classical Chinese grammar]] and terminology, but some Inner Chapter contexts are difficult to translate. Comparing three versions of this passage listing ''xian'' medicines illustrates the translational choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The best ''hsien'' medicine is cinnabar. Others in the order of decreasing excellence are gold, silver, ''chih'', the five jades, mica, pearl, realgar, ''t'ai i yü yü liang'', ''shih chung huang tzu'' 石中黄子 (literally yellow nucleus in stone), ''shih kuei'' 石桂 (stony cinnamon), quartz, ''shih nao'' 石腦, ''shih liu huang'' 石硫黄 (a kind of raw sulfur), wild honey and ''tseng ch'ing''. (11, tr. Davis and Ch'en 1941:311) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Medicines of superior quality for immortality are: cinnabar; next comes gold, then follows silver, then the many ''chih'', then the five kinds of jade, then mica, then ''ming-chu'', then realgar, then brown hematite, then conglomerate masses of brown hematite, then stone cassia (?), then quartz, then paraffin, then sulphur, then wild honey, then malachite (stratified variety) (tr. Feifel 1946:2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the top of the genie's pharmacopoeia stands cinnabar. Second comes gold; third, silver, fourth, excresences; fifth, the jades; sixth, mica; seventh, pearls; eighth, realgar; ninth, brown hematite; tenth, conglomerated brown hematite; eleventh, quartz; twelfth, rock crystal; thirteenth, geodes; fourteenth, sulphur; fifteenth, wild honey; and sixteenth, laminar malachite. (tr. Ware 1966:178) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Baoppuzi'' Outer Chapters have one partial translation into English. Jay Sailey (1978) translated 21 of the 50 chapters: 1, 3, 5, 14-15, 20, 24-26, 30-34, 37, 40, 43-44, 46-47, and 50. In addition, Sailey (1978:509-545) included appendices on "Buddhism and the ''Pao-p'u-tzu''", "Biography of Ko Hung" from the ''[[Jin Shu]]'', and "Recensions" of lost ''Baopuzi'' fragments quoted in later texts. Kroll (1982:139) gave a mixed review, "Although Sailey's renderings frequently obscure Ko Hung's carefully polished diction and nuance, they reliably convey the sense of the original and should be a substantial boon to Western students of medieval Chinese thought and culture."

==Significance==
For centuries, traditional scholars have revered the ''Baopuzi'' as a canonical Daoist scripture – but in recent years, modern scholars have reevaluated the text.

Traditional scholarship viewed the ''Baopuzi'', especially the Inner Chapters, as a primary textual source for early Chinese ''waidan'' "external alchemy". Wu and Davis described it as, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;probably the widest known and highest regarded of the ancient Chinese treatises on alchemy. It has been preserved for us as part of the Taoist canon. It shows us the art matured by five or six centuries of practice, having its traditional heroes and an extensive literature, its technique and philosophy now clearly fixed, its objectives and pretentions established. This art the author examines in a hardheaded manner and expounds in language which is remarkably free from subterfuge. (1935:221) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Arthur Waley]] praised Ge Hong's rational attitude toward alchemy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nowhere in Pao P'u Tzu's book do we find the hierophantic tone that pervades most writings on alchemy both in the East and in the West. He uses a certain number of secret terms, such as 金公 "metal-lord" and 河車 "river chariot", both of which mean lead; and 河上她女 "the virgin on the river", which means mercury … But his attitude is always that of a solidly educated layman examining claims which a narrow-minded orthodoxy had dismissed with contempt. (1930:13) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the estimation of Ho (1967:145), the ''Baopuzi'' is a "more important" alchemical text than [[Wei Boyang]]'s (ca. 142) ''[[Cantong qi]]'' 參同契 "The Kinship of the Three". The ''Baopuzi'' mentions a ''Neijing'' 內經 "Inner Classic" by Wei Boyang, but curiously does not mention Wei's ''Cantong ji''.

Modern scholarship has taken another look at the ''Baopuzi''. Sivin demeans the text's significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inner Chapters are anything but the writings of a Taoist man of wisdom or organizer for his disciples or for other initiates. This book is a vast trove of commonplaces and hearsay about popular beliefs in which Ko's few incontestably Taoist texts play an essential but small part. Its goal is not to catalogue, synthesize, or provide a handbook of techniques. It is rather a dialogue in which Ko hurls scattershot against a skeptical anonymous interlocutor. The Inner Chapters are a one-issue book. Ko seeks to convince his questioner, and thereby his readers, that immortality is a proper object of study and is attainable – not only by the ancients but in his own time, not only by a destined few but by anyone with enough faith to undertake arduous and dangerous disciplines. The devotion that Ko calls for implies wholesale acceptance of legends, myths, tales of prodigies, magical beliefs, religious faiths – practically every belief current in the popular imagination of Ko's time and the inverse in almost every sense of what "fundamentalist Confucian" humanists considered worthy of thought (but then they were no longer setting the intellectual style). (1978:345) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sivin sarcastically compares Ge Hong, "an obsessed bookman and indiscriminate lore-collector", with [[Alan Watts]]. "Ko's style was rather than of a pedantic purveyor of occultism to the upper class. I can only think of him as the Alan Watts of his time."  However, James Benn (2003:139) observes, "This judgement is perhaps not as damning as Professor Sivin intended. Certainly, one would not now go to Watts in the hope of learning much about Taoism, but a close study of his work would tell us a great deal about perceptions and presuppositions concerning Asian religions in mid-twentieth century America. Like Watts and others of his generation it is true that Ge Hong did see religion as a personal matter, and he seems to have approached it from the point of view of a fan or enthusiast more than as an initiate."

Chi-Tim Lai (1998:199) interprets the Inner Chapters as a "new discourse" on ''xian''-immortality through personal salvation and perfection, contrasting with the traditional "imperial discourse" that only the rich could afford ''xian''-hood. For example, histories record that both [[Qin Shi Huang]] and [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched imperial naval expeditions to obtain the "elixir of immortality" from mythical [[Mount Penglai]]. "That is, an individual's self-perfection is only dependent upon ascetic, mystic, and ethical behavior. Since it is a new religious discourse supposedly open to all people, the quest for a prolonged life is no longer the preserve of the wealthy and powerful."
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Ko Hung, the ''hsien''-immortals who can achieve the complete avoidance of death rarely come from the social groups of worthies, emperors, or sages. Hence, he implies that ''hsien''-immortality are distinctive "human" ideal values to be pursued and potentially achieved by anyone. In the first, in order to differentiate the ideal values of ''hsien''-immortal from this worldly worthies and powers, Ko Hung says, "Those who attained immortal were almost all poor and lowly. They were not men of position and power."' Second, in placing the ideal of ''hsien''-immortality out of the reach of imperial figures, Ko Hung rebukes emperors such as the First Emperor of the Ch'in and Emperor Han-wu-ti, who were "models" of seeking for immortality in ancient Chinese history and literature, by saying, "These two emperors had a hollow reputation for wanting immortality, but they never experienced the reality of cultivating the Tao." (Lai 1998:210) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ge Hong quotes his teacher Zheng Yin explaining that poverty forces ''daoshi'' "Daoist practitioners" seeking ''xian'' techniques to engage in the difficulties and dangers of alchemy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then I asked further, "Why should we not eat the gold and silver which are already in existence instead of taking the trouble to make them? What are made will not be real gold and silver but just make-believes."

Said Cheng Chun in reply, "The gold and silver which are found in the world are suitable for the purpose. But ''Tao-shih'' are all poor; witness the adage that ''Hsien'' are never stout and ''Tao-shih'' never rich. ''Tao-shih'' usually go in groups of five or ten, counting the teacher and his disciples. Poor as they are, how can they be expected to get the necessary gold and silver? Furthermore they cannot cover the great distances to gather the gold and silver which occur in nature. The only thing left for them to do is to make the metals themselves". (16, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:260-1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ware (1966:268) translates this adage, "There are no fat genii and no rich processors".

For a wealthy person seeking ''xian''-transcendence, Ge Hong recommends compounding ''jinye'' 金液 (lit. "gold liquid/fluid") "golden liquor" in a ''huachi'' 花池 (lit. "flower pond") "a vinegar solvent" (fortified with [[saltpeter]]; Ware 1966:347). This is simpler to produce than traditional ''jiuding'' 九鼎 "nine tripods" elixirs (attributed to the [[Yellow Emperor]]), but expensive – eight doses cost 400,000 [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;True it is that the nine medicines are the best of ''Hsien'' medicines. Yet the materials for their compounding are quite numerous. They are easily procurable only in large cities which have good facilities for communication, but are not to be obtained at other places. Furthermore, in the compounding of the medicines, the fires should be tended for tens of days and nights with industrious application and close adjustment, which is a great difficulty. The compounding of the Gold Fluid is much easier. There the only thing which is difficult is to get the gold. One pound in the old measure is equivalent to two in our contemporary measure. Such a quantity of gold would cost only some three hundred thousand cash. The other auxiliary materials are easy to procure. In the compounding, no fire is required. All that needs to be done is to have the mixture in a ''Hua Ch'ih'' (Flower Pond) for the necessary number of days. A total expenditure of four hundred thousand cash will make an amount large enough to transform eight persons into ''Hsien''. Just as no wine is formed by the fermentation of small quantities of rice, so small quantities of materials will not be able to interact to give the medicine. (4, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:251) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pregadio (2006:215) says recent studies show Ge's intent was "glorifying the religious and ritual legacy of [[Jiangnan]] 江南 (the region south of the lower Yangzi River), emphasizing the superiority of certain traditions over others, and enhancing their prestige among the social elite to which Ge Hong belonged." Nonetheless, Pregadio concludes, &lt;blockquote&gt;Ge Hong's testimony deserves attention as a valuable overview of the religious traditions of Jiangnan just before the Way of the Celestial Masters ([[Tianshi dao]]) spread to that area, soon followed by the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] revelations. From this point of view, the ''Baopu zi'' documents important links between the earlier and later history of Taoism, as it also does for medicine and other fields. (2006:217) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Coda''' is a group of [[fictional]] female [[warrior]]s in [[Wildstorm]] [[comic book|comics]]. The Coda first appeared in ''[[WildC.A.T.S.]]'' volume 1 #1 (August, 1992) and were created by [[Brandon Choi]] and [[Jim Lee]]. 

==Fictional background==
The Coda are a particular race of all female aliens who live on the planet Khera. They are trained in their own unique form of martial arts. Their weapon of choice is the Clef Blade, a weapon resembling a harpoon or a lance, though they often wield swords or even modern firearms. Coda warriors usually wear red markings on their face.  A sign (usually a circle) on the forehead and stripes on the cheeks) depicting their ranking within the sisterhood. A second class group of Coda warriors of different species have formed on various planets, carrying the blood of original Coda warriors only.

===Khera===
The Coda was founded on the planet Khera, home to the [[Kherubim]]. The Kherubim were a race blessed with longevity, but the downside was that they had become nearly infertile. Childbirth was a great honor and therefore every Kheran had to participate in a ritual in which a Kheran female and a Kheran male had to couple once. Should the female become pregnant and give birth, she would go on to become a priestess. Otherwise she could do with her life as she pleased. [[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Lady Zannah]] had been selected to mate with [[Mister Majestic|Majestros]] and their union did result in childbirth, the child [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Kenesha]]. Zannah, though, loved being a warrior; so her mother, Harmony, proposed a plan: She would tell her people that Zannah's child had died, and would raise Kenesha as her own daughter. Zannah accepted, and Harmony became a figure of legend, the only Kherubim to have given birth to more than one child in ages. This legend was the foundation of the Sisterhood known as the Coda, a completely female [[caste]] of warriors, devoted to the honor of combat. Their male counterpart is known as the Brotherhood of the Sword. Over the millennia, the Coda would grow in power, and at present they are the second largest political faction within Kherubim society. Only the Pantheon is slightly larger. The Coda's headquarters is Zealot's former home, the Tower of Red Lament. Among the Coda on Khera, there is a small cell of elite assassins called the Skein. They have no known counterpart among the Earthborn Coda. The first rule of The Coda is: ''The weapon is the extension of the flesh, the flesh of the mind, the mind of the soul''.

===Earth===
The Kherubim were at war with the [[Daemonite]]s, another spacefaring race. During a ship-to-ship combat, a Kheran and a Daemonite vessel crashlanded on Earth. Both Zannah and Kenesha were on board this vessel. The Kherubim were physically identical to humans and quickly integrated within human society, inspiring tales of superhuman heroes, gods and angels. The Daemonites had the ability to possess human hosts and inspired tales of possession, demons and monsters. Their war continued underground. 

To aid them in their war, Zannah, now called Zealot and two of her fellow Coda generals, Andromache and Artemis, started training human Coda Warriors, giving birth to the myth of the Amazons. They established a hidden Coda city on Mt. Themyscira in [[Greece]]. Kenesha took the name [[Savant (Wildstorm)|Savant]], but had no desire to join the Coda. As the Earthborn sisterhood are not born immortals, the immortal members take part in a ''Blood Dance'' with the newer members worthy of being called Coda Warriors. In the ritual they cut each other in a ritualistic dance and rub each other's wounds, thus mingling the blood, transferring the immortal blood into the non-immortal. The blood of a Kherubim, mingled with a human's during a special ritual, gave the gift of longevity to normal humans and this became an important ritual for Earth's Coda. The Kheran Coda sisterhood have been shown to perform this ritual also, but as they are all immortal, their reasons have more to do with the symbolic than with the need for survival. The Coda's Cleft Blades, both on Khera and on Earth, are considered very sacred to the sisterhood. They are only to be used in a death duel or in their ritual Blood Dance. During a battle near Troy (presumably the [[Trojan War]]), Zealot's actions branded her as a traitor to the rest of the Coda, to be killed on sight. The Coda general Andromache took over the role of [[Majestrix]]. Under her rule the Coda began selling their skills to the highest bidders and became less noble warriors and more power hungry conquerors. They also began establishing smaller Coda bases around the world. Though Mt. Themyscira still proved to be the oldest and most sacred of homes to the Amazons, the Coda have also been shown to reside in a massive island off the coast of Africa which they refer to as the Coda Citadel, as discovered by members of [[Gen¹³]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gen¹³'' (vol. 2), #3-5&lt;/ref&gt;  As Zealot was seen as a traitor to the sisterhood, she became a constant target of The Coda for several centuries.

[[Image:CodaWarrior.JPG|thumb|[[Zealot (Wildstorm)|Zealot]] displays standard Coda weapons, such as the Cleft Blade]]
In the mid 20th century, Zealot trained [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] in the fighting style of the Coda, making him the first male Coda. When the Coda discovered this they marked Grifter a target for extermination as they believed the Coda ways are only to be carried by women. By now many Coda were working for the Cabal, an organisation founded by the Daemonites. Zealot, Grifter and Savant all were part of the [[WildC.A.T.s]] and Zealot also eventually trained WildC.A.T.s member [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] in the Coda martial arts. The WildC.A.T.s and Coda fought often. The WildC.A.T.s returned once to Khera where Zealot was nearly assassinated by her own Coda Sisters, just to make her a martyr for their cause. Zealot was disgusted with the Sisters betrayal of their ideals and returned to Earth with the other WildC.A.T.s.

Several months later on Earth, Zealot apparently died on a mission causing the WildC.A.T.s to disband. She decided that the actions of the Coda on Earth and on Khera proved that the Coda had become corrupt and decided that the corruption had to be destroyed. She set out to single-handedly erase the Coda from the face of the Earth. She killed all Coda in America she could find, but spared Grifter, because of their shared romantic past. She warned him not to follow her.

Zealot continued her quest in Europe and destroyed most of the Coda there, but was captured by their top agent, The Grand Sarin. Grifter gathered several allies to save her, resulting in a war between his forces and the Coda. In the end, his small group turned out not to be enough, but Grifter called in the help of former WildC.A.T.s member and his current employer, [[Spartan (comics)|Jack Marlowe]], who used his powers to teleport part of the Mediterranean Sea on top of the Coda, drowning many of them. Majestrix Andromache survived and with her surviving troops she faced Grifter and his friends. At the same time FBI-agent Chandler, whose partner had been killed by the Coda, had found the Coda's armory. Chandler detonated the armory, blowing up the entire Coda base. Grifter and his friends were teleported away by Marlowe in time, but Andromache and her soldiers were caught in the blast.

Currently there are only few Earth-born Coda left. Majestrix Andromache was among the Coda fighting Grifter and his allies and died in the explosion. Recently, in the pages of ''Majestic'', [[Mister Majestic]] and Zealot have encountered Kherubim Coda Warriors on Earth. Also the Coda-traitor Charis (known as [[Nemesis (Wildstorm)|Nemesis]]) recently joined forces with the former WildC.A.T.s in the pages of ''Wildcats: Nemesis''. During the ''Wildstorm Armageddon'' story line The few remaining Coda were gathered up by the thought long dead Devin, formerly excommunicated acolyte of their order who survived into obscurity until the end of the world occurred. Gathering up the few remaining Coda survivors of the Post Apocalyptic world to create her own sisterhood, with her as Majestrix, which expanded its numbers through the weary travelers and soccer moms looking for safe respite that only her sect could provide, all while keeping any capable males captured as breeding labor in order to proliferate their ranks; Devin would eventually come into conflict with a past [[Caitlin Fairchild]] and her weathered survivor friends of [[Gen 13]].

==Notable members==
*Andromache, Kheran Majestrix of the Coda on Earth. Presumed dead.

A '''cosmology episode''' is a sudden loss of meaning, followed eventually by a transformative pivot, which creates the conditions for revised meaning.

In the wake of the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[Vietnam War]], the 1977 [[Tenerife airport disaster]], the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal chemical disaster]], and the relatively sudden insertion of [[personal computers]] into the workplace, organizational scholar [[Karl E. Weick]] coined the term "cosmology episode," as follows, in 1985:

"Representations of events normally hang together sensibly within the set of assumptions that give them life and constitute a 'cosmos' rather than its opposite, a 'chaos.'  Sudden losses of meaning that can occur when an event is represented electronically in an incomplete, cryptic form are what I call a 'cosmology episode.'  Representations in the electronic world can become chaotic for at least two reasons:  The data in these representations are flawed, and the people who manage those flawed data have limited processing capacity.  These two problems interact in a potentially deadly vicious circle."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1985.  Cosmos vs. Chaos:  Sense and Nonsense in Electronic Contexts.  Organizational Dynamics, 14 (Autumn): 50-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of cosmology episodes evolved significantly between 1985 and 1993, when Weick published his now-classic reanalysis of [[Norman Maclean]]'s study of the [[Mann Gulch fire|Mann Gulch wildland firefighting disaster]] in 1949.  In the 1993 article, Weick positions cosmology episodes within a [[constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] [[ontology]], he links the term to a variety of similar concepts, and he provides a better-developed definition than he was able to provide in 1985.

First, Weick makes it clear that cosmology episodes occur within a constructivist ontology of the world, rather than the more familiar [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist]] and [[subjectivist]] ontologies:

"The basic idea of [[sensemaking]] is that reality is an ongoing accomplishment that emerges from efforts to create order and make retrospective sense of what occurs....  Sensemaking emphasizes that people try to make things rationally accountable to themselves and others.  Thus, in the words of Morgan, Frost, and Pondy (1983: 24), "individuals are not seen as living in, and acting out their lives in relations ''to'', a wider reality, so much as creating and sustaining images of a wider reality, in part to rationalize what they are doing.  They realize their reality by 'reading into' their situation patterns of significant meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, Weick clarifies the key phrase "sudden loss of meaning" by linking it to related ideas described by other organizational scholars:

"Minimal organizations, such as we find in the crew at Mann Gulch, are susceptible to sudden losses of meaning, which have been variably described as fundamental surprises (Reason, 1990) or as events that are inconceivable (Lanir, 1989), hidden (Westrum, 1982), or incomprehensible (Perrow, 1984).  Each of these labels points to the low probability that the event could occur, which is why it is meaningless.  But these explanations say less about the astonishment of the perceiver, and even less about the perceiver's inability to rebuild some sense of what is happening."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, Weick expands his 1985 definition -- "sudden losses of meaning"—to a more nuanced description:

"Cosmology refers to a branch of philosophy often subsumed under metaphysics that combines rational speculation and scientific evidence to understand the universe as a totality of phenomena.  Cosmology is the ultimate macro perspective, directed at issues of time, space, change, and contingency as they relate to the origin and structure of the universe.  Integrations of these issues, however, are not just the handiwork of philosophers.  Others also must make their peace with these issues, as reflected in what they take for granted.  People, including those who are smokejumpers, act as if events cohere in time and space and that change unfolds in an orderly manner.  These everyday cosmologies are subject to disruption.  And when they are severely disrupted, I call this a cosmology episode (Weick, 1985: 51-52).  A cosmology episode occurs when people suddenly and deeply feel that the universe is no longer a rational, orderly system."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catastrophic Cosmology Episodes ==
Building on Weick's 1993 definition of cosmology episodes, Weick, his colleagues, and other researchers have advanced knowledge of best practices during cosmology episodes at four levels of analysis:  (1) catastrophic cosmology episodes, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001 and the Haitian earthquake of 2010; (2) disastrous cosmology episodes, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 Hurricane Katrina; (3) contextualized cosmology episodes occurring within specific domains, such as the 1976 Three Mile Island nuclear system incident and the 1970 [[Apollo 13]] space system incident; and (4) everyday cosmology episodes, such as transition of leaders at the top of an organization and the introduction of new technologies throughout an organization.

The study of cosmology episodes is distinct from the study of high-reliability organizations because the concept directs explicit attention to the integral role of human spirituality during catastrophic events—as the threatened entity (what now is my role in the universe?), the source of inspiration/improvisation (what now am I able to do to respond to the event?), and the re-established entity (what now is my different role in the universe?).  Consequently, the topic of cosmology episodes lends itself to study by researchers within two small academic organizations—the American Psychological Association's Division 36 (Psychology of Religion and Spirituality) and the Academy of Management's MSR Division (Management, Spirituality, and Religion).

== Disastrous Cosmology Episodes ==
A 2016 article titled "Cosmology Episodes:  A Reconceptualization," Doug Orton and Kari O'Grady identified three taxonomies that they found helpful in studying 164 citations of the term "cosmology episode" on Google Scholar.  One taxonomy was based on level of analysis (nation, community, organization, team, and individual).  One taxonomy was based on five resilience processes (anticipating, sense-losing, improvising, sense-remaking, and renewing).  The third taxonomy -- of interest here -- is level of intensity of the cosmology episode (catastrophe, disaster, crisis, ancillary, and metaphorical).  Communications researchers tend to be more present in the study of community disasters; management researchers tend to be more present in the study of organizational crises.  Importantly, though, it is possible for a community-level cosmology episode to be catastrophic (e.g. Hurrican Katrina), disastrous (e.g the Red River floods of 1997), a crisis (e.g. the 22 July 2005 Stockwell Subway Shooting), ancillary (e.g. an e coli epidemic for a food company), and metaphorical (e.g. the introduction of new technology in an Italian courtroom).

'''''Creatures 3''''' is the third game in the ''[[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]]'' [[artificial life|a-life]] game series made by [[Creature Labs]]. In this installment, the [[Shee (Creatures)|Shee]] have left Albia in a spaceship, the Shee Ark, to search for a more spherical world. The Ark was abandoned by the Shee because a meteor hit the ship, but the infrastructure still remains in working order.

There are 6 main "[[Closed ecological system|metarooms]]" on the ship; the Norn Terranium, Grendel Jungle, Ettin Desert, Marine area, Bridge, and Engineering Room. The [[Norn (Creatures)|Norn]] Terranium is where you can safely hatch and raise your norns. The Grendel Jungle is where the [[Grendel]] mother (egg-layer) is, and it is well suited for Grendels. The Ettin Desert is where the [[Ettin (Creatures)|Ettin]] mother is; it is a dry, harsh environment for all creatures. The Bridge is where you will find the most gadgets, and also the most Ettins. The Engineering Room is where the Agent Creator is, with which you can create objects for your world.

Grendels are now vicious, unlike the original ''Creatures'' Grendels; these Grendels enjoy hunting down, and then killing norns. The Ettins, which first appeared in ''[[Creatures 2]]'', love gathering gadgets and taking them back to the Ettin Desert.

Creatures 3 runs on the CAOS engine, making it highly moddable, but now it is retired and outdated.

{{other uses|DOA (disambiguation)}}
{{unreferenced|date=November 2016}}
'''Dead on arrival''' ('''DOA'''), also '''dead in the field''' and '''brought in dead''' ('''BID''') indicates that a patient was found to be already [[Clinical death|clinically dead]] upon the arrival of professional medical assistance, often in the form of [[first responder]]s such as [[emergency medical technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s, or [[police]].

In some jurisdictions, first responders must consult verbally with a [[physician]] before officially pronouncing a patient deceased, but once [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] is initiated, it must be continued until a physician can pronounce the patient dead.

==Medical DOA==
When presented with a patient, medical professionals are required to perform [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) unless specific conditions are met which allow them to pronounce the patient as deceased. In most places, these are examples of such criteria:
* Injuries not compatible with life. These include but are not necessarily limited to [[decapitation]] or other catastrophic brain trauma, [[incineration]], severed body, and injuries that do not permit effective administration of CPR. If a patient has sustained such injuries, it should be intuitively obvious that the patient is non-viable. 
* ''[[Rigor mortis]]'', indicating that the patient has been dead for at least a few hours. ''Rigor mortis'' can sometimes be difficult to determine, so it is often used reported along with other determining factors.
* Obvious [[Decomposition#Stages of decomposition|decomposition]].
* ''[[Livor mortis]]'' (lividity), indicating that the body has been pulseless and in the same position long enough for blood to sink and collect within the body, creating purplish discolorations at the lowest points of the body (with respect to [[gravity]]).
* [[Stillbirth]]. If it can be determined without a doubt that an infant died prior to birth, as indicated by skin blisters, an unusually soft head, and an extremely offensive odor, resuscitation should not be attempted. If there is even the slightest hope that the infant is viable, CPR should be initiated; some jurisdictions maintain that life-saving efforts should be attempted on all infants to assure parents that [[Futile care|all possible actions were performed to save their child, futile as the medical professionals may have known them to be]]. 
* Identification of valid [[do not resuscitate]] orders.

This list may not be a comprehensive picture of medical practice in all jurisdictions or conditions. For example, it may not represent the standard of care for patients with terminal diseases such as advanced cancer. In addition, jurisdictions such as [[Texas]] permit withdrawal of medical care from patients who are deemed unlikely to recover. {{further|Texas Futile Care Law}}

Regardless of the patient, a pronouncement of [[death]] must always be made with absolute certainty and only after it has been determined that the patient is not a candidate for resuscitation. This type of decision is rather sensitive and can be difficult to make.

Legal definitions of death vary from place to place; for example, irreversible brain-stem death, prolonged [[clinical death]],  etc.

==Colloquial use==
*When, as with computers, product complexity is high and diagnostics are involved, the medical metaphor is perhaps appropriate, as [[boot image control|complex diagnostics]] might be required to determine if the product "is really dead".
*In another context, "dead on arrival" may be used to describe an idea or product that is considered to be fundamentally flawed, and therefore viewed as an utter failure from the start.

Death – particularly the death of [[human]]s – has commonly been considered a [[sadness|sad]] or unpleasant occasion, due to the [[affection]] for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial [[human bonding|bonds]] with the deceased. Other concerns include [[death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[necrophobia]], [[anxiety]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], [[grief]], [[emotional pain]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], [[solitude]], or [[saudade]]. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an [[afterlife]], and also hold the idea of [[Heaven|reward]] or [[Judgement (afterlife)|judgement]] and [[Hell|punishment for past sin]].

== Etymology ==
The word death comes from [[Old English]] ''dēaþ'', which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *''dauþuz'' (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *''dheu-'' meaning the "process, act, condition of dying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |title=Death |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013162848/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated terms ==
[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
The concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death.  When a person has died, it is also said they have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', ''expired'', or are ''gone'', among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a ''corpse'', ''[[cadaver]]'', a ''body'', a ''set of remains'', and when all flesh has rotted away, a [[skeleton]]. The terms ''[[carrion]]'' and ''carcass'' can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals.  As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the [[participle]] form of "decease", as in ''the deceased''; another noun form is ''decedent''.  The ashes left after a [[cremation]] are sometimes referred to by the [[neologism]] ''cremains'', a [[portmanteau]] of "cremation" and "remains".

== Senescence ==
[[File:Dead magpie.jpg|thumb|alt=A dead magpie|A dead [[Eurasian magpie]]]]

[[Senescence]] refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick &amp; Moody, 2003).

Almost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as "senescence". Some organisms experience [[negligible senescence]], even exhibiting [[biological immortality]].  These include the jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |title=Turritopsis nutricula (Immortal jellyfish) |publisher=Jellyfishfacts.net |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163459/http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |archivedate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]], and the [[planarian]]. Unnatural causes of death include [[suicide]] and [[homicide]]. From all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aubrey D.N.J |first=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations |journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology |volume=1 |issue=1, Article 5 |year=2007 |url=http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011 |accessdate=20 March 2009 |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163622/http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90%, i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt;

[[Physiological]] death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crippen |first=David |website=Scientific American Surgery, Critical Care, April 2005 |url=http://www.sciamsurgery.com/sciamsurgery/institutional/payPerAdd.action?chapterId=part08_ch10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624132446/http://www.acssurgery.com/abstracts/acs/acs0812.htm |archivedate=24 June 2006 |title=Brain Failure and Brain Death |accessdate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of [[vital signs]]. In general, [[clinical death]] is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of [[legal death]]. A patient with working [[human heart|heart]] and [[human lung|lungs]] determined to be [[brain death|brain dead]] can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring. As [[science|scientific knowledge]] and [[medicine]] advance, formulating a precise medical definition of death becomes more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life Death Whatever |first=Alexander |last=Artishevsky |publisher=Createspace |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4495-9420-6 }}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signs===
Signs of death or strong indications that a [[endotherm|warm-blooded animal]] is no longer alive are:
* [[Respiratory arrest]] (no [[breathing]])
* [[Cardiac arrest]] (no [[heart rate|pulse]])
* [[Brain death]] (no neuronal activity)
* {{lang|la|[[Pallor mortis]]}}, paleness which happens in the 15–120 minutes after death
* {{lang|la|[[Livor mortis]]}}, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
* {{lang|la|[[Algor mortis]]}}, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
* {{lang|la|[[Rigor mortis]]}}, the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin ''rigor'') and difficult to move or manipulate
* [[Decomposition]], the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |publisher=''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life. This general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicine.

It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see WP:CITE) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} In this context "death" describes merely the state where something has ceased, for example, life. Thus, the definition of "life" simultaneously defines death.

Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.

The category of "brain death" is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: "By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant "brain-dead" women)."&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616–620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&amp;nbsp;– irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&amp;nbsp;– has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].

Even by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

The death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.
A [[death certificate]] is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.

[[File:Wiertz burial.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Wiertz]]'s painting of a man buried alive]]
There are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then "coming back to life", sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when [[embalming]] procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before [[burial]], ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the [[rectum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|pp=56,&amp;nbsp;71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in [[England]] and [[Wales]], although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of [[electric shock]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned [[nerve]]s to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an [[emergency department|emergency room]].&lt;ref name=Limmer&gt;{{cite book|title=Brady Emergency Care AHA |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-159390-9 |author=Limmer, Dan; O'Keefe, Michael F.; Bergeron, J.

As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be re-evaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. Therefore, the concept of information-theoretic death&lt;ref name="InfoDeath"&gt;{{cite web

There have been some scientific attempts to bring dead organisms back to life, but with limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/28/blood-swapping-reanimates-dead-dogs/ |title=Blood Swapping Reanimates Dead Dogs |newspaper=Fox News |date=28 June 2005 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014135940/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/28/blood-swapping-reanimates-dead-dogs.html |archivedate=14 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--to find this if it goes dead: original url http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,160903,00.html--&gt; In [[science fiction]] [[scenario]]s where such technology is readily available, real death is distinguished from reversible death.

{{See also|List of causes of death by rate|List of preventable causes of death}}

The leading cause of human death in [[developing countries]] is [[infectious disease]]. The leading causes in [[developed countries]] are [[atherosclerosis]] ([[heart disease]] and [[stroke]]), [[cancer]], and other diseases related to [[obesity]] and [[aging]]. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging,&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; leading to various complications known as [[aging-associated diseases]]. These conditions cause loss of [[homeostasis]], leading to [[cardiac arrest]], causing loss of [[oxygen]] and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the [[Human brain|brain]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, approaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011" /&gt; With improved medical capability, dying has become [[respite care|a condition to be managed]]. Home deaths, once commonplace, are now rare in the developed world.

According to [[Jean Ziegler]] ([[United Nations]] Special Reporter on the Right to Food, 2000 – Mar 2008), mortality due to [[malnutrition]] accounted for 58% of the total mortality rate in 2006.

Many leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[physical fitness|physical activity]], but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human [[longevity]]. The [[evolution of aging|evolutionary cause of aging]] is, at best, only just beginning to be understood.

[[Hans Selye|Selye]] proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that [[Stress (biology)|stress]] decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource, ''adaptation energy''. The animal dies when this resource is exhausted.&lt;ref name="SelyeAE2"&gt;Selye, H. (1938). Experimental evidence supporting the conception of "adaptation energy", Am. J. Physiol. 123 (1938), 758–765.&lt;/ref&gt; Selye assumed that  the adaptability is a finite supply, presented at birth. Later on, Goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit), as a capital reserve of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstone B |year=1952 |title=The general practitioner and the general adaptation syndrome |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent works,  adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the "dominant path" in the model of adaptation. It is demonstrated that oscillations of well-being appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gorban A.N. |author2=Tyukina T.A. |author3=Smirnova E.V. |author4=Pokidysheva L.I. |year=2016 |title=Evolution of adaptation mechanisms: adaptation energy, stress, and oscillating death|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287251014 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.12.017 |pmid=26801872 |journal=J.

=== Autopsy ===
[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of an autopsy, by Rembrandt, entitled "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp"|An autopsy is portrayed in ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]
An [[autopsy]], also known as a ''postmortem examination'' or an ''obduction'', is a [[medical procedure]] that consists of a thorough [[Medical examination|examination]] of a human [[dead body|corpse]] to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any [[disease]] or [[injury]] that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].

Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.

A "necropsy" is an older term for a postmortem examination, unregulated, and not always a medical procedure. In modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals.

{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]] (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'icy cold') is the [[cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKie|first=Robin |title=Cold facts about cryonics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/14/medicalscience.science |newspaper=[[The Oalobserver]] |date=13 July 2002 |accessdate=1 December 2013 |quote="Cryonics, which began in the Fifties, is the freezing – usually in liquid nitrogen – of human beings who have been legally declared dead.

== Life extension ==
{{Main|Life extension}}

Life extension refers to an increase in [[maximum life span|maximum]] or [[life expectancy|average lifespan]], especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the [[senescence|processes of aging]]. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.

A United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.

Researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as "biomedical [[gerontologist]]s". They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called "life extensionists" or "longevists". The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.

[[File:Placid death.JPG|thumb|A naturally mummified body (from Guanajuato)|Dead bodies can be [[mummified]] either naturally, as this one [[Mummies of Guanajuato|from Guanajuato]], or by intention, as [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|those in ancient Egypt]].]]

In society, the nature of death and humanity's [[Mortality salience|awareness of its own mortality]] has for millennia been a concern of the world's [[religious traditions]] and of [[philosophy|philosophical inquiry]]. This includes belief in [[resurrection]] or an [[afterlife]] (associated with [[Abrahamic religions]]), [[reincarnation]] or rebirth (associated with [[Dharmic religions]]), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as [[eternal oblivion]] (associated with [[atheism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fuKB8MPMdG4C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Handbook to the Afterlife |last1=Heath |first1=Pamela Rae |last2=Klimo |first2=Jon |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2010 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-55643-869-1 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemoration ceremonies after death may include various [[mourning]], [[funeral]] practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'', or its [[initialism]] RIP.

Death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullin|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].

Legal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.

[[File:Grave stone2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gravestones in Japan|Gravestones in [[Kyoto]], Japan]]
[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004030535/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=4 October 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death in warfare and in [[suicide attack]] also have cultural links, and the ideas of [[dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]], [[mutiny]] punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and [[death notification]] are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.

[[Suicide]] in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. [[Death (personification)|Death is personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]], the [[Hindu]] God [[Yama]] and [[Father Time]].

In [[Brazil]], a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry.  Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204–220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.

== Consciousness ==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}

Much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called ''[[eternal oblivion]]''. Belief that the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] is preserved after physical death is described by the term ''[[afterlife]]''.

== In biology ==
[[File:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Earthworm]]s are a good example of soil-dwelling detritivores.]]
After death the remains of an organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]]. Animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]]. [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.

[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be decomposed fully. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}

Contemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.

=== Extinction ===
{{Main|Extinction}}
[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W. Norton]] |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-393-31755-8 |pages=43–44 |chapter=Up to the Starting Line|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of [[Taxon|taxa]], reducing [[biodiversity]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly "reappear" (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}

Inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.

Organisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are "immortal" at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. In [[multicellular]] organisms (and also in [[multinucleate]] [[ciliates]]),&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Online Chapter 2: [http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780199657148/ The diversity of sexual cycles], p. 12. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Weismann barrier|Weismannist development]], that is, with a division of labor between mortal [[somatic cells|somatic (body) cells]] and "immortal" [[germ cell|germ (reproductive) cells]], death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert |first=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental biology |edition=7th |place=Sunderland, Mass |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=34–35 |isbn=978-0-87893-258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Volvox]]'' algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence include death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its [[Biological life cycle|life history]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 |pmid=21174128 |pmc=3098969 |title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae |last=Hallmann |first=A. |journal=Sexual Plant Reproduction |date=June 2011 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
Death is an important subject of religious doctrine.

=== Buddhism ===
{{See also|Anussati#The ten recollections}}

In Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|"deathless"]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain  enlightenment, therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.&lt;ref name="Blum 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name="Blum 2004" /&gt;

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]
{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}
Death is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.  Persons who come into contact with corpses are [[Tumah and taharah|ritually impure]].  There are a [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|variety of beliefs about the afterlife]] within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death.  This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any [[Mitzvah|commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;Soloveitchik, Joseph B.  ''Halakhic Man.'' Qtd. in [https://elmad.pardes.org/2018/04/tazria-metzora-understanding-purity/ Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical [[Freudian]] [[psychoanalytic theory]], the '''death drive''' ({{lang-de|Todestrieb}}) is the [[Drive theory|drive]] toward death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by [[Sabina Spielrein]] in her paper "Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |date=April 1994 |title=Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=155–186 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-5922.1994.00155.x}} [http://www.arizonapsychoanalyticsociety.com/downloads/sabrina.pdf Free pdf of the full essay] by the Arizona Psychoanalytic Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |year=1995 |title=Destruction as Cause of Becoming |journal=Psychoanalysis and Contemporary Thought |volume=18 |issue= |pages=85–118|doi= |url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=pct.018.0085a}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens'')&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |year=1912 |title=''Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens'' |journal=Jahrbuch für Psychoanalytische und Psychopathologische Forschungen |volume=IV |issue= |pages=465–503 |doi= |url=https://archive.org/stream/JahrbuchFuumlrPsychoanalytischeUndPsychopathologischeForschungenIv_509/JdP_IV_1912_1_Haelfte#page/n467/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1912, which was then taken up by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1920 in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]].'' This concept has been translated as "opposition between the ego or death [[instinct]]s and the sexual or life instincts".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Beyond the Pleasure Principle" in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pleasure Principle'', Freud used the plural "death drives" (''Todestriebe'') much more frequently than in the singular.&lt;ref&gt;See occurrences of [https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=%22death+drives%22 "death drives"] and of [https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=%22death+drive%22 "death drive"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The death drive opposes [[Eros (concept)#Sigmund Freud|Eros]], the tendency toward survival, propagation, sex, and other creative, life-producing drives. The death drive is sometimes referred to as "[[Thanatos]]" in post-Freudian thought, complementing "Eros", although this term was not used in Freud's own work, being rather introduced by [[Wilhelm Stekel]] in 1909 and then by [[Paul Federn]] in the present context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Jones |title=The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud.

The Standard Edition of Freud's works in English confuses two terms that are different in German, ''Instinkt'' ("instinct") and ''Trieb'' ("drive"), often translating both as ''instinct''; for example, "the hypothesis of a ''death instinct'', the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "The Ego and the Id", in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex, 1987), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; "This equating of ''instinkt'' and ''Trieb'' has created serious misunderstandings".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'', (London, 1946), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1988) [1973]. "[https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=%22Instinct+(or+Drive)+=+I.+D.:+Instinkt%22%22D.:+Trieb%22 Instinct (or Drive) (pp. 214-7).]"&lt;/ref&gt; Freud actually refers to the term "instinkt" in explicit use elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Instinct and Drive (pp. 19ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=qbWuAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22Instinct+and+Drive%22 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Instincts |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qbWuAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=qnowAAAAIAAJ 1970] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-1-317-67045-2 |id={{ISBN|1-31767045-0}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so while the concept of "instinct" can loosely be referred to as a "drive," any essentialist or naturalist connotations of the term should be put in abeyance. In a sense, the death drive is a force that is not essential to the life of an organism (unlike an "instinct") and tends to denature it or make it behave in ways that are sometimes counter-intuitive. In other words, the term death "drive" is simply a false representation of death instinct. The term is almost universally known in scholarly literature on Freud as the "death drive", and Lacanian psychoanalysts often shorten it to simply "drive" (although Freud posited the existence of other drives as well, and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] explicitly states in Seminar XI that all drives are partial to the death drive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The four fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis|last=|first=|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=|isbn=9780393317756|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Penguin translations of Freud translate ''Trieb'' and ''Instinkt'' as "drive" and "instinct" respectively.

==Origin of the theory: ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''==
{{Main|Beyond the Pleasure Principle}}
{{Anchors|origin}}It was a basic premise of Freud's that "the course taken by mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle...[associated] with an avoidance of unpleasure or a production of pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond the Pleasure Principle", p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main types of conflictual evidence, difficult to explain satisfactorily in such terms, led Freud late in his career to look for another principle in mental life ''beyond'' the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]—a search that would ultimately lead him to the concept of the death drive.

The first problem Freud encountered was the phenomenon of repetition in (war) trauma. When Freud worked with people with [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] (particularly the trauma experienced by soldiers returning from [[World War I]]), he observed that subjects often tended to repeat or re-enact these traumatic experiences: "dreams occurring in traumatic have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the expectations of the pleasure principle.

A second problematic area was found by Freud in children's [[Play (activity)|play]] (such as the ''Fort/Da'' [Forth/here] game played by Freud's grandson, who would stage and re-stage the disappearance of his mother and even himself). "How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third problem came from clinical practice.  Freud found his patients, dealing with painful experiences that had been repressed, regularly "obliged to ''repeat'' the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of [...] ''remembering'' it as something belonging to the past".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond" p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with what he called "the compulsion of destiny [...] come across [in] people all of whose human relationships have the same outcome",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond" p. 294 and p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; such evidence led Freud "to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that would seem more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then set out to find an explanation of such a compulsion; in Freud's own words, "What follows is speculation, often far-fetched speculation, which the reader will consider or dismiss according to his individual predilection".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking a new instinctual paradigm for such problematic repetition, he found it ultimately in "''an urge in organic life to restore an earlier state of things''"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;—the inorganic state from which life originally emerged. From the conservative, restorative character of instinctual life, Freud derived his death drive, with its "pressure towards death", and the resulting "separation of the death instincts from the life instincts"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", pp. 316 and 322.&lt;/ref&gt; seen in Eros. The death drive then manifested itself in the individual creature as a force "whose function is to assure that the organism shall follow its own path to death".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking further potential clinical support for the existence of such a self-destructive force, Freud found it through a reconsideration of his views of masochism—previously "regarded as sadism that has been turned round upon the subject's own ego"—so as to allow that "there ''might'' be such a thing as primary masochism—a possibility which I had contested"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; before. Even with such support, however, he remained very tentative to the book's close about the provisional nature of his theoretical construct: what he called "the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spielrein's paper was published in 1912, Freud initially resisted the concept as he considered it to be too Jungian. Nevertheless, Freud eventually adopted the concept, and in later years would build extensively upon the tentative foundations he had set out in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''. In ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923) he would develop his argument to state that "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an ''instinct of destruction'' directed against the external world".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Ego/Id", p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he would spell out more clearly that the "libido has the task of making the destroying instinct innocuous, and it fulfils the task by diverting that instinct to a great extent outwards [...]. The instinct is then called the destructive instinct, the instinct for mastery, or the will to power",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "The Economic Problem of Masochism" in ''On Metapsychology'', p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; a perhaps much more recognisable set of manifestations.

At the close of the decade, in ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930), Freud acknowledged that "To begin with it was only tentatively that I put forward the views I have developed here, but in the course of time they have gained such a hold upon me that I can no longer think in any other way".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Civilization and Its Discontents", in ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (Middlesex, 1987), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the "Will"{{!}}Philosophy of the "Will" in Schopenhauer}}
From a philosophical perspective, the death drive may be viewed in relation to the work of the German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. His philosophy, expounded in ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1818) postulates that all exists by a metaphysical "will" (more clearly, a '''will to live'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |title=The World as Will and Presentation |others=Translated by Richard E. Aquila and David Carus |location= New York |publisher= Longman |year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and that pleasure affirms this will. Schopenhauer's [[pessimism]] led him to believe that the affirmation of the "will" was a negative and immoral thing, due to his belief of life producing more suffering than happiness. The death drive would seem to manifest as a natural and psychological negation of the "will".

Freud was well aware of such possible linkages. In a letter of 1919, he wrote that regarding "the theme of death, [that I] have stumbled onto an odd idea via the drives and must now read all sorts of things that belong to it, for instance Schopenhauer".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Gay, ''Freud: A life for our time'' (London, 1989), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, [[Ernest Jones]] (who like many analysts was not convinced of the need for the death drive, over and above an instinct of aggression) considered that "Freud seemed to have landed in the position of Schopenhauer, who taught that 'death is the goal of life'".&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (London, 1964), p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as Freud put it to the imagined auditors of his ''New Introductory Lectures'' (1932), "You may perhaps shrug your shoulders and say: "That isn't natural science, it's Schopenhauer's philosophy!" But, ladies and gentlemen, why should not a bold thinker have guessed something that is afterwards confirmed by sober and painstaking detailed research?"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (London, 1991), pp. 140-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to add that "what we are saying is not even genuine Schopenhauer....we are not overlooking the fact that there is life as well as death. We recognise two basic instincts and give each of them its own aim".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural application: ''Civilization and Its Discontents''==
{{Main|Civilization and Its Discontents}}
Freud applied his new theoretical construct in ''Civilization and Its Discontents'' (1930) to the difficulties inherent in [[western culture|Western civilization]]—indeed, in civilization and in social life as a whole. In particular, given that "a portion of the [death] instinct is diverted towards the external world and comes to light as an instinct of aggressiveness', he saw 'the inclination to aggression [...] [as] the greatest impediment to civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'' pp. 310 and 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to overcome such aggression entailed the formation of the [cultural] superego: "We have even been guilty of the heresy of attributing the origin of conscience to this diversion inwards of aggressiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Why War?" in ''Civilization'', p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence thereafter in the individual of the superego and a related sense of guilt—"Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual's dangerous desire for aggression by [...] setting up an agency within him to watch over it"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;—leaves an abiding sense of uneasiness inherent in civilized life, thereby providing a structural explanation for 'the suffering of civilized man'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London, 1997), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud made a further connection between [[Group (sociology)|group]] life and innate aggression, where the former comes together more closely by directing aggression to other groups, an idea later picked up by group analysts like [[Wilfred Bion]].

==Continuing development of Freud's views==
In the closing decade of Freud's life, it has been suggested, his view of the death drive changed somewhat, with "the stress much more upon the death instinct's manifestations ''outwards''".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Dickson, "Editor's Introduction", ''Civilization'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  Given "the ubiquity of non-erotic aggressivity and destructiveness", he wrote in 1930, "I adopt the standpoint, therefore, that the inclination to aggression is an original, self-subsisting instinctual disposition in man".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', pp. 311 and 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 he conceded of his original formulation of the death drive 'the improbability of our speculations.  A queer instinct, indeed, directed to the destruction of its own organic home!'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote moreover that "Our hypothesis is that there are two essentially different classes of instincts: the sexual instincts, understood in the widest sense—Eros, if you prefer that name—and the aggressive instincts, whose aim is destruction".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, he went so far as to suggest privately that 'We should have a neat schematic picture if we supposed that originally, at the beginning of life, all libido was directed to the inside and all aggressiveness to the outside'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud quoted by Dickson, ''Civilization'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his last writings, it was the contrast of "two basic instincts, ''Eros'' and ''the destructive instinct'' [...] our two primal instincts, ''Eros'' and ''destructiveness'',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Standard Edition'' vol. xxiii (London 1964), pp. 148 and 246.&lt;/ref&gt; on which he laid stress.  Nevertheless, his belief in "the death instinct [...] [as] a return to an earlier state [...] into an inorganic state"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''SE'', xxiii, pp. 148-9.&lt;/ref&gt; continued to the end.

==Analytic reception==
As Freud wryly commented in 1930, "The assumption of the existence of an instinct of death or destruction has met with resistance even in analytic circles".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Ernest Jones would comment of ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' that the book not only "displayed a boldness of speculation that was unique in all his writings" but was "further noteworthy in being the only one of Freud's which has received little acceptance on the part of his followers".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Life'', p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Fenichel in his compendious survey of the first Freudian half-century concluded that "the facts on which Freud based his concept of a death instinct in no way necessitate the assumption [...] of a genuine self-destructive instinct".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London, 1946), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinz Hartmann]] set the tone for [[ego psychology]] when he "chose to [...] do without 'Freud's other, mainly biologically oriented set of hypotheses of the "life" and "death instincts"'".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gay, ''Freud'', pp. 402-3n.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[object relations theory]], among the independent group 'the most common repudiation was the loathsome notion of the death instinct'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi, ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge, 2006), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, "for most analysts Freud's idea of a primitive urge towards death, of a primary masochism, was [...] bedevilled by problems".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, ''Freud'', p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the concept has been defended, extended, and carried forward by some analysts, generally those tangential to the psychoanalytic mainstream; while among the more orthodox, arguably of "those who, in contrast to most other analysts, take Freud's doctrine of the death drive seriously, K. R. Eissler has been the most persuasive—or least unpersuasive".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 768.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melanie Klein]] and her immediate followers considered that "the infant is exposed from birth to the anxiety stirred up by the inborn polarity of instincts—the immediate conflict between the life instinct and the death instinct";&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;[[Hanna Segal]], ''Introduction to the work of Melanie Klein'' (London, 1964), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kleinians indeed built much of their theory of early childhood around the outward deflection of the latter. "This deflection of the death instinct, described by Freud, in Melanie Klein's view consists partly of a projection, partly of the conversion of the death instinct into aggression".&lt;ref name=Segal /&gt;

French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], for his part, castigated the "refusal to accept this culminating point of Freud's doctrine [...] by those who conduct their analysis on the basis of a conception of the ''ego'' [...] that death instinct whose enigma Freud propounded for us at the height of his experience".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, he stressed the linguistic aspects of the death drive: "the symbol is substituted for death in order to take possession of the first swelling of life [...]. There is therefore no further need to have recourse to the outworn notion of primordial masochism in order to understand the reason for the repetitive games in [...] his ''Fort!'' and in his ''Da!''."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' pp. 124 and 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] too would proudly proclaim that he, "besides having repeated and confirmed the conventional observations of Freud, also believes right down the line with him concerning the death instinct, and the pervasiveness of the [[repetition compulsion]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You say After You Say Hello?'' (London, 1975) pp. 399-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the twenty-first century, "the death drive today [...] remains a highly controversial theory for many psychoanalysts [...] [almost] as many opinions as there are psychoanalysts".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London, 2005), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's conceptual opposition of death and eros drives in the human psyche was applied by Walter A. Davis in ''Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative''&lt;ref name=Adams01&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|title=Deracination; Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative|date=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-79144834-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Death's Dream Kingdom: The American Psyche since 9/11.''&lt;ref name=Adam02&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|title=Death's Dream Kingdom|date=2006|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-74532468-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis described social reactions to both Hiroshima and 9/11 from the Freudian viewpoint of the death force. Unless they consciously take responsibility for the damage of those reactions, Davis claims that Americans will repeat them.

'''Death education''' is [[education]] about [[death]] that focuses on the [[human]] and [[emotional]] aspects of death. Though it may include teaching on the biological aspects of death, teaching about [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with [[grief]] is a primary focus. Death education is formally known as [[thanatology]]. Thanatology stems from the Greek word ''thanatos'', meaning death, and ''ology'' meaning a science or organized body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;   A specialist in this field is referred to as a [[thanatologist]]. 
Death education refers to the experiences and activities of death that one deals with. Death education also deals with being able to grasp the different processes of dying, talk about the main topics of attitudes and meanings toward death, and the after effects on how to learn to care for people that are affected by the death. The main focus in death education is teaching people how to cope with grief. Many people feel death education is a taboo and instead of talking about death and grieving, they hide it away and never bring it up to others. With the right education of death, the less of a taboo it will be.

==History==
Historically death education in American society has been seen as a taboo topic, not worthy of scholarly research or for educational purposes. In the 1960s pioneering professionals like that of Herman Feifel (1959), [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] (1969), and [[Cicely Saunders]] (1967) encouraged behavioral scientists, clinicians, and humanists to pay attention and to study death-related topics. This initiated the death-awareness movement and began the widespread study of death-related behavior, developing new programs of care for the dying and bereaved, as well as new research on death-related attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
"Death is no enemy of life; it restores our sense of the value of living. Illness restores the sense of proportion that is lost when we take life for granted. To learn about value and proportion we need to honor illness, and ultimately to honor death."&lt;ref&gt;Frank, 2002, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Death education honors death by educating about death, dying, and bereavement to enrich personal lives, inform and guide individuals in their transactions with society, prepare individuals for their public roles as citizens, help prepare and support individuals in their professional and vocational roles, and lastly to enhance the ability of individuals to communicate effectively about death-related matters.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospice==
One of the major organizations that educates people on death is [[Hospice]]. Hospice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospice Foundation of America |url=http://www.hospicefoundation.org/beforedeath |accessdate=19 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311105852/http://www.hospicefoundation.org/beforedeath |archivedate=11 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers support for the caregiver, and Hospice also offers information on what to expect before death and what the family can expect after death. One of the major subjects that hospice addresses within death are the myths that come along with death. Hospice will also walk caretakers through the signs and symptoms to look for that signify death.
Hospice is an important type of care that helps spread and explain death education to the people. When people have a loved one that is not able to get anymore help from medication or doctors, it would be a good recommendation for them to go to hospice. They would be able to receive great support and comfort during the end of their life journey. Not only does hospice give care to the terminally ill, they also give grief suggestions to family members and close friends. "With proper care, proper support, and love, we can share the miracle that is life".  The end of a person's life should be centered on being alive instead of being dead.

==Curriculum==
Students of a death education course need to clearly understand the complex knowledge of the subject, learn the five key areas of knowledge, and to learn the physical, psycho-social, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of death. The five key areas are: understanding the dying process, decision making for end of life, loss, grief, and bereavement, assessment and intervention, and traumatic death. Death education should be taught in perspective and one's emotional response should be proportionate to the occasion. In addition death education can be taught formally or informally. Formally planned death education is associated with learning in organized educational settings including: schools, colleges, graduate education, professional workshops, and volunteer training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Corr, 2013, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of Dying==
in her book, In Death and Dying (1969), Elisabeth Kubler-Ross proposed the five stages of the dying process. Though her work has often been referred to as the "five stages of grief," the original work was based on her clinical observations of the psychosocial responses of terminally ill patients to their impending death. Much scholarly debate has surrounded the legitimacy of her five "stages"—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Experienced psychosocial clinicians have largely rejected the accuracy of the model because it addresses only emotional states, sets up false expectations of the process, and have not been empirically verified as a descriptive model.

The first stage is denial and isolation. When you first hear about a loved one who has a deathly illness your first instinct is to deny the reality of the situation.  This is known as a defense mechanism because we block out the words by not fully processing them and also hide from the facts.
The second stage is anger. Once the blocking out subsides the reality of the situation becomes overwhelming and the pain from the news emerges.
The third stage is bargaining. This stage you will feel more vulnerable and helpless. In order to gain control again you'll start thinking of ways that would have made it better like:
•	"If only we had sought medical attention sooner…"
•	"If only we got a second opinion from another doctor…"
•	"If only we had tried to be a better person toward them…"

All of these are defense lines to try and protect us from the reality of pain in a lost one.
The fourth stage is depression. In this stage there can be two different types of depression that you deal with. The first type of depression can be a more quiet and private feeling. The second type of depression is the kind where sadness and regret overtake your body and become the predominate factors in your life.
The fifth and final stage is acceptance. This stage does not always reach everyone but for the people who actually get it should consider this stage as a gift. It does not mean that you will not be sad anymore but it does mean that there is going to be some kind of peace that you are able to reach with the loved one that died.

==Summary==
Even though people are still conservative towards the idea of death and dying, with help and the education of death, people will come to know death as a natural part of life that everyone will someday have to go through. Instead of being timid and scared of death, people will become comfortable towards the topic and be able to prepare for what will come in the future. Death education is not just for medical professionals and those dealing with the terminally ill but rather death education is beneficial to everyone for it reveals the importance of quality in living and the human search for meaning. "Dying was what human life moved toward and therefore dying was what a human being constantly prepared for."&lt;ref&gt;Moran, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''essence''' is the property or set of properties that make an entity or [[substance theory|substance]] what it fundamentally is, and which it has by [[metaphysical necessity|necessity]], and without which it loses its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]. Essence is contrasted with [[accident (philosophy)|accident]]: a property that the entity or substance has [[metaphysical contingency|contingently]], without which the substance can still retain its identity.  The concept originates rigorously with Aristotle (although it can also be found in Plato)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthyfro.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} Euthyphro by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who used the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] expression ''to ti ên einai'' (τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1029b&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "the what it was to be" and corresponding to the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] term [[quiddity]]) or sometimes the shorter phrase ''to ti esti'' (τὸ τί ἐστι,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', 1030a&lt;/ref&gt; literally meaning "the what it is" and corresponding to the scholastic term [[haecceity]]) for the same idea. This phrase presented such difficulties for its Latin translators that they coined the word ''essentia'' (English "essence") to represent the whole expression. For Aristotle and his scholastic followers, the notion of essence is closely linked to that of definition (ὁρισμός ''[[horismos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysicys/ S. Marc Cohen, "Aristotle's Metaphysics"], [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], accessed 20 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of western thought, essence has often served as a vehicle for doctrines that tend to individuate different forms of existence as well as different identity conditions for objects and properties; in this logical meaning, the concept has given a strong theoretical and common-sense basis to the whole family of logical theories based on the "possible worlds" analogy set up by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and developed in the intensional logic from [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] to [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]], which was later challenged by "extensionalist" philosophers such as [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].

==Ontological status&lt;!--Linked from 'Étienne Gilson'--&gt;==
In his dialogues [[Plato]] suggests that concrete beings acquire their essence through their relations to "[[Theory of Forms|Forms]]"{{mdash}}abstract universals logically or ontologically separate from the objects of sense perception. These Forms are often put forth as the models or paradigms  of which sensible things are "copies". When used in this sense, the word form is often capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 28: Form" of ''The Great Ideas: A Synopticon of Great Books of the Western World'' (Vol. II). ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1952), p. 526-542. This source states that Form or Idea get capitalized according to this convention when they refer "to that which is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas in our mind."&lt;/ref&gt; Sensible bodies are in constant flux and imperfect and hence, by Plato's reckoning, less real than the Forms which are eternal, unchanging and complete. Typical examples of Forms given by Plato are largeness, smallness, equality, unity, goodness, beauty and justice.

[[Aristotle]] moves the Forms of Plato to the nucleus of the individual thing, which is called ''[[ousia]]'' or substance. Essence is the ''ti'' of the thing, the ''[[to ti en einai]]''. Essence corresponds to the ''ousia'''s definition; essence is a real and physical aspect of the ''ousia'' (Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', I).

According to [[nominalists]] ([[Roscelin of Compiègne]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Bernard of Chartres]]), universals aren't concrete entities, just voice's sounds; there are only individuals: "''nam cum habeat eorum sententia nihil esse praeter individuum [...]''" (Roscelin, ''De gener. et spec.'', 524). Universals are words that can to call several individuals; for example the word "homo". Therefore, a universal is reduced to a sound's emission (Roscelin, ''De generibus et speciebus'').

[[John Locke]] distinguished between "real essences" and "nominal essences". Real essences are the thing(s) that makes a thing a thing, whereas nominal essences are our conception of what makes a thing a thing.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/real-essence/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Edmund Husserl]] essence is ''ideal''. However, ''ideal'' means that essence is an intentional object of consciousness. Essence is interpreted as ''sense'' (E. Husserl, ''Ideas pertaining to a pure phenomenology and to a phenomenological philosophy'', paragraphs 3 and 4).

==Existentialism==
{{main|Meaning (existential)}}
[[Existentialism]] was coined by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s endorsement of [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]] statement that for human beings "[[existence precedes essence]]."  In as much as "essence" is a cornerstone of all [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] philosophy and of [[Rationalism]], Sartre's statement was a repudiation of the philosophical system that had come before him (and, in particular, that of [[Husserl]], [[Hegel]], and [[Heidegger]]).  Instead of "is-ness" generating "actuality," he argued that existence and actuality come first, and the essence is derived afterward. For [[Kierkegaard]], it is the individual person who is the supreme moral entity, and the personal, subjective aspects of human life that are the most important; also, for Kierkegaard all of this had religious implications.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of Philosophy'', Bryan Magee, Dorling Kindersley Lond. 1998, {{ISBN|0-7513-0590-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In metaphysics==
"Essence," in metaphysics, is often synonymous with the [[soul]], and some existentialists argue that individuals gain their souls and spirits after they exist, that they develop their souls and spirits during their lifetimes.  For Kierkegaard, however, the emphasis was upon essence as "nature."  For him, there is no such thing as "human nature" that determines how a human will behave or what a human will be.  First, he or she exists, and then comes property.  [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s more materialist and skeptical existentialism furthered this existentialist tenet by flatly refuting any metaphysical essence, any soul, and arguing instead that there is merely existence, with attributes as essence.

Thus, in existentialist discourse, essence can refer to physical aspect or property to the ongoing being of a person (the character or internally determined goals), or to the infinite inbound within the human (which can be lost, can atrophy, or can be developed into an equal part with the finite), depending upon the type of existentialist discourse.

==Marxism's essentialism==

[[Karl Marx]] was a follower of [[Hegel]]'s thought, and he, too, developed a philosophy in reaction to his master. In his early work, Marx used [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] style [[teleology]] and derived a concept of humanity's essential nature. Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]] describe [[Marx's theory of alienation|a theory of alienation]] based on human existence being completely different from human essence.  Marx said human nature was social, and that humanity had the distinct essence of free activity and conscious thought.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Some scholars, such as Philip Kain, have argued that Marx abandoned the idea of a human essence, but many other scholars point to Marx's continued discussion of these ideas despite the decline of terms such as essence and alienation in his later work.

==Buddhism==
Within the [[Madhyamaka]] school of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]], [[Candrakirti]] identifies the [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] as:{{quote|an essence of things that does not depend on others; it is an intrinsic nature. The non-existence of that is [[Anatta|selflessness]].| {{IAST|'''Bodhisattvayogacaryācatuḥśatakaṭikā'''}} 256.1.7&lt;ref name="Lam Rim"&gt;Translations from "The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment", Vol. 3 by Tsong-Kha-Pa, Snow Lion Publications {{ISBN|1-55939-166-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buddhapālita]] adds, while commenting on [[Nagarjuna|Nagārjuna]]'s [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], {{quote|What is the reality of things just as it is? It is the absence of essence. Unskilled persons whose eye of intelligence is obscured by the darkness of delusion conceive of an essence of things and then generate attachment and hostility with regard to them.|{{IAST|''Buddhapālita-mula-madhyamaka-vrtti''}}, P5242, 73.5.6-74.1.2&lt;ref name="Lam Rim"/&gt;}}

For the [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhists, '[[Shunyata|Emptiness]]' (also known as [[Anatta|Anatta or Anatman]]) is the strong assertion that all phenomena are empty of any essence, and that anti-essentialism lies at the root of Buddhist praxis and it is the innate belief in essence that is considered to be an afflictive obscuration which serves as the root of [[Samsara|all suffering]]. However, the [[Madhyamaka]] also rejects the tenets of [[Idealism]], [[Materialism]] or [[Cārvāka#No life after death|Nihilism]]; instead, the ideas of ''truth'' or ''existence'', along with any assertions that depend upon them are limited to their function within the contexts and conventions that assert them, possibly somewhat akin to [[Relativism]] or [[Pragmatism]]. For the [[Madhyamaka]], replacement paradoxes such as [[Ship of Theseus]] are answered by stating that the Ship of Theseus remains so (within the conventions that assert it) until it ceases to function as the Ship of Theseus.

In [[Nagarjuna]]'s [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]] Chapter XV examines essence itself.

==Hinduism==

In understanding any individual personality, a distinction is made between one's ''Swadharma'' (essence) and ''Swabhava'' (mental habits and conditionings of ego personality). Svabhava is the nature of a person, which is a result of his or her samskaras (impressions created in the mind due to one's interaction with the external world). These samskaras create habits and mental models and those become our nature. While there is another kind of svabhava that is a pure internal quality — [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|smarana]] — we are here focusing only on the svabhava that was created due to samskaras (because to discover the pure, internal svabhava and smarana, one should become aware of one's samskaras and take control over them). [[Dharma]] is derived from the root ''dhr'' "to hold." It is that which holds an entity together. That is, Dharma is that which gives integrity to an entity and holds the core quality and identity (essence), form and function of that entity. Dharma is also defined as righteousness and duty. To do one's dharma is to be righteous, to do one's dharma is to do one's duty (express one's essence).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prasadkaipa.com/blog/archives/2005/07/svabhava_and_sv.php Prasadkaipa.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Essentialism''' is the view that every [[entity]] has a set of attributes that are necessary to its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Richard L.|title=Some Remarks on Essentialism|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|year=1968|volume=65|issue=20|pages=615–626|jstor=2024315|doi=10.2307/2024315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Western thought [[Platonic idealism|Plato's idealism]] held that all things have such an "essence"—an [[Theory of Forms|"idea" or "form"]]. In [[Categories (Aristotle)|''Categories'']], Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a [[Substance theory|substance]] that, as [[George Lakoff]] put it "make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not ''that'' kind of thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Janicki|2003|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contrary view—[[non-essentialism]]—denies the need to posit such an "essence'".

Essentialism has been controversial from its beginning. Plato, in the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides Dialogue]]'', depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the "existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt" .&lt;ref name="platostanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-parmenides/|title=Plato's Parmenides|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] at least until the time of [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ereshefsky|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the role and importance of essentialism in biology is still a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hull|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[gender studies]] the essentialist idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Women and Men|publisher=Basic Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0465047925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"&gt;Suzanne Kelly, Gowri Parameswaran, and Nancy Schniedewind, ''Women: Images &amp; Realities: A Multicultural Anthology'', 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
An ''[[essence]]'' characterizes a [[substance theory|substance]] or a [[Substantial form|form]], in the sense of the forms and ideas in [[Platonic idealism]]. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, is and present in every possible world. Classical [[humanism]] has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable [[human nature]]. This has been criticized by [[Kierkegaard]], [[Marx]], [[Heidegger]], [[Sartre]], and many other [[Existentialism|existential]] and [[Historical materialism|materialist]] thinkers.

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy (in particular, the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the ''[[Philebus]]''), things were said to come into being by the action of a [[demiurge]] who works to form [[substance theory|chaos]] into ordered entities. Many definitions of ''essence'' hark back to the ancient Greek [[hylomorphic]] understanding of the formation of the things. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires ''hyle'' (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in her own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (''morphe''). Aristotle was the first to use the terms ''hyle'' and ''morphe''. According to [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|his explanation]], all entities have two aspects: "matter" and "form". It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity—its [[quiddity]] or "whatness" (i.e., its "what it is").

Plato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms—an [[abstract entity]] of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some ''idea'' in common—the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato's forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects—the abstract properties that makes them what they are. (For more on forms, read [[Plato's allegory of the cave|Plato's parable of the cave]].)

[[Karl Popper]] splits the ambiguous term ''[[Philosophical realism|realism]]'' into ''essentialism'' and ''realism''. He uses ''essentialism'' whenever he means the opposite of [[nominalism]], and ''realism'' only as opposed to [[idealism]]. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like "a puppy is a young dog" should be read from right to left, as an answer to "What shall we call a young dog"; never from left to right as an answer to "What is a puppy?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysical essentialism===
Essentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of ''essence''. Unlike [[existentialism]], which posits "being" as the fundamental reality, the essentialist [[wikt:ontology|ontology]] must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.

[[Plato]] believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man's limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the "essential" or ideal and the "perceived". [[Aristotle]] (384–322 B.C.) applied the term ''essence'' to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, ''rationality'' is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle's philosophy, [[Bertrand Russell]] said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing's "essence" consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the ''name'' for it.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept of essence was "hopelessly muddled" it became part of every philosophy until modern times.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt;

The Egyptian-born philosopher [[Plotinus]] (204–270 CE) brought [[idealism]] to the [[Roman Empire]] as [[Neoplatonism]], and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a "primary essence" but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.

Despite the metaphysical basis for the term, academics in science, [[aesthetics]], [[heuristics]], [[psychology]], and gender-based sociological studies have advanced their causes under the banner of essentialism. Possibly the clearest definition for this philosophy was offered by gay/lesbian rights advocate [[Diana Fuss]], who wrote: "Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the 'whatness' of a given entity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fuss|2013|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical essentialism stands diametrically opposed to existential realism in that finite existence is only differentiated appearance, whereas "ultimate reality" is held to be absolute essence.

Among contemporary essentialists, what all existing things have in common is ''the power to exist'', which defines their "uncreated" Essence.&lt;ref&gt;Levina, Tatiana (Moscow 2013) Realism in Metaphysics: Analytic Questions and Continental Answers (p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==
In 2010, an article by [[Gerald B. Folland]] in the ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' stated, "It is a truth universally acknowledged that almost all mathematicians are Platonists, at least when they are actually doing mathematics …" This refers to their implicit embrace of essentialism, which he finds revealed in mathematicians peculiar use of language. Whereas physicists define [[Lie algebra]] as a rule they can apply to facts, mathematicians define it as an essence of a structure, independent of any circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/201009/rtx100901121p.pdf Gerald B. Folland, October 2010, Notices of the AMS, p. 1121 "Speaking with the Natives: Reﬂections on Mathematical Communication"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==
[[File:Toronto Maple Leafs bild.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] attempts to explain why people will pay more in an auction for the clothing of celebrities if the clothing is unwashed. He believes the answer to this and many other questions is that people cannot help but think of objects as containing a sort of "essence" that can be influenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_the_origins_of_pleasure.html Paul Bloom, July 2011 Ted talk, "The Origins of Pleasure"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There is a difference between metaphysical essentialism (see above) and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medin|first=D. L.|title=Conceptes and conceptual structure|journal=American Psychologist|year=1989|volume=44|issue=12|pages=1469–1481|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.44.12.1469}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Medin, 1989). Influential in this area is [[Susan Gelman]], who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms—i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gelman, S. ''The essential child: Origins of essentialism in everyday thought''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toosi|first=N. R.|author2=Ambady, N.|title=Ratings of essentialism for eight religious identities|journal=International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1080/10508619.2011.532441|pmid=21572550|pmc=3093246}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Toosi &amp; Ambady, 2011). This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dar-Nimrod|first=I.|author2=Heine, S. J.|title=Genetic essentialism: On the deceptive determinism of DNA|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2011|volume=137|issue=5|pages=800–818|doi=10.1037/a0021860|pmid=21142350|pmc=3394457}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, 2011).

===In developmental psychology===
Essentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly [[developmental psychology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gelman|first=S. A.|author2=Kremer, K. E.|title=Understanding natural causes: Children's explanations of how objects and their properties originate|journal=Child Development|year=1991|volume=62|issue=2|pages=396–414|doi=10.2307/1131012|pmid=2055130|jstor=1131012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelman and Kremer (1991) studied the extent to which children from 4–7 years old demonstrate essentialism. Children were able to identify the cause of behaviour in living and non-living objects. Children understood that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Participants could correctly describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects as a result of an adult influencing the object's actions. This is a biological way of representing essential features in cognitions. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rangel|first=U.|author2=Keller, J.|title=Essentialism goes social: Belief in social determinism as a component of psychological essentialism|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=6|pages=1056–1078|doi=10.1037/a0022401|pmid=21319911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rangel and Keller, 2011).
Younger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in [[cognitive development]]. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demoulin|first=Stéphanie|last2=Leyens |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last3=Yzerbyt |first3=Vincent|title=Lay Theories of Essentialism |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|year=2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=25–42|doi=10.1177/1368430206059856}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Demoulin, Leyens &amp; Yzerbyt, 2006).

There are four key criteria which constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms (del Rio &amp; Strasser, 2011). The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanovsky|first=M.|title=Essentialism and folksociology: Ethnicity again|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=241–281|doi=10.1163/156853707X208503|citeseerx=10.1.1.411.7247}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kanovsky, 2007). According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holtz|first=P.|author2=Wagner, W.|title=Essentialism and attribution of monstrosity in racist discourse: Right-wing internet postings about africans and jews|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=19|issue=6|pages=411–425|doi=10.1002/casp.1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Holtz &amp; Wagner, 2009). Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birnbaum|first=D.|author2=Deeb, I. |author3=Segall, G. |author4=Ben-Eliyahu, A. |author5=Diesendruck, G. |title=The development of social essentialism: The case of Israeli children's inferences about Jews and Arabs |journal=Child Development |year=2010 |volume=81|issue=3|pages=757–777|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624-2010.01432.x|pmid=20573103|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Birnbaum, Deeb, Segall, Ben-Aliyahu &amp; Diesendruck, 2010). This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different. However similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences.

The implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=T. A.|author2=Hornsey, M. J. |author3=Postmes, T. |title=Shifting ground: The variable use of essentialism in contexts of inclusion and exclusion|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=48|issue=1|pages=35–59|doi=10.1348/014466607X270287|pmid=18171502}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Morton, Hornsey &amp; Postmes, 2009). This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Medin | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Atran | first2 = S. | year = 2004 | title = The native mind: biological categorization and reasoning in development and across cultures | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.111.4.960 | pmid = 15482069 | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 111 | issue = 4| pages = 960-83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] of Yale University has stated that "one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom. P. (2010) Why we like what we like. ''Observer''. 23 (8), 3 [http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2010/october-10/why-we-like-what-we-like.html online link].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars suggest that the categorical nature of essentialist thinking predicts the use of stereotypes and can be targeted in the application of stereotype prevention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastian|first=B.|author2=Haslam, N.|title=Psychological essentialism and stereotype endorsement|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=228–235|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Bastian &amp; Haslam, 2006).

==In ethics==
Classical essentialists claim that some things are wrong in an absolute sense. For example murder breaks a universal, objective and natural moral law and not merely an advantageous, socially or ethically constructed one.

Many modern essentialists claim that right and wrong are moral boundaries that are individually constructed; in other words, things that are ethically right or wrong are actions that the individual deems to be beneficial or harmful, respectively.

==In biology==

One possibility is that before [[evolution]] was developed as a [[scientific theory]], there existed an essentialist view of [[biology]] that posited all species to be unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as [[Louis Agassiz]] in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowler |first1=Peter J. |title=Evolution. The History of an Idea |date=1989 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-06386-0 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[creation-evolution controversy|religious opponents of evolution]] continue to maintain this view of biology.

Recent work by historians of [[systematics|systematic biology]] has, however, cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan Müller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as [[Linnaeus]] and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and it appears that the so-called "essentialism story" (or "myth") in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed by philosophers from [[Aristotle]] onwards through to [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[William Whewell]] in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, using biological examples, with the use of terms in biology like species.&lt;ref&gt;Amundson, R. (2005) ''The changing rule of the embryo in evolutionary biology: structure and synthesis'', New York, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-80699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Müller-Wille | first1=Staffan | year=2007 | title=Collection and collation: theory and practice of Linnaean botany | journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences | volume=38 | issue=3| pages=541–562 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2007.06.010| pmid=17893064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Winsor | first1=M.

== Gender essentialism ==
{{main|Gender essentialism}}

In [[feminist theory]] and [[gender studies]], '''gender essentialism''' is the attribution of a fixed essence to women. Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist [[Elizabeth Grosz]] states in her 1995 publication ''Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies'' that essentialism "entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization."&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Grosz|first1 = Elizabeth|title =Space, Time, and Perversion: Essays on the Politics of Bodies |date = 1995|publisher = Routledge|location = New York|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Perversion.html?id=Htf7y-rcVFwC |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 March 2017|isbn = 9780415911375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 ''New York Times'' best seller ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus'', HarperCollins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women studies textbooks such as ''Women: Images &amp; Realities''.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"/&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. [[Evelyn Fox Keller]],&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller, ''Reflections on Gender and Science'', Yale University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Harding]],
&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Harding, ''The Science Question in Feminism'', Cornell University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nancy Tuana]]
&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Tuana, ''The Less Noble Sex'', Indiana University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the modern scientific enterprise is inherently patriarchal and incompatible with women's nature.  Other feminist scholars, such as [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "A historian looks at gender and science," ''International Journal of Science Education'', vol. 9 (1987), p. 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenore Blum]],&lt;ref&gt;Lenore Blum, "AWM's first twenty years: The presidents' perspectives," in Bettye Anne Case and Anne M. Leggett, eds., ''Complexities: Women in Mathematics'', Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Gray (scholar)|Mary Gray]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Gray, "Gender and mathematics: Mythology and Misogyny," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Beth Ruskai,&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Ruskai, "Why women are discouraged from becoming scientists," ''The Scientist'', March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram&lt;ref&gt;Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram, "Introduction," ''Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789-1979'', Rutgers University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized those theories for ignoring the diverse nature of scientific research and the tremendous variation in women's experiences in different cultures and historical periods.

== In historiography ==
Essentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. [[Herodotus]], for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a "softness" which has made Egypt easy to conquer.&lt;ref&gt;DeLapp 177.&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity,&lt;ref&gt;Lape 149-52.&lt;/ref&gt; or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentialism had been operative in [[colonialism]] as well as in critiques of colonialism.

[[Postcolonialism|Post-colonial]] theorists such as [[Edward Said]] insisted that essentialism was the "defining mode" of "Western" historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to [[Touraj Atabaki]], manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as [[Eurocentrism]], over-generalization, and reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians reject essentialism because it "dehistoricizes the process of social and cultural changes" and tends to see non-Western societies as historically unchanging; in India this led to the anti-essentialist (even anti-historiographical) school of [[Subaltern Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows 565 million years of human evolution, from [[shrewlike]] mammals 65 million years in the past to the ultimate fate of humanity (and its descendants, both biological and non-biological) 500 million years in the future.

The book follows the evolution of mankind as it shapes surviving [[Purgatorius]] into tree dwellers, remoulds a group that drifts from Africa to a (then much closer) [[New World]] on a raft formed out of debris, and confronting others with a terrible dead end as ice clamps down on [[Antarctica]].

The stream of DNA runs on elsewhere, where ape-like creatures in North Africa are forced out of their diminishing forests to come across grasslands where their distant descendants will later run joyously. At one point, hominids become [[Sapience|sapient]], and go on to develop technology, including an evolving [[universal assembler|universal constructor]] machine that goes to Mars and multiplies, and in an act of [[global ecophagy]]  consumes Mars by converting the planet into a mass of machinery that leaves the Solar system in search of new planets to assimilate. [[Human extinction]] (or the extinction of human culture) also occurs in the book, as well as the end of planet Earth and the rebirth of life on another planet.  (The [[extinction-level event]] that causes the human extinction is, indirectly, an eruption of the [[Rabaul caldera]], coupled with various actions of humans themselves, some of which are only vaguely referred to, but implied to be a form of genetic engineering which removed the ability to reproduce with non-engineered humans.) Also to be found in ''Evolution'' are ponderous Romans, sapient [[dinosaur]]s, the last of the wild [[Neanderthal]]s, a primate who witnesses the extinction of the dinosaurs, [[symbiotic]] primate-tree relationships, mole people, and primates who live on a Mars-like Earth. The final chapter witnesses the final fate of the last primate and the descendants of the replicator machines sent to [[Mars]] that are implied to have reached sentience and colonized the galaxy.
In the epilogue, Joan Useb (a paleontologist introduced in the prologue and in the intermission sections) discusses the philosophy of evolution with her daughter Lucy as they weather the aftermath of Rabaul on the [[Galapagos]], where [[Charles Darwin]] made his observations leading to his landmark theory.

==Reception==
[[Peter Cannon]] reviewing for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' stated "here is a rigorously constructed hard SF novel where the question is not whether humanity will reach the stars but how it will survive its own worst tendencies."&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Peter|date=January 20, 2003|title=EVOLUTION (Book)|journal=Publishers Weekly|volume= 250|issue= 3|pages=61|issn=0000-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' called this novel "glum, dyspeptic, and depressing."&lt;ref name="Kirkus Reviews"&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 15, 2002|title=EVOLUTION (Book)|journal=Kirkus Reviews|volume= 70|issue= 22,|pages=1662|issn=0042-6598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackie Cassada said in her review for ''[[Library Journal]]'' that "spanning more than 165 million years and encompassing the entire planet, Baxter's ambitious saga provides both an exercise in painless paleontology and superb storytelling."&lt;ref name="Cassada"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassada|first=Jackie |date=February 15, 2003|title=Evolution (Book)|journal=Library Journal|volume= 128|issue= 3|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/area.12339|title = Demonic geographies| journal=Area| volume=49| issue=4| pages=503–509|year = 2017|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014. Recent research on free will: Conceptualizations, beliefs, and processes. In Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 50, pp. 1-52). Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C.

Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, ''had'' one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one ''could'' have done otherwise without physical impediment. Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control, and to what extent. These questions predate the early Greek [[Stoicism|stoics]] (for example, [[Chrysippus]]), and some modern philosophers lament the lack of progress over all these centuries.&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;

It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by [[physical law]].&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2–29 |author=Max Velmans |title=How Could Conscious Experiences Affect Brains? |url=http://cogprints.org/2750/ |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either [[causal closure]] or [[physical determinism]] ([[nomological determinism]]) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).

The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the ''problem of free will'' or sometimes referred to as the ''dilemma of determinism''.&lt;ref name=WJames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Will to believe, and other essays in popular philosophy |author=William James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Tw28d-85wC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145 ''ff'' |chapter=The dilemma of determinism |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma leads to a [[morality|moral]] dilemma as well: the question of how to assign [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.&lt;ref name=Bargh&gt;

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003). "Can Conscious Experience affect brain Activity?", ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 10, nr. 12, pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt; Yet even with [[indeterminism|physical indeterminism]], arguments have been made against libertarianism in that it is difficult to assign ''Origination'' (responsibility for "free" indeterministic choices).

Free will here is predominately treated with respect to [[physical determinism]] in the strict sense of [[nomological determinism]], although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments /&gt; For example, logical and [[theological determinism|theological]] determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of [[destiny]] and [[fate]], and [[biological determinism|biological]], [[cultural determinism|cultural]] and [[psychological determinism|psychological]] determinism feed the development of compatibilist models. Separate classes of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]] may even be formed to represent these.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Zagzebski |first=Linda |editor=Edward N.

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main|Hard determinism}}
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy4.svg|thumb|A simplified [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and determinism.]]

Determinism can be divided into causal, logical and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="Parkinson2012"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=G. H. R. Parkinson|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqbJnEYKpW4C|accessdate=26 December 2012|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-00323-0|title=determinism|pages=891–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding to each of these different meanings, there arises a different problem for free will.&lt;ref name="Viv"&gt;Vihvelin, Kadri, "Arguments for Incompatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2003 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2003/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt; Hard determinism is the claim that [[determinism]] is true, and that it is [[incompatibilism|incompatible with free will]], so free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:
;[[Causal determinism]]: The idea that everything is caused by prior conditions, making it impossible for anything else to happen.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility /&gt; In its most common form, [[nomological determinism|nomological (or scientific) determinism]], future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]]. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;
The view of ''scientific determinism'' goes back to [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]]: "We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state." For further discussion see {{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia. N–Z, Indeks, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA197 |pages= 197 ''ff'' |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |chapter=Determinism |isbn=0415939275 |editors=Sahotra Sarkar, Jessica Pfeifer, Justin Garson |author=John T Roberts}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''.

London: Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how our actions can be free if there is a being who has determined them for us in advance, or if they are already set in time.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Suggestions have been made that hard determinism need not maintain strict determinism, where something near to, like that informally known as [[determinism|adequate determinism]], is perhaps more relevant.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{Main|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[File:FreewillConceptsBasedUponPhilosophyOfMindCausationViews.svg|thumb|Various definitions of free will that have been proposed for Metaphysical Libertarianism (agent/substance causal,&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories/&gt; centered accounts,&lt;ref name="Kane2005" /&gt; and efforts of will theory&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt;), along with examples of other common free will positions (Compatibilism,&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"/&gt; Hard Determinism,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and Hard Incompatibilism&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt;). Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.
:#D is true, and we do have F.
:#D is true, we have F, and F implies D.
:#D is unproven, but we have F.
:#D isn't true, we do have F, and would have F even if D were true.
:#D isn't true, we don't have F, but F is compatible with D.
::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====

[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H.

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Moral Responsibility | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Winter 2009 | year=2009 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/determinism-causal}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to free will and the classification of theological compatibilism/incompatibilism below, "theological determinism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge of all true propositions including propositions about our future actions," more minimal criteria designed to encapsulate all forms of theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordincompatibilismarguments"/&gt;

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====

{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

It has been noted that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] have yet to resolve the [[hard problem of consciousness]]:&lt;ref name=Kalat&gt;

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T. (1651) ''Leviathan'' [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html#a_2025807 Chapter XXI.: "Of the liberty of subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122711/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }} (1968 edition). London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In articulating this crucial proviso, [[David Hume]] writes, "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains."&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages= 487 ''ff'' |editors=Ezequiel Morsella, John A.

Our findings suggest that the traditional folk notions of willpower and character strength have some legitimate basis in genuine phenomena.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas.

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience. See [[s:Page:On the Fourfold Root, and On the Will in Nature.djvu/90|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes....

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]). His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 2| page = 74| last = Staley| first = Kevin M.| title = Aquinas: Compatibilist or Libertarian| journal = The Saint Anselm Journal| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2005| url = http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151221073832/http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| archivedate = 2015-12-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hartung| first = Christopher| title = Thomas Aquinas on Free Will| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = May 2013| publisher = University of Delaware| url = http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

Furthermore, there are always external constraints on the range of options we can meaningfully try to undertake. As the presence or absence of these conditions and constraints are not (usually) our responsibility, it is plausible that the central loci of our responsibility are our choices, or "willings".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will enters as follows: Free will is an "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term "appetite" from Aquinas's definition "includes all forms of internal inclination").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01656a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Appetite |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that judgment "concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite [that is, the free-will]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1083.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Free-will (Prima Pars, Q. 83) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Free Will: Essential Readings from the Contemporary Debates |author1=Paul Russell |author2=Oisin Deery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLyi7nmzr28C&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |chapter=I. The free will problem – real or illusory |isbn=9780199733392 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (readiness-potential) |author=Benjamin Libet |display-authors=etal |journal=Brain |year=1983 |volume=106 |pages=623–42 |url=http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |doi=10.1093/brain/106.3.623 |pmid=6640273 |issue=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526054605/http://trans-techresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Brain-1983-LIBET.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these authors also found that awareness of action was ''anticipatory'' to activity in the muscle underlying the movement; the entire process resulting in action involves more steps than just the ''onset'' of brain activity. The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012.

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.]. Retrieved 19 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because they are not strictly ''involuntary'': they may be experienced as a ''voluntary'' response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed.&lt;ref name=TSADef/&gt; People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.&lt;ref name=Zinner&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zinner | first1 = S.H. | year = 2000 | title = Tourette disorder | url = | journal = Pediatric Review | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pmid = 11077021 | pages = 372–83 | doi=10.1542/pir.21-11-372| doi-broken-date = 2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

In addition, one of the most important ("first rank") diagnostic symptoms of [[schizophrenia]] is the patient's delusion of being controlled by an external force.&lt;ref name=Schneider&gt;Schneider, K. (1959). ''Clinical Psychopathology.''

This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect. Of course, explaining to subjects exactly what the experimenter wants them to experience can bring its own problems–...instructions to attend to a particular internally generated experience can easily alter both the timing and the content of that experience and even whether or not it is consciously experienced at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J. Chalmers: ''What do philosophers believe?''. Philosophical Studies (3): 1–36 (2013). [http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP.pdf Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among evolutionary biologists====
79 percent of evolutionary biologists said that they believe in free-will according to a survey conducted in 2007, only 14 percent chose no free will, and 7 percent did not answer the question.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory W. Graffin and William B. Provine, “Evolution, Religion, and Free Will,” American Scientist 95 (July–August 2007), 294–97; results of Cornell Evolution Project survey,

====Effects of the belief itself====
{{see also|Self-efficacy}}

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Alquist | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 13–16 | doi = 10.1007/s12152-009-9046-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To test the effects of belief in determinism, future studies would need to provide articles that do not simply "attack free will", but instead focus on explaining determinism and compatibilism. Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

Baumeister and colleagues also note that volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of [[counterfactual thinking]].&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alquist, J.L., M. Daly, T. Stillman, and R.F. Baumeister, (2009). [Belief in determinism decreases counterfactual thinking].

Roese. 2008. The functional theory of counterfactual thinking. Personality and Social Psychology 12: 168–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of protective effect==
One of the most pernicious and irreparable types of [[oxidative damage]] inflicted by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) upon biomolecules involves the carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage (hydrogen abstraction).

In theory, replacing hydrogen with deuterium "reinforces" the bond due to the [[kinetic isotope effect]], and such reinforced biomolecules taken up by the body will be more resistant to ROS.&lt;ref name=pmid17378752&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/rej.2006.0506 |pmid=17378752 |title=Reactive Oxygen Species, Isotope Effect, Essential Nutrients, and Enhanced Longevity |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=47–59 |year=2007 |last1=Shchepinov |first1=Mikhail S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12952">'''Indefinite lifespan''' (also known as indefinite life extension or bio-indefinite) is a term used in the [[life extension]] movement and [[transhumanism]] to refer to the hypothetical longevity of humans (and other life-forms) under conditions in which [[ageing]] is effectively and completely prevented and treated.  Their lifespans would be "[[Wikt:indefinite|indefinite]]" (that is, they would not be "[[Wikt:immortal|immortal]]"), because protection from the effects of aging on health does not guarantee survival. Such individuals would still be susceptible to [[death]] by disease, [[starvation]], accidents, or deliberate killing, but not death from aging.  Semantically, "indefinite lifespan" is more accurate than "[[immortality]]" which, especially in religious contexts, implies an inability to die.

== Longevity escape velocity ==
[[File:Longevity Escape Velocity.png|thumb|right|380px|“The first 1000-year-old is probably only ~10 years younger than the first 150-year-old”]]
{{main|Longevity escape velocity}}

[[Longevity escape velocity]] is a term used in the [[life extension]] movement.  It is a hypothetical situation in which [[life expectancy]] is being increased faster than time is being expended.  For example, in a given year in which longevity escape velocity would be maintained, technological advances would increase life expectancy more than that year took away by passing by.

==Not immortality==
The terms "[[immortality]]" and "[[eternal youth]]" are often used as synonyms for "indefinite lifespan", but they carry connotations from their other contexts which science has deemed to be impossible. That is, ''immortal'' means "incapable of dying". ''Eternal'' implies guaranteed existence for [[eternity]], and in this context is also implausible because of [[entropy]]. Even if cures were found for all the degenerative diseases, and effective treatments were developed for all the processes of aging, so that bodies could be maintained as easily as cars can be repaired, people would still be killed in [[accident]]s, slain in [[war]]s, [[suicide|choose]] to die, etc.

The term indefinite lifespan represents a more achievable state of affairs, because it merely implies freedom from death by aging or infirmity.

The use of the term is also sometimes favored for reasons of linguistic aesthetics, in the same way that the term [[birth control]] is preferred to "''birth prevention''" or "''birth elimination''" which both imply, as does 'immortality', that the choice is one-time only and has permanent consequences.  Whereas the point of 'indefinite lifespan', like the point of 'birth control', is to gain the opportunity to lead one's life in a more conscious and deliberate manner.

==Probability==
This question is twofold. On the one hand it can be interpreted to mean, "Will a cure (or program of effective treatments) for aging ever be developed?" while on the other hand it could mean "Will the effective treatment of aging become available soon enough for those alive today to take advantage of it?" The answer to the first question is conditional on medical advancement: if medical science continues to advance in the fields of [[biogerontology]] and [[bioengineering]], then some people hope the answer is "yes, that it will happen eventually, except if some event or series of events were to prevent the further advance of biological science" (''see'' [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]] ''and the'' [[Doomsday Clock]]). Many scientists researching this area at the moment do not agree. They see a problem in not just individual diseases but in failure of repair mechanisms alluded to above in the discussion of thermodynamic considerations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

While science is constantly advancing and technology is becoming ever more sophisticated, the human body and mind are only evolving very slowly, and the aging process has not, in that time, become any more damaging (''which, in short, is why we live three times as long on average in the twenty-first century as we did ten thousand years before'').&lt;ref&gt;Cairns J (1997). “Matters of Life and Death” Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. (see pages 8-13) {{ISBN|9780691002507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The answer to the second question depends on two factors: the first being ''how fast'' medical science advances, and the second being ''how well'' each person takes care of themself (such as utilizing the best available [[life extension]] technology or not, and generally eating and behaving in a healthful and non-degrading way), both of which may affect whether or not a given person is still alive when the cure (or set of treatments) becomes available. This strategy is captured in the subtitle "Live Long Enough to Live Forever" of the life extension book ''Fantastic Voyage'', by [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Terry Grossman]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The second factor to the second question hinges on the first factor - no amount of healthy living will enable somebody alive today to reach the point of indefinite lifespan if medical science is curtailed significantly, or if aging turns out to be massively more complex than currently believed. However, if biomedical gerontology continues to improve, if somatic [[Genetic engineering#Gene therapy|genetic engineering]] becomes safe and effective (and is not banned by opponents) within the relatively near future, it may be conceivable for some of those now alive to attain indefinite lifespans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On the theory that the primary cause of aging is DNA damage [see [[DNA damage theory of aging]] and [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]]], there are, in principle, two ways of reducing DNA damage in cells, and thus allowing indefinite extension of lifespan. These are:
# Preventing the occurrence of DNA damage, and
# Repairing the DNA damage after it has occurred.

There is a large body of literature on antioxidant phytochemicals that reduce the occurrence of oxidative DNA damage. However, when intervention trials were carried out using these antioxidants as dietary supplements and cancer as the endpoint, the results generally proved disappointing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Andrew R. |title=Antioxidant intervention as a route to cancer prevention |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=41 |issue=13 |pages=1923–30 |year=2005 |pmid=16111883 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2005.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Christina D. |title=Antioxidants and prevention of gastrointestinal cancers |journal=Current Opinion in Gastroenterology |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=195–200 |year=2013 |pmid=23274317 |doi=10.1097/MOG.0b013e32835c9d1b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there seems to be evidence that certain dietary components stimulate repair of DNA damage, and protect against cancer as an endpoint. One of these is [[chlorogenic acid]], a major component of, and absorbable from, coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Del Rio |first1=Daniele |last2=Stalmach |first2=Angelique |last3=Calani |first3=Luca |last4=Crozier |first4=Alan |title=Bioavailability of Coffee Chlorogenic Acids and Green Tea Flavan-3-ols |journal=Nutrients |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=820–33 |year=2010 |pmid=22254058 |pmc=3257704 |doi=10.3390/nu2080820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee is protective against colorectal cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Guowei |last2=Ma |first2=Defu |last3=Zhang |first3=Yumei |last4=Zheng |first4=Wei |last5=Wang |first5=Peiyu |title=Coffee consumption and risk of colorectal cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies |journal=Public Health Nutrition |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=346–57 |year=2013 |pmid=22694939 |doi=10.1017/S1368980012002601 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and chlorogenic acid and its metabolites increase the protein expression levels of two DNA repair enzymes: Pms2 and PARP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Harris |last1=Bernstein |first2=Cheray |last2=Crowley-Skillicorn |first3=Carol |last3=Bernstein |first4=Katerina |last4=Dvorak |first5=Harinder |last5=Garewal |chapter=Dietary Compounds that Enhance DNA Repair and their Relevance to Cancer and Aging |pages=99–113 |chapterurl={{Google books|KxzvDlS90tUC|page=99|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Breehn R. |editor1-last=Landseer |year=2007 |title=New Research on DNA Repair |isbn=978-1-60021-385-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another compound that protects against the early stages of cancer is [[naringenin]], a citrus [[flavonoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leonardi |first1=T. |last2=Vanamala |first2=J. |last3=Taddeo |first3=S.

He directed the television production of ''One'' for the Dutch national broadcasting company [[Nederlandse Programma Stichting|NPS]]. ''Passage'' (2004), a short film by van der Aa, has been shown at several international festivals and has been aired on Dutch national television.

As a free agent from the Heat, Aagaard opted to continue in the AHL after securing a try-out to attend the [[Springfield Thunderbirds]] training camp. In making a positive impression, Aagaard was signed to a standard one-year deal with the Thunderbirds for the [[2017–18 AHL season|2017–18]] season on October 4, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url =  http://www.springfieldthunderbirds.com/news/detail/thunderbirds-sign-f-aagaard | title = Thunderbirds sign Forward Aagaard | publisher = ''[[Springfield Thunderbirds]]'' | date = 2017-10-04 | accessdate = 2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aagard appeared in 23 games with Springfield before he was re-assigned to ECHL affiliate, the [[Manchester Monarchs (ECHL)|Manchester Monarchs]], then later released from his contract on February 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = https://theahl.com/stats/transactions/411/57?page=1 | title = Springfield Thunderbirds transactions | publisher = ''[[American Hockey League]]'' | date = 2018-02-01 | accessdate = 2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">'''Mortality displacement''' denotes a temporary increase in the [[mortality rate]] (number of deaths) in a given population, also known as '''excess mortality''' or '''excess mortality rate'''. It is usually attributable to environmental phenomena such as [[heat wave]]s, [[wikt:cold snap|cold spell]]s, [[epidemic]]s and [[pandemic]]s, especially [[influenza pandemic]]s, [[famine]] or [[war]].

During heat waves, for instance, there are often additional deaths observed in the population, affecting especially older adults and those who are sick.  After some periods with excess mortality, however, there has also been observed a decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks.  Such short-term forward shift in mortality rate is also referred to as '''harvesting effect'''.  The subsequent, compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that the heat wave had affected especially those whose health is already so compromised that they "would have died in the short term anyway".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1240305/ The Impact of Heat Waves and Cold Spells on Mortality Rates in the Dutch Population]'' Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 109, Number 5, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death march]]es can also lead to a significant mortality displacement, such as in the [[Trail of Tears]], the [[Armenian Genocide]], and the [[Bataan death march]], wherein the oldest, weakest, and sickest died first.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

A '''nanobe''' is a tiny filamental [[structure]] first found in some [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and [[sediment]]s.  Some scientists [[Hypothesis|hypothesize]] that nanobes are the smallest form of [[life]], 1/10 the size of the [[Mycoplasma|smallest known]] [[Bacterium|bacteria]].&lt;ref name=Nanjundiah2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nanjundiah | first =  V. | year = 2000 | title = The smallest form of life yet? | journal = Journal of Biosciences | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–10 | url = http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/archive/00001799/01/25smallest25(1)-9to10mar2000.pdf | doi = 10.1007/BF02985175 | pmid = 10824192 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No conclusive evidence exists that these structures are, or are not, living organisms, so their classification is controversial.

The 1996 discovery of nanobes was published in 1998&lt;ref name=nanobepaper1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Uwins, Philippa, J. R.|url=http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanobes.pdf|title=Novel nano-organisms from Australian sandstones|work= [[American Mineralogist]]| volume=83|pages=1541–1550|year=1998|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Philippa Uwins ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/nanobes/nanophil.html Nanobes: About Philippa Uwins and the Discovery Team]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of Queensland]], [[Australia]]. They were found growing from rock samples (both full-diameter and sidewall cores) of [[Jurassic]] and [[Triassic]] sandstones, originally retrieved from an unspecified number of [[oil exploration]] wells off Australia's west coast. Depths of retrieval were between {{convert|3400|m|mi|1}} and {{convert|5100|m|mi|1}} below the sea bed. While Uwins ''et al.'' present assertions against it, they do not exclude the possibility that the nanobes are from a surface contaminant, not from the rock units cited.

The smallest are just 20 [[Nanometre|nanometers]] in diameter. Some researchers believe that these structures are [[crystal]] growths, but the staining of these structures with dyes that bind to [[DNA]] might indicate that they are living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/nanobes/index.html "Nanobacteria and Nanobes- Are They Alive?"]&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to the structures found in [[ALH84001]], a [[Mars meteorite]] found in the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]]. 
Nanobes are similar in size to [[nanobacteria]], which are also structures that have been proposed to be extremely small living organisms. However, these two should not be confused. Nanobacteria are thought to be cellular organisms, while nanobes are hypothesized to be a previously unknown form of life or [[protocell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Claims ==
{{unsourced section|date=July 2017}}

* It is a living organism (contains [[DNA]] or some analogue, and reproduces).
* Has a [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] similar to [[Actinomycetes]] and [[fungi]].
* Nanobes are about 20 [[Nanometre|nm]] in diameter, which may be too small to contain the basic elements for an organism to exist (DNA, ribosomes, etc.), suggesting that if they grow and reproduce they would need to do so in an unconventional way.
* The [[Martian meteorite]] [[ALH84001]], discovered in 1984 in the [[Antarctic]], contained similar tubular structures which some [[astrobiology|astrobiologists]] suggested could be evidence of life at an earlier time on [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McSween, H. Y. |title=Evidence for life in a martian meteorite? |journal=GSA Today |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=1–7 |year=1997 |pmid=11541665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

A review in ''Microbes and Environments''&lt;ref name=Velimirov2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Velimirov, B. | year = 2001 | title = Nanobacteria, Ultramicrobacteria and Starvation Forms: A Search for the Smallest Metabolizing Bacterium | journal = Microbes and Environments | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 67–77 | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsme2/16/2/16_2_67/_pdf | accessdate = 2008-06-23 | doi = 10.1264/jsme2.2001.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the various ultra-small forms of proposed life states that the main criticism of nanobes is that they appear too small to contain the biochemical machinery needed to sustain life. The review also states that there is no evidence that nanobes are organisms in themselves and not fragments of larger organisms.

Tony Taylor was one of the authors of the original nanobe paper.&lt;ref name=nanobepaper1998 /&gt; He argues that the conspicuous lack of phosphorus in the X-ray spectroscopy data and the failure to find DNA using various DNA amplification techniques demonstrates that nanobes do not have any DNA or RNA. He also argues that they may have a completely different mechanism for heredity, which would account for many of their unusual chemical and physical properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2715">'''Necropolitics''' is the use of [[Power (social and political)|social and political power]] to dictate how some people may live and how some must die.

==Overview==
[[Achille Mbembe]], author of ''[[On the Postcolony]]'', was the first scholar to explore the term in depth in his article of the same name.&lt;ref name="mbembe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mbembe|first1=Achille|authorlink1=Achille Mbembe|title=Necropolitics|journal=Public Culture|date=2003|volume=15|issue=1|pages=11–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Necropolitics is often discussed with [[biopower]], the [[Foucauldian]] term for the use of social and political power to control people's lives.

Mbembe was clear that necropolitics is more than a right to kill (Foucault's ''droit de glaive''), but also the right to expose other people (including a country's own citizens) to death. His view of necropolitics also included the right to impose [[social death|social]] or [[civil death]], the right to enslave others, and other forms of [[political violence]].&lt;ref name="mbembe" /&gt; Necropolitics is a theory of the walking dead, namely a way of analysing how "contemporary forms of subjugation of life to the power of death"&lt;ref name="mbembe" /&gt; forces some bodies to remain in different states of being located between life and death. Mbembe uses the examples of slavery, apartheid, the colonisation of Palestine and the figure of the suicide bomber to show how different forms of necropower over the body (statist, racialised, a state of exception, urgency, martyrdom) reduce people to precarious conditions of life.

==Queer necropolitics==
[[Jasbir Puar]] coined the term ''queer necropolitics'' to analyze the [[post-9/11]] queer outrage regarding [[gay bashing]] and simultaneous queer complicity with [[Islamophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Puar|first1=Jasbir K.|title=Terrorist assemblages : homonationalism in queer times|date=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=9780822340942|pages=32–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars use Puar's queer necropolics in conjunction with [[Judith Butler]]'s concept of a grievable life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Judith|title=Precarious life : the powers of mourning and violence|date=2004|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=978-1844670055|pages=20–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer necropolitics is the subject of an anthology from [[Routledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Haritaworn|editor1-first=Jin|editor2-last=Kuntsman|editor2-first=Adi|editor3-last=Posocco|editor3-first=Silvia|title=Queer necropolitics|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415644761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">An '''obligation''' is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether [[legal obligation|legal]] or [[moral obligation|moral]].  There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of [[etiquette]], [[social]] obligations, [[religious]] and possibly in terms of [[politics]], where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally [[legal]] obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a [[tradition]] or for social reasons.

Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bear, ''Sacred Journey of the Medicine Wheel'' (2008), p. 393: "Adults have more obligations and are held to higher standards of accountability than children are".&lt;/ref&gt; Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.  For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit is not blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.

The word "obligation" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.

==Other uses==
The term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is [[facultative]], meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family [[Proteidae]] are obligate [[paedomorphs]], whereas species belonging to the [[Ambystomatidae]] are facultative paedomorphs.

In the Catholic Church, [[Holy Days of Obligation]] or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]].

In [[biology]], '''offspring''' are the young born of living [[organism]]s, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of [[sexual reproduction]], two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a '''brood''' or '''progeny''' in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the [[bird|chicks]] hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the [[brood (honeybee)|honeybee]].

Human offspring ([[kinship and descent|descendants]]) are referred to as [[child]]ren (without reference to age, thus one can refer to a parent's "[[minor (law)|minor]] children" or "[[adult]] children" or "[[infant|infant children]]" or "[[Teenagers|teenage children]]" depending on their age); male children are [[son]]s and female children are [[daughter]]s (see [[kinship and descent]]). Offspring can occur after mating or after [[artificial insemination]].

Offspring contains many parts and properties that are precise and accurate in what they consist of, and what they define. As the offspring of a new species, also known as a child or f1 generation, consist of genes of the father and the mother, which is also known as the parent generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these offspring contains numerous genes which have coding for specific tasks and properties. Males and females both contribute equally to the genotypes of their offspring, in which gametes fuse and form. An important aspect of the formation of the parent offspring is the chromosome, which is a structure of DNA which contains many genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To focus more on the offspring and how it results in the formation of the f1 generation, is an inheritance called sex-linkage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a gene which is located on the sex chromosome and patterns of these inheritance differ in both male and female. The explanation that proves the theory of the offspring having genes from both parent generations, is proven through a process called crossing-over, which consists of taking genes from the male chromosomes and genes from the female chromosome, resulting in a process of [[meiosis]] occurring, and leading to the splitting of the chromosomes evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/what_is_gene.html|title=what is a gene|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on which genes are dominantly expressed in the gene will result in the sex of the offspring. The female will always give an X chromosome, whereas the male, depending on the situation, will either give an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. If a male offspring is produced, the gene will consist of an X and a Y chromosome. If two X chromosomes are expressed and produced, it produces a female offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/what_is_gene.html|title=what is a gene|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning is the production of an offspring which represents the identical genes as its parent. Reproductive cloning begins with the removal of the nucleus from an egg, which holds the genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precaution.org/lib/cloned_animals.nejm.041230.pdf|title=cloning|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to clone an organ, a stem cell is to be produced and then utilized to clone that specific organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precaution.org/lib/cloned_animals.nejm.041230.pdf|title=cloning|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common misconception of cloning is that it produces an exact copy of the parent being cloned. Cloning copies the DNA/genes of the parent and then creates a genetic duplicate. The clone will not be a similar copy as he or she will grow up in different surroundings from the parent and may encounter different opportunities and experiences. Although mostly positive, cloning also faces some setbacks in terms of ethics and human health. Though cell division and DNA replication is a vital part of survival, there are many steps involved and mutations can occur with permanent change in an organism's and their offspring's DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnemstudio.org/genetic-algorithms-mutation.htm|title=mutation|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mutations can be good as they result in random evolution periods in which may be good for the species, but most mutations are bad as they can change the genotypes of offspring, which can result in changes that harm the species.

As of this writing, a physics engine called [[Sibernetic]] has been built for the project and models of the neural [[connectome]] and a muscle cell have been created in [[NeuroML]] format.

__TOC__

== Background: ''C. elegans'' ==
The roundworm ''C. elegans'' has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its [[hermaphrodite]] type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural [[connectome]] of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a ''C. elegans'' worm, and because ''C. Elegans'' is a [[model organism]], each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism.

In the process of trying to build an "in silico" model of a relatively simple organism like ''C. elegans'', new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms.

===NemaLoad===

Project Nemaload &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121007022842/http://nemaload.davidad.org/ NemaLoad]&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, [[David Dalrymple (computer scientist)|David Dalrymple]], is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project.

==OpenWorm project==

Although the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of ''C. elegans''' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the Open Worm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus &gt; Sensory Transduction &gt; Interneuron Firing &gt; Motor Neuron Firing &gt; Motor Output &gt; Environmental Change &gt; Sensory Transduction.

There are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]], and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm.

The OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like [[digestion]]) which the team will tackle at a later time.

The team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in [[NeuroML]]. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of ''C. elegans''.

Using NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above.

The next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect.

The rough plan is to then both:
* Approximate the synapses which synapse on those neurons
* Repeat the process for other muscle cells

===Progress===
As of January 2015, the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are "only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/ |title=Scientists upload a worm's mind into a Lego robot |work=CNN |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|last2=Hamahashi|first2=Shugo|last3=Luke|first3=Sean|date=April 1998|title=The Perfect C.

In 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf |title=A dynamic body model of the Nematode C. elegans with neural oscillators |journal=Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=2005 |first1=Michiyo |last1=Suzuki |first2=Takeshi |last2=Goto |first3=Toshio |last3=Tsuji |first4=Hisao |last4=Ohtake |pages=318–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Michiyo|last2=Tsuji|first2=Toshio|last3=Ohtake|first3=Hisao|date=September 2005|title=A model of motor control of the nematode C. elegans with neuronal circuits|url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|volume=35|issue=1-2|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2005.01.008|issn=0933-3657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a "sense-process-react" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Paul |last=Frenger |title=Simple C. elegans Nervous System Emulator |conference=Houston Conference for Biomedical Engineering Research |date=2005 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the [[synaptic weight]]s at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system.

==Open science==
The Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of [[open science]]. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source.

Open Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred "members" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses "virtual lab meetings" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22704">'''Ovarian follicle activation''' can be defined as [[primordial follicles]] in the ovary moving from a quiescent (inactive) to a growing phase. The primordial follicle in the [[oocyte]] is what makes up the “pool” of follicles that will be induced to enter growth and developmental changes that change them into pre-ovulatory follicles, ready to be released during [[ovulation]]. The process of development from a primordial follicle to a pre-ovulatory follicle is called [[folliculogenesis]].

Activation of the primordial follicle involves the following: a morphological change from flattened to cuboidal [[granulosa cell]]s, proliferation of granulosa cells, formation of the protective [[zona pellucida]] layer, and growth of the oocyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braw-Tal|first=Ruth|title=The initiation of follicle growth: the oocyte or the somatic cells?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0303-7207(01)00699-2|journal=Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology|volume=187|issue=1-2|pages=11–18|doi=10.1016/s0303-7207(01)00699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely understood that androgens act primarily on preantral follicles and that this activity is important for preantral follicle growth. Additionally, it is thought that androgens are involved in primordial follicle activation. However, the influence of androgens on primordial follicle recruitment and whether this response is primary or secondary is still uncertain.

== Activation of Primordial Follicle Development ==
Primordial follicles are activated to grow into [[antral follicle]]s. Communication between the oocytes and the surrounding somatic cells, such as the granulosa cells and the [[theca cells]], is involved in the control of primordial follicle activation. There are various activator signalling pathways that are involved in the control of ovarian follicle activation, including: [[Neurotrophin|Neurotropin]], [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) and its tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK1), [[Neurotrophin-4|neurotrophin 4]] (NT4), [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) and their receptor NTRK2. Additional ligands have a role in facilitating primordial follicle activation such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-B), [[Growth differentiation factor-9|growth differentiation factor 9]] (GDF9) and [[Bone morphogenetic protein|bone morphogenic protein]] 15 (BMP15).

=== GDF9 ===
Follicular activation rate is increased in experiments where recombinant GDF9 is added. Additionally, in vitro addition of GDF9 to human ovarian cortical tissue causes enhanced activation and follicular survival. Removing GDF9 from mice, through knock-out experiments, halts follicle progression beyond the first stage, and prevents granulosa cell proliferation. However, these GDF9 null mice have accelerated oocyte growth, suggesting that GDF9 is partially responsible for granulosa cell recruitment, as well as inhibiting oocyte growth.  GDF9 promotes follicular survival and growth as a result of dampened granulosa apoptosis and follicular atresia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jin Yeong|date=March 2012|title=Control of ovarian primordial follicle activation|journal=Clinical and Experimental Reproductive Medicine|volume=39|issue=1|pages=10–14|doi=10.5653/cerm.2012.39.1.10|issn=2233-8233|pmc=3341446|pmid=22563545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TGF-β ===
As discussed above TGF-β ligands, for example BMP4 and 7 have a role in follicular activation. SMADS are downstream molecules of the TGF-β signalling pathway, hence rely on TGF-β for activation. In the absence of SMADs, mice have decreased folliculogenesis, with decreased quantities of primordial follicles, as well as developed adult follicles at both developmental stages. BMP15 has been shown to stimulate granulosa cell growth by encouraging proliferation of undifferentiated granulosa cells. This is not dependent on FSH. It was shown that two proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), are regulated by these factors. Additionally, PCNA has been suggested to act as a key regulator of ovarian follicle development. The temporal expression of PCNA in oocytes is coincident with the start of primordial follicle formation. PCNA promotes apoptosis of oocytes, which regulates primordial follicle assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/insights-from-animal-reproduction/the-primordial-to-primary-follicle-transition-a-reliable-marker-of-ovarian-function|title=The Primordial to Primary Follicle Transition — A Reliable Marker of Ovarian Function|last=Duda|first=Malgorzata|last2=Grzesiak|first2=Malgorzata|last3=Knet-Seweryn|first3=Malgorzata|last4=Tabarowski|first4=Zbigniew|date=2016|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/62138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Forkhead box L2|Foxl2]] ===
Another molecule that has been implicated in the activation of oocyte follicles is Forkhead boxL2 (Foxl2). In knock out studies, it has been shown that Foxl2 may be responsible for the cuboidal transition of the pre-granulosa cells. Hence, when Foxl2 is removed, the primordial follicles are unable to develop into secondary follicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sohlh1 ===
Spermatogenesis-and-oogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix containing protein 1 (Sohlh1) is expressed within germ cell clusters and in new primordial follicles. Knock out studies of this protein in mice show a reduced number of oocytes present at 7 weeks post birth and a malfunction in the transition from primordial to primary follicle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Repression of Primordial Follicle Activation==
===[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]===
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumour suppressor gene]] whose actions directly affect the activation of primordial follicles. It does this by negatively controlling the [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This particular action of PTEN was initially discovered in an experiment using PTEN knockout mice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The absence of PTEN within the primordial follicles lead to an increase in AKT phosphorylation. This then creates a subsequent rise in FOXO3 export, as AKT is no longer inhibiting its production.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsueh|first=Aaron J. W.|last2=Kawamura|first2=Kazuhiro|last3=Cheng|first3=Yuan|last4=Fauser|first4=Bart C. J. M.|date=February 2015|title=Intraovarian control of early folliculogenesis|journal=Endocrine Reviews|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1210/er.2015.36.issue-1.edboard|issn=1945-7189|pmc=4309737|pmid=25202833}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to over-activation of the primordial follicles, which resulted in a premature decline of the primordial follicle pool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===[[FOXO3|Foxo3]]===
When Foxo3 is KO in mice models a huge uncontrolled activation of follicles is seen thus the mouse ovaries are deficient of the entire pool of primordial follicles because they have been prematurely activated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This action is regulated by phosphorylation, the unphosphorylated form is transcriptionally active in the nucleus. However, when phosphorylation occurs the protein is transported to the cytoplasm and loses its transcriptional activity. Pelosi et al. noted that the timing and level of the Foxo3 expression is very important to regulate ovarian follicle activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelosi|first=Emanuele|last2=Omari|first2=Shakib|last3=Michel|first3=Marc|last4=Ding|first4=Jun|last5=Amano|first5=Tomokazu|last6=Forabosco|first6=Antonino|last7=Schlessinger|first7=David|last8=Ottolenghi|first8=Chris|date=2013-05-14|title=Constitutively active Foxo3 in oocytes preserves ovarian reserve in mice|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2861|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=4|pages=ncomms2861|doi=10.1038/ncomms2861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AKt- PTEN-AKt and Foxo3 are all involved in the same pathway. PTEN is situated upstream of AKt. Therefore, if PTEN is deleted specifically from an oocyte this causes an increase in AKt activity resulting in large numbers of dormant ovarian follicles resuming their growth and differentiation.  The TSC complex also plays an important role in this pathways by suppressing the activity of mTOR which has been proven to be essential for maintaining dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Xinbo|last2=Tang|first2=Naimei|last3=Hadden|first3=Timothy J.|last4=Rishi|first4=Arun K.|date=November 2011|title=Akt, FoxO and regulation of apoptosis|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1813|issue=11|pages=1978–1986|doi=10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.03.010|issn=0006-3002|pmid=21440011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TSC and mTOR===
Tuberin/tuberous sclerosis complex is also thought to be important in the regulation of primordial follicle activation. TSC negatively controls the function of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). TSC knockout mice have a raised level of [[mTORC1]] activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Liu|first3=Kui|date=February 2010|title=Mechanisms maintaining the dormancy and survival of mammalian primordial follicles|journal=Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=21|issue=2|pages=96–103|doi=10.1016/j.tem.2009.10.001|issn=1879-3061|pmid=19913438}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppressing mTORC1 is a necessary process to prevent primordial follicles from being prematurely activated and therefore premature ovarian insufficiency.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Flohr|first2=Gilian|last3=Gorre|first3=Nagaraju|last4=Shen|first4=Yan|last5=Yang|first5=Hairu|last6=Lundin|first6=Eva|last7=Lan|first7=Zijian|last8=Gambello|first8=Michael J.|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=December 2009|title=Disruption of Tsc2 in oocytes leads to overactivation of the entire pool of primordial follicles|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=15|issue=12|pages=765–770|doi=10.1093/molehr/gap092|issn=1460-2407|pmid=19843635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AMH===
AMH ([[Anti-Müllerian hormone|Anti-mullerian Hormone]]) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), that has a very important role in regulating both testicular and ovarian function. In the first instance AMH inhibits the initial enrollment of the resting primordial follicles. Secondly AMH prevents the regulation of preantral/small antral follicle growth by reducing their responsiveness to FSH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Hsun-Ming|last2=Klausen|first2=Christian|last3=Leung|first3=Peter C.

P27 inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=M. B.|date=September 2000|title=P27 in cell cycle control and cancer|journal=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma|volume=39|issue=1-2|pages=19–27|doi=10.3109/10428190009053535|issn=1042-8194|pmid=10975380}}&lt;/ref&gt; by preventing the action of cyclin E-Cdk2.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to its’ important role in the cell cycle, it is found within the nucleus of mice oocytes in primordial and primary follicles. During puberty of p27 knock out mice, all primordial follicles are activated and leads to POF. This indicates that p27 is a vital regulator in maintaining a quiescent state in primordial follicles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Medical Consequences ==

=== Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) ===
[[Premature ovarian failure]] (POF), or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is a female reproductive disorder characterised by at least 4 months of primary or secondary [[amenorrhea]], before the age of 40.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Chevy|last2=Cree|first2=Lynsey|last3=Shelling|first3=Andrew N|date=2015-09-23|title=The genetics of premature ovarian failure: current perspectives|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|volume=7|pages=799–810|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S64024|issn=1179-1411|pmc=4590549|pmid=26445561}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by either a decrease in the primordial follicle pool, accelerated [[atresia]] of follicles or altered maturation or recruitment of primordial follicles and is associated with menopausal levels of follicle stimulating hormones, exceeding 40 Ul/L.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persani|first=Luca|last2=Rossetti|first2=Raffaella|last3=Cacciatore|first3=Chiara|date=November 2010|title=Genes involved in human premature ovarian failure|journal=Journal of Molecular Endocrinology|volume=45|issue=5|pages=257–279|doi=10.1677/JME-10-0070|issn=1479-6813|pmid=20668067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific activator and suppressor genes are implicated in ovarian follicle activation and recent research suggests that POF may be the consequence of a genetic mutation in one or more of these genes.

[[FOXL2]] - FOXL2 [[knockout mouse]] models showed failure of [[granulosa cell]] differentiation, which led to the premature activation and depletion of primordial follicles, characteristic of POF. Two different variations of mutations in the FOXL2 gene, which cause different forms of POF, one with earlier onset and the other with later onset and incomplete penetrance, have been identified.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=S. E.|last2=Chand|first2=A. L.|last3=Winship|first3=I. M.|last4=Gersak|first4=K.|last5=Aittomäki|first5=K.|last6=Shelling|first6=A. N.|date=August 2002|title=Identification of novel mutations in FOXL2 associated with premature ovarian failure|journal=Molecular Human Reproduction|volume=8|issue=8|pages=729–733|issn=1360-9947|pmid=12149404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, mutations in the FOXL2 gene have been found in approximately 5% of nonsyndromic POF patients, which suggests that FOXL2 mutations are also associated with idiopathic POF.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

BMP15 and [[Growth differentiation factor-9|GDF9]] - Mutations in BMP15 and GDF9 genes can be involved in POF, but are not major causes of the disease. For example, low GDF9 mutation frequency has been found in a large cohort of Indian cases of POF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laissue|first=Paul|last2=Christin-Maitre|first2=Sophie|last3=Touraine|first3=Philippe|last4=Kuttenn|first4=Frederique|last5=Ritvos|first5=Olli|last6=Aittomaki|first6=Kristiina|last7=Bourcigaux|first7=Nathalie|last8=Jacquesson|first8=Laetitia|last9=Bouchard|first9=Philippe|date=May 2006|title=Mutations and sequence variants in GDF9 and BMP15 in patients with premature ovarian failure|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|volume=154|issue=5|pages=739–744|doi=10.1530/eje.1.02135|issn=0804-4643|pmid=16645022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOHLH1 - Little is known about the causative association of SOHLH1 and POF, however three novel SOHLH1 variants have been found to potentially cause the disease and when studied, they were absent in controls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

AMH - A decrease in AMH expression in POF [[antral follicle]]s leads to defective antral development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Méduri|first=G.|last2=Massin|first2=N.|last3=Guibourdenche|first3=J.|last4=Bachelot|first4=A.|last5=Fiori|first5=O.|last6=Kuttenn|first6=F.|last7=Misrahi|first7=M.|last8=Touraine|first8=P.|date=January 2007|title=Serum anti-Müllerian hormone expression in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Human Reproduction (Oxford, England)|volume=22|issue=1|pages=117–123|doi=10.1093/humrep/del346|issn=0268-1161|pmid=16954410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[mTORC1]] and [[PI3K]] - Deregulation of mTORC1 and PI3K signaling pathways in oocytes results in ovarian pathological conditions, including POF and subsequent infertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|last2=Zheng|first2=Wenjing|last3=Shen|first3=Yan|last4=Gorre|first4=Nagaraju|last5=Hämäläinen|first5=Tuula|last6=Cooney|first6=Austin J.|last7=Huhtaniemi|first7=Ilpo|last8=Lan|first8=Zi-Jian|last9=Liu|first9=Kui|date=2010-02-01|title=Tsc/mTORC1 signaling in oocytes governs the quiescence and activation of primordial follicles|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–410|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp483|issn=1460-2083|pmc=2798719|pmid=19843540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] - Studies of mice with a deletion in PTEN in the oocytes showed early activation of the entire pool of primordial follicles, leading to a lack of primordial follicles in adulthood, resulting in a POF phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Pradeep|last2=Liu|first2=Lian|last3=Adhikari|first3=Deepak|last4=Jagarlamudi|first4=Krishna|last5=Rajareddy|first5=Singareddy|last6=Shen|first6=Yan|last7=Du|first7=Chun|last8=Tang|first8=Wenli|last9=Hämäläinen|first9=Tuula|date=2008-02-01|title=Oocyte-specific deletion of Pten causes premature activation of the primordial follicle pool|journal=Science|volume=319|issue=5863|pages=611–613|doi=10.1126/science.1152257|issn=1095-9203|pmid=18239123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuang|first=Haibin|last2=Zhang|first2=Li|last3=Peng|first3=Jing|last4=Chen|first4=Qi|date=December 2009|title=Premature ovarian failure, menopause and ovarian cancer, three nodes on the same string: Pten and other potential genes on the go|journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]]|volume=73|issue=6|pages=961–962|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2009.06.023|issn=1532-2777|pmid=19733443}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

[[FOXO3|Foxo3a]] - Studies into mice with complete and partial Foxo3a deletions also showed premature activation of the entire primordial follicle pool, destroying the ovarian reserve and leading to oocyte death. This led to a POF phenotype, seen in studies in a range of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watkins|first=Wendy J.|last2=Umbers|first2=Alexandra J.|last3=Woad|first3=Kathryn J.|last4=Harris|first4=Sarah E.|last5=Winship|first5=Ingrid M.|last6=Gersak|first6=Ksenija|last7=Shelling|first7=Andrew N.|date=November 2006|title=Mutational screening of FOXO3A and FOXO1A in women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1518–1521|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2006.03.054|issn=1556-5653|pmid=16979636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Binbin|last2=Mu|first2=Yuan|last3=Ni|first3=Feng|last4=Zhou|first4=Sirui|last5=Wang|first5=Jing|last6=Cao|first6=Yunxia|last7=Ma|first7=Xu|date=April 2010|title=Analysis of FOXO3 mutation in 114 Chinese women with premature ovarian failure|journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=20|issue=4|pages=499–503|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2010.01.008|issn=1472-6491|pmid=20219431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSC - In the oocytes of [[TSC2|Tsc2]] knockout mice, elevated mTORC1 activity causes the pool of primordial follicles to become activated prematurely. This results in follicle depletion in early adulthood, causing POF.&lt;ref name="Adhikari 765–770"/&gt;

=== [[Chemotherapy]] and Ovarian Follicle Activation ===

As well as having many genetic causes, [[premature ovarian failure]] has been shown to be a side effect of many chemotherapeutic agents.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalich-Philosoph|first=Lital|last2=Roness|first2=Hadassa|last3=Carmely|first3=Alon|last4=Fishel-Bartal|first4=Michal|last5=Ligumsky|first5=Hagai|last6=Paglin|first6=Shoshana|last7=Wolf|first7=Ido|last8=Kanety|first8=Hannah|last9=Sredni|first9=Benjamin|date=2013-05-15|title=Cyclophosphamide triggers follicle activation and "burnout"; AS101 prevents follicle loss and preserves fertility|journal=Science Translational Medicine|volume=5|issue=185|pages=185ra62|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3005402|issn=1946-6242|pmid=23677591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage suffered by ovaries appears to be [[Dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]], and a class of chemotherapy drugs known as [[alkylating agents]], seem to cause the most damage to the ovary and follicles. There are two ways in which this damage occurs:
# By direct damage to the primordial follicle, causing cell death by toxicity
# By indirect damage to the [[stromal cell]]s which surround the follicle and support it, to allow it to grow. Loss of these supporting cells then leads to death of the follicle.
Chemotherapeutic agents, such as Cyclophosphamide, have been shown to activate the PI3K/PTEN/Akr pathway, which is the main pathway involved in keeping the follicles dormant and permitting them to grow - activation of this pathway encourages more primordial follicles to grow and develop.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These growing follicles may then be destroyed in subsequent rounds of chemotherapy, which often target growing cells, which will then cause more primordial follicles to differentiate and grow to replace the destroyed cells. This concept, known as burnout, leads to a depletion of the ovarian reserve and results in premature ovarian failure.

===[[Oocyte cryopreservation]]===

Oocyte cryopreservation is a preservative process which can be used as a way of preserving fertility in children treated for childhood or adolescent cancer, and to avoid the damage caused to the ovaries caused by cytotoxic drugs often used in chemotherapy.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnez|first=Jacques|last2=Dolmans|first2=Marie-Madeleine|last3=Pellicer|first3=Antonio|last4=Diaz-Garcia|first4=Cesar|last5=Sanchez Serrano|first5=Maria|last6=Schmidt|first6=Kristen Tryde|last7=Ernst|first7=Erik|last8=Luyckx|first8=Valérie|last9=Andersen|first9=Claus Yding|date=May 2013|title=Restoration of ovarian activity and pregnancy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue: a review of 60 cases of reimplantation|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=99|issue=6|pages=1503–1513|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.03.030|issn=1556-5653|pmid=23635349}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several methods of [[cryopreservation]], each with different levels of effectiveness. After cryopreservation, the ovarian tissue must be placed back into the patient, in order to allow the ovary to function normally again and regain fertility.

=== Restoration of Ovarian Activity after Cryopreservation ===

Restoration of the ovarian function occurs in almost all cases of cryopreservation, but it takes a while for the ovarian follicles to regain full function. In all cases of successful function restoration, it took 3.5-6.5 months after reimplantation before a rise in [[oestrogen]], a key hormone produced by the ovary, and a decrease in [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) were detected. The variation in time difference may be due to differences in the follicular reserves in the women at the time of cryopreservation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3045">'''Paratomy''' is a form of [[asexual reproduction]] in animals where the organism splits in a plane perpendicular to the [[antero-posteriorly|antero-posterior axis]] and the split is preceded by the "pregeneration" of the anterior structures in the posterior portion.The developing organisms have their body axis aligned i.e. they develop in a head to tail fashion.

[[Budding]] can be considered to be similar to paratomy except that the body axes need not be aligned: the new head may grow toward the side or even point backward (e.g. ''[[Convolutriloba retrogemma]]'' an [[acoela|acoel]] flat worm).&lt;ref name=Akesson2001&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1046/j.1463-6395.2001.00084.x| issn = 1463-6395| volume = 82| issue = 3| pages = 231–239| last = Åkesson| first = Bertil|author2=Robert Gschwentner |author3=Jan Hendelberg |author4=Peter Ladurner |author5=Johann Müller |author6=Reinhard Rieger | title = Fission in ''Convolutriloba longifissura'': asexual reproduction in acoelous turbellarians revisited| journal = Acta Zoologica| accessdate = 2011-07-13| date = 2001-12-01| url = http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c719135/pdf/Akesson-Gschwentner-2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1002/bdrc.20135| issn = 1542-9768| volume = 84| issue = 4| pages = 257–264| last = Egger| first = Bernhard| title = Regeneration: rewarding, but potentially risky| journal = Birth Defects Research.

'''''Phaedon''''' ({{lang-de|Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele}}), published in 1767, is a book by the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]], in which Mendelssohn offers a defense of [[immortality]].&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Lenn E. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
''Phaedon'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul.&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Popkind"&gt;{{cite book |author=Popkin, Richard H. |editor=Audi, Robert |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1999 |isbn=0-521-63722-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue [[Phaedo]], in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including [[Plotinus]], [[Descartes]], and [[Leibniz]], argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the ''Phaedon'', Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that [[Kant]] calls ''the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology''). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.

==Reception==
Materialistic views were at the time rampant and fashionable, and faith in immortality was at a low ebb. At this favourable juncture appeared Phädon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (Phaedo or On the Immortality of Souls; 1767). Modelled on [[Plato]]'s dialogue of the same name, Mendelssohn's work possessed some of the charm of its Greek exemplar and impressed the German world with its beauty and lucidity of style. The Phaedon was an immediate success, and besides being one of the most widely read books of its time in German it was speedily translated into several European languages, including English. The author was hailed as the "German Plato," or the "German Socrates"; royal and other aristocratic friends showered attentions on him, and it was said that "no stranger who came to Berlin failed to pay his personal respects to the German Socrates."

[[Immanuel Kant]] criticized Mendelssohn's argument for immortality in the second edition of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787), at B413–15. Commentators disagree over whether Kant's criticism is successful. Mendelssohn's arguments have been largely overlooked by contemporary analytic philosophers, but philosophers including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[E.J. Lowe]] have offered arguments for the simplicity of the soul.

'''Polyworld''' is a cross-platform ([[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]]) program written by [[Larry Yaeger]] to evolve [[Artificial Intelligence]] through [[natural selection]] and [[evolutionary algorithm]]s. 

It uses the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] graphics toolkit and [[OpenGL]] to display a graphical environment in which a population of trapezoid agents search for food, mate, have offspring, and prey on each other. The population is typically only in the hundreds, as each individual is rather complex and the environment consumes considerable computer resources. The graphical environment is necessary since the individuals actually move around the 2-D [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] and must be able to "see." Since some basic abilities, like eating carcasses or randomly generated food, seeing other individuals, mating or fighting with them, etc., are possible, a number of interesting behaviours have been observed to spontaneously arise after prolonged evolution, such as cannibalism, predators and prey, and mimicry.

Each individual makes decisions based on a [[neural net]] using [[Hebbian learning]]; the neural net is derived from each individual's genome. The genome does not merely specify the wiring of the neural nets, but also determines their size, speed, color, [[mutation rate]] and a number of other factors. The [[genome]] is randomly mutated at a set probability, which are also changed in descendant organisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14878">"'''Precambrian rabbits'''" or "'''fossil rabbits in the Precambrian'''" are reported to have been among responses given by the biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] when asked what [[evidence]] could destroy his confidence in the [[theory of evolution]] and the field of study. The answers became popular [[image]]ry in debates about evolution and the scientific field of [[evolutionary biology]] in the 1990s. Many of Haldane's statements about his scientific research were popularized in his lifetime.

Some accounts use this response to rebut claims that the [[theory]] of evolution is [[Objections to evolution#Evolution is unfalsifiable|not falsifiable]] by any [[empirical evidence]]. This followed an assertion by philosopher, [[Karl Popper]], who had proposed that [[Falsifiability|''falsifiability'']] is an essential feature of a scientific theory. Popper also expressed doubts about the scientific status of evolutionary theory, although he later concluded that the field of study was genuinely scientific.

[[Rabbits]] are [[mammal]]s. From the perspective of the [[philosophy of science]], it is doubtful whether the genuine discovery of mammalian [[fossil]]s in [[Precambrian]] rocks would overthrow the theory of evolution instantly, though if authentic, such a discovery would indicate serious errors in modern understanding about the evolutionary process. Mammals are a class of animals whose emergence in the [[geologic timescale]] is dated to much later than any found in Precambrian strata. Geological records indicate that although the first true mammals appeared in the [[Triassic]] period, modern mammalian orders appeared in the [[Palaeocene]] and [[Eocene]] epochs of the [[Palaeogene]] period. Hundreds of millions of years separate this period from the Precambrian.

==Origin of the phrase==

Several authors have written that J.B.S. Haldane (1892–1964) said that the discovery of a [[fossil]] [[rabbit]] in Precambrian rocks would be enough to destroy his belief in [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Ridley2004Evolution"&gt;{{cite book

==Theoretical background==
The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] held that any scientific proposition must be falsifiable, in other words it must at least be possible to [[thought experiment|imagine some reproducible experiment or observation]] whose outcome would disprove the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" /&gt; Initially he thought that [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]] (often summarized as "the survival of the fittest"&lt;ref name=OriginCh4&gt;"This preservation of favourable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest." &amp;mdash; {{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 1978 Popper wrote that his earlier objection had been specifically to the theory of natural selection, in lectures and articles from 1949 to 1974 he had stated that "[[Darwinism]]" or "Darwin's theory of evolution" was a "metaphysical research programme" because it was not falsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact he continued to express dissatisfaction with contemporary statements of the theory of evolution which focused on [[population genetic]]s, the study of the relative frequencies of [[allele]]s (different forms of the same [[gene]]). Unfortunately some of the adjustments he proposed resembled [[Lamarckianism]] or [[saltation (biology)|saltationism]], evolutionary theories that were and still are considered obsolete, and evolutionary biologists therefore disregarded his criticisms.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper"&gt;{{cite journal

| pages=481 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 Popper complained that he had been misinterpreted as saying that "historical sciences" such as [[paleontology]] or the [[evolutionary history of life|history of evolution of life on Earth]] were not genuine sciences, when in fact he believed they could make falsifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further confusion arose in 1980–1981, when there was a long debate in the pages of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' about the scientific status of the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Editorial |title= How true is the theory of evolution? |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 290|issue= 5802 | pages= 75–76 |year= 1981 |pmid=7207599|doi= 10.1038/290075a0|bibcode= 1981Natur.290...75.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book| author= Johnson PE|title= Darwin on Trial|year= 2010 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YtrGVVwk5HsC&amp;dq |page= 238 | publisher=  InterVarsity Press |isbn= 9780830838318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the argument was on the factors influencing and nature of the [[unit of selection]] in the genome, with one side positing natural selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orgel LE, Crick FH |title= Selfish DNA: the ultimate parasite |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 284|issue= 5757 | pages=604–607  |year=1980  |pmid=7366731 |doi= 10.1038/284604a0|bibcode=1980Natur.284..604O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cavalier-Smith T |title= How selfish is DNA? |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 285|issue= 5767 | pages=617–618  |year=1980  |pmid= 7393317 |doi= 10.1038/285617a0|bibcode= 1980Natur.285..617C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other, [[Neutral mutation theory|neutral mutation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dover G, Doolittle WF |title= Modes of genome evolution |url= |journal= Nature |volume=288|issue= 5792 | pages= 646–647 |year=1980 |pmid= 6256636|doi= 10.1038/288646a0|bibcode=1980Natur.288..646D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li WH, Gojobori T, Nei M |title= Pseudogenes as a paradigm of neutral evolution |url= |journal= Nature |volume=292|issue= 5820 | pages= 237–239 |year=1981 |pmid= 7254315|doi= 10.1038/292237a0|bibcode=1981Natur.292..237L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of the parties seriously doubted that the theory was both scientific and, according to current scientific knowledge, true. Some participants objected to statements that appeared to present the theory of evolution as an absolute dogma, however, rather than as a hypothesis that so far has performed very well, and both sides quoted Popper in support of their positions. Evolution critics such as [[Phillip E. Johnson]] took this as an opportunity to declare that the theory of evolution was unscientific.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" /&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

==Would anachronistic fossils disprove evolution?==
Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] said that the discovery of [[fossil mammal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in Precambrian rocks would "completely blow evolution out of the water."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news 
| title=The Evolution Wars | author=Wallis, C. | newspaper=Time | date= August 7, 2005 
| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1090909-6,00.html | accessdate=2008-10-29 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] doubted that a single set of [[anachronistic]] fossils, however, even rabbits in the Precambrian, would disprove the theory of evolution outright. The first question raised by the assertion of such a discovery would be whether the alleged "Precambrian rabbits" really were fossilized rabbits. Alternative interpretations might include incorrect identification of the "fossils", incorrect dating of the rocks, and a [[hoax]] such as the [[Piltdown Man]] was shown to be. Even if the "Precambrian rabbits" turned out to be genuine, they would not instantly refute the theory of evolution, because that theory is a large package of ideas, including: that life on Earth has evolved over billions of years; that this evolution is driven by certain mechanisms; and that these mechanisms have produced a specific "family tree" that defines the relationships among species and the order in which they appeared. Hence, "Precambrian rabbits" would prove that there were one or more serious errors somewhere in this package, and the next task would be to identify those errors.&lt;ref name="GodfreySmith2003TheoryAndReality" /&gt;

Benton pointed out that, in the short term, scientists often have to accept the existence of competing hypotheses, each of which explains large parts&amp;mdash;but not all&amp;mdash;of the observed relevant data.&lt;ref name="BentonHitchin1996QualityOfFossilRecord" /&gt;

==Oldest rabbit==

Genuine fossils of earliest rabbits are from the [[Eocene]] [[epoch (geology)|Epoch]], about 56 to 33.9 million years ago. Members of the [[genus]] ''[[Gomphos]]'' are established to be the [[phylogenetic]] root of [[lagomorph]] rabbits and hares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Asher RJ, Meng J, Wible JR, McKenna MC, Rougier GW, Dashzeveg D, Novacek MJ |url= |title=Stem Lagomorpha and the antiquity of ''Glires'' | journal=Science |volume= 307|issue=5712 |pages= 1091–1094| year= 2005|pmid=15718468 |doi=10.1126/science.1107808|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1091A}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the oldest ''Gomphos'' is ''G. elkema'' discovered in 2008 from [[Gujarat]], [[India]].

[[File:Sexual cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|In the first stage of sexual reproduction, "meiosis", the number of chromosomes is reduced from a [[diploid]] number (2n) to a [[haploid]] number (n). During "fertilization", haploid gametes come together to form a diploid zygote and the original number of chromosomes is restored.]]

'''Sexual reproduction''' is a kind of [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] where generations alternate between cells with a single set of [[chromosome]]s ([[haploid]]) and cells with a double set of chromosomes ([[diploid]]).&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Smith &amp; Eörz Szathmáry, The Major Transitions in Evolution, [[W. H. Freeman and Company]], 1995, p 149&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sexual reproduction'' is by far the most common life cycle in [[eukaryotes]], for example animals and plants. 

Diploid cells divide into haploid cells in a process called [[meiosis]]. Two haploid cells combine into one diploid cell in a process called [[fertilisation]]. Between fertilisation and meiosis there can be a large number of [[mitosis|cell division]]s without change of the number of chromosomes.  

[[Fertilization]] creates a single-celled [[zygote]] which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called [[genetic recombination]], genetic material ([[DNA]]) joins up so that [[homologous chromosome]] sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents. For instance, in [[human reproduction]] each human cell contains 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Meiosis in the parents' gonads produce gamete cells which only contain 23 chromosomes each. When the gametes are combined via [[sexual intercourse]] to form a fertilized egg, the resulting child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 chromosome pairs or 46 total.

Cell division [[mitosis]] then initiates the development of a new individual [[organism]] in [[multicellular organism]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fertilization | title = Fertilization | publisher = Merriam-Webster | accessdate = 2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Otto|first1=Sarah P.|last2=Lenormand|first2=Thomas|title=EVOLUTION OF SEX: RESOLVING THE PARADOX OF SEX AND RECOMBINATION|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=1 April 2002|volume=3|issue=4|pages=252–261|doi=10.1038/nrg761|pmid=11967550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle because [[asexual reproduction]] should be able to outcompete it as every young organism created can bear its own young. This implies that an asexual population has an intrinsic capacity to grow more rapidly with each generation.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; This 50% cost is a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] disadvantage of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-fold cost of sex includes this cost and the fact that any organism can only pass on 50% of its own genes to its offspring. One definite advantage of sexual reproduction is that it prevents the accumulation of genetic [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ng.3216 | pmid = 25685891 | laydate = 4 March 2015 | laysummary = http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/opinion/making-sense-sex | journal = Nature Genetics | title = Recombination affects accumulation of damaging and disease-associated mutations in human populations | year = 2015 | last1 = Hussin | first1 = Julie G | last2 = Hodgkinson | first2 = Alan | last3 = Idaghdour | first3 = Youssef | last4 = Grenier | first4 = Jean-Christophe | last5 = Goulet | first5 = Jean-Philippe| last6 = Gbeha | first6 = Elias | last7 = Hip-Ki | first7 = Elodie | last8 = Awadalla | first8 = Philip | volume=47 | issue = 4 | pages=400–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual selection]] is a mode of [[natural selection]] in which some individuals out-reproduce others of a population because they are better at securing [[Mating|mates]] for sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology: The Unity &amp; Diversity of Life|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=281|author=Cecie Starr|edition=Ralph Taggart, Christine Evers, Lisa Starr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHYS-20140129"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogt |first=Yngve |title=Large testicles are linked to infidelity |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |date=January 29, 2014 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=January 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a powerful evolutionary force that does not exist in asexual populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11395771|year=2001|author1=Agrawal|first1=A. F.|title=Sexual selection and the maintenance of sexual reproduction|journal=Nature|volume=411|issue=6838|pages=692–5|doi=10.1038/35079590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokaryote]]s, whose initial cell has additional or transformed genetic material, reproduce through asexual reproduction but may,  in [[lateral gene transfer]], display processes such as [[bacterial conjugation]], [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]], which are similar to sexual reproduction although they do not lead to reproduction.

==Evolution==
{{main|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}
The first [[fossil]]ized evidence of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is from the [[Stenian]] period, about 1 to 1.2 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=dateref&gt;
{{cite journal | author = N.J. Buttefield | year = 2000 | title = Bangiomorpha pubescens n.  gen., n. sp.: implications for the evolution of sex, multicellularity,  and the Mesoproterozoic/Neoproterozoic radiation of eukaryotes | url = http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/content/26/3/386.abstract | journal = [[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 386–404 | doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2000)026&lt;0386:BPNGNS&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists studying [[evolution]] propose several explanations for why sexual reproduction developed and why it is maintained. These reasons include reducing the likelihood of the [[Mullers ratchet|accumulation]] of deleterious mutations, increasing rate of [[red queen hypothesis|adaptation to changing environments]],&lt;ref name=Gray2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Goddard | first2 = M.

Larger [[population]]s appear to respond more quickly to benefits obtained through sexual reproduction than do smaller population sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12478292|year=2002|author1=Colegrave|first1=N|title=Sex releases the speed limit on evolution|journal=Nature|volume=420|issue=6916|pages=664–6|doi=10.1038/nature01191|bibcode=2002Natur.420..664C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintenance of sexual reproduction has been explained by theories that work at several [[levels of selection]], though some of these models remain controversial.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, newer models presented in recent years suggest a basic advantage for sexual reproduction in slowly reproducing [[complex organism]]s.

Sexual reproduction allows these species to exhibit characteristics that depend on the specific [[Natural environment|environment]] that they inhabit, and the particular survival strategies that they employ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s12064-009-0077-9|title=Diploidy and the selective advantage for sexual reproduction in unicellular organisms|year=2009|last1=Kleiman|first1=Maya|last2=Tannenbaum|first2=Emmanuel|journal=Theory in Biosciences|volume=128|issue=4|pages=249–85|pmid=19902285|arxiv=0901.1320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual selection==
{{main|Sexual selection}}
In order to sexually reproduce, both males and females need to find a [[mating|mate]]. Generally in animals [[mate choice]] is made by females while males compete to be chosen. This can lead [[organism]]s to extreme efforts in order to reproduce, such as combat and display, or produce extreme features caused by a [[positive feedback]] known as a [[Fisherian runaway]]. Thus sexual reproduction, as a form of [[natural selection]], has an effect on [[evolution]]. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is where the basic [[phenotypic trait]]s vary between males and females of the same [[species]]. Dimorphism is found in both [[sex organ]]s and in [[secondary sex characteristics]], body size, physical strength and morphology, [[biological ornament]]ation, [[behavior]] and other bodily traits. However, sexual selection is only implied over an extended period of time leading to sexual dimorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Dimijian, G. G. (2005). Evolution of sexuality: biology and behavior. Proceedings (Baylor University. Medical Center), 18, 244–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex ratio==
Apart from some [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[wasp]]s, organisms which reproduce sexually have a 1:1 [[sex ratio]] of male and female births. The English statistician and biologist [[Ronald Fisher]] outlined why this is so in what has come to be known as [[Fisher's principle]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton67&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3774.477 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W.D. | year = 1967 | title = Extraordinary sex ratios | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/refs/156/3774/477 | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3774| pages = 477–488 | pmid = 6021675 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..477H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially says the following:

:# Suppose male births are less common than female.
:# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
:# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
:# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.
:# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
:# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.

===Insects===
{{further|Insect#Reproduction and development}}
[[File:Australian Emperor mating and laying.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Australian emperor]] laying egg, guarded by the male]]
Insect species make up more than two-thirds of all [[Extant taxon|extant]] animal species. Most insect species reproduce sexually, though some species are facultatively [[parthenogenetic]]. Many insects species have [[sexual dimorphism]], while in others the sexes look nearly identical. Typically they have two sexes with males producing spermatozoa and females ova. The ova develop into eggs that have a covering called the [[chorion]], which forms before internal fertilization. Insects have very diverse mating and reproductive strategies most often resulting in the male depositing [[spermatophore]] within the female, which she stores until she is ready for egg fertilization. After fertilization, and the formation of a zygote, and varying degrees of development, in many species the eggs are deposited outside the female; while in others, they develop further within the female and are born live.

===Mammals===
{{main|Mammalian reproduction}}
{{See also|Human reproduction}}
There are three extant kinds of mammals: [[monotreme]]s, [[placental]]s and [[marsupial]]s, all with internal fertilization. In placental mammals, offspring are born as juveniles: complete animals with the [[sex organ]]s present although not reproductively functional. After several months or years, depending on the species, the sex organs develop further to maturity and the animal becomes [[Sexual maturity|sexually mature]]. Most female mammals are only [[fertility|fertile]] during certain periods during their [[estrous]] cycle, at which point they are ready to mate. Individual male and female mammals meet and carry out [[animal sexual behavior#Mammals|copulation]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} For most mammals, males and females [[Promiscuity|exchange sexual partners throughout their adult lives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reichard|first=U.H. |title=Monogamy—A variable relationship |journal=Max Planck Research |volume=3 |pages=62–7 |year=2002|url=http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524204835/http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf|archivedate=24 May 2013|accessdate=24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barash,Lipton,2001"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lipton, Judith Eve |author2=Barash, David P. |title=The Myth of Monogamy: Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People |publisher=W.H.

===Fish===
{{further|Fish#Reproductive system}}
The vast majority of fish species lay eggs that are then fertilized by the male,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/bony-fish/reproduction.htm BONY FISHES - Reproduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; some species lay their eggs on a substrate like a rock or on plants, while others scatter their eggs and the eggs are fertilized as they drift or sink in the water column.

Some fish species use internal fertilization and then disperse the developing eggs or give birth to live offspring. Fish that have live-bearing offspring include the [[guppy]] and mollies or ''[[Poecilia]]''. Fishes that give birth to live young can be [[ovoviviparous]], where the eggs are fertilized within the female and the eggs simply hatch within the female body, or in [[seahorse]]s, the male carries the developing young within a pouch, and gives birth to live young.&lt;ref name=Cavendish2001&gt;
{{Cite book | author = M. Cavendish | year = 2001 | title = Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World | url = https://books.google.com/?id=s5zZJVu2hxYC&amp;pg=PA1254 | page = 1252 | isbn = 978-0-7614-7194-3 | publisher = Marshall Cavendish | accessdate = 2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishes can also be [[viviparous]], where the female supplies nourishment to the internally growing offspring.  Some fish are [[hermaphrodite]]s, where a single fish is both male and female and can produce eggs and sperm. In hermaphroditic fish, some are male and female at the same time while in other fish they are serially hermaphroditic; starting as one sex and changing to the other. In at least one hermaphroditic species, self-fertilization occurs when the eggs and sperm are released together. Internal self-fertilization may occur in some other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Orlando EF, Katsu Y, Miyagawa S, Iguchi T | year = 2006 | title = Cloning and differential  expression of estrogen receptor and aromatase genes in the self-fertilizing  hermaphrodite and male mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus | journal = [[Journal of Molecular Endocrinology]] | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 353–365 | doi = 10.1677/jme.1.02101 | pmid = 17032750 | last2 = Katsu | last3 = Miyagawa | last4 = Iguchi }}&lt;/ref&gt; One fish species does not reproduce by sexual reproduction but uses sex to produce offspring; ''[[Poecilia formosa]]'' is a unisex species that uses a form of [[parthenogenesis]] called [[gynogenesis]], where unfertilized eggs develop into embryos that produce female offspring. ''Poecilia formosa'' mate with males of other fish species that use internal fertilization, the sperm does not fertilize the eggs but stimulates the growth of the eggs which develops into embryos.&lt;ref&gt;

==Plants==
{{main|Plant reproduction}}
Animals typically produce gametes directly by meiosis. Male gametes are called sperm, and female gametes are called eggs or ova. In animals, fertilization follows immediately after meiosis. Plants on the other hand have mitosis occurring in spores, which are produced by meiosis. The spores germinate into the gametophyte phase. The gametophytes of different groups of plants vary in size; angiosperms have as few as three cells in pollen, and mosses and other so called primitive plants may have several million cells. Plants have an [[alternation of generations]] where the sporophyte phase is succeeded by the gametophyte phase. The sporophyte phase produces spores within the sporangium by meiosis.

===Flowering plants===
[[File:hosta3.jpg|thumb|right|Flowers are the sexual organs of flowering plants.]]
[[Flowering plant]]s are the dominant plant form on land and they reproduce either sexually or asexually. Often their most distinguishing feature is their reproductive organs, commonly called flowers.  The [[Stamen|anther]] produces [[pollen|pollen grains]] which contain the male [[gametophyte]]s (sperm). For pollination to occur, pollen grains must attach to the stigma of the female reproductive structure ([[carpel]]), where the female gametophytes (ovules) are located inside the [[ovary]]. After the pollen tube grows through the carpel's style, the [[sex]] cell nuclei from the pollen grain migrate into the ovule to fertilize the egg cell and endosperm nuclei within the female gametophyte in a process termed [[double fertilization]]. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo, while the triploid endosperm (one sperm cell plus two female cells) and female tissues of the ovule give rise to the surrounding tissues in the developing seed. The ovary, which produced the female gametophyte(s), then grows into a [[fruit]], which surrounds the seed(s). Plants may either [[Self-pollination|self-pollinate]] or [[pollination|cross-pollinate]].

Nonflowering plants like [[fern]]s, [[moss]] and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s use other means of sexual reproduction.

In 2013, flowers dating from the [[Cretaceous]] (100 million years before present) were found encased in amber, the oldest evidence of sexual reproduction in a flowering plant. Microscopic images showed tubes growing out of pollen and penetrating the flower's stigma. The pollen was sticky, suggesting it was carried by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=George O |last=Poinar Jr. |first2=Kenton L |last2=Chambers |first3=Joerg |last3=Wunderlich |title=Micropetasos, a new genus of angiosperms from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber |journal=J.

===Ferns===
Ferns mostly produce large diploid [[sporophyte]]s with [[rhizome]]s, roots and leaves; and on fertile leaves called [[sporangium]], [[spore]]s are produced. The spores are released and germinate to produce short, thin gametophytes that are typically heart shaped, small and green in color. The gametophytes or [[thallus]], produce both motile sperm in the [[antheridia]] and egg cells in separate [[archegonia]]. After rains or when dew deposits a film of water, the motile sperm are splashed away from the antheridia, which are normally produced on the top side of the thallus, and swim in the film of water to the archegonia where they fertilize the egg. To promote out crossing or cross fertilization the sperm are released before the eggs are receptive of the sperm, making it more likely that the sperm will fertilize the eggs of different thallus. A [[zygote]] is formed after fertilization, which grows into a new sporophytic plant. The condition of having separate sporephyte and gametophyte plants is called [[alternation of generation]]s. Other plants with similar reproductive means include the  ''[[Psilotum]]'', ''[[Lycopodium]]'', ''[[Selaginella]]'' and ''[[Equisetum]]''.

===Bryophytes===
The [[bryophyte]]s, which include [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, [[hornwort]]s and [[moss]]es, reproduce both sexually and [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]]. They are small plants found growing in moist locations and like ferns, have motile sperm with [[flagella]] and need water to facilitate sexual reproduction. These plants start as a haploid spore that grows into the dominate form, which is a multicellular haploid body with leaf-like structures that [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. Haploid gametes are produced in antherida and archegonia by mitosis. The sperm released from the antherida respond to chemicals released by ripe archegonia and swim to them in a film of water and fertilize the egg cells thus producing a zygote.  The [[zygote]] divides by mitotic division and grows into a sporophyte that is diploid.  The multicellular diploid sporophyte produces structures called spore capsules, which are connected by [[seta]] to the archegonia. The spore capsules produce spores by meiosis, when ripe the capsules burst open and the spores are released. Bryophytes show considerable variation in their breeding structures and the above is a basic outline. Also in some species each plant is one sex while other species produce both sexes on the same plant.&lt;ref&gt;

==Fungi==
{{Main|Mating in fungi}}
{{further|Fungus#Reproduction}}
[[File:Puffballs emitting spores.jpg|thumb|309x309px|Puffballs emitting spores]]
[[Fungi]] are classified by the methods of sexual reproduction they employ.  The outcome of sexual reproduction most often is the production of [[resting spore]]s that are used to survive inclement times and to spread. There are typically three phases in the sexual reproduction of fungi: [[plasmogamy]], [[karyogamy]] and [[meiosis]]. The cytoplasm of two parent cells fuse during plasmogamy and the nuclei fuse during karyogamy. New haploid gametes are formed during meiosis and develop into spores.

==Bacteria and archaea==
Three distinct processes in [[prokaryote]]s are regarded as similar to [[Origin and function of meiosis|eukaryotic sex]]: [[bacterial transformation]], which involves the incorporation of foreign DNA into the bacterial chromosome; [[bacterial conjugation]], which is a transfer of [[plasmid]] DNA between bacteria, but the plasmids are rarely incorporated into the bacterial chromosome; and [[Prokaryote#Gene transfer|gene transfer and genetic exchange in archaea]].

Bacterial transformation involves the [[genetic recombination|recombination of genetic material]] and its function is mainly associated with [[Sexual recombination#Recombinational repair|DNA repair]]. Bacterial transformation is a complex process encoded by numerous bacterial genes, and is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer.&lt;ref name="Michod" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5|title=Evolutionary Origin of Recombination during Meiosis|year=2010|last1=Bernstein|first1=Harris|last2=Bernstein|first2=Carol|journal=BioScience|volume=60|issue=7|pages=498–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process occurs naturally in at least 40 bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7968924|year=1994|last1=Lorenz|first1=MG|last2=Wackernagel|first2=W|title=Bacterial gene transfer by natural genetic transformation in the environment|volume=58|issue=3|pages=563–602|pmc=372978|journal=Microbiological Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state referred to as competence (see [[Natural competence]]).

'''Sinistral''' and '''dextral''', in some scientific fields, are the two types of [[chirality]] ("[[handedness]]") or [[relative direction]].

The terms are derived from the [[Latin]] words for "left" (''sinister'') and "right" (''dexter'').

Other disciplines have different terms (such as [[Dextrorotary|dextro-]] and [[Laevorotary|laevo-rotary]], in [[Chirality (chemistry)|chemistry]], or [[Clockwise#Usage|clockwise]] and [[anticlockwise]] in [[Chirality (electromagnetism)|physics]]) or simply use left and right (as in [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|anatomy]]).

Relative direction and chirality are distinct concepts. Relative direction is from the point of view of the observer. A completely symmetrical object has a left and a right side, from the observer's point of view, if the top and bottom and direction of observation are defined. Chirality, however, is observer-independent: no matter how one looks at a right-hand screw thread, it remains different from a left-hand screw thread. Therefore, a symmetrical object has sinistral and dextral directions arbitrarily defined by the position of the observer, while an object that has chirality can have sinistral and dextral directions defined by characteristics of the object, no matter the position of the observer.

[[Image:strike slip fault.png|thumb|218px|right|Schematic illustration of the two strike-slip fault types. The view is of the Earth's surface from above.]]
In geology the terms '''sinistral''' and '''dextral''' refer to the horizontal component of movement of blocks on either side of a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] or the sense of movement within a [[shear zone]]. These are terms of relative direction, as the movement of the blocks are described relative to each other when viewed from above. 
Movement is sinistral (left-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the left, or if straddling the fault the left side moves toward the observer.
Movement is dextral (right-handed) if the block on the other side of the fault moves to the right, or if straddling the fault the right side moves toward the observer.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;

===Gastropods===

Because the coiled shells of gastropods are asymmetrical, they possess a quality called [[chirality]], the "handedness" of an asymmetrical structure.

of gastropod species have '''dextral''' (right-handed) shells in their coiling.  A small minority of species and genera are almost always '''sinistral''' (left-handed).  A very few species show an even mixture of dextral and sinistral individuals (for example, ''[[Amphidromus perversus]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxshells.org/052ddr.htm ''Amphidromus perversus'' (Linnaeus, 1758)]&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Flatfish===
{{main|Flatfish}}

The most obvious characteristic of flatfish, other than their flatness, is asymmetry because both eyes are on the same side of the head in the adult fish. In some families of flatfish, the eyes are always on the right side of the body ('''dextral''' or right-eyed flatfish), and in others, they are always on the left ('''sinistral''' or left-eyed flatfish). Primitive [[spiny turbot]]s include equal numbers of right- and left-sided individuals, and are generally more symmetrical than other families.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N.|author1=Chapleau, Francois  |author2=Amaoka, Kunio |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= xxx|isbn= 0-12-547665-5 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research".

The term "[[negligible senescence]]" was first used in the early 1990s by professor [[Caleb Finch]] to describe organisms such as [[lobsters]] and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]]s, which do not show symptoms of aging. The term "engineered negligible senescence" first appeared in print in [[Aubrey de Grey]]'s 1999 book ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging'',&lt;ref name="isbn1587061554"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2003).

==Framework==

[[File:Aging treatment approaches.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The arrows with flat heads are a notation meaning "inhibits," used in the literature of gene expression and gene regulation.]]

The ultimate objective of SENS is the eventual elimination of age-related diseases and infirmity by repeatedly reducing the state of senescence in the organism. The SENS project consists in implementing a series of periodic medical interventions designed to repair, prevent or render irrelevant all the types of molecular and cellular damage that cause age-related pathology and degeneration, in order to avoid debilitation and death from age-related causes.&lt;ref name=EndingAging/&gt;

De Grey defines aging as "the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us", and, more specifically, as follows: "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecule|molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an [[adult]] [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death."&lt;ref name="pmid12844502"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (January 8, 2003). "[http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/manu16.pdf An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging medicine]". ''Sci Aging Knowledge Environ''. 2003 (1): VP1. {{doi|10.1126/sageke.2003.1.vp1}}. {{PMID|12844502}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds: "[[geriatrics]] is the attempt to stop damage from causing pathology; traditional [[gerontology]] is the attempt to stop [[metabolism]] from causing damage; and the SENS (engineering) approach is to eliminate the damage periodically, so keeping its abundance below the level that causes any pathology." The SENS approach to biomedical [[gerontology]] is thus distinctive because of its emphasis on tissue rejuvenation rather than attempting to slow the aging process.

By enumerating the various differences between young and old tissue identified by the science of [[biogerontology]], a 'damage' report was drawn, which in turn formed the basis of the SENS strategy. The results fell into seven main categories of 'damage', seven alterations whose reversal would constitute [[negligible senescence]]:

For each of these areas SENS offers at least one strategy, with a research and a clinical component. The clinical component is required because in some of the proposed therapies, feasibility has already been proven, but not completely applied and approved for human trials. These strategies do not presuppose that the underlying metabolic mechanisms of aging be fully understood, only that we take into account the form senescence takes as directly observable to science, and described in scientific literature..

==Types of aging damage and treatment schemes==

===Nuclear mutations/epimutations—OncoSENS===
These are changes to the nuclear DNA ([[nDNA]]), or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain mutations can lead to [[cancer]].

This would need to be corrected in order to prevent or [[cure for cancer|cure cancer]]. SENS focuses on a strategy called "whole-body interdiction of lengthening [[telomere]]s" (WILT), which would be made possible by periodic [[regenerative medicine]] treatments.

===Mitochondrial mutations—MitoSENS===

[[Mitochondria]] are components in our [[cell (biology)|cells]] that are important for [[energy]] production. Because of the highly [[Oxidative stress|oxidative]] environment in mitochondria and their lack of the sophisticated repair systems, mitochondrial mutations are believed to be a major cause of progressive cellular degeneration.

This would be corrected by [[allotopic expression]]—copying the [[DNA]] for mitochondria completely within the cellular [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], where it is better protected. De Grey argues that experimental evidence demonstrates that the operation is feasible, however, a 2003 study showed that some mitochondrial proteins are too [[hydrophobic]] to survive the transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;Oca-Cossio, J. et al., 2003. Limitations of Allotopic Expression of Mitochondrial Genes in Mammalian Cells. Genetics, 165(2), 707–720.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intracellular junk—LysoSENS===
{{tone|date=January 2018}}
Our cells are constantly breaking down [[protein]]s and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can’t be digested accumulate as junk inside our cells, which is detected in the form of [[lipofuscin]] granules. [[Atherosclerosis]], [[macular degeneration]], [[liver spot]]s on the skin and all kinds of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s (such as [[Alzheimer's]] disease) are associated with this problem.

Junk inside cells might be removed by adding new [[enzymes]] to the cell's natural [[digestion]] organ, the [[lysosome]]. These enzymes would be taken from [[bacteria]], [[mold]]s and other organisms that are known to completely digest animal bodies.

===Extracellular junk—AmyloSENS===

Harmful junk protein can accumulate outside of our cells. Junk here means useless things accumulated by a body, but which cannot be digested or removed by its processes, such as the amyloid plaques characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other [[amyloidosis|amyloidoses]].

Junk outside cells might be removed by enhanced [[phagocytosis]] (the normal process used by the immune system), and small drugs able to break chemical beta-bonds. The large junk in this class can be removed surgically.

===Cell loss and atrophy—RepleniSENS===

Some of the cells in our bodies cannot be replaced, or can be only replaced very slowly—more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number affects some of the most important tissues of the body.  Muscle cells are lost in [[skeletal muscle]]s and the heart, causing them to become frailer with age.  Loss of neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] causes [[Parkinson's disease]], while loss of immune cells impairs the [[immune system]].

This can be partly corrected by therapies involving [[exercise]] and [[growth factor]]s, but [[stem cell therapy]], [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] are almost certainly required for any more than just partial replacement of lost cells.

===Cell senescence—ApoptoSENS===

[[Cellular senescence#Cellular senescence|Senescence]] is a phenomenon where the cells are no longer able to divide, but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other harmful things, like secreting proteins. Degeneration of [[joint]]s, immune senescence, accumulation of [[visceral fat]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] are caused by this. Cells sometimes enter a state of resistance to signals sent, as part of a process called [[apoptosis]], to instruct cells to destroy themselves.

Cells in this state could be eliminated by forcing them to apoptose (via [[suicide gene]]s, [[vaccine]]s, or recently discovered [[senolytics|senolytic agents]]), and healthy cells would multiply to replace them.

===Extracellular crosslinks—GlycoSENS===

Cells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many [[cross-links]] form between cells in a [[Biological tissue|tissue]], the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including arteriosclerosis, presbyopia and weakened skin texture. These are chemical bonds between structures that are part of the body, but not within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak.

SENS proposes to further develop small-molecular drugs and [[enzyme]]s to break links caused by sugar-bonding, known as [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s, and other common forms of chemical linking.

==Scientific controversy==
While some fields mentioned as branches of SENS are broadly supported by the medical research community, e.g., [[stem cell research]] (RepleniSENS), [[Alzheimer's disease clinical research|anti-Alzheimers research]] (AmyloSENS) and [[oncogenomics]] (OncoSENS), the SENS programme as a whole has been a highly controversial proposal, with many critics arguing that the SENS agenda is fanciful and the highly complicated biomedical phenomena involved in the aging process contain too many unknowns for SENS to be fully implementable in the foreseeable future&lt;ref name="pmid16264422" /&gt;. Cancer may well deserve special attention as an [[Aging-associated diseases|aging-associated disease]] (OncoSENS), but the SENS claim that nuclear DNA damage only matters for aging because of cancer has been challenged in the literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Best, BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging 
| journal=Rejuvenation Research  | volume=12 | issue=3 | date=2009 | pages=199–208  
| url=http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/Nuclear_DNA_in_Aging.pdf | format= [[PDF]]  
| doi = 10.1089/rej.2009.0847 |  pmid=19594328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by material in the article [[DNA damage theory of aging]].

In November 2005, 28 biogerontologists published a statement of criticism in ''[[EMBO Journal|EMBO Reports]]'', "Science fact and the SENS agenda: what can we reasonably expect from ageing research?,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"&gt;Warner H ''et al.'' (November 2005). "Science fact and the SENS agenda. What can we reasonably expect from ageing research?". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1006–1008. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400555}}. {{PMID|16264422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing "each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; and that some of the specific proposals "will take decades of hard work [to be medically integrated], if [they] ever prove to be useful."&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; The researchers argue that while there is "a rationale for thinking that we might eventually learn how to postpone human illnesses to an important degree,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; increased basic research, rather than the goal-directed approach of SENS, is presently the scientifically appropriate goal. This article was written in response to a July 2005 ''EMBO Reports'' article previously published by de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (July 2005). "Resistance to debate on how to postpone ageing is delaying progress and costing lives". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (S1): S49–S53. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400399}}. {{PMID|15995663}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a response from de Grey was published in the same November issue.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2005). "Like it or not, life-extension research extends beyond biogerontology". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1000. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400565}}. {{PMID|16264420}}.&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey summarizes these events in "The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS," published on the [[Methuselah Foundation]] website.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey.

In 2012, [[Colin Blakemore]] criticised Aubrey de Grey, but not SENS specifically, in a debate hosted at the [[Oxford University]] Scientific Society.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

More recently, biogerontologist [[Marios Kyriazis]] has sharply criticised the clinical applicability of SENS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyriazis M |title=The impracticality of biomedical rejuvenation therapies: translational and pharmacological barriers |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=390–6 |year=2014 |pmid=25072550 |pmc=4142774 |doi=10.1089/rej.2014.1588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kyriazis |first1=Marios |title=Translating laboratory anti-aging biotechnology into applied clinical practice: Problems and obstacles |journal=World Journal of Translational Medicine |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2015 |pages=51–4 |doi=10.5528/wjtm.v4.i2.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that such therapies, even if developed in the laboratory, would be practically unusable by the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyriazis M, Apostolides A |title=The Fallacy of the Longevity Elixir: Negligible Senescence May be Achieved, but Not by Using Something Physical |journal=Current Aging Science |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=227–34 |year=2015 |pmid=26135528 |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/132663/article |doi=10.2174/1874609808666150702095803}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey responded to one such criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Grey AD |title=The practicality or otherwise of biomedical rejuvenation therapies: a response to Kyriazis |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=397–400 |year=2014 |pmid=25072964 |doi=10.1089/rej.2014.1599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Technology Review'' controversy===

In February 2005, ''[[Technology Review]]'', which is owned by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published an article by [[Sherwin Nuland]], a Clinical Professor of Surgery at [[Yale University]] and the author of "How We Die",&lt;ref&gt;Nuland, Sherwin (1994). ''How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter''. New York: Knopf Random House. {{ISBN|0-679-41461-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that drew a skeptical portrait of SENS, at the time de Grey was a computer associate in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100108033304/http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/flybase.htm Flybase Facility] of the [http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Genetics] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The April 2005 issue of ''Technology Review'' contained a reply by Aubrey de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (April2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14097&amp;ch=infotech Aubrey de Grey Responds]", ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous comments from readers.&lt;ref&gt;TR Readers (April 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14310&amp;ch=infotechReaders LETTERS: Our February cover story on Aubrey de Grey and antiaging science lives on]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During June 2005, [[David Gobel]], CEO and Co-founder of Methuselah Foundation offered Technology Review $20,000 to fund a prize competition to publicly clarify the viability of the SENS approach. In July 2005, Pontin announced a $20,000 prize, funded 50/50 by Methuselah Foundation and MIT Technology Review, open to any molecular biologist, with a record of publication in biogerontology, who could prove that the alleged benefits of SENS were "so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate."&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (July 28, 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/pontin/14968/ The SENS Challenge]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Technology Review'' received five submissions to its Challenge. In March 2006, ''Technology Review'' announced that it had chosen a panel of judges for the Challenge: [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Anita Goel]], [[Nathan Myhrvold]], [[Vikram Sheel Kumar]], and [[Craig Venter]].&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (March 14, 2006). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/16593/ We've picked the judges for our biogerontology prize]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the five submissions met the terms of the prize competition. They were published by ''Technology Review'' on June 9, 2006. Accompanying the three submissions were rebuttals by de Grey, and counter-responses to de Grey's rebuttals. On July 11, 2006, ''Technology Review'' published the results of the SENS Challenge.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130606111748/http://www.mprize.com/index.php?pagename=newsdetaildisplay&amp;ID=0104 SENS Withstands Three Challenges : $20,000 Remains Unclaimed]". Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, no one won the $20,000 prize. The judges felt that no submission met the criterion of the challenge and discredited SENS, although they unanimously agreed that one submission, by [[Preston Estep]] and his colleagues, was the most eloquent. [[Craig Venter]] succinctly expressed the prevailing opinion: "Estep et al. ... have not demonstrated that SENS is unworthy of discussion, but the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for it."&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt; Summarizing the judges' deliberations, Pontin wrote that SENS is "highly speculative" and that many of its proposals {{clarify|text=could not be reproduced with the scientific technology of that period.|date=April 2016}} Myhrvold described SENS as belonging to a kind of "antechamber of science" where they wait until technology and scientific knowledge advance to the point where it can be tested.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invincible Man"/&gt; In a letter of dissent dated July 11, 2006 in Technology Review, Estep et al. criticized the ruling of the judges.

==Social and economic implications==

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | date = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/sens/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

De Grey and other scientists in the general field have argued that the costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky ''et al.'' 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050.&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend&gt;Olshansky, S. Jay; Perry, Daniel; Miller, Richard A.; Butler, Robert N. (March 2006). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160110004616/http://www.edmontonagingsymposium.com/files/eas/Longevity_Dividend.pdf In Pursuit of the Longevity Dividend: What Should We Be Doing To Prepare for the Unprecedented Aging of Humanity?]". ''The Scientist''. 20 (3): 28–36.&lt;/ref&gt; "Consider what is likely to happen if we don't [invest further in aging research]. Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in the United States will have AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias. The impact of this single disease will be catastrophic, and this is just one example."&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend/&gt;

== SENS Research Foundation ==
{{Main|SENS Research Foundation}}

The SENS Research Foundation is a [[non-profit organization]] co-founded by Michael Kope, [[Aubrey de Grey]], Jeff Hall, Sarah Marr and Kevin Perrott, which is based in [[California]], [[United States]]. Its activities include SENS-based research programs and [[public relations]] work for the acceptance of and interest in related research.

Before March 2009, the SENS research programme was mainly pursued by the [[Methuselah Foundation]], co-founded by Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel.  The [[Methuselah Foundation]] is most notable for establishing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]], a monetary prize awarded to researchers who extend the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths.&lt;ref name=MFMission&gt;

'''Terror management theory''' ('''TMT''') is an [[evolutionary psychology]] theory originally proposed by [[Jeff Greenberg]], [[Sheldon Solomon]], and [[Tom Pyszczynski]]&lt;ref name=GPS/&gt; and codified in their book ''The Worm at the Core: On the Role of Death in Life'' (2015). It proposes that a basic psychological conflict results from having a [[self-preservation]] instinct whilst realizing that death is inevitable and to some extent unpredictable. This conflict produces terror, and the terror is then managed by embracing cultural values, or symbolic systems that act to provide life with enduring meaning and value.&lt;ref name="GPS"&gt;Greenberg, J., Pyszczynski, T. &amp; Solomon, S. (1986). "The causes and consequences of a need for self-esteem: A terror management theory". In R.F. Baumeister (ed.), ''Public Self and Private Self'' (pp. 189-212). Springer-Verlag (New York).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GPS91"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomon | first1 = S. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | year = 1991 | title = A terror management theory of social behavior: The psychological functions of self-esteem and cultural worldviews | url = | journal = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 93| page = 159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Examples of cultural values that impact an individual's terror of death are those that purport to offer literal immortality (e.g. belief in afterlife, religion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jonas | first1 = E. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = P. | year = 2006 | title = Terror management and religion: evidence that intrinsic religiousness mitigates worldview defense following mortality salience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 553–567 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.3.553 | pmid=16938037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, TMT also argues that other cultural values&amp;nbsp;– including those that are seemingly unrelated to death&amp;nbsp;– offer symbolic immortality.  For example, values of national identity,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; posterity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhou | first1 = X. | last2 = Liu | first2 = J. | last3 = Chen | first3 = C. | last4 = Yu | first4 = Z. | year = 2008 | title = Do children transcend death?

L. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Pyszczynski | first2 = T. | last3 = Greenberg | first3 = J. | last4 = Solomon | first4 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Fleeing the body: A terror management perspective on the problem of human corporeality | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 200–218 | doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0403_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human superiority over animals&lt;ref name="Goldenberg, J. L. 2000"/&gt; have  been linked to death concerns.  In many cases these values are thought to offer symbolic immortality either a) by providing the sense that one is part of something greater that will ultimately outlive the individual (e.g. country, lineage, species), or b) by making one's symbolic identity superior to biological nature (i.e. you are a personality, which makes you more than a glob of cells).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Because cultural values determine that which is meaningful, they are also the foundation for [[self-esteem]]. TMT describes self-esteem as being the personal, subjective measure of how well an individual is living up to their cultural values.&lt;ref name=GPS91/&gt;

TMT is derived from [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Ernest Becker]]'s 1973&amp;nbsp;[[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning work of nonfiction ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', in which Becker argues most human action is taken to ignore or avoid the inevitability of death. The terror of absolute annihilation creates such a profound&amp;nbsp;– albeit subconscious&amp;nbsp;– anxiety in people that they spend their lives attempting to make sense of it. On large scales, societies build symbols: laws, [[religion and happiness|religious meaning systems]], cultures, and belief systems to explain the significance of life, define what makes certain characteristics, skills, and talents extraordinary, reward others whom they find exemplify certain attributes, and punish or kill others who do not adhere to their cultural [[worldview]]. On an individual level, self-esteem provides a buffer against death-related anxiety.

{{Quote box
 | width = 30%
 | quote  = ''The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing else; it is a mainspring of human activity—activity designed largely to avoid the fatality of death, to overcome it by denying in some way that it is the final destiny for man.''

}}

[[Cultural anthropology|Cultural anthropologist]] Ernest Becker asserted in his 1973&amp;nbsp;book ''[[The Denial of Death]]'' that humans, as intelligent animals, are able to grasp the inevitability of death. They therefore spend their lives building and believing in cultural elements that illustrate how to make themselves stand out as individuals and give their lives significance and meaning. Death creates an anxiety in humans; it strikes at unexpected and random moments, and its nature is essentially unknowable, causing people to spend most of their time and energy to explain, forestall, and avoid it.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, pp. ix–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker expounded upon the previous writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Norman&amp;nbsp;O.&amp;nbsp;Brown]], and [[Otto Rank]]. According to clinical psychiatrist [[Morton Levitt]], Becker replaces the Freudian preoccupation with [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] with the fear of death as the primary motivation in human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, Morton (July 1974). "Reviewed work(s): The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 414, USA-USSR: Agenda for Communication, pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

People desire to think of themselves as beings of value and worth with a feeling of permanence, a concept in [[psychology]] known as [[self-esteem]]. This feeling counters the [[cognitive dissonance]] created by an individual's realization that they may be no more important than any other living thing. Becker refers to high self-esteem as heroism: {{blockquote|the problem of heroics is the central one of human life, that it goes deeper into human nature than anything else because it is based on organismic [[narcissism]] and on the child's need for self-esteem as ''the'' condition for his life. Society itself is a codified hero system, which means that society everywhere is a living myth of the significance of human life, a defiant creation of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rationale behind decisions regarding one's own health can be explored through a terror management model. A 2008 research article in [[Psychological Review]] proposes a three-part model for understanding how awareness of death can ironically subvert health-promoting behaviors by redirecting one's focus towards behaviors that build self-esteem instead: "''Proposition 1 suggests that conscious thoughts about death can instigate health-oriented responses aimed at removing death-related thoughts from current focal attention. Proposition 2 suggests that the unconscious resonance of death-related cognition promotes self-oriented defenses directed toward maintaining, not one's health, but a sense of meaning and self-esteem. The last proposition suggests that confrontations with the physical body may undermine symbolic defenses and thus present a previously unrecognized barrier to health promotion activities.''"&lt;ref name=model&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldenberg | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Arndt | first2 = J. | year = 2008 | title = The Implications of death for health: A terror management health model for behavioral health promotion | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 115 | issue = 4| pages = 1032–1053 | doi=10.1037/a0013326| pmid = 18954213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary backdrop===
Terror management theorists consider TMT to be compatible with the [[theory of evolution]]:&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; Valid fears of dangerous things have an adaptive function that helped facilitate the survival of our ancestors' genes. However, generalized existential anxiety resulting from the clash between a desire for life and awareness of the inevitability of death is neither adaptive nor selected for. TMT views existential anxiety as an unfortunate byproduct of these two highly adaptive human proclivities rather than as an adaptation that the evolutionary process selected for its advantages. Just as human [[bipedalism]] confers advantages as well as disadvantages, death anxiety is an inevitable part of our intelligence and awareness of dangers.

Anxiety in response to the inevitability of death threatened to undermine adaptive functioning and therefore needed amelioration. TMT posits that humankind used the same intellectual capacities that gave rise to this problem to fashion cultural beliefs and values that provided protection against this potential anxiety. TMT considers these cultural beliefs (even unpleasant and frightening ones, such as ritual human sacrifice) when they manage potential [[death anxiety (psychology)|death anxiety]] in a way that promotes beliefs and behaviors which facilitated the functioning and survival of the collective.

Hunter-gatherers used their emerging cognitive abilities to facilitate solving practical problems, such as basic needs for nutrition, mating, and tool-making. As these abilities evolved, an explicit awareness of death also emerged. But once this awareness materialized, the potential for terror that it created put pressure on emerging conceptions of reality. Any conceptual formation that was to be widely accepted by the group needed to provide a means of managing this terror.

Originally, the emergence of morality evolved to facilitate co-existence within groups. Together with language, morality served pragmatic functions that extended survival. The struggle to deny the finality of death co-opted and changed the function of these cultural inventions. For example, [[Neanderthal]]s might have begun burying their dead as a means of avoiding unpleasant odors, disease-infested parasites, or dangerous scavengers. But during the Upper Paleolithic era, these pragmatic burial practices appear to have become imbued with layers of ritual performance and supernatural beliefs, suggested by the elaborate decoration of bodies with thousands of beads or other markers. Food and other necessities were also included within the burial chamber, indicating the potential for a belief system that included life after death. In many human cultures today, [[funeral]]s are viewed primarily as cultural events, viewed through the lens of morality and language, with little thought given to the utilitarian origins of burying the dead.

Evolutionary history also indicates that "the costs of ignoring threats have outweighed the costs of ignoring opportunities for self-development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook Of Experimental Existential Psychology|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_KMRe9wK2MC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=2013-08-18|chapter=Paradise Lost and Reclaimed|last1=Koole|first1=Sander L.|last2=van den Berg|first2=Agnes E.|editor1-last=Greenberg|editor1-first=Jeff|editor2-last=Koole|editor2-first=Sander L.|editor3-last=Pyszczynski|editor3-first=Tom|year=2004|publisher=[[Guilford Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59385-040-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces the concept that abstract needs for individual and group self-esteem may continue to be selected for by evolution, even when they sometimes confer risks to physical health and well-being.

==Self-esteem==
[[Self-esteem]] lies at the heart of TMT and is a fundamental aspect of its core paradigms. TMT fundamentally seeks to elucidate the causes and consequences of a need for self-esteem. Theoretically, it draws heavily from [[Ernest Becker]]'s conceptions of culture and self-esteem (Becker, 1971;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Ernest (1971). The birth and death of meaning (2nd ed.). New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Becker, 1973&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Ernest (1973). ''The Denial of Death'' (1st ed.). New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;). TMT not only attempts to explain the concept of self-esteem, it also tries to explain ''why'' we need self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self-esteem"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Pyszczynski, T., Greenberg, J., Solomon, S., Arndt, J. &amp; Schimel, J.

 | pmid = 15122930
 | volume=130
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation is that self-esteem is used as a coping mechanism for anxiety. It helps people control their sense of terror and nullify the realization that humans are just animals trying to manage the world around them. According to TMT, self-esteem is a sense of personal value that is created by beliefs in the validity of one's cultural worldview, and the belief that one is living up to the cultural standards created by that worldview.&lt;ref name = "self-esteem"/&gt;

Critically, Hewstone ''et al.'' (2002) have questioned the causal direction between self-esteem and death-anxiety, evaluating whether one's self-esteem comes from their desire to reduce their death anxiety, or if death anxiety arises from a lack of self-esteem.&lt;ref name=Hew&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hewstone | first1 = M. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = M. | last3 = Willis | first3 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Intergroup bias | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 575–604 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135109 | pmid = 11752497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, an individual's suppression of death anxiety may arise from their overall need to increase their self-esteem in a positive manner.&lt;ref name="Hew"/&gt;

Research has demonstrated that self-esteem can play an important role in physical health. In some cases, people may be so concerned with their physical appearance and boosting their self-esteem that they ignore problems or concerns with their own physical health.&lt;ref name=arndt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arndt | first1 = J. | last2 = Cox | first2 = C. R. | last3 = Goldenberg | first3 = J. L. | last4 = Vess | first4 = M. | last5 = Routledge | first5 = C. | last6 = Cooper | first6 = D.

(2009) conducted three studies to examine how peer perceptions and social acceptance of smokers contributes to their quitting, as well as if, and why these people continue smoking for outside reasons, even when faced with thoughts of death and anti-smoking prompts.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt; Tanning and exercising were also looked at in the researchers' studies. The studies found that people are influenced by the situations around them.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt;  Specifically, Arndt ''et al.'' (2009) found in terms of their self-esteem and health, that participants who saw someone exercising were more likely to increase their intentions to exercise.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt; In addition, the researchers found in study two that how participants reacted to an anti-smoking commercial was affected by their motivation for smoking and the situation which they were in. For instance, people who smoked for extrinsic reasons and were previously prompted with death reminders were more likely to be compelled by the anti-smoking message.&lt;ref name="arndt"/&gt;

===Self-esteem as anxiety buffer===
An individual's level of self-consciousness can affect their views on life and death. To a point, increasing self-consciousness is adaptive in that it helps prevent awareness of danger. However, research has demonstrated that there may be [[diminishing returns]] from this phenomenon. Individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness sometimes have increased death cognition, and a more negative outlook on life, than those with reduced self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=anxiety&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taubman-Ben-Ari | first1 = O. | last2 = Noy | first2 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Self-consciousness and death cognitions from a terror management perspective | url = | journal = Death Studies | volume = 34 | issue = 10| pages = 871–892 | doi = 10.1080/07481187.2010.496685 | pmid = 24482853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, self-esteem can work in the opposite manner. Research has confirmed that individuals with higher self-esteem, particularly in regard to their behavior, have a more positive attitude towards their life. Specifically, death cognition in the form of anti-smoking warnings weren't effective for smokers and in fact, increased their already positive attitudes towards the behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = J. | last2 = Winzeler | first2 = S. | last3 = Topolinski | first3 = S. | year = 2010 | title = When the death makes you smoke: A terror management perspective on the effectiveness of cigarette on-pack warnings | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 226–228 | doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2009.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons behind individuals' optimistic attitudes towards smoking after mortality was made salient, indicate that people use positivity as a buffer against anxiety. Continuing to hold certain beliefs even after they are shown to be flawed creates [[cognitive dissonance]] regarding current information and past behavior, and the way to alleviate this is to simply reject new information. Therefore, anxiety buffers such as self-esteem allow individuals to cope with their fears more easily. Death cognition may in fact cause [[negative reinforcement]] that leads people to further engage in dangerous behaviors (smoking in this instance) because accepting the new information would lead to a loss of self-esteem, increasing vulnerability and awareness of mortality.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

==Mortality salience==
The [[mortality salience]] hypothesis&amp;nbsp;(MS) states that if indeed one's cultural worldview, or one's self-esteem, serves a death-denying function, then threatening these constructs should produce defenses aimed at restoring psychological equanimity (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;returning the individual to a state of feeling invulnerable). In the MS&amp;nbsp;paradigm, these "threats" are simply experiential reminders of one's own death. This can, and has, taken many different forms in a variety of study paradigms (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;asking participants to write about their own death;&lt;ref name=GPS/&gt; conducting the experiment near funeral homes or cemeteries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Wicklund | first2 = R.

Like the other TMT hypotheses, the literature supporting the MS hypothesis is vast and diverse. For a meta analysis of MS&amp;nbsp;research, see Burke ''et al.'' (2010).&lt;ref name = Burke&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burke | first1 = B. L. | last2 = Martens | first2 = A. | last3 = Faucher | first3 = E. H. | year = 2010 | title = Two decades of terror management theory: A meta-analysis of mortality salience research | url = | journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology Review | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 155–195 | doi=10.1177/1088868309352321 | pmid=20097885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimentally, the MS&amp;nbsp;hypothesis has been tested in close to 200&amp;nbsp;empirical articles.&lt;ref name = Burke/&gt; After participants in an experiment are asked to write about their own death (vs.&amp;nbsp;a neutral, non-death control topic, such as dental pain), and then following a brief delay (distal, worldview/self-esteem defenses work the best after a delay; see Greenberg ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name="Green 1994"/&gt; for a discussion), the participants' defenses are measured. In one early TMT study assessing the MS&amp;nbsp;hypothesis, Greenberg ''et al.'' (1990)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = J. | last2 = Pyszczynski | first2 = T. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | last4 = Rosenblatt | first4 = A. | last5 = Veeder | first5 = M. | last6 = Kirkland | first6 = S. | last7 = Lyon | first7 = D. | year = 1990 | title = Evidence for terror management&amp;nbsp;II: The effects of mortality salience on reactions to those who threaten or bolster the cultural worldview | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 308–318 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.2.308| citeseerx = 10.1.1.454.2378 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had Christian participants evaluate other Christian and Jewish students that were similar demographically, but differed in their religious affiliation. After being reminded of their death (experimental MS&amp;nbsp;induction), Christian participants evaluated fellow Christians more positively, and Jewish participants more negatively, relative to the control condition.&lt;ref name=religion&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harmon-Jones | first1 = E. | last2 = Simon | first2 = L. | last3 = Greenberg | first3 = J. | last4 = Pyszczynski | first4 = T. | last5 = Solomon | first5 = S. | last6 = McGregor | first6 = H. | year = 1997 | title = Terror management theory and self-esteem: Evidence that increased self-esteem reduces mortality salience effects | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 24–36 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.24| pmid = 9008372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, bolstering self-esteem in these scenarios leads to less worldview defense and derogation of dissimilar others.&lt;ref name="religion"/&gt;

Mortality salience has an influence on individuals and their decisions regarding their health. Cox ''et al.'' (2009) discuss mortality salience in terms of suntanning. Specifically, the researchers found that participants who were prompted with the idea that pale was more socially attractive along with mortality reminders, tended to lean towards decisions that resulted in more protective measures from the sun.&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = C. R. | last2 = Cooper | first2 = D. P. | last3 = Vess | first3 = M. | last4 = Arndt | first4 = J. | last5 = Goldenberg | first5 = J. L. | last6 = Routledge | first6 = C. | year = 2009 | title = Bronze is beautiful but pale can be pretty: The effects of appearance standards and mortality salience on sun-tanning outcomes | url = | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 746–752 | doi = 10.1037/a0016388 | pmid = 19916643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants were placed in two different conditions; one group of participants were given an article relating to the fear of death, while the control group received an article unrelated to death dealing with the fear of public speaking.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Additionally, they gave one group an article pertaining to the message that "bronze is beautiful," one relating to the idea that "pale is pretty," and one neutral article that did not speak of tan or pale skin tones.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; Finally, after introducing a delay activity, the researchers gave the participants a five-item questionnaire asking them about their future sun-tanning behaviors. The study illustrated that when tan skin was associated with attractiveness, mortality salience positively affected people's intentions to suntan; however, when pale skin was associated with attractiveness people's intentions to tan decreased.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt;

===Mortality and self-esteem on health risks===
Studies have shown that mortality and self-esteem are important factors of the terror management theory. Jessop ''et al.'' (2008) study this relationship within four studies that all examine how people react when they are given information on risks, specifically, in terms of the mortality related to the risks of driving.&lt;ref name=ms&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jessop | first1 = D. C. | last2 = Albery | first2 = I. P. | last3 = Rutter | first3 = J. | last4 = Garrod | first4 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Understanding the impact of mortality-related health-risk information: A terror management theory perspective | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = 7| pages = 951–964 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208316790 | pmid = 18453389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the researchers were exploring how participants acted in terms of self-esteem, and its impact on how mortality-related health-risk information would be received.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Overall, Jessop ''et al.'' (2008) found that even when mortality is prominent, people who engage in certain behaviors to improve their self-esteem have a greater chance of continuing with these activities.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt; Mortality and self-esteem are both factors that influence people's behaviors and decision-making regarding their health. Furthermore, individuals who are involved in behaviors and possess motivation to enhance their self-worth are less likely to be affected by the importance placed on health risks, in terms of mortality.&lt;ref name="ms"/&gt;

Self-esteem is important when mortality is made salient. It can allow people a coping mechanism, one that can cushion individuals' fears; and thus, impacting one's attitudes towards a given behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Individuals who have higher levels of self-esteem regarding their behavior(s) are less likely to have their attitudes, and thus their behaviors changed regardless of mortality salient or death messages.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; People will use their self-esteem to hide behind their fears of dying. In terms of smoking behaviors, people with higher smoking-based self-esteem are less susceptible to anti-smoking messages that relate to death; therefore, mortality salience and death warnings afford them with an even more positive outlook on their behavior, or in this instance their smoking.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

In the Hansen ''et al.'' (2010) experiment the researchers manipulated mortality salience. In the experiment, Hansen ''et al.'' (2010) examined smokers' attitudes towards the behavior of smoking. Actual warning labels were utilized to create mortality salience in this specific experiment. The researchers first gave participants a questionnaire to measure their smoking-based self-esteem.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Following the questionnaire, participants were randomly assigned to two different conditions; the first were given anti-smoking warning labels about death and the second, control group were exposed to anti-smoking warning labels not dealing with death.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Before the participants' attitudes towards smoking were taken the researchers introduced an unrelated question to provide a delay. Further research has demonstrated that delays allow mortality salience to emerge because thoughts of death become non-conscious.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; Finally, participants were asked questions regarding their intended future smoking behavior.&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt; However, one weakness in their conduction was that the final questionnaire addressed opinions and behavioral questions, as opposed to the participants level of persuasion regarding the different anti-smoking warning labels.

===Social impacts===
Many people are more motivated by social pressures, rather than health risks. Specifically for younger people, mortality salience is stronger in eliciting changes of one's behavior when it brings awareness to the immediate loss of social status or position, rather than a loss, such as death that one can not imagine and feels far off.&lt;ref name=social&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = I. M. | last2 = Kamins | first2 = M. A. | year = 2010 | title = An application of terror management theory in the design of social and health-related anti-smoking appeals | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Behaviour | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 172–190 | doi = 10.1002/cb.293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many different factors to take into consideration, such as how strongly an individual feels toward a decision, his or her level of self-esteem, and the situation around the individual. Particularly with people's smoking behaviors, self-esteem and mortality salience have different effects on individuals' decisions.  In terms of the longevity of their smoking decisions, it has been seen that individuals' smoking habits are affected, in the short-term sense, when they are exposed to mortality salience that interrelates with their own self-esteem.  Moreover, people who viewed social exclusion prompts were more likely to quit smoking in the long run than those who were simply shown health-effects of smoking.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; More specifically, it was demonstrated that when individuals had high levels of self-esteem they were more likely to quit smoking following the social pressure messages, rather than the health risk messages.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt;  In this specific instance, terror management, and specifically mortality salience is showing how people are more motivated by the social pressures and consequences in their environment, rather than consequences relating to their health. This is mostly seen in young adult smokers with higher smoking-based self-esteems who are not thinking of their future health and the less-immediate effects of smoking on their health.&lt;ref name="social"/&gt;

==Death thought accessibility==
Another paradigm that TMT&amp;nbsp;researchers use to get at unconscious concerns about death is what is known as the death thought accessibility&amp;nbsp;(DTA) hypothesis. Essentially, the DTA&amp;nbsp;hypothesis states that if individuals are motivated to avoid cognitions about death, and they avoid these cognitions by espousing a worldview or by buffering their self-esteem, then when threatened, an individual should possess more death-related cognitions (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;thoughts about death, and death-related stimuli) than they would when not threatened.&lt;ref name = "Hayes" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = J. | last2 = Schimel | first2 = J. | last3 = Ardnt | first3 = J. | last4 = Faucher | first4 = E. | year = 2010 | title = A Theoretical and Empirical Review of the Death Thought Accessibility Concept in Terror Management Research | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 136 | issue = 5| pages = 699–739 | doi=10.1037/a0020524 | pmid=20804234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DTA hypothesis has its origins in work by Greenberg ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name = "Green 1994"/&gt; as an extension of their earlier terror management hypotheses (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;the anxiety buffer hypothesis and the mortality salience hypothesis). The researchers reasoned that if, as indicated by [[Daniel Wegner|Wegner's]] research on [[thought suppression]] (1994; 1997), thoughts that are purposely suppressed from conscious awareness are often brought back with ease, then following a delay death-thought cognitions should be more available to consciousness than (a)&amp;nbsp;those who keep the death-thoughts in their consciousness the whole time, and (b)&amp;nbsp;those who suppress the death-thoughts but are not provided a delay. That is precisely what they found. However, other psychologists have failed to replicate these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trafimow|first=David|author2=Jamie S. Hughes |title=Testing the Death Thought Suppression and Rebound Hypothesis|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=September 2012|volume=3|issue=5|pages=622–629|doi=10.1177/1948550611432938|url=http://spp.sagepub.com/content/3/5/622.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these initial studies (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;Greenberg ''et al.'' (2004); Arndt ''et al.'' (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arndt | first1 = J. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | last4 = Solomon | first4 = S. | year = 1997 | title = Subliminal exposure to death-related stimuli increases defense of the cultural worldview | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 379–385 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00429.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in numerous subsequent DTA studies, the main measure of DTA is a word fragment task, whereby participants can complete word fragments in distinctly death-related ways (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;coff_&amp;nbsp;_ as coffin, not coffee) or in non death-related ways (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;sk_&amp;nbsp;_l as skill, not skull).&lt;ref name="TMHM"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = D. P. | last2 = Goldenberg | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Arndt | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Empowering the self: Using the terror management health model to promote breast self-examination | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 315–325 | doi = 10.1080/15298868.2010.52749 | doi-broken-date = 2018-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If death-thoughts are indeed more available to consciousness, then it stands to reason that the word fragments should be completed in a way that is semantically related to death.

===Importance of the DTA hypothesis===

The introduction of this hypothesis has refined TMT, and led to new avenues of research that formerly could not be assessed due to the lack of an empirically validated way of measuring death-related cognitions. Also, the differentiation between proximal (conscious, near, and threat-focused) and distal (unconscious, distant, symbolic) defenses that have been derived from DTA studies have been extremely important in understanding how people deal with their terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | year = 1999 | title = A dual-process model of defense against conscious and unconscious death-related thoughts: An extension of terror management theory | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 835–845 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.4.835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note how the DTA paradigm subtly alters, and expands, TMT as a motivational theory. Instead of solely manipulating mortality and witnessing its effects (e.g., [[nationalism]], increased prejudice, [[Safe sex|risky sexual behavior]], etc.), the DTA paradigm allows a measure of the death-related cognitions that result from various affronts to the self. Examples include threats to self-esteem and to one's worldview; the DTA paradigm can therefore assess the role of death-thoughts in self-esteem and worldview defenses. Furthermore, the DTA hypothesis lends support to TMT in that it corroborates its central hypothesis that death is uniquely problematic for human beings, and that it is fundamentally different in its effects than meaning threats, (i.e., Heine ''et al.'', 2006&lt;ref name = "Heine"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heine | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Proulx | first2 = T. | last3 = Vohs | first3 = K.

(2008) explore this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritsche | first1 = I. | last2 = Jonas | first2 = E. | last3 = Fankhänel | first3 = T. | year = 2008 | title = The role of control motivation in mortality salience effects on ingroup support and defense | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 524–541 | doi=10.1037/a0012666 | pmid=18729692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the DTA hypothesis had been rapidly gaining ground in TMT investigations, and as of 2009, has been employed in over 60 published papers, with a total of more than 90 empirical studies.&lt;ref name = "Hayes"/&gt;

===Death anxiety on health promotion===

How people respond to their fears and anxiety of death is investigated in TMT. Moreover, Taubman-Ben-Ari and Noy (2010) examine the idea that a person's level of self-awareness and self-consciousness should be considered in relation to their responses to their anxiety and death cognitions.&lt;ref name="anxiety"/&gt; The more an individual is presented with their death or death cognitions in general, the more fear and anxiety one may have; therefore, to combat said anxiety one may implement anxiety buffers.&lt;ref name="anxiety"/&gt;

Due to a change in people's lifestyles, in the direction of more unhealthy behaviors, the leading causes of death now, being [[cancer]] and [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], most definitely are related to individuals' unhealthy behaviors (though the statement is over-generalising and certainly cannot be applied to every case)&lt;ref name="death anxiety"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bozo | first1 = Ö. | last2 = Tunca | first2 = A. | last3 = Şİmşek | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = The effect of death anxiety and age on health- promoting behaviors: A terror-management theory perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied | volume = 143 | issue = 4| pages = 377–389 | doi = 10.3200/JRLP.143.4.377-389 | pmid = 19606644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Age and death anxiety both are factors that should be considered in the terror management theory, in relation to health-promoting behaviors. Age undoubtedly plays some kind of role in people's health-promoting behaviors; however, an actual age related effect on death anxiety and health-promoting behaviors has yet to be seen. Although, research has demonstrated that for young adults only, when they were prompted with death related scenarios, they yielded more health-promoting behaviors, compared to those participants in their sixties. In addition, death anxiety has been found to have an effect for young adults, on their behaviors of health promotion.&lt;ref name="death anxiety"/&gt;

==Terror management health model==
The terror management health model (TMHM) explores the role that death plays on one's health and behavior. Goldenberg and Arndt (2008) state that the TMHM proposes the idea that death, despite its threatening nature, is in fact instrumental and purposeful in the conditioning of one's behavior towards the direction of a longer life.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt;

According to Goldenberg and Arndt (2008), certain health behaviors such as [[Breast self-examination|breast self-exam]]s (BSEs) can consciously activate and facilitate people to think of death, especially their own death.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt; While death can be instrumental for individuals, in some cases, when breast self-exams activate people's death thoughts an obstacle can present itself, in terms of health promotion, because of the experience of fear and threat.&lt;ref name="model" /&gt; Abel and Kruger (2009) have suggested that the stress caused by increased awareness of mortality when celebrating one's birthday might explain the [[birthday effect]], where mortality rates seem to spike around these days.&lt;ref name="MLB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mortality Salience of Birthdays on Day of Death in the Major Leagues|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Death Studies|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=175–184|doi=10.1080/07481180802138936|pmid=19143110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, death and thoughts of death can serve as a way of empowering the self, not as threats. Researchers, Cooper ''et al.'' (2011) explored TMHM in terms of empowerment, specifically using BSEs under two conditions; when death thoughts were prompted, and when thoughts of death were non-conscious.&lt;ref name="TMHM"/&gt; According to TMHM, people's health decisions, when death thoughts are not conscious, should be based on their motivations to act appropriately, in terms of the self and identity.&lt;ref name="TMHM" /&gt; Cooper ''et al.'' (2011) found that when mortality and death thoughts were primed, women reported more empowerment feelings than those who were not prompted before performing a BSE.&lt;ref name="TMHM" /&gt;

Additionally, TMHM suggests that mortality awareness and self-esteem are important factors in individuals' decision making and behaviors relating to their health. TMHM explores how people will engage in behaviors, whether positive or negative, even with the heightened awareness of mortality, in the attempt to conform to society's expectations and improve their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt; The TMHM is useful in understanding what motivates individuals regarding their health decisions and behaviors.

In terms of smoking behaviors and attitudes, the impact of warnings with death messages depends on:
# The individuals' level of smoking-based self-esteem
# The warnings' actual degree of death information&lt;ref name="morality"/&gt;

== Emotion ==
People with low self-esteem, but not high self-esteem, have more negative emotions when reminded of death. This is believed to be because these individuals lack the very defenses that TMT argues protect people from mortality concerns (e.g., solid worldviews). In contrast, positive mood states are not impacted by death thoughts for people of low or high self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Routledge|first=C. |author2=Ostafin, B. |author3=Juhl, J. |author4=Sedikides, C. |author5=Cathey, C.  |author6=Liao, J.|title=The effects of self-esteem and mortality salience on well-being, growth motivation, and maladaptive behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|pages=897–916|doi=10.1037/a0021431 |volume=99 |issue=6 |pmid=21114350|citeseerx=10.1.1.465.8476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
It has been suggested that culture provides  meaning, organization, and a coherent world view that diminishes the psychological terror caused by the knowledge of eventual death. The terror management theory can help to explain why a leader's popularity can grow substantially during times of crisis. When a follower's mortality is made prominent they will tend to show a strong preference for iconic leaders. An example of this occurred when [[George&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Bush]]'s [[United States presidential approval rating|approval rating]] jumped almost 50&amp;nbsp;percent following the [[September&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;attacks]] in the United States. As Forsyth (2009) posits, this tragedy made U.S.&amp;nbsp;citizens aware of their mortality, and Bush provided an antidote to these existential concerns by promising to bring justice to the terrorist group responsible for the attacks.

Researchers Cohen ''et al.'' (2004), in their particular study on TMT, tested the preferences for different types of leaders, while reminding people of their mortality. Three different candidates were presented to participants. The three leaders were of three different types: task-oriented (emphasized setting goals, strategic planning, and structure), relationship-oriented (emphasized [[compassion]], trust, and confidence in others), and [[charisma]]tic. The participants were then placed in one of two conditions: mortality salient or control group. In the former condition the participants were asked to describe the emotions surrounding their own death, as well as the physical act of the death itself, whereas the [[control group]] were asked similar questions about an upcoming exam. The results of the study were that the charismatic leader was favored more, and the relationship-oriented leader was favored less, in the mortality-salient condition. Further research has shown that mortality salient individuals also prefer leaders who are members of the same group, as well as men rather than women (Hoyt ''et al.'' 2010). This has links to [[social role theory]].

==TMT and religion==
TMT posits that religion was created as a means for humans to cope with their own mortality. Supporting this, arguments in favor of life after death, and simply being religious, reduce the effects of mortality salience on worldview defense. Thoughts of death have also been found to increase religious beliefs. At an implicit, subconscious level, this is the case even for people who claim to be nonreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heflick |first=Nathan |author2=Goldenberg, J. |title=No atheists in foxholes: Arguments for (but not against) afterlives buffer mortality salience effects for atheists |journal=British Journal of Social Psychology |year=2012| doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02058.x |pmid=21995319 |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=385–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jong |first=Jonathan |author2=Halberstadt, Jamin |author3=Bluemke, Matthias |title=Foxhole atheism, revisited: The effects of mortality salience on explicit and implicit religious belief |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.005 |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |year=2012 |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=983–989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}

Bloom and Nancy Dess]&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar commented that the field of psychology would be advanced by a study of paralyzed states caused by anxiety that would only be alleviated with the reworking of a person's mental state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fessler/pubs/NavarreteNormativeBiasEP.pdf Normative Bias and Adaptive Challenges]&lt;/ref&gt; These authors instead explain human behavior is selected to urge people to avoid situations likely to lead to death. This suggests that mortality salience effects reflect adaptive responses to solve specific life-threats rather than an unconscious attempt to avoid this realization.

===Prevalence of death in TMT===
Since findings on mortality salience and worldview defense were first published, other researchers have claimed that the effects may have been obtained due to reasons other than death itself, such as anxiety, fear, or other aversive stimuli such as pain. Other studies have found effects similar to those that MS results in – for example, thinking about difficult personal choices to be made, being made to respond to open-ended questions regarding uncertainty, thinking about being robbed, thinking about being socially isolated, and being told that one's life lacks meaning.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pyszczynski | first1 = T. | last2 = Greenberg | first2 = J. | last3 = Solomon | first3 = S. | last4 = Maxfield | first4 = M. | year = 2006 | title = On the unique psychological import of the human awareness of mortality: Theme and variations | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 328–356 | doi=10.1080/10478400701369542}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these cases exist, thoughts of death have since been compared to various aversive experimental controls, such as (but not limited to) thinking about: failure, writing a critical exam, public speaking with a considerable audience, being excluded, paralysis, dental pain, intense physical pain, etc.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

With regards to the studies that found similar effects, TMT theorists have argued that in the previously mentioned studies where death was not the subject thought about, the subjects would quite easily be related to death in an individual's mind due to "linguistic or experiential connection with mortality" (p.&amp;nbsp;332)&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; For example, being robbed invokes thoughts of violence and being unsafe in one's own home – many people have died trying to protect their property and family. A second possible explanation for these results involves the death-thought accessibility hypothesis: these threats somehow sabotage crucial anxiety-buffering aspects of an individual's worldview or self-esteem, which increases their DTA. For example, one study found increased DTA in response to thoughts of antagonistic relations with attachment figures.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Meaning maintenance model===
The meaning maintenance model (MMM) was initially introduced as a comprehensive motivational theory that claimed to subsume TMT, with alternative explanations for TMT findings. Essentially, it posits that people automatically give meaning to things, and when those meanings are somehow disrupted, it causes anxiety.&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt; In response, people concentrate on "meaning maintenance to reestablish their sense of symbolic unity" and that such "meaning maintenance often involves the compensatory reaffirmation of alternative meaning structures".&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt; These meanings, among other things, should "provide a basis for prediction and control of our...environments, help [one] to cope with tragedy and trauma...and the symbolic cheating of death via adherence to the enduring values that these cultures provide".&lt;ref name = "Heine"/&gt;

TMT theorists argue that MMM cannot describe why different sets of meaning are preferred for a symbol by different people, and that while they may exist, "different [(i.e., more concrete)] types of meaning have different psychological functions".&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; For example, MMM&amp;nbsp;theorists argue that all types of meaning are basically equal, and yet one could not compare the likelihood of defensive responses resulting from exposure to a deck of cards containing black hearts with something like the September&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;attacks.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists argue, essentially, that unless something is an important element of a person's anxiety-buffering worldview or self-esteem, it will not require broad meaning maintenance.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

In sum, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists believe that MMM cannot accurately claim to be an alternative to TMT because it does not seem to be able to explain the current breadth of TMT evidence.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; As an example, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists assert that mortality salience would not be a threat to meaning, since our eventual demise is a necessary condition of life. Therefore, it should not cause an individual to engage in general meaning maintenance. MMM also makes no attempt to explain why threatening meaning increases DTA.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Offensive defensiveness===
Some theorists have argued that it is not the idea of death and nonexistence that is unsettling to people, but the fact that uncertainty is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGregor | first1 = I. | last2 = Zanna | first2 = M. P. | last3 = Holmes | first3 = J. G. | last4 = Spencer | first4 = S. J. | year = 2001 | title = Compensatory conviction in the face of personal uncertainty: Going to extremes and being oneself | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = 3| pages = 472–488 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.3.472}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, these researchers posited that people defend themselves by altering their fear responses from uncertainty to an enthusiasm approach.&lt;ref name ="uniqueness of death"/&gt;  Other researchers argue for distinguishing fear of death from fear of dying and, therein, posit that ultimately the fear of death has more to do with some other fear (e.g., fear of pain) or reflects fear of the unknown.&lt;ref name="FOTU"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carleton|first1=R. Nicholas|title=Fear of the unknown: One fear to rule them all?|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=June 2016|volume=41|pages=5–21|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2016.03.011|pmid=27067453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMT theorists agree that uncertainty can be disconcerting in some cases and it may even result in defense responses, but note that they believe the inescapability of death and the possibility of its finality regarding one's existence is most unsettling. They ask, "'Would death be any less frightening if you knew for certain that it would come next Tuesday at 5:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., and that your hopes for an afterlife were illusory?'....Would you rather be certain that death is the end, or live with the uncertainty that it might not be?" They also note that people actually seek out some types of uncertainty, and that being uncertain is not always very unpleasant.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt; In contrast, there is substantial evidence that, all things being equal, uncertainty and the unknown represent fundamental fears and are only experienced as pleasant when there is sufficient contextual certainty.&lt;ref name = "FOTU" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "IU_Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carleton|first1=R. Nicholas|title=Into the unknown: A review and synthesis of contemporary models involving uncertainty|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=April 2016|volume=39|pages=30–43|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2016.02.007|pmid=26945765}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a surprise involves uncertainty, but is only perceived as pleasant if there is sufficient certainty that the surprise will be pleasant.  Consider a box received on a birthday from a trusted family member as compared to the box received at the end of the film "[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]" (which contains a severed head).

Though TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists acknowledge that many responses to mortality salience involve greater approaches (zealousness) towards important worldviews, they also note examples of mortality salience which resulted in the opposite, which offensive defensiveness cannot account for: when negative features of a group to which participants belong were made salient, people actively distanced themselves from that group under&amp;nbsp;mortality salience.&lt;ref name = "uniqueness of death"/&gt;

===Evolutionary psychology, coalitional psychology, and TMT===
Several critiques have been proposed against TMT from [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] – for reasons including that fear is an adaptive response in individuals' that has come about as a result of natural selection; without these adaptations human beings would have never been able to avoid maladaptive situations.&lt;ref name = "Landau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landau | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Solomon | first2 = S. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | last4 = Greenberg | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On the compatibility of terror management theory and perspectives on human evolution | url = | journal = Evolutionary Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 476–519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is unlikely that people would have psychological ways of slowing-down anxiety.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; In response, TMT&amp;nbsp;theorists argue that this critique is mixing up fear related to immediate danger with anxiety related to thoughts of threats that will or may occur eventually.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; TMT is talking about the protection that self-esteem and cultural worldviews offer against the threat of unavoidable death in the ''future''. While anxiety may be adaptive in avoiding entering a dangerous place (e.g. because a predator may be waiting), this doesn't mean that anxiety must be adaptive in all cases.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; For a more comprehensive review of TMT and evolutionary psychology, see Landau ''et al.'', 2007.&lt;ref name = "Landau"/&gt; Similar evolutionary critiques have been raised by researchers exploring uncertainty and unknowns (see for reviews,&lt;ref name = "FOTU"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "IU_Review" /&gt;).

Coalitional psychology&amp;nbsp;(CP) is presented as another alternative to TMT, which proposes that there is an evolutionary tendency to seek safety in groups (coalitions) as a reaction to adaptive threats.&lt;ref name= "Nav"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Navarrete | first1 = D.C. | last2 = Fessler | first2 = D.M.T. | year = 2005 | title = Normative bias and adaptive challenges: A relational approach to coalitional psychology and a critique of terror management theory | url = | journal = Evolutionary Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 297–325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People already a part of coalitional groups seek to protect their membership by exhibiting their value to the group.&lt;ref name = "Nav"/&gt; TMT theorists answer by arguing that CP 1) cannot account for the fact that virtually all cultures have a supernatural dimension; 2) it does not explain why cultural worldview defense is symbolic, involving allegiance to both specific and general systems of abstract meaning unrelated to specific threats, rather than focused on the specific adaptive threats it supposedly evolved to deal with; 3) it dismisses TMT's dual process account of the underlying processes that generate MS effects without providing an alternative of any kind or attempting to account for the data relevant to this aspect of the TMT analysis and 4) the experiments testing hypotheses derived from CP do not provide compelling or unique support for CP, 5) it cannot account for a host of empirical findings supporting hypotheses derived from TMT that could never be deduced from CP.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.ku.edu/~mjlandau/docs/Landau_tmt%20and%20evol%20psych_EP%202007.pdf On the Compatibility of Terror Management Theory and Perspectives on Human Evolution&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Turritopsis dohrnii''''', the '''immortal jellyfish''', is a [[species]] of small, [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]] [[jellyfish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bavestrello|first=Giorgio |author2=Christian Sommer |author3=Michele Sarà|year=1992|title=Bi-directional conversion in Turritopsis nutricula (Hydrozoa)|journal=Scientia Marina|volume=56|issue=2–3|pages=137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="piraino-96"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piraino|first=Stefano|author2=F.

It is one of the few known cases of [[animal]]s capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual. Others include the jellyfish ''{{ill|Laodicea undulata|sv}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|last = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |display-authors=etal|volume=149|issue = 2|pages=339–346}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Aurelia (genus)|Aurelia]]'' sp.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 2015-12-21|journal = PLoS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|display-authors=etal|volume=10|issue = 12|pmc=4687044|pages=e0145314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most other [[hydrozoan]]s, ''T. dohrnii'' begin their life as free-swimming tiny [[larva]]e known as [[planula]]. As a planula settles down, it gives rise to a colony of [[polyp]]s that are attached to the sea-floor. All the polyps and jellyfish arising from a single planula are genetically identical clones. The polyps form into an extensively branched form, which is not commonly seen in most jellyfish. Jellyfish, also known as medusae, then bud off these polyps and continue their life in a free-swimming form, eventually becoming sexually mature. When sexually mature they have been known to prey on other jellyfish species at a rapid pace. If a ''T. dohrnii'' jellyfish is exposed to environmental stress or physical assault, or is sick or old, it can revert to the polyp stage, forming a new polyp colony.&lt;ref name=nytm/&gt; It does this through the cell development process of [[transdifferentiation]], which alters the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated state of the cells]] and transforms them into new types of cells.

Theoretically, this process can go on indefinitely, effectively rendering the jellyfish biologically immortal,&lt;ref name="piraino-96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CheatingDeath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of Turritopsis|last=Gilbert|first=Scott F.|year=2006|accessdate=2009-03-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402085711/http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6|archivedate=2010-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in practice individuals can still die. In nature, most ''Turritopsis'' are likely to succumb to predation or disease in the medusa stage, without reverting to the polyp form.&lt;ref name="National Geographic News"&gt;{{cite web

The capability of biological immortality with no maximum lifespan makes ''T. dohrnii'' an important target of basic biological, [[Ageing|aging]] and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencepub.net/stem/stem0504/007_A00288stem050414_49_53.pdf|doi=10.7537/marsscj050414.07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The "immortal jellyfish" was formerly classified as ''[[Turritopsis nutricula|T. nutricula]]''.&lt;ref name=mig/&gt;

== Description ==

The medusa of ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' is bell-shaped, with a maximum diameter of about {{convert|4.5|mm|in}} and is about as tall as it is wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramp|first=P. L.|title=Synopsis of the medusae of the world|journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|year=1961|volume=40|pages=1–469|doi=10.1017/s0025315400007347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesOnline26012009" /&gt; The jelly in the walls of the bell is uniformly thin, except for some thickening at the apex. The relatively large stomach is bright red and has a cruciform shape in cross section. Young specimens 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter have only eight tentacles evenly spaced out along the edge,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martell|first=L.|last2=Piraino|first2=S.|last3=Gravili|first3=C.|last4=Boero|first4=F.|date=2016-07-02|title=Life cycle, morphology and medusa ontogenesis of Turritopsis dohrnii (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa)|journal=Italian Journal of Zoology|volume=83|issue=3|pages=390–399|doi=10.1080/11250003.2016.1203034|issn=1125-0003}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas adult specimens have 80–90 tentacles. The medusa (jellyfish) is free-living in the plankton. Dense [[nerve net]] cells are also present in the [[epidermis]] in the cap. They form a large ring-like structure above the radial cannal which is commonly presented in cnidarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koizumi|first=Osamu|last2=Hamada|first2=Shun|last3=Minobe|first3=Sumiko|last4=Hamaguchi-Hamada|first4=Kayoko|last5=Kurumata-Shigeto|first5=Mami|last6=Nakamura|first6=Masaru|last7=Namikawa|first7=Hiroshi|title=The nerve ring in cnidarians: its presence and structure in hydrozoan medusae|journal=Zoology|volume=118|issue=2|pages=79–88|doi=10.1016/j.zool.2014.10.001|pmid=25498132|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Turritopsis dohrnii'' also has a bottom-living polyp form, or hydroid, which consists of [[stolon]]s that run along the substrate, and upright branches with feeding polyps that can produce medusa buds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser|first=C. McLean|title=Hydroids of the Pacific Coast of Canada and the United States|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1937|pages=201 plus 44 plates}}&lt;/ref&gt; These polyps develop over a few days into tiny 1&amp;nbsp;mm medusae, which are liberated and swim free from the parent hydroid colony.

Images of both the medusa and polyp of the closely related species ''[[Turritopsis rubra]]'' from [[New Zealand]] can be found online.&lt;ref name="schuchert-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/hydrozoa/antho/turritopsis-rubra.htm |title=Turritopsis rubra |last=Schuchert |first=Peter |accessdate=23 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912180002/http://www.ville-ge.ch/mhng/hydrozoa/antho/turritopsis-rubra.htm |archivedate=September 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until a recent genetic study, it was thought that ''Turritopsis rubra'' and ''Turritopsis nutricula'' were the same.&lt;ref name=mig/&gt; It is not known whether or not ''T. rubra'' medusae can also transform back into polyps.

== Distribution and invasion ==

''Turritopsis'' is believed to have originated in the [[Pacific]] but has spread all over the world through trans-Arctic migrations, and has speciated into several populations that are easy to distinguish morphologically, but whose species distinctions have recently been verified by a study and comparison of mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences.&lt;ref name=mig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miglietta|first=M.

== Life cycle ==

The eggs develop in gonads of female medusae, which are located in the walls of the manubrium (stomach). Mature eggs are presumably spawned and fertilized in the sea by sperm produced and released by male medusae, as is the case for most hydromedusae, although the related species ''Turritopsis rubra'' seems to retain fertilized eggs until the planula stage.&lt;ref name="schuchert-10"/&gt; Fertilized eggs develop into [[planula]] larvae, which settle onto the sea-floor (or even the rich marine communities that live on floating docks), and develop into polyp colonies ([[hydroids]]). The hydroids bud new jellyfishes, which are released at about one millimetre in size and then grow and feed in the plankton, becoming sexually mature after a few weeks (the exact duration depends on the ocean temperature; at {{convert|20|C|F}} it is 25 to 30 days and at {{convert|22|C|F}} it is 18 to 22 days).&lt;ref name="piraino-96"/&gt; Medusae of ''T. dohrnii'' are able to survive between 14&amp;nbsp;°C  and 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Biological immortality ===

Most jellyfish species have a relatively fixed life-span, which varies by species from hours to many months (long-lived mature jellyfish spawn every day or night; the time is also fairly fixed and species-specific).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=C. E.|year=1983|title=Vertical migration and diel activity patterns of hydromedusae: studies in a large tank|journal=Journal of Plankton Research|volume=5|pages=619–635|doi=10.1093/plankt/5.5.619|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medusa of ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' is the only form known to have developed the ability to return to a polyp state, by a specific transformation process that requires the presence of certain cell types (tissue from both the jellyfish bell surface and the circulatory canal system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/science/biology/meet-the-worlds-only-immortal-animal/|title = Meet the world's only immortal animal|date = December 5, 2008|accessdate = January 10, 2015|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful laboratory experiments have revealed that all stages of the medusae, from newly released to fully mature individuals, can transform back into polyps under the conditions of starvation, sudden temperature change, reduction of salinity and artificial damage of the bell with forceps or scissor.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; The transforming [[medusae|medusa]] is characterized first by deterioration of the bell, mesoglea and tentacles. All immature medusa (with 12 tentacles at most) then turned into a [[Microbial cyst|cyst]]-like stage and then transformed into [[stolon]]s and polyps. However, about 20%-40% of mature medusa went into stolons and polyps stage without passing cyst-like stage. Polyps were formed after 2 days since stolons had developed and fed on food. Polyps further multiply by growing additional stolons, branches and then polyps, to form colonial [[hydroids]]. In the experiment, they would eventually transform into stolons and polyps and begin their lives once again even without suffering from environment changes or injury.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; Diagram of the transformation procedure can be found at the further reading.

This ability to reverse the biotic cycle (in response to adverse conditions) is unique in the [[animals|animal kingdom]], and allows the jellyfish to bypass death, rendering ''Turritopsis dohrnii'' potentially [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]. The process has not been observed in their natural habitat, in part because the process is quite rapid, and because field observations at the right moment are unlikely.&lt;ref name="piraino-96" /&gt; Regardless, most individual medusae are likely to fall victim to the general hazards of life as [[plankton]], including being eaten by predators or succumbing to disease.

The species' cell development method of transdifferentiation has inspired scientists to find a way to make stem cells using this process for renewing damaged or dead tissue in [[human]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dimberu|first=Peniel M.|title=Immortal Jellyfish Provides Clues for Regenerative Medicine|url=http://singularityhub.com/2011/04/25/immortal-jellyfish-provides-clues-for-regenerative-medicine/|publisher=Singularity Hub|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genomic analysis ==
Genomic analyses such as [[sequence analysis]] on [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] or [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] DNA have been employed to investigate its lifecycle. mRNA analysis of each life stage showed that a stage-specific gene in the medusae stage is expressed tenfold more than in other stages.

Keeping ''T. dohrnii'' in captivity is quite difficult.

'''Xenotransplantation''' (''xenos-'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning "foreign" or strange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dooldeniya |first1=M D , |last2=Warrens |first2=AN |title=Xenotransplantation: where are we today? |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539416/ |website=NCBI |publisher=NCBI |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mitchell |first1=C Ben |title=Xenotransplanation and Transgenics: The Need to Discuss Limits |url=https://cbhd.org/content/xenotransplanation-and-transgenics-need-discuss-limits |website=Cbhd |publisher=Cbhd |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or '''heterologous transplant''' is the [[Organ transplant|transplantation]] of living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[biological tissue|tissue]]s or [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s from one [[species]] to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/transplantation/xeno/en/ Xenotransplantation]. Definition by the World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt; Such cells, tissues or organs are called '''xenografts''' or '''xenotransplants'''. It is contrasted with [[allotransplantation]] (from other individual of same species), [[Syngenic|syngeneic]] transplantation or isotransplantation (grafts transplanted between two genetically identical individuals of the same species) and [[autotransplantation]] (from one part of the body to another in the same person).

Xenotransplantation of human [[tumor]] cells into [[immunocompromised]] mice is a research technique frequently used in pre-clinical [[oncology]] research.

Human xenotransplantation offers a potential treatment for end-stage [[organ failure]], a significant health problem in parts of the [[industrialized world]].  It also raises many novel medical, legal and ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kress | first1 = J. M. | title = Xenotransplantation: Ethics and economics | journal = Food and drug law journal | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 353–384 | year = 1998 | pmid = 10346691}}&lt;/ref&gt; A continuing concern is that many animals, such as pigs, have a shorter lifespan than humans, meaning that their tissues age at a quicker rate. Disease transmission ([[xenozoonosis]]) and permanent alteration to the genetic code of animals are also causes for concern. Similarly to objections to [[animal testing]], animal rights activists have also objected to xenotransplantation on ethical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/organfarm/interviews/lyons.html |title=Interviews - Dan Lyons |publisher=PBS |access-date=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few temporarily successful cases of xenotransplantation are published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/596_xeno.html  |title=Organ Transplants from Animals: Examining the Possibilities |publisher=Internet Archive |work=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071210031618/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/596_xeno.html |archivedate = 2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for patients and physicians to use the term "allograft" imprecisely to refer to either allograft (human-to-human) or xenograft (animal-to-human), but it is helpful scientifically (for those searching or reading the [[scientific literature]]) to maintain the more precise distinction in [[usage]].

==History==

The first serious attempts at xenotransplantation (then called heterotransplantation) appeared in the scientific literature in 1905, when slices of rabbit kidney were transplanted into a child with [[renal insufficiency]].&lt;ref name=History1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reemtsma|first1=K|title=Xenotransplantation: A Historical Perspective.|journal=ILAR journal|date=1995|volume=37|issue=1|pages=9–12|pmid=11528018|url=https://academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article/37/1/9/760596/Xenotransplantation-A-Historical-Perspective|doi=10.1093/ilar.37.1.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two decades of the 20th century, several subsequent efforts attempts to use organs from lambs, pigs and primates were published.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

Scientific interest in xenotransplantation declined when the [[immunological]] basis of the organ rejection process was described. The next waves of studies on the topic came with the discovery of [[immunosuppressive drug]]s.  Even more studies followed Dr. [[Joseph Murray]]'s first successful [[kidney transplantation|renal transplantation]] in 1954 and scientists, facing the ethical questions of organ donation for the first time, accelerated their effort in looking for alternatives to human organs.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

In 1963, doctors at [[Tulane University]] attempted [[chimpanzee]]-to-human renal transplantations in six people who were near death; after this and several subsequent unsuccessful attempts to use primates as organ donors and the development of a working cadaver organ procuring program, interest in xenotransplantation for kidney failure dissipated.&lt;ref name=History1995/&gt;

An American infant girl known as "[[Baby Fae]]" with [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]] was the first infant recipient of a xenotransplantation, when she received a [[baboon]] heart in 1983. The procedure was performed by [[Leonard L. Bailey]] at [[Loma Linda University Medical Center]] in [[Loma Linda, California]]. Fae died 21 days later due to a [[Humoral immunity|humoral-based]] [[graft rejection]] thought to be caused mainly by an ABO [[blood type]] mismatch, considered unavoidable due to the rarity of type O baboons. The graft was meant to be temporary, but unfortunately a suitable [[allograft]] replacement could not be found in time. While the procedure itself did not advance the progress on xenotransplantation, it did shed a light on the insufficient amount of organs for infants. The story grew so big that it made such an impact that the crisis of infant organ shortage improved for that time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.1985.03360230053022 | last1 = Bailey | first1 = L.

Human organs have been transplanted into animals as a powerful research technique for studying [[human biology]] without harming human patients. This technique has also been proposed as an alternative source of human organs for future transplantation into human patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis |first=Tanya |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/growing-human-kidneys-in-rats-sparks-ethical-debate/ |title=Growing human kidneys in rats sparks ethical debate |publisher=CBS News |date=2015-01-21 |accessdate=2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, researchers from the [[Ganogen Research Institute]] transplanted [[human]] [[fetal]] [[kidneys]] into rats which demonstrated life supporting function and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/ajt.13149 |pmid=25645705|title=Arterial Flow Regulator Enables Transplantation and Growth of Human Fetal Kidneys in Rats|journal=American Journal of Transplantation|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1692–700|year=2015|last1=Chang|first1=N.

==Potential uses==
A worldwide shortage of organs for clinical implantation causes about 20–35% of patients who need replacement organs to die on the waiting list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Healy | first1 = D. G. | last2 = Lawler | first2 = Z. | last3 = McEvoy | first3 = O. | last4 = Parlon | first4 = B. | last5 = Baktiari | first5 = N. | last6 = Egan | first6 = J.

If [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] can be perfected, it could allow for long-term storage of xenogenic cells, tissues and organs so that they would be more readily available for transplant.

Xenotransplants could save thousands of patients waiting for donated organs. The animal organ, probably from a pig or baboon could be genetically altered with human genes to trick a patient’s immune system into accepting it as a part of its own body. They have re-emerged because of the lack of organs available and the constant battle to keep immune systems from [[Transplant rejection|rejecting]] allotransplants. Xenotransplants are thus potentially a more effective alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Platt JL, Cascalho M |title= New and old technologies for organ replacement|journal= Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 179–85|pmid=23449347|year= 2013|doi= 10.1097/MOT.0b013e32835f0887|pmc=4911019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3501885 |pmid= 23172951|year= 2012|author1= Van Der Windt|first1= D.

Xenotransplantation also is and has been a valuable tool used in research laboratories to study [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19913288|year=2010|author1=Bols|first1=P.

== Potential animal organ donors ==

Since they are the closest relatives to humans, non-human primates were first considered as a potential organ source for xenotransplantation to humans. Chimpanzees were originally considered the best option since their organs are of similar size, and they have good blood type compatibility with humans, which makes them potential candidates for [[xenotransfusion]]s. However, since chimpanzees are listed as an endangered species, other potential donors were sought. Baboons are more readily available, but impractical as potential donors. Problems include their smaller body size, the infrequency of blood group O (the universal donor), their long gestation period, and their typically small number of offspring. In addition, a major problem with the use of nonhuman primates is the increased risk of disease transmission, since they are so closely related to humans.&lt;ref name=michler1996&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Michler | first1 = R. | title = Xenotransplantation: Risks, Clinical Potential, and Future Prospects | doi = 10.3201/eid0201.960111 | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–70 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8903201 | pmc =2639801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic pig|Pig]]s (''Sus scrofa domesticus'') are currently thought to be the best candidates for organ donation. The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans.&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dooldeniya | first1 = M. D. | last2 = Warrens | first2 = A.

(2007) [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3715.htm Xenotransplantation]. Emedicine.com&lt;/ref&gt; Current experiments in xenotransplantation most often use pigs as the donor, and baboons as human models.

In the field of regenerative medicine, pancreatogenesis- or nephrogenesis-disabled pig embryos, unable to form a specific organ, allow experimentation toward the ''in vivo'' generation of functional organs from xenogenic pluripotent stem cells in large animals via compensation for an empty developmental niche (blastocyst complementation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Matsunari Hitomi |author2=Nagashima Hiroshi |author3=Watanabe Masahito | year = | title = and Hiromitsu Nakauchi (2013).

To date no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to the many obstacles arising from the response of the recipient’s [[immune system]]. "Xenozoonoses" are one of the biggest threats to rejections, as they are xenogenetic infections. The introduction of these microorganisms are a big issue that lead ti the fatal infections and then rejection of the organs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boneva |first1=RS |last2=Folks |first2=TM |last3=Chapman |first3=LE |title=Infectious disease issues in xenotransplantation. |journal=Clinical microbiology reviews |date=January 2001 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=1-14 |doi=10.1128/CMR.14.1.1-14.2001 |pmid=11148000}}&lt;/ref&gt;This response, which is generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and can in some cases result in the immediate death of the recipient. There are several types of rejection organ xenografts are faced with, these include: 
* Hyperacute rejection
* Acute vascular rejection
* Cellular rejection
* Chronic rejection

A rapid, violent, and hyperacute response comes as a result of [[antibodies]] present in the host organism. These antibodies are known as xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNAs).&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003/&gt;

==== Hyperacute rejection ====

This rapid and violent type of rejection occurs within minutes to hours from the time of the transplant. It is mediated by the binding of XNAs (xenoreactive natural antibodies) to the donor endothelium, causing activation of the human [[complement system]], which results in endothelial damage, inflammation, thrombosis and necrosis of the transplant. XNAs are first produced and begin circulating in the blood in neonates, after colonization of the bowel by bacteria with galactose moieties on their cell walls. Most of these antibodies are the [[IgM]] class, but also include [[IgG]], and [[IgA]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

The epitope XNAs target is an α-linked galactose moiety, Gal-α-1,3Gal (also called the α-Gal epitope), produced by the enzyme α-galactosyl transferase.&lt;ref name=candinas2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Candinas | first1 = D. | last2 = Adams | first2 = D. H. | title = Xenotransplantation: Postponed by a millennium? | doi = 10.1093/qjmed/93.2.63 | journal = QJM | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 63–66 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10700475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most non-primates contain this enzyme thus, this epitope is present on the organ epithelium and is perceived as a foreign [[antigen]] by primates, which lack the galactosyl transferase enzyme. In pig to primate xenotransplantation, XNAs recognize porcine glycoproteins of the integrin family.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

The binding of XNAs initiate complement activation through the [[classical complement pathway]]. Complement activation causes a cascade of events leading to: destruction of endothelial cells, platelet degranulation, inflammation, coagulation, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage. The end result is [[thrombosis]] and [[necrosis]] of the xenograft.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

===== Overcoming hyperacute rejection =====

Since hyperacute rejection presents such a barrier to the success of xenografts, several strategies to overcome it are under investigation:

''Interruption of the complement cascade'' 
*The recipient's complement cascade can be inhibited through the use of cobra venom factor (which depletes C3), soluble complement receptor type 1, anti-C5 antibodies, or C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). Disadvantages of this approach include the toxicity of cobra venom factor, and most importantly these treatments would deprive the individual of a functional complement system.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

''Transgenic organs (Genetically engineered pigs)'' 
*1,3 galactosyl transferase gene knockouts – These pigs don’t contain the gene that codes for the enzyme responsible for expression of the immunogeneic gal-α-1,3Gal moiety (the α-Gal epitope).&lt;ref name=latemple&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-3089.1998.tb00027.x | last1 = Latemple | first1 = D.

*Increased expression of H-transferase (α 1,2 fucosyltransferase), an enzyme that competes with galactosyl transferase. Experiments have shown this reduces α-Gal expression by 70%.&lt;ref name=sharma&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.14.7190 | last1 = Sharma | first1 = A. | last2 = Okabe | first2 = J. | last3 = Birch | first3 = P. | last4 = McClellan | first4 = S.

*Expression of human complement regulators ([[CD55]], [[CD46]], and [[CD59]]) to inhibit the complement cascade.&lt;ref name=huang&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-695X.2001.tb00521.x | last1 = Huang | first1 = J. | last2 = Gou | first2 = D. | last3 = Zhen | first3 = C. | last4 = Jiang | first4 = D. | last5 = Mao | first5 = X. | last6 = Li | first6 = W. | last7 = Chen | first7 = S. | last8 = Cai | first8 = C. | title = Protection of xenogeneic cells from human complement-mediated lysis by the expression of human DAF, CD59 and MCP | journal = FEMS Immunology and Medical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 203–209 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11720816}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Plasmaphoresis, on humans to remove 1,3 galactosyltransferase, reduces the risk of activation of effector cells such as CTL (CD8 T cells), complement pathway activation and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH).

====Acute vascular rejection====

Also known as delayed xenoactive rejection, this type of rejection occurs in discordant xenografts within 2 to 3 days, if hyperacute rejection is prevented. The process is much more complex than hyperacute rejection and is currently not completely understood. Acute vascular rejection requires de novo protein synthesis and is driven by interactions between the graft endothelial cells and host antibodies, macrophages, and platelets. The response is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of mostly [[macrophages]] and [[natural killer cells]] (with small numbers of [[T cells]]), intravascular thrombosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

Binding of the previously mentioned XNAs to the donor endothelium leads to the activation of host macrophages as well as the endothelium itself. The endothelium activation is considered type II since gene induction and protein synthesis are involved. The binding of XNAs ultimately leads to the development of a procoagulant state, the secretion of inflammatory [[cytokines]] and [[chemokines]], as well as expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules such as [[E-selectin]], intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ([[ICAM-1]]), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ([[VCAM-1]]).&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

This response is further perpetuated as normally binding between regulatory proteins and their ligands aid in the control of coagulation and inflammatory responses. However, due to molecular incompatibilities between the molecules of the donor species and recipient (such as porcine [[major histocompatibility complex]] molecules and human natural killer cells), this may not occur.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

===== Overcoming acute vascular rejection =====
Due to its complexity,  the use of immunosuppressive drugs along with a wide array of approaches are necessary to prevent acute vascular rejection, and include: 
*Administering a synthetic thrombin inhibitor to modulate thrombogenesis
*Depletion of anti-galactose antibodies (XNAs) by techniques such as immunoadsorption, to prevent endothelial cell activation
*Inhibiting activation of macrophages (stimulated by CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells) and NK cells (stimulated by the release of Il-2). Thus, the role of MHC molecules and T cell responses in activation would have to be reassessed for each species combo.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;

==== Accommodation ====

If hyperacute and acute vascular rejection are avoided accommodation is possible, which is the survival of the xenograft despite the presence of circulating XNAs. The graft is given a break from humoral rejection&lt;ref name=takahashi&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Takahashi | first1 = T. | last2 = Saadi | first2 = S. | last3 = Platt | first3 = J. L. | doi = 10.1007/BF02786395 | title = Recent advances in the immunology of xenotransplantation | journal = Immunologic Research | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–297 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9379077 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the complement cascade is interrupted, circulating antibodies are removed, or their function is changed, or there is a change in the expression of surface antigens on the graft. This allows the xenograft to up-regulate and express protective genes, which aid in resistance to injury, such as [[heme oxygenase-1]] (an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme).&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt;

==== Cellular rejection ====
Rejection of the xenograft in hyperactute and acute vascular rejection is due to the response of the [[humoral immune system]], since the response is elicited by the XNAs. Cellular rejection is based on [[cellular immunity]], and is mediated by: 
*Natural killer cells, which accumulate in and damage the xenograft; and
*T-lymphocytes – which are activated by MHC molecules through both direct and indirect xenorecognition.

In direct xenorecognition, antigen presenting cells from the xenograft present peptides to recipient CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells via xenogeneic MHC class II molecules, resulting in the production of [[interleukin 2]] (IL-2). Indirect xenorecognition involves the presentation of antigens from the xenograft by recipient antigen presenting cells to CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. Antigens of phagocytosed graft cells can also be presented by the host’s class I MHC molecules to CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells.&lt;ref name=Dooldeniya2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=abbas2005&gt;Abbas, A., Lichtman, A. (2005) ''Cellular and Molecular Immunology'', 5th ed., pp. 81, 330–333, 381, 386. Elsevier Saunders, Pennsylvania,{{ISBN|0-7216-0008-5}}, {{DOI|10.1002/bmb.2004.494032019997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of cellular rejection in xenografts remains uncertain, however it is expected to be stronger than in allografts due to differences in peptides among different animals. This leads to more antigens potentially recognized as foreign, thus eliciting a greater indirect xenogenic response.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

===== Overcoming cellular rejection =====

A proposed strategy to avoid cellular rejection is to induce donor non-responsiveness using hematopoietic chimerism. Donor stem cells are introduced into the bone marrow of the recipient, where they coexist with the recipient’s stem cells. The bone marrow stem cells give rise to cells of all hematopoietic lineages, through the process of [[hematopoiesis]]. Lymphoid progenitor cells are created by this process and move to the thymus where negative selection eliminates T cells found to be reactive to self. The existence of donor stem cells in the recipient’s bone marrow causes donor reactive T cells to be considered self and undergo [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

==== Chronic rejection ====

Chronic rejection is slow and progressive, and usually occurs in transplants that survive the initial rejection phases. Scientists are still unclear how chronic rejection exactly works, research in this area is difficult since xenografts rarely survive past the initial acute rejection phases. Nonetheless, it is known that XNAs and the complement system are not primarily involved.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt; [[Fibrosis]] in the xenograft occurs as a result of immune reactions, cytokines (which stimulate fibroblasts), or healing (following cellular necrosis in acute rejection). Perhaps the major cause of chronic rejection is [[arteriosclerosis]]. Lymphocytes, which were previously activated by antigens in the vessel wall of the graft, activate macrophages to secrete smooth muscle growth factors. This results in a build up of smooth muscle cells on the vessel walls, causing the hardening and narrowing of vessels within the graft. Chronic rejection leads to pathologic changes of the organ, and is why transplants must be replaced after so many years.&lt;ref name="abbas2005"/&gt; It is also anticipated that chronic rejection will be more aggressive in xenotransplants as opposed to allotransplants.&lt;ref name=vanderpool&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vanderpool | first1 = H. Y. | title = Xenotransplantation: Progress and promise | doi = 10.1136/bmj.319.7220.1311 | journal = BMJ | volume = 319 | issue = 7220 | page = 1311 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10559062| pmc =1129087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dysregulated coagulation ====

Successful efforts have been made to create knockout mice without α1,3GT; the resulting reduction in the highly immunogenic αGal epitope has resulted in the reduction of the occurrence of hyperacute rejection, but has not eliminated other barriers to xenotransplantation such as dysregulated coagulation, also known as [[coagulopathy]].&lt;ref name="cowan2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cowan PJ |author2=Robson SC |author3=d’Apice AJF |title=Controlling coagulation dysregulation in xenotransplantation|journal=Current Opinion in Organ Transplantation|volume=16|issue=2|pages=214–21|pmid=21415824|pmc=3094512|year=2011|doi=10.1097/MOT.0b013e3283446c65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different organ xenotransplants result in different responses in clotting. For example, kidney transplants result in a higher degree of [[coagulopathy]], or impaired clotting, than cardiac transplants, whereas liver xenografts result in severe [[thrombocytopenia]], causing recipient death within a few days due to bleeding.&lt;ref name="cowan2011" /&gt; An alternate clotting disorder, [[thrombosis]], may be initiated by preexisting antibodies that affect the protein C anticoagulant system. Due to this effect, porcine donors must be extensively screened before transplantation. Studies have also shown that some porcine transplant cells are able to induce human tissue factor expression, thus stimulating platelet and monocyte aggregation around the xenotransplanted organ, causing severe clotting.&lt;ref name="ekser2010"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ekser B, Cooper DK|title=Overcoming the barriers to xenotransplantation: prospects for the future|journal=Expert review of clinical immunology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=219–30|pmid=20402385|pmc=2857338|year=2010|doi=10.1586/eci.09.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, spontaneous platelet accumulation may be caused by contact with pig von Willebrand factor.&lt;ref name="ekser2010" /&gt;

Just as the α1,3G epitope is a major problem in xenotransplantation, so too is dysregulated coagulation a cause of concern. Transgenic pigs that can control for variable coagulant activity based on the specific organ transplanted would make xenotransplantation a more readily available solution for the 70,000 patients per year who do not receive a human donation of the organ or tissue they need.&lt;ref name="ekser2010" /&gt;

=== Physiology ===
Extensive research is required to determine whether animal organs can replace the physiological functions of human organs. Many issues include:

*Size – Differences in organ size limit the range of potential recipients of xenotransplants.
*Longevity – The lifespan of most pigs is roughly 15 years, currently it is unknown whether or not a xenograft may be able to last longer than that. 
*Hormone and protein differences – Some proteins will be molecularly incompatible, which could cause malfunction of important regulatory processes. These differences also make the prospect of hepatic xenotransplantation less promising, since the liver plays an important role in the production of so many proteins.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;
*Environment – For example, pig hearts work in a different anatomical site and under different hydrostatic pressure than in humans.&lt;ref name="candinas2000"/&gt;
*Temperature – The body temperature of pigs is 39&amp;nbsp;°C (2&amp;nbsp;°C above the average human body temperature). Implications of this difference, if any, on the activity of important enzymes are currently unknown.&lt;ref name="Dooldeniya2003"/&gt;

===Xenozoonosis===
Xenozoonosis,  also known as [[zoonosis]] or xenosis, is the transmission of infectious agents between species via xenograft. Animal to human infection is normally rare, but has occurred in the past. An example of such is the [[avian influenza]], when an influenza A virus was passed from birds to humans.&lt;ref name=who2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beigel | first1 = J. | last2 = Farrar | first2 = J. | last3 = Han | first3 = A. | last4 = Hayden | first4 = F. | last5 = Hyer | first5 = R. | last6 = De Jong | first6 = M. | last7 = Lochindarat | first7 = S. | last8 = Nguyen | first8 = T. | last9 = Nguyen | first9 = T. | last10 = Tran | first10 = T.

*Implantation breaches the physical barrier that normally helps to prevent disease transmission,	
*The recipient of the transplant will be severely immunosuppressed; and
*Human complement regulators (CD46, CD55, and CD59) expressed in transgenic pigs have been shown to serve as virus receptors, and may also help to protect viruses from attack by the complement system.&lt;ref name=takeuchi2000&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0952-7915(00)00128-X | last1 = Takeuchi | first1 = Y. | last2 = Weiss | first2 = R.

Examples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine [[herpesvirus]], [[rotavirus]], [[parvovirus]], and [[circovirus]]. Porcine herpesviruses and rotaviruses can be eliminated from the donor pool by screening, however others (such as parvovirus and circovirus) may contaminate food and footwear then re-infect the herd. Thus, pigs to be used as organ donors must be housed under strict regulations and screened regularly for microbes and pathogens. Unknown viruses, as well as those not harmful in the animal, may also pose risks.&lt;ref name=takeuchi2000 /&gt; Of particular concern are PERVS (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.&lt;ref name=FDA2006&gt;FDA. (2006) [http://www.fda.gov/cber/xap/xap.htm Xenotransplantation Action Plan: FDA Approach to the Regulation of Xenotransplantation]. Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baboons and pigs carry myriad transmittable agents that are harmless in their natural host, but extremely toxic and deadly in humans. HIV is an example of a disease believed to have jumped from monkeys to humans. Researchers also do not know if an outbreak of infectious diseases could occur and if they could contain the outbreak even though they have measures for control. Another obstacle facing xenotransplants is that of the body’s rejection of foreign objects by its immune system. These antigens (foreign objects) are often treated with powerful immunosuppressive drugs that could, in turn, make the patient vulnerable to other infections and actually aid the disease. This is the reason the organs would have to be altered to fit the patients' DNA ([[histocompatibility]]).

In 2005, the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) declared an eighteen-year moratorium on all animal-to-human transplantation, concluding that the risks of transmission of animal viruses to patients and the wider community had not been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf |title=The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council's 2005 statement on xenotransplantation |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-11-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080722120810/http://nhmrc.gov.au/about/committees/expert/gtrap/_files/xenotrans.pdf |archivedate = 2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was repealed in 2009 after an NHMRC review stated "... the risks, if appropriately regulated, are minimal and acceptable given the potential benefits.", citing international developments on the management and regulation of xenotransplantation by the World Health Organisation and the European Medicines Agency.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Tim (10 December 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20091215005407/http://www.lifescientist.com.au/article/329402/xenotransplantation_ban_lifted_australia Xenotransplantation ban lifted in Australia]. lifescientist.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Porcine endogenous retroviruses ====
[[Endogenous retroviruses]] are remnants of ancient viral infections, found in the genomes of most, if not all, mammalian species. Integrated into the chromosomal DNA, they are vertically transferred through inheritance.&lt;ref name="vanderpool"/&gt; Due to the many deletions and mutations they accumulate over time, they usually are not infectious in the host species, however the virus may become infectious in another species.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007"/&gt; PERVS were originally discovered as retrovirus particles released from cultured porcine kidney cells.&lt;ref name=armstrong1971&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-10-2-195 | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = J.

===Ethics===
Xenografts have been a controversial procedure since they were first attempted. Many, including animal rights groups, strongly oppose killing animals to harvest their organs for human use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=82 PETA Media Center: Factsheet: Xenotransplantation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626072643/http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=82 |date=June 26, 2010 }}.

==== Informed consent of patient ====
[[Autonomy]] and [[informed consent]] are important when considering the future uses of xenotransplantation. A patient undergoing xenotransplantation should be fully aware of the procedure and should have no outside force influencing their choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ellison T. |title=Xenotransplantation—ethics and regulation|journal=Xenotransplantation|volume=13|issue=6|pages=505–9|pmid=17059575|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3089.2006.00352_3.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient should understand the risks and benefits of such a transplantation. However, it has been suggested that friends and family members should also give consent, because the repercussions of transplantation are high, with the potential of diseases and viruses crossing over to humans from the transplantation. Close contacts are at risk for such infections. Monitoring of close relations may also be required to ensure that [[xenozoonosis]] is not occurring. The question then becomes: does the autonomy of the patient become limited based on the willingness or unwillingness of friends and family to give consent, and are the [[confidentiality|principles of confidentiality]] broken?

The safety of public health is a factor to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaiser M. |title=Xenotransplantation—ethical considerations based on human and societal perspectives|journal=Acta veterinaria Scandinavica. Supplementum|volume=99|pages=65–73|pmid=15347151|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is any risk to the public at all for an [[outbreak]] from transplantation there must be procedures in place to protect the public. Not only does the recipient of the transplantation have to understand the risks and benefits, but society must also understand and consent to such an agreement.

The Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association points out one major ethical issue is the societal response to such a procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sykes M |author2=D’Apice A |author3=Sandrin M |year= 2003|title= Position Paper of the Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association|journal= Xenotransplantation|volume= 10|issue= 3|pages= 194–203|pmid=12694539|doi=10.1034/j.1399-3089.2003.00067.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that the recipient of the transplantation will be asked to undergo lifelong monitoring, which would deny the recipient the ability to terminate the monitoring at any time, which is in direct opposition of the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] and the [[Code of Federal Regulations|US Code of Federal Regulations]].
In 2007, xenotransplantation was banned under ethical grounds in all countries but Argentina, Russia and New Zealand. Since then, the practice has only been carried out to treatment for diabetes type 1 to serve as a substitute for penicillin injections. 

==== Xenotransplantion guidelines in the United States ====

The Food and Drug Administration ([[FDA]]) has also stated that if a transplantation takes place the recipient must undergo monitoring for the rest of that recipient's lifetime and waive their right to withdraw. The reason for requiring lifelong monitoring is due to the risk of acute infections that may occur. The FDA suggests that a passive screening program should be implemented and should extend for the life of the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;United States Food and Drug Administration.

{{About|Taoist religion||Xian (disambiguation)}}
{{Taoism}}
'''Xian''' ({{Zh|c=仙/仚/僊|p=''xiān''|w=''hsien''}}) is a Chinese word for an enlightened person, translatable in English as:
*"spiritually immortal; transcendent; super-human; celestial being" (in [[Daoist]] philosophy and cosmology)
*"physically immortal; immortal person; immortalist; saint" (in Daoist religion and pantheon)
*"alchemist; one who seeks the [[elixir of life]]; one who practices longevity techniques" or by extension "(alchemical, dietary, [[qigong]]) methods for attaining [[immortality]]" (in [[Alchemy#Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemy]])
*"wizard; magician; shaman" (in [[Chinese mythology]])
*  "genie; elf, fairy; nymph" (in popular [[Chinese literature]], 仙境 xian jing is "fairyland", [[faery]])
*"sage living high in the mountains; mountain-man; hermit; recluse" ([[folk etymology]] for the character 仙)
*"immortal (talent); accomplished person; celestial (beauty); marvelous; extraordinary" (metaphorical modifier)
''Xian'' semantically developed from meaning spiritual "immortality; enlightenment", to physical "immortality; longevity" involving methods such as alchemy, breath meditation, and [[tai chi]], and eventually to legendary and figurative "immortality".

The ''xian'' archetype is described by [[Victor H. Mair]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;They are immune to heat and cold, untouched by the elements, and can fly, mounting upward with a fluttering motion. They dwell apart from the chaotic world of man, subsist on air and dew, are not anxious like ordinary people, and have the smooth skin and innocent faces of children. The transcendents live an effortless existence that is best described as spontaneous. They recall the ancient Indian ascetics and holy men known as ''ṛṣi'' who possessed similar traits.1994:376 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the [[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]], Chinese ''xian'' (仙) can mean Sanskrit ''ṛṣi'' (''[[rishi]]'' "inspired sage in the [[Vedas]]").

==The word ''xian''==
[[Image:Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=1.2|"The [[Eight Immortals]] Crossing the Sea"&lt;ref name =werner&gt;{{cite book | first=E. T. C. | last=Werner|authorlink=E. T. C. Werner| year=1922 | title=Myths &amp; Legends of China | publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd. | location=New York | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15250 | accessdate=2007-03-14 }} ([[Project Gutenberg]] eText 15250)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most famous Chinese [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''xiān'' is ''Bāxiān'' (八仙 "the [[Eight Immortals]]"). Other common words include ''xiānrén'' (仙人 [[sennin]] in Japanese, "immortal person; transcendent", see ''[[Xianren Cave|Xiānrén Dòng]]''), ''xiānrénzhăng'' (仙人掌 "immortal's palm; [[cactus]]"), ''xiānnǚ'' (仙女 "immortal woman; female celestial; angel"), and ''shénxiān'' (神仙 "gods and immortals; divine immortal"). Besides humans, ''xiān'' can also refer to supernatural animals. The mythological [[Huli jing|''húlijīng'']] 狐狸精 (lit. "fox spirit") "fox fairy; vixen; witch; enchantress" has an alternate name of ''húxiān'' 狐仙 (lit. "fox immortal").

The [[etymology]] of ''xiān'' remains uncertain. The circa 200 CE ''[[Shiming]]'', a [[Chinese dictionary]] that provided word-pun "etymologies",  defines ''xiān'' (仙) as "to get old and not die," and explains it as someone who ''qiān'' (遷 "moves into") the mountains."

[[Edward H. Schafer]] (1966:204) defined ''xian'' as "transcendent, sylph (a being who, through alchemical, gymnastic and other disciplines, has achieved a refined and perhaps immortal body, able to fly like a bird beyond the trammels of the base material world into the realms of aether, and nourish himself on air and dew.)" Schafer noted ''xian'' was cognate to ''xian'' 䙴 "soar up", ''qian'' 遷 "remove", and ''xianxian'' 僊僊 "a flapping dance movement"; and compared Chinese ''yuren'' 羽人 "feathered man; ''xian''" with English [[peri]] "a fairy or supernatural being in [[Persian mythology]]" ([[Persian language|Persian]] [[wikt:ری#Persian|pari]] from ''par'' "feather; wing").

Two linguistic hypotheses for the etymology of ''xian'' involve [[Arabic]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]. Wu and Davis (1935:224) suggested the source was ''[[jinn]]'', or ''jinni'' "genie" (from Arabic ''جني'' ''jinnī''). "The marvelous powers of the ''Hsien'' are so like those of the ''jinni'' of the Arabian Nights that one wonders whether the Arabic word, ''jinn'', may not be derived from the Chinese ''Hsien''." Axel Schuessler's etymological dictionary (2007:527) suggests a Sino-Tibetan connection between ''xiān'' (Old Chinese *''san'' or *''sen'') "'An immortal' ... men and women who attain supernatural abilities; after death they become immortals and deities who can fly through the air" and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''gšen'' &lt; ''g-syen'' "shaman, one who has supernatural abilities, incl[uding] travel through the air".

==The character and its variants==
[[File:仙-bw.png|thumb|[[Stroke order]] for ''xian'' 仙]]
The word ''xiān'' is written with three characters [[Wikt:僊|僊]], [[Wikt:仙|仙]], or [[Wikt:仚|仚]], which combine the logographic "[[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]" ''rén'' (人 or 亻 "person; human") with two "phonetic" elements (see [[Chinese character classification]]). The oldest recorded ''xiān'' character 僊 has a ''xiān'' ("rise up; ascend") phonetic supposedly because immortals could "ascend into the heavens". (Compare ''qiān'' 遷 "move; transfer; change" combining this phonetic and the motion radical.) The usual modern ''xiān'' character 仙, and its rare variant 仚, have a ''shān'' (山 "mountain") phonetic. For a character analysis, Schipper (1993:164) interprets "'the human being of the mountain,' or alternatively, 'human mountain.' The two explanations are appropriate to these beings: they haunt the holy mountains, while also embodying nature."

The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' (220/3) contains the oldest occurrence of the character 僊, reduplicated as ''xiānxiān'' (僊僊 "dance lightly; hop about; jump around"), and rhymed with ''qiān'' (遷). "But when they have drunk too much, Their deportment becomes light and frivolous—They leave their seats, and [遷] go elsewhere, They keep [僊僊] dancing and capering." (tr. [[James Legge]])[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005113/http://www.afpc.asso.fr/wengu/wg/wengu.php?lang=fr&amp;no=220&amp;l=Shijing] [[Joseph Needham|Needham]] and [[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang]] (1956:134) suggest ''xian'' was cognate with ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'' 巫 "shamanic" dancing. Paper (1995:55) writes, "the function of the term ''xian'' in a line describing dancing may be to denote the height of the leaps. Since, "to live for a long time" has no etymological relation to ''xian'', it may be a later accretion."

The 121 CE ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', the first important dictionary of Chinese characters, does not enter 仙 except in the definition for {{lang|zh|{{linktext|偓佺}}}} ({{linktext|Wòquán}} "name of an ancient immortal"). It defines 僊 as "live long and move away" and 仚 as "appearance of a person on a mountaintop".

==Textual references==
This section chronologically reviews how Chinese texts describe ''xian'' "immortals; transcendents". While the early ''Zhuangzi'', ''Chuci'', and ''Liezi'' texts allegorically used ''xian'' immortals and magic islands to describe spiritual immortality, later ones like the ''Shenxian zhuan'' and ''Baopuzi'' took immortality literally and described esoteric Chinese alchemical techniques for physical longevity. On one the hand, ''[[neidan]]'' (內丹 "internal alchemy") techniques included ''taixi'' (胎息 "embryo respiration") breath control, meditation, visualization, sexual training, and [[Tao Yin]] exercises (which later evolved into [[Qigong]] and [[T'ai chi ch'uan]]). On the other hand, ''[[waidan]]'' (外丹 "external alchemy") techniques for immortality included alchemical recipes, magic plants, rare minerals, herbal medicines, drugs, and dietetic techniques like [[inedia]].

The earliest representations of Chinese immortals, dating from the [[Han Dynasty]], portray them flying with feathery wings (the word ''yuren'' 羽人 "feathered person" later meant "Daoist") or riding dragons. In [[Chinese art]], ''xian'' are often pictured with symbols of immortality including the dragon, crane, fox, white deer, pine tree, peach, and mushroom. [[File:Dragon gods - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|''Xian'' riding dragons&lt;ref name=werner/&gt;]]
[[File:蝦蟇・鉄拐仙人図 曾我蕭白.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Paintings of ''xian'' by Soga Shōhaku 曾我蕭白, ca. 1760.]]

Besides the following major Chinese texts, many others use both graphic variants of ''xian''. ''Xian'' (仙) occurs in the ''[[Chunqiu Fanlu]]'', ''[[Fengsu Tongyi]]'', ''[[Qian fu lun]]'', ''Fayan'', and ''Shenjian''; ''xian'' (僊) occurs in the ''Caizhong langji'', ''Fengsu Tongyi'', ''Guanzi'', and ''Shenjian''.

===''Zhuangzi''===
Two circa 3rd century BCE "Outer Chapters" of the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (莊子 "[Book of] Master Zhuang") use the archaic character ''xian'' 僊. Chapter 11 has a parable about "Cloud Chief" (雲 將)  and "Big Concealment" (鴻濛) that uses the ''Shijing'' compound ''xianxian'' ("dance; jump"):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Big Concealment said, "If you confuse the constant strands of Heaven and violate the true form of things, then Dark Heaven will reach no fulfillment. Instead, the beasts will scatter from their herds, the birds will cry all night, disaster will come to the grass and trees, misfortune will reach even to the insects. Ah, this is the fault of men who 'govern'!"&lt;br&gt;"Then what should I do?" said Cloud Chief.&lt;br&gt;"Ah," said Big Concealment, "you are too far gone! [僊僊] Up, up, stir yourself and be off!"&lt;br&gt;Cloud Chief said, "Heavenly Master, it has been hard indeed for me to meet with you—I beg one word of instruction!"&lt;br&gt;"Well, then—mind‑nourishment!" said Big Concealment. "You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless, and the ten thousand things one by one will return to the root—return to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos—to the end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try to observe its form. Things will live naturally end of themselves."&lt;br&gt;Cloud Chief said, "The Heavenly Master has favored me with this Virtue, instructed me in this Silence. All my life I have been looking for it, and now at last I have it!" He bowed his head twice, stood up, took his leave, and went away. (11, tr. [[Burton Watson]] 1968:122-3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 12 uses ''xian'' when mythical [[Emperor Yao]] describes a ''shengren'' (聖 人 "sagely person").
&lt;blockquote&gt;The true sage is a quail at rest, a little fledgling at its meal, a bird in flight who leaves no trail behind. When the world has the Way, he joins in the chorus with all other things. When the world is without the Way, he nurses his Virtue and retires in leisure. And after a thousand years, should he weary of the world, he will leave it and [上] ascend to [僊] the immortals, riding on those white clouds all the way up to the village of God. (12, tr. Watson 1968:130)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Without using the word ''xian'', several ''Zhuangzi'' passages employ ''xian'' imagery, like flying in the clouds, to describe individuals with superhuman powers. For example, Chapter 1, within the circa 3rd century BCE "Inner Chapters", has two portrayals. First is this description of Liezi (below).
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lieh Tzu could ride the wind and go soaring around with cool and breezy skill, but after fifteen days he came back to earth. As far as the search for good fortune went, he didn't fret and worry. He escaped the trouble of walking, but he still had to depend on something to get around. If he had only mounted on the truth of Heaven and Earth, ridden the changes of the six breaths, and thus wandered through the boundless, then what would he have had to depend on? Therefore, I say, the Perfect Man has no self; the Holy Man has no merit; the Sage has no fame. (1, tr. Watson 1968:32) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Second is this description of a ''shenren'' (神人 "divine person").
&lt;blockquote&gt;He said that there is a Holy Man living on faraway [姑射] Ku-she Mountain, with skin like ice or snow, and gentle and shy like a young girl. He doesn't eat the five grains, but sucks the wind, drinks the dew, climbs up on the clouds and mist, rides a flying dragon, and wanders beyond the [[Four Seas]]. By concentrating his spirit, he can protect creatures from sickness and plague and make the harvest plentiful. (1, tr. Watson 1968:33) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors of the ''Zhuangzi'' had a lyrical view of life and death, seeing them as complimentary aspects of natural changes. This is antithetical to the physical immortality (''changshengbulao'' 長生不老 "live forever and never age") sought by later Daoist alchemists. Consider this famous passage about accepting death.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chuang Tzu's wife died. When Hui Tzu went to convey his condolences, he found Chuang Tzu sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing. "You lived with her, she brought up your children and grew old," said Hui Tzu. "It should be enough simply not to weep at her death. But pounding on a tub and singing—this is going too far, isn't it?"

Chuang Tzu said, "You're wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn't grieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there's been another change and she's dead. It's just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter."&lt;br&gt;"Now she's going to lie down peacefully in a vast room. If I were to follow after her bawling and sobbing, it would show that I don't understand anything about fate. So I stopped. (18, tr. Watson 1968:191–2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alan Fox explains this anecdote about Zhuangzi's wife.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many conclusions can be reached on the basis of this story, but it seems that death is regarded as a natural part of the ebb and flow of transformations which constitute the movement of Dao. To grieve over death, or to fear one's own death, for that matter, is to arbitrarily evaluate what is inevitable. Of course, this reading is somewhat ironic given the fact that much of the subsequent Daoist tradition comes to seek longevity and immortality, and bases some of their basic models on the ''Zhuangzi''. (1995:100) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Chuci''===
[[File:WuXianGuan-Immortals-footprint-0519.jpg|thumb|The supposed "footprint of a ''xian''", a little pond in Guangzhou's Temple of the Five Immortals]]
The 3rd-2nd century BCE ''[[Chuci]]'' (楚辭 "Lyrics of Chu") anthology of poems uses ''xian'' 仙 once and ''xian'' 僊 twice, reflecting the disparate origins of the text. These three contexts mention the legendary Daoist ''xian'' immortals [[Chisongzi|Chi Song]] (赤松 "[[Red Pine (disambiguation)|Red Pine]]", see Kohn 1993:142–4) and Wang Qiao (王僑, or Zi Qiao 子僑). In later Daoist hagiography, Chi Song was Lord of Rain under [[Shennong]], the legendary inventor of agriculture; and Wang Qiao was a son of [[King Ling of Zhou]] (r. 571–545 BCE), who flew away on a giant white bird, became an immortal and was never again seen.

The "''[[Yuan You]]''" (遠遊 "Far-off Journey") poem describes a spiritual journey into the realms of gods and immortals, frequently referring to Daoist myths and techniques.
&lt;blockquote&gt;My spirit darted forth and did not return to me,&lt;br&gt;And my body, left tenantless, grew withered and lifeless.&lt;br&gt;Then I looked into myself to strengthen my resolution,&lt;br&gt;And sought to learn from where the primal spirit issues.&lt;br&gt;In emptiness and silence I found serenity;&lt;br&gt;In tranquil inaction I gained true satisfaction.&lt;br&gt;I heard how once Red Pine had washed the world's dust off:&lt;br&gt;I would model myself on the pattern he had left me.&lt;br&gt;I honoured the wondrous powers of the [真人] Pure Ones,&lt;br&gt;And those of past ages who had become [仙] Immortals.&lt;br&gt;They departed in the flux of change and vanished from men's sight,&lt;br&gt;Leaving a famous name that endures after them. (tr. Hawkes 1985:194) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "''[[Sorrow for Troth Betrayed|Xi shi]]''" (惜誓 "Sorrow for Troth Betrayed") resembles the "''Yuan You''", and both reflect Daoist ideas from the Han period. "Though unoriginal in theme," says Hawkes (1985:239), "its description of air travel, written in a pre-aeroplane age, is exhilarating and rather impressive."
&lt;blockquote&gt;We gazed down of the Middle Land [China] with its myriad people&lt;br&gt;As we rested on the whirlwind, drifting about at random.&lt;br&gt;In this way we came at last to the moor of Shao-yuan:&lt;br&gt;There, with the other blessed ones, were Red Pine and Wang Qiao.&lt;br&gt;The two Masters held zithers tuned in perfect concord:&lt;br&gt;I sang the Qing Shang air to their playing.&lt;br&gt;In tranquil calm and quiet enjoyment,&lt;br&gt;Gently I floated, inhaling all the essences.&lt;br&gt;But then I thought that this immortal life of [僊] the blessed,&lt;br&gt;Was not worth the sacrifice of my home-returning. (tr. Hawkes 1985:240) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "''[[Ai shi ming]]''" (哀時命 "Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast") describes a celestial journey similar to the previous two.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Far and forlorn, with no hope of return:&lt;br&gt;Sadly I gaze in the distance, over the empty plain.&lt;br&gt;Below, I fish in the valley streamlet;&lt;br&gt;Above, I seek out [僊] holy hermits.&lt;br&gt;I enter into friendship with Red Pine;&lt;br&gt;I join Wang Qiao as his companion.
We send the Xiao Yang in front to guide us;&lt;br&gt;The White Tiger runs back and forth in attendance.&lt;br&gt;Floating on the cloud and mist, we enter the dim height of heaven;&lt;br&gt;Riding on the white deer we sport and take our pleasure. tr. Hawkes 1985:266) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "''[[Li Sao]]''" (離騷 "On Encountering Trouble"), the most famous ''Chuci'' poem, is usually interpreted as describing ecstatic flights and trance techniques of Chinese shamans. The above three poems are variations describing Daoist ''xian''.

Some other ''Chuci'' poems refer to immortals with synonyms of ''xian''. For instance, "''Shou zhi''" (守志 "Maintaining Resolution), uses ''[[zhenren]]'' (真人 "true person", tr. "Pure Ones" above in "''Yuan You''"), which Wang Yi's commentary glosses as ''zhen xianren'' (真仙人 "true immortal person").
&lt;blockquote&gt;I visited Fu Yue, bestriding a dragon,&lt;br&gt;Joined in marriage with the Weaving Maiden,&lt;br&gt;Lifted up Heaven's Net to capture evil,&lt;br&gt;Drew the Bow of Heaven to shoot at wickedness,&lt;br&gt;Followed the [真人] Immortals fluttering through the sky,&lt;br&gt;Ate of the Primal Essence to prolong my life. (tr. Hawkes 1985:318) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Liezi''===
The ''[[Liezi]]'' (列子 "[Book of] Master Lie"), which Louis Komjathy (2004:36) says "was probably compiled in the 3rd century CE (while containing earlier textual layers)", uses ''xian'' four times, always in the compound ''xiansheng'' (仙聖 "immortal sage").

Nearly half of Chapter 2 ("The [[Yellow Emperor]]") comes from the ''Zhuangzi'', including this recounting of the above fable about Mount Gushe (姑射, or Guye, or Miao Gushe 藐姑射).
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ku-ye mountains stand on a chain of islands where the Yellow River enters the sea. Upon the mountains there lives a Divine Man, who inhales the wind and drinks the dew, and does not eat the five grains. His mind is like a bottomless spring, his body is like a virgin's. He knows neither intimacy nor love, yet [仙聖] immortals and sages serve him as ministers. He inspires no awe, he is never angry, yet the eager and diligent act as his messengers. He is without kindness and bounty, but others have enough by themselves; he does not store and save, but he himself never lacks. The Yin and Yang are always in tune, the sun and moon always shine, the four seasons are always regular, wind and rain are always temperate, breeding is always timely, the harvest is always rich, and there are no plagues to ravage the land, no early deaths to afflict men, animals have no diseases, and ghosts have no uncanny echoes. (tr. Graham 1960:35) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 5 uses ''xiansheng'' three times in a conversation set between legendary rulers [[Tang of Shang|Tang]] (湯) of the [[Shang Dynasty]] and Ji (革) of the [[Xia Dynasty]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;T'ang asked again: 'Are there large things and small, long and short, similar and different?'&lt;br&gt;—'To the East of the Gulf of Chih-li, who knows how many thousands and millions of miles, there is a deep ravine, a valley truly without bottom; and its bottomless underneath is named "The Entry to the Void". The waters of the eight corners and the nine regions, the stream of the Milky Way, all pour into it, but it neither shrinks nor grows. Within it there are five mountains, called Tai-yü, Yüan-chiao, Fang-hu, Ying-chou and P'eng-Iai. These mountains are thirty thousand miles high, and as many miles round; the tablelands on their summits extend for nine thousand miles. It is seventy thousand miles from one mountain to the next, but they are considered close neighbours. The towers and terraces upon them are all gold and jade, the beasts and birds are all unsullied white; trees of pearl and garnet always grow densely, flowering and bearing fruit which is always luscious, and those who eat of it never grow old and die. The men who dwell there are all of the race of [仙聖] immortal sages, who fly, too many to be counted, to and from one mountain to another in a day and a night. Yet the bases of the five mountains used to rest on nothing; they were always rising and falling, going and returning, with the ebb and flow of the tide, and never for a moment stood firm. The [仙聖] immortals found this troublesome, and complained about it to God. God was afraid that they would drift to the far West and he would lose the home of his sages. So he commanded Yü-ch'iang to make fifteen [鼇] giant turtles  carry the five mountains on their lifted heads, taking turns in three watches, each sixty thousand years long; and for the first time the mountains stood firm and did not move.&lt;br&gt;'But there was a giant from the kingdom of the Dragon Earl, who came to the place of the five mountains in no more than a few strides. In one throw he hooked six of the turtles in a bunch, hurried back to his country carrying them together on his back, and scorched their bones to tell fortunes by the cracks. Thereupon two of the mountains, Tai-yü and Yüan-chiao, drifted to the far North and sank in the great sea; the [仙聖] immortals who were carried away numbered many millions. God was very angry, and reduced by degrees the size of the Dragon Earl's kingdom and the height of his subjects. At the time of Fu-hsi and Shen-nung, the people of this country were still several hundred feet high.' (tr. Graham 1960:97–8) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Penglai Mountain]] became the most famous of these five mythical peaks where the [[elixir of life]] supposedly grew, and is known as [[Horai]] in Japanese legends. The first emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] sent his court alchemist [[Xu Fu]] on expeditions to find these plants of immortality, but he never returned (although by some accounts, he discovered Japan).

Holmes Welch (1957:88–97) analyzed the beginnings of Daoism, sometime around the 4th-3rd centuries BCE, from four separate streams: philosophical Daoism (Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi), a "hygiene school" that cultivated longevity through breathing exercises and yoga, Chinese alchemy and [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]] philosophy, and those who sought Penglai and elixirs of "immortality". This is what he concludes about ''xian''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is my own opinion, therefore, that though the word ''hsien'', or Immortal, is used by Chuang Tzu and Lieh Tzu, and though they attributed to their idealized individual the magic powers that were attributed to the ''hsien'' in later times, nonetheless the ''hsien'' ideal was something they did not believe in—either that it was possible or that it was good. The magic powers are allegories and hyperboles for the ''natural'' powers that come from identification with Tao. Spiritualized Man, P'eng-lai, and the rest are features of a ''genre'' which is meant to entertain, disturb, and exalt us, not to be taken as literal hagiography. Then and later, the philosophical Taoists were distinguished from all other schools of Taoism by their rejection of the pursuit of immortality. As we shall see, their books came to be adopted as scriptural authority by those who did practice magic and seek to become immortal. But it was their misunderstanding of philosophical Taoism that was the reason they adopted it. (Welch 1957:95) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Shenxian zhuan''===
[[File:Nanyang-Xijiao-Qilingang-Xianren-cheng-gui-tu.jpg|thumb|An immortal riding a tortoise. A [[Han Dynasty]] painting]]
The ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'' (神仙傳 Biographies of Spirit Immortals") is a [[hagiography]] of ''xian''. Although it was traditionally attributed to [[Ge Hong]] (283–343 CE), Komjathy (2004:43) says, "The received versions of the text contain some 100-odd hagiographies, most of which date from 6th-8th centuries at the earliest."

According to the ''Shenxian zhuan'', there are four schools of immortality:

'''''[[Ch'i|Qì]]''''' (气—“energy”): Breath control and meditation. Those who belong to this school can

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...blow on water and it will flow against its own current for several paces; blow on fire, and it will be extinguished; blow at tigers or wolves, and they will crouch down and not be able to move; blow at serpents, and they will coil up and be unable to flee. If someone is wounded by a weapon, blow on the wound, and the bleeding will stop. If you hear of someone who has suffered a poisonous insect bite, even if you are not in his presence, you can, from a distance, blow and say in incantation over your own hand (males on the left hand, females on the right), and the person will at once be healed even if more than a hundred li away. And if you yourself are struck by a sudden illness, you have merely to swallow pneumas in three series of nine, and you will immediately recover.&lt;br&gt;But the most essential thing [among such arts] is fetal breathing. Those who obtain [the technique of] fetal breathing become able to breathe without using their nose or mouth, as if in the womb, and this is the culmination of the way [of pneumatic cultivation]." (Campany 2002:21) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Fàn''''' (饭—“Diet”): Ingestion of herbal compounds and abstention from the ''Sān Shī Fàn'' (三尸饭—“Three-Corpses food”)—Meats (raw fish, pork, dog, [[leeks]], and [[scallions]]) and [[grain]]s. The ''Shenxian zhuan'' uses this story to illustrate the importance of ''[[Bigu (avoiding grains)|bigu]]'' "grain avoidance":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"During the reign of [[Emperor Cheng of Han|Emperor Cheng of the Han]], hunters in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a person who wore no clothes, his body covered with black hair. Upon seeing this person, the hunters wanted to pursue and capture him, but the person leapt over gullies and valleys as if in flight, and so could not be overtaken. [But after being surrounded and captured, it was discovered this person was a 200 plus year old woman, who had once been a concubine of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] [[Ziying|Emperor Ziying]]. When he had surrendered to the 'invaders of the east', she fled into the mountains where she learned to subside on 'the resin and nuts of pines' from an old man. Afterwards, this diet 'enabled [her] to feel neither hunger nor thirst; in winter [she] was not cold, in summer [she] was not hot.']&lt;br&gt;The hunters took the woman back in. They offered her grain to eat. When she first smelled the stink of grain, she vomited, and only after several days could she tolerate it. After little more than two years of this [diet], her body hair fell out; she turned old and died. Had she not been caught by men, she would have become a transcendent." (Campany 2002:22–23) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Fángzhōng Zhī Shù''''' (房中之术—“Arts of the Bedchamber”): [[Taoist sexual practices|Sexual yoga]]. (Campany 2002:30–31) According to a discourse between the [[Yellow Emperor]] and the immortaless ''Sùnǚ'' (素女—“Plain Girl”), one of the three daughters of [[Hsi Wang Mu]],
&lt;blockquote&gt; “The sexual behaviors between a man and woman are identical to how the universe itself came into creation. Like Heaven and Earth, the male and female share a parallel relationship in attaining an immortal existence. They both must learn how to engage and develop their natural sexual instincts and behaviors; otherwise the only result is decay and traumatic discord of their physical lives. However, if they engage in the utmost joys of sensuality and apply the principles of yin and yang to their sexual activity, their health, vigor, and joy of love will bear them the fruits of longevity and immortality. (Hsi 2002:99–100) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''White Tigress (Zhuang Li Quan Pure Angelic Metal Ajna Empress "Toppest") Manual'', a treatise on female sexual yoga, states,
&lt;blockquote&gt; “A female can completely restore her youthfulness and attain immortality if she refrains from allowing just one or two men in her life from stealing and destroying her [sexual] essence, which will only serve in aging her at a rapid rate and bring about an early death. However, if she can acquire the sexual essence of a thousand males through absorption, she will acquire the great benefits of youthfulness and immortality.” (Hsi 2001:48) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Dān''''' (丹—"[[Alchemy#Chinese alchemy|Alchemy]]", literally "[[Cinnabar]]"): [[Elixir of life#China|Elixir of Immortality]].(Campany 2002:31)

===''Baopuzi''===
The 4th century CE ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (抱朴子 "[Book of] Master Embracing Simplicity"), which was written by [[Ge Hong]], gives some highly detailed descriptions of ''xian''.

The text lists three classes of immortals:

*'''''Tiānxiān''''' (天仙—“Celestial Immortal”): The highest level.
*'''''Dìxiān''''' (地仙—“Earth Immortal”): The middle level.
*'''''[[Shijie (Daoism)|Shījiě]] xiān''''' (尸解仙—"Escaped-by-means-of-a-stimulated-corpse-simulacrum Immortal", literally "[[Shi (personator)|Corpse]] Untie Immortal"): The lowest level. This is considered the lowest form of immortality since a person must first “fake” their own death by substituting a bewitched object like a bamboo pole, sword, [[Amulet|talisman]] or a shoe for their corpse or slipping a type of [[Death certificate]] into the coffin of a newly departed paternal grandfather, thus having their name and "allotted life span" deleted from the ledgers kept by the ''Sīmìng'' (司命—"Director of allotted life spans", literally "Controller of Fate"). [[Hagiography|Hagiographies]] and folktales abound of people who seemingly die in one province, but are seen alive in another. Mortals who choose this route must cut off all ties with family and friends, move to a distant province, and enact the ''Ling bao tai xuan yin sheng zhi fu'' (靈寳太玄隂生之符—“Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding”) to protect themselves from heavenly retribution (Campany 2002:52–60). However, this is not a true form of immortality. For each misdeed a person commits, the Director of allotted life spans subtracts days and sometimes years from their allotted life span. This method allows a person to live out the entirety of their allotted lifespan (whether it be 30, 80, 400, etc.) and avoid the agents of death. But the body still has to be transformed into an immortal one, hence the phrase ''Xiānsǐ hòutuō'' (先死後脱—“The ‘death’ is apparent, [but] the sloughing off of the body’s mortality remains to be done.”). Sometimes the ''Shījiě'' are employed by heaven to act as celestial peace keepers. Therefore, they have no need for hiding from retribution since they are empowered by heaven to perform their duties. There are three levels of heavenly ''Shījiě'':
**'''''Dìxià zhǔ''''' (地下主—“Agents Beneath the Earth”): Are in charge of keeping the peace within the [[Diyu|Chinese underworld]]. They are eligible for promotion to earthbound immortality after 280 years of faithful service.
**'''''Dìshàng zhǔzhě''''' (地上主者—"Agents Above the Earth"): Are given magic talismans which prolong their lives (but not indefinitely) and allow them to heal the sick and exorcize demons and evil spirits from the earth. This level was ''not'' eligible for promotion to earthbound immortality.
**'''''Zhìdì jūn''''' (制地君—"Lords Who Control the Earth"): A heavenly decree ordered them to "disperse all subordinate junior demons, whether high or low [in rank], that have cause afflictions and injury owing to blows or offenses against the Motion of the Year, the Original Destiny, Great Year, the Kings of the Soil or the establishing or breaking influences of the chronograms of the tome. Annihilate them all." This level was also ''not'' eligible for promotion to immortality.

These titles were usually given to humans who had either not proven themselves worthy of or were not fated to become immortals. One such famous agent was '''Fei Changfang''', who was eventually murdered by evil spirits because he lost his book of magic talismans. However, some immortals are written to have used this method in order to escape execution. (Campany 2002:52–60)

[[Ge Hong]] wrote in his book ''The Master Who Embraces Simplicity'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [immortals] Dark Girl and Plain Girl compared sexual activity as the intermingling of fire [yang/male] and water [yin/female], claiming that water and fire can kill people but can also regenerate their life, depending on whether or not they know the correct methods of sexual activity according to their nature. These arts are based on the theory that the more females a man copulates with, the greater benefit he will derive from the act. Men who are ignorant of this art, copulating with only one or two females during their life, will only suffice to bring about their untimely and early death. (Hsi 2001:48) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji''===
[[Image:Changchun-Temple-Small-statue-0301.jpg|thumb|[[He-He er xian|Hé (和) and Hé (合)]],  the two "Immortals of Harmony and Unity", associated with happy marriage, depicted in Changchun Temple, a Taoist temple in [[Wuhan]]]]
The ''Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji'' (鐘呂傳道集/钟吕传道集 "Anthology of the Transmission of the Dao from Zhong[li Quan] to Lü [Dongbin]") is associated with [[Zhongli Quan]] (2nd century CE?) and [[Lü Dongbin]] (9th century CE), two of the legendary Eight Immortals. It is part of the so-called “Zhong-Lü” (鍾呂) textual tradition of internal alchemy (''neidan''). Komjathy (2004:57) describes it as, "Probably dating from the late Tang (618–906), the text is in question-and-answer format, containing a dialogue between Lü and his teacher Zhongli on aspects of alchemical terminology and methods."

The ''Zhong Lü Chuan Dao Ji'' lists five classes of immortals:

*'''''Guǐxiān''''' (鬼仙—"Ghost Immortal"): A person who cultivates too much [[Yin and Yang|yin]] energy. These immortals are likened to [[Vampires]] because they drain the life essence of the living, much like the [[Huli jing|fox spirit]]. Ghost immortals do not leave the realm of ghosts.
*'''''Rénxiān''''' (人仙—Human Immortal”): Humans have an equal balance of yin and yang energies, so they have the potential of becoming either a ghost or immortal. Although they continue to hunger and thirst and require clothing and shelter like a normal human, these immortals do not suffer from aging or sickness. Human immortals do not leave the realm of humans. There are many sub-classes of human immortals, as discussed above under '''''[[Xian (Taoism)#Baopuzi|Shījiě xiān]]'''''.
*'''''Dìxiān''''' (地仙—“Earth Immortal”): When the yin is transformed into the pure yang, a true immortal body will emerge that does not need food, drink, clothing or shelter and is not affected by hot or cold temperatures. Earth immortals do not leave the realm of earth. These immortals are forced to stay on earth until they shed their human form.
*'''''Shénxiān''''' (神仙—"Spirit Immortal"): The immortal body of the earthbound class will eventually change into vapor through further practice. They have supernatural powers and can take on the shape of any object. These immortals must remain on earth acquiring merit by teaching mankind about the [[Tao]]. Spirit immortals do not leave the realm of spirits. Once enough merit is accumulated, they are called to heaven by a celestial decree.
*'''''Tiānxiān''''' (天仙—“Celestial Immortal”): Spirit immortals who are summoned to heaven are given the minor office of water realm judge. Over time, they are promoted to oversee the earth realm and finally become administrators of the celestial realm. These immortals have the power to travel back and forth between the earthly and celestial realms.

===''Śūraṅgama Sūtra''===
The ''[[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'', in an approach to Taoist teachings, discusses the characteristics of ten types of ''xian'' who exist between the world of [[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]] ("gods") and that of human beings. This position, in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] literature, is usually occupied by [[Asura (Buddhism)|asura]]s ("[[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s", "antigods"). These ''xian'' are not considered true cultivators of ''[[samadhi]]'' ("unification of mind"), as their methods differ from the practice of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]'' ("meditation").&lt;ref&gt;Benn, James A. 2008, "[https://www.academia.edu/12082377/Another_Look_at_the_Pseudo-%C5%9A%C5%ABra%E1%B9%83gama_S%C5%ABtra Another Look at the Pseudo-Śūraṃgama sūtra]" pgs. 73-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.sfsu.edu/rone/Buddhism/Shurangama/Shurangama.htm Shurangama Sutra: Text, Commentaries, and Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Dìxiān''''' ({{zh|地(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Dìxíng xiān}}'', "earth-travelling immortals")&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who constantly ingest special food called ''fuer'' (服餌).
*'''''Fēixiān''''' ({{zh|飛(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Fēixíng xiān}}'', “flying immortals”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who constantly ingest certain herbs and plants.
*'''''Yóuxiān''''' ({{zh|遊(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Yóuxíng xiān}}'', “roaming immortals”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who “transform” by constantly ingesting metals and minerals.
*'''''Kōngxiān''''' ({{zh|空(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Kōngxíng xiān}}'', “void-travelling immortals”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who perfect their ''[[qi]]'' and essence through unceasing movement and stillness (''dongzhi'' 動止).
*'''''Tiānxiān''''' ({{zh|天(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Tiānxíng xiān}}'', “heaven-travelling immortals”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who constantly practice control of their fluids and saliva.
*'''''Tōngxiān''''' ({{zh|通(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Tōngxíng xiān}}'', “all-penetrating immortals”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who constantly practice the inhalation of unadulterated essences.
*'''''Dàoxiān''''' ({{zh|道(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Dàoxínɡ xiān}}'', “immortals of the Way”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who achieve transcendence through unceasing recitation of spells and prohibitions.
*'''''Zhàoxiān''''' ({{zh|照(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Zhàoxíng xiān}}'', “illuminated immortals”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who achieve transcendence through constant periods of thought and recollection.
*'''''Jīngxiān''''' ({{zh|精(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Jīngxíng xiān}}'', “seminal immortals”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who have mastered the stimuli and responses of intercourse.
*'''''Juéxiān''''' ({{zh|絕(行)仙}} ''{{transl|zh|Juéxíng xiān}}'', “absolute immortals”)&amp;nbsp;– ''Xian'' who "have attained the end" and perfected their awakening through constant transformation.
