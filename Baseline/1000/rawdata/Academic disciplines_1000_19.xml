'''Arts administration''' (alternatively '''arts management''') is the field that concerns [[business operations]] around an [[arts]] organization.  Arts administrators are responsible for facilitating the day-to-day operations of the [[organization]] and fulfilling its mission. Arts organizations include professional non-profit entities (e.g. theaters, museums, symphonies, jazz organizations, opera houses, and ballet companies) and many smaller professional and non-professional for-profit arts-related organizations (e.g. auction houses, art galleries, music companies, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of an arts administrator can include [[staff management]], marketing, budget management, public relations, fundraising, program development and evaluation, and board relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/artsadministrator.aspx|title = Job profiles: Arts administrator|date = |accessdate = April 5, 2015|website = National Careers Service|publisher = Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, UK|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/careers/management-arts-administrators|title = Career: Arts Administrators|date = |accessdate = April 5, 2015|website = Big Future|publisher = College Board|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts administrators==
Art administrators (alternatively '''arts managers''') work for arts and cultural organizations such as theatres, symphonies, "...art [[Art museum|galleries]], [[museums]], arts festivals, arts centers, arts councils, regional arts boards, [[dance]] companies, community arts organizations, disability arts organizations, and local authorities."&lt;ref name="prospects.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?state=showocc&amp;idno=61&amp;pageno=1 Arts administrator: Job description and activities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An arts administrator in a small organization may do [[marketing]], event booking, and handle financial issues. An arts administrator for a larger arts organization may be responsible for buildings and facilities, creative staff (e.g., performers/artists), other administrative staff, [[public relations]], marketing, and writing reports.

A senior-level arts administrator may advise the [[board of directors]] or other senior managers on "strategic planning and management decisions. An effective arts administrator must also be knowledgeable in local, state and federal [[public policy]] as it relates to [[human resources]], [[health insurance]], [[labor laws]] and volunteer risk management."&lt;ref name="prospects.ac.uk"/&gt;

There are several notable professionals in the field. [[Philippe de Montebello]] was curator of New York City's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1977-2008. On his retirement, he was both the longest-serving director in the institution's history and the longest-serving director of any major art museum in the world. [[Michael Maddox]] co-founded the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow, home to [[Bolshoi Ballet]] and [[Bolshoi Opera]], which are amongst the oldest and grandest ballet and opera companies in the world.  Another notable figure in arts administration is John Lane of John Lane's Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine.  Lane acquired the playhouse in 1950 and successfully ran the organization, still considered to be "America's foremost summer theatre," until his retirement in 1994.

==Issues in arts administration==
Like any business, arts organizations must work within changing external and internal environments.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological.  Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.

Although a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Arts organizations, as part of the economic system, experience the effects of expansion and contractions in the local, regional, national, and world economies.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Many arts organizations struggle in difficult economic times.

==Academic programs==
Arts administration programs are available at a number of universities and colleges in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia.&lt;!-- No others? --&gt;   In the United States, these programs began in the 1970s at several schools after meetings with the National Endowment for the Arts on how the next generations of arts leaders would be educated.  Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as [[business administration]], they also include specialized courses on administering [[non-profit]] arts and cultural organizations.

Arts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as [[public administration]], business administration, arts law, and [[management]]. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at [[Columbia University]] is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an [[Ivy league]] university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts Administration@Teachers College, Columbia University|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/artsadmin/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience.

At some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arts Management Degree Programs &amp; Information {{!}} American University, Washington, DC|url = http://www.american.edu/cas/arts-management/|website = www.american.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Performing Arts Management {{!}} School of Music {{!}} DePaul University|url = https://music.depaul.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/performing-arts-management-bm/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.depaul.edu|accessdate = 2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Graduate Degree in Arts Leadership {{!}} Conservatory {{!}} DePaul Theatre {{!}} DePaul University|url = http://theatre.depaul.edu/conservatory/graduate/arts-leadership/Pages/default.aspx|website = theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while it's undergraduate music program is music oriented).  The master's degree at some schools is an [[MBA]], while other universities offer [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed.  For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor.

Though curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ.  Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.  Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy.  Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent "in the field", applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences.  [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual &amp; Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations. At this institution, the faculty are required to be both academically and experientially qualified, with many being current senior arts managers at some of the Washington, DC's area most prominent visual &amp; performing arts centers.

Most programs require two years in residence, though [http://www.drexel.com/online-degrees/business-degrees/arts-administration/index.aspx Drexel University], [http://universitycollege.du.edu/mals/degree/masters/arts-development-and-program-management-online/degreeid/423 University of Denver], and [[Goucher College]] offer online options with limited residency. The [http://finearts.uky.edu/arts-administration/ma-program University of Kentucky] and [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] offer fully online degrees in arts administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online M.A. Program {{!}} College of Fine Arts|url = http://finearts.uky.edu/arts-administration/ma-program|website = finearts.uky.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arts administration|url = https://www.scad.edu/academics/programs/arts-administration|accessdate = 2015-04-06|website = SCAD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to accommodate full-time employment, provide strong networking opportunities, and many teamwork opportunities, programs such as [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University] have adopted a cohort model and offer classes on evenings and weekends.

Some programs offer dual degrees.  For example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] offers an MA/MBA program in conjunction with the Cincinnati [[College-Conservatory of Music]].  The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, like most others, exists to prepare and train students to become successful [[CEO]]s and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsadminmba.com www.ArtsAdminMBA.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the [http://www.ied.edu Istituto Europeo di Design], in Venice, offers a [http://www.ied.edu/venice/management-school/master-courses/business-administration-for-arts-and-cultural-events/CMG2095E Master in Business Administration in Arts and Cultural Events] that provides advanced knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary to understand and operate in the multifarious world of the arts. A similar course is held in [[Bologna]], at the [[University of Bologna]], called Innovation and Organization of Culture and the Arts [http://corsi.unibo.it/gioca/Pages/default.aspx], offering a double degree opportunity together with Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management. In Turin, the [[St. John International University]] [http://www.sjiu.it/] offers a Master of Arts in International Arts Administration. A new innovative program based on the concept of artwork as 'information', that integrate recording, cataloging, communication, management, fruition. The program is led by faculty and high level practitioners from Heritage, srl.

Other programs may offer a single degree that includes coursework at two colleges. [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s Master of Arts Management (MAM) Program is one example, tying the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]] to [[Heinz College]]'s School of Public Policy and Management. Heinz College provides the core management coursework and the College of Fine Arts supports the MAM Program with coursework specific to arts institutions.  Another example is the two-year MA/MBA program at [[Southern Methodist University]], offering a Master of Arts in Arts Administration from the Meadows School of the Arts and a Master of Business Administration from the Cox School of Business.

Some programs are housed within their university's Music, Theater and Dance department like the one at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. This is the [http://leap.colostate.edu/masters/ LEAP Institute for the Arts Master of Arts Leadership and Administration] residential and online programs.

Several universities offer concentrations in media (film, television, music, new media, etc.) management: Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia College Chicago are examples.  Carnegie Mellon offers a separate degree in film/television management. New York University's MA in Arts Administration program allows students to choose a visual arts or a performing arts focus.

Increasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues.  As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.

Arts administrators have the ability to create and administer necessary professional development to fine arts teachers. Professional development for the arts is often subpar due to a lack in finances from the government's allotted funding, which can be remedied by the lobbying of arts administrators.  &lt;ref&gt;Gates, Leslie. “Professional Development: Through Collaborative Inquiry for an Art Education Archipelago.” Vol. 52, no. 1, 2010, pp. 6–17., {{jstor|25746078}} Accessed 16 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Bachelor of Environmental Science''' is an [[undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for courses taken in the study of [[environmental science]] or related disciplines, such as sustainable resource development, [[environmental health]], or [[ecological sustainability]], and may also be known as a Bachelor of Environmental Science and Management degree in some schools. This is a interdisciplinary degree course, some universities offers four year honors degree programme  

The Bachelor of Environmental Science degree is frequently abbreviated as '''B.Env.Sc.''', (sometimes B.E.Sc, B.S.E.S, or even B.E.S - the latter of which can cause confusion with a Bachelor of Environmental ''Studies'' degree) especially in the use of post-nominals where an Environmental Studies degree may be either B.S. or B.A.

In Australia, those who graduate with a B.Env.Sc. are eligible for membership in the [[Environment Institutes|Environment Institute of Australian and New Zealand]].

==List of institutions awarding Bachelor of Environmental Science degrees==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7469">'''Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia'''  is a [[learned society]] founded in 1947 at the [[University of Virginia]], [[Charlottesville]] to promote interest in books and manuscripts, maps, printing, the graphic arts, and bibliography and textual criticism.  The society sponsors exhibitions, contests for student book collectors and Virginia printers, an international speakers’ series, and an active publications program which has produced over 175 separate publication in addition to its journal ''Studies in Bibliography''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsuva.org/wordpress/about/history/ Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, "History"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was led for many years by [[Fredson Bowers]], a University of Virginia faculty member, and was influential in applying and spreading the theories of [[textual criticism]] developed by Bowers and [[W. W. Greg]] which brought about changes in the study of manuscripts and the printing of books to ascertain the original intentions of authors. 

==History==
After several years of preparation, on February 26, 1947 a group met in the University of Virginia library in Charlottesville and adopted a constitution that declared the object of their new society to be "to foster an interest in books (including books in manuscript), maps, printing, and bibliography." The group called "The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia." The inaugural address was given by Fredson Bowers, a member of the faculty, speaking on "Some Problems and Practices in Bibliographical Descriptions of Modern Authors," The leadership in the early years fell to Bowers, to John Cook Wyllie, and to Linton Massey. Bowers served as President in the Society's second and third years, 1948 and 1949, and then from its fifth year, 1951, up to 1974.{{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 4-8]}} By the late 1960s, the Society had nearly 1,000 members. {{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 70]}} Irby Cauthen, a charter member, became President in 1978. He was succeeded in 1993 by  [[G. Thomas Tanselle]], who was elected a Council member and President in 1993, only the second Council member from outside Charlottesville. Tanselle served as president of the society 1993-2006.{{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 76]}}

==''Studies in Bibliography'' and other publications==
''The Papers of the Bibliographical Society'' of the University of Virginia was started in 1948 as an annual journal dedicated to the study of books as physical objects and to textual criticism and scholarly editing; Bowers served as the journal's editor until his death in 1991.{{sfnb|Tanselle|2009}}  It was renamed ''Studies in Bibliography'' for volume 2.{{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 59-60, 67]}} Bowers conceived of the journal as one that encompassed all bibliographical study, with no restriction as to the geographical origins or periods or genres of the material examined. The topics of articles in Volume I (1948-1949), for instance, ranged from an unpublished manuscript by Thomas Jefferson, Elizabethan drama, and the use of watermarks as bibliographical evidence to catalogs issued by 16th century booksellers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv001.xml Papers Volume I] &lt;/ref&gt; Volume III (1950) opened with four major essays on textual matters: R. C. Bald's "Editorial Problems--A Preliminary Survey," W. W. Greg's "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Bowers's "Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems," and Archibald A. Hill's "Some Postulates for Distributional Study of Texts." &lt;ref&gt;[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv003.xml Papers Volume III] &lt;/ref&gt; G. Thomas Tanselle called Greg's article "one of the most seminal papers in the history of English scholarship." 
{{sfnb|Tanselle|1997| p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.03;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.03;brand=default 142]}} Articles in later issues also discussed new technology, such as the [[Hinman collator]], which used lenses and mirrors to compare copies of a printed work in order to show the differences. Bowers promoted this technique for early printed works, such as the [[First Folio]]s of Shakespeare.

Book length publications range from bibliographies of contemporary authors such as [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]] and [[Hilda Doolittle]] (H.D.), to studies of Shakespearean promptbooks, with an especially large number of works on the problems and theory of textual editing, including collections of essays by Bowers and Tanselle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsuva.org/wordpress/publications-2/publications/ Print Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, editorship of ''Studies in Bibliography'' passed to David L. Vander Meulen, a professor of English at the University of Virginia.{{sfnb|Tanselle|2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5509">'''Categories for the Description of Works of Art''' ('''CDWA''') describes the content of art databases by articulating a conceptual framework for describing and accessing information about works of art, architecture, other material culture, groups and collections of works, and related images. The CDWA includes 532 categories and subcategories. A small subset of categories are considered core in that they represent the minimum information necessary to identify and describe a work. The CDWA includes discussions, basic guidelines for cataloging, and examples. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/introduction.html CDWA Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Categories provide a framework to which existing art information systems can be mapped and upon which new systems can be developed. In addition, the discussions in the CDWA identify vocabulary resources and descriptive practices that will make information residing in diverse systems both more compatible and more accessible. 

The use of the CDWA framework will contribute to the integrity and longevity of data and will facilitate its inevitable migration to new systems as informational technology continues to evolve. Above all, it will help to give end-users consistent, reliable access to information, regardless of the system in which it resides. 

These guidelines hopefully provide a common ground for reaching agreement on what information should be included in art information systems, and what information will be shared or exchanged with other institutions or systems. Target users are curators, registrars, researchers, information managers, and systems vendors.

==History==
The CDWA is a product of the Art Information Task Force (AITF), which encouraged dialog between art historians, art information professionals, and information providers so that together they could develop guidelines for describing works of art, architecture, groups of objects, and visual and textual surrogates. 

Formed in the early 1990s, the task force was made up of representatives from the communities that provide and use art information: art historians, museum curators and registrars, visual resource professionals, art librarians, information managers, and technical specialists. The work of the AITF was funded by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], with a two-year matching grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) to the [[College Art Association]] (CAA).

==CDWA Lite== &lt;!-- [[Lightweight Information Describing Objects]] redirects here --&gt;
[[ARTstor]], the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], and RLG Programs/[[OCLC]] have worked together to develop an XML schema to describe cultural materials and their surrogates to provide an easier and more sustainable model for contributing to union resources. This initiative was driven by the absence of a data content standard specifically designed for unique cultural works, and a technical format for expressing this data in a machine-readable format.

CDWA Lite is an XML schema to describe core records for works of art and material culture based on CDWA and the Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) content standard. CDWA Lite records are intended for contribution to union catalogs and other repositories using the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) harvesting protocol. The CDWA Lite schema has been enlarged and integrated into the [[LIDO|Lightweight Information Describing Objects (LIDO)]] schema, which is available on the CIDOC site. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA)|url=https://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/introduction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage}}
[[File:Antiques restoration.jpg|thumb|Antiques restoration]]
A '''conservator-restorer''' is a professional responsible for the [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|preservation of artistic and cultural artifacts]], also known as [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation#.WSymX8m1tPs About Conservation: What is conservation? What is a conservator?]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservators possess the expertise to preserve cultural heritage in a way that retains the integrity of the object, building or site, including its historical significance, context and aesthetic or visual aspects.&lt;ref name="Defining2003"&gt;Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies. (2003). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1.&lt;/ref&gt;  This kind of preservation is done by analyzing and assessing the condition of cultural property, understanding processes and evidence of deterioration, planning [[collections care]] or site management strategies that prevent damage, carrying out conservation treatments, and conducting research.&lt;ref name="Careers2014"&gt;Careers in Conservation. (2014). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/publications-resources/careers-in-conservation/become-a-conservator#.VPPIxMaLTwN.&lt;/ref&gt;  A conservator's job is to ensure that the objects in a museum's collection are kept in the best possible condition, as well as to serve the museum's mission to bring art before the [[public]].&lt;ref name="Neuman2011"&gt;Neuman, R. (2011). MFA Highlights: Conservation and Care of Museum Collections. Boston, MA: Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation and restoration ==
Essentially, the term "conservation" refers to a manner of care or treatment that repairs damage and also takes action to prevent or slow down further deterioration of an object.&lt;ref name="Landry2000"&gt;Landry, G. (2000). The Wintertbur Guide to Caring for Your Collection. Winterthur, Delaware, DE: Winterthur Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "restoration" refers to a manner of care or treatment in which the goal is to bring an object back to its original appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt; "Restoration" can be part of the care and treatment of an object and is a subset of the umbrella term "conservation".&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;  Both terms come into play when it comes to the treatment and care of all cultural heritage.

== Responsibilities and duties ==
Conservators and restorers care for, manage, treat, preserve, and document many different historical items including [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], [[art]], and specimens.&lt;ref name="Baker2015"&gt;Baker, G. D. (2015). How to Become a Museum Conservator. Retrieved from http://collegemouse.com/jobs/how-to-become-a-museum-conservator.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Examining artifacts, both visually and using scientific tools such as x-rays, infrared photography and microscopic analysis to determine the extent and causes of deterioration.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013"&gt;Johnston, L. (2013). Museum/gallery conservator job description. Retrieved from http://www.prospects.ac.uk/museum_gallery_conservator_job_description.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation science (sometimes called museum science) aids every aspect of a museum’s mission to study its collections, both inside and out of the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Maintaining full conservation records by documenting the condition of an object or site, including any previous restoration work and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Documentation ensures the careful recording of treatment procedures and materials so there can be no misunderstanding in the future about what is part of the original work of art and what has been added or altered by the conservator&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Producing a visual record of the object for identification purposes and to illustrate its condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The examination of the object, treatment proposal, and the actual treatment is documented with written reports and photographs&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Monitoring and recording display and storage conditions with the aim of keeping objects in a stable condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Preservation is the ultimate goal of conservation.  By taking into account the possible day-to-day stresses caused by an object’s environment, museum conservators do their best to preserve art for generations to come.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Proposing and estimating the costs of treatments to halt decay and stabilize an artifact.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservators, present a proposal for work to be done as well as a report on the completion of the treatment.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Although conservators cannot exactly recapture the original appearance, they are able to make highly educated decisions about how to restore an object if they identify the materials from which it was made and fully understand their properties.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Organizing the logistics of long-term projects and collaborating with other conservators.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  This collaboration can take place when items are on loan or when outside help is needed for complex conservation projects.
* Working out creative solutions to clean, support and repair sensitive objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Ultimately, just as every object is unique, every conservation decision must be considered on its own and on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Developing and maintaining appropriate standards within the specialist area.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Critical information can be lost and an object permanently damaged when things are cared for without basic guidelines and information.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Keeping up to date with the latest conservation techniques and practices, through research and training.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservation is a young profession, which means it continues to evolve over time and conservators must be able to keep up to date with the latest trends.
* Advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials .  Museum conservators strive to maintain the integrity of each work of art throughout its life, whenever it is handled, stored, displayed, or shipped to other locations for exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Direct and supervise curatorial, technical, and student staff in the handling, mounting, care, and storage of art objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Other museum departments look to conservators and restorers for direction on safety procedures when it comes to objects in the museum's collection.
* Recommend preservation procedures, such as control of temperature and humidity, to curatorial and building staff.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The most important step you can take to ensure the preservation of any collection is to create a safe display and storage environment that will not cause further deterioration of the objects.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;

== Education and training ==

=== Undergraduate and graduate education ===
Conservators can receive training through apprenticeships, internships and graduate programs. In order to be accepted into a graduate program, they will need to fulfill some undergraduate prerequisites.  This includes undergraduate coursework in science, the humanities (art history, anthropology, and archaeology), and studio art.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Some graduate programs may also require internship, volunteer, apprenticeship, or paid conservation experience.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Many may also require a personal interview where candidates are asked to present a portfolio of art and conservation project work that demonstrates manual dexterity and familiarity with techniques and materials.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Graduate programs generally require two to four years of study, which can also include a full-time internship in the final year where students work under the guidance of experienced conservators.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  There are also a limited number of Ph.D. programs for advanced study in conservation.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservation-related programs are described on the websites of the AIC,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/jobs/become-a-conservator#.WSycysm1tPt Careers in Conservation: Become a Conservator]".

=== Continued professional development ===
The specialty of conservation is ever-changing and evolving, which means that practicing conservators must stay up-to-date of advances in technology and methodology.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservators usually expand their knowledge through reading publications, attending professional meetings, and enrolling in short-term workshops or courses.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt; AIC offers many workshops, conferences, and online courses and tutorials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/courses#.WSykcMm1tPt Professional Development Courses in Conservation Education]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org.

== Ethics ==
The primary goal for conservators and restorers is the preservation of cultural property.  In order to achieve this goal, conservators abide by a code of ethics and guidelines that establish the principles that guide conservation professionals and others who are involved in the care of cultural property.  An example of a code of ethics and guidelines for practice were created by the [[American Institute for Conservation|American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.VPPM0saLTwM Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practive]" (2015). American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important principles in a conservator's code of ethics is that treatments should be reversible, which means that one must be able to undo any treatment in the future.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;  Conservators strive to only minimize interventions and not completely alter an object during restoration.  Conservation focuses on the material aspects of art, and respect for original materials remains a crucial element of the field's ethics.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;

The [[harpsichord]] was largely obsolete, and seldom played, during a period lasting from the late 18th century to the early 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ukpianos.co.uk/harpsichord-history.html | title=Harpsichord History | accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument was successfully revived during the 20th century, first in an [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]] form strongly influenced by the piano, then with historically more faithful instruments. The revival was the joint work of performers, builders, and composers who wrote new harpsichord pieces. However the harpsichord never completely disappeared from the public eye as it was used through the mid-19th century for basso continuendo because despite its low volume, it had considerable power to "cut through" the orchestra. The earliest revival efforts began in the mid-19th century due to its increasingly infrequent usage and there was concern that the instrument could become a forgotten relic of the past.

==Instruments==
[[File:Clavecin 1979.JPG|thumb|300px|A heavy-framed mid-century harpsichord by the Sperrhake firm. Such instruments were harshly criticized during the 1960s by [[Wolfgang Zuckermann|Zuckermann]], who described their sound as feeble and their appearance as tubby, a betrayal of the tradition of beauty seen in historical instruments.]]
[[File:Deless-10.jpg|thumb|300px|Harpsichords played today tend to follow closely the building practices established in the historical period. This modern instrument was built by Jean-Paul Rouaud based on a historical instrument made in 1707 by Nicolas Dumont.]]
In the earlier stages, 20th-century harpsichords were heavily influenced by the technology of the modern piano, and usually included metal framing (which was entirely absent in historical instruments). It was felt that such construction would increase the stability of tuning. Since heavy framing tends to stifle harpsichord sound, instruments were bolstered by other means, notably the addition of a [[Eight foot pitch|16']] stop (an additional set of strings that played an octave below normal pitch); such stops were somewhat unusual in the historical period but became widespread in the first half of the 20th century. An example was the harpsichord produced by [[Pleyel et Cie]] at the request of Landowska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harpsichord.org.uk/EH/Vol2/No5/pleyel.pdf | title=The Pleyel Harpsichord | last=Richard | first=J.A. | publisher=The British Harpsichord Society | year=1979 | accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the mid-20th century, instruments were introduced whose construction followed historical principles, with thinner cases, historical dispositions (arrangements of choirs of strings) and no metal framing. Among the leaders of this shift were [[Frank Hubbard]], [[William Dowd]], and [[Martin Skowroneck]]. With time, such instruments came to dominate the scene, and the older heavy-frame instruments are almost never manufactured today. They retain historical value, however, since they were the instruments that early to mid-20th-century composers had in mind when they wrote their works.&lt;ref&gt;Thus the [[Neupert]] firm still offers its mid-century "Bach" model for sale, defending it explicitly on the grounds of its suitability for 20th-century music ([http://www.jc-neupert.de/en/node/48]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition of harpsichord building toward historicist principles is covered in detail by Hubbard (1965), Zuckermann (1969), and Kottick (2003), cited below.

==Music written for the contemporary harpsichord==

===Classical music===
In the 20th century, classical composers returned to the harpsichord as they sought out variation in the sounds available to them. Under the influence of [[Arnold Dolmetsch]], the [[harpsichordist]]s [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]] (1872–1951) and in France, [[Wanda Landowska]] (1879–1959), were at the forefront of the instrument's renaissance.

[[Harpsichord concerto|Concertos]] for the instrument were written by [[Francis Poulenc]] (the ''[[Concert champêtre]]'', 1927–28), [[Manuel de Falla]], [[Walter Leigh]], [[Bertold Hummel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bertoldhummel.de/english/register/register.html Bertold Hummel list of works]: Op. 15 is his ''Divertimento capriccioso'' for harpsichord and chamber orchestra.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henryk Mikołaj Górecki]], [[Michael Nyman]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[Viktor Kalabis]]. [[Bohuslav Martinů]] wrote both a [[concerto]] and a [[sonata (music)|sonata]] for the instrument, and [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Double Concerto'' is scored for harpsichord, piano and two chamber [[orchestra]]s. The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] composer [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] also wrote a harpsichord concerto for chamber ensemble (1951), and the instrument featured in one of his most famous works, ''[[Petite Symphonie Concertante]]''. 

In chamber music, [[György Ligeti]] wrote a small number of solo works for the instrument (including ''[[Continuum (Ligeti)|Continuum]]''), and [[Henri Dutilleux]]'s ''Les Citations'' (1991) is scored for harpsichord, oboe, double bass and percussions. [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and Harpsichord'' (1952) and his ''Double Concerto For Piano, Harpsichord, and Two Chamber Orchestras'' (1961) explore the timbre possibilities of the modern harpsichord.

[[Iannis Xenakis]] is also one of the composers who have written for harpsichord, with works like ''A l'lle de Gorée'' for amplified harpsichord and chamber orchestra, ''Komboi'' and ''Oophaa'' for harpsichord (again amplified) and percussion, and the two solo works ''Khoai'' and ''Naama''.

[[Josef Tal]] wrote ''Concerto for harpsichord &amp; electronic music'' (1964), ''Three Compositions for recorder &amp; harpsichord'' (1966) and ''Chamber Music'' (1982) for s-recorder, marimba &amp; harpsichord. Both [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (''Hamlet'', 1964) and [[Alfred Schnittke]] (''Symphony No.8'', 1994) wrote works that use the harpsichord as part of the orchestral texture. [[John Cage]] and [[Lejaren Hiller]] wrote ''[[HPSCHD]]'' (1969) for 1-7 harpsichords and 1-51 computer-generated tapes. [[John Zorn]] has also used harpsichord in works like ''Rituals'' (1998), ''Contes de Fées'' (1999), and ''La Machine de l'Etre'' (2000).

In the Preface to his piano collection ''[[Mikrokosmos (Bartók)|Mikrokosmos]]'', [[Béla Bartók]] suggests some ten pieces as being suitable for the harpsichord.

American composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] composed a number of sonatas for the harpsichord. 

[[Benjamin Britten]] included harpsichord parts in his opera ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and his [[cantata]] ''[[Phaedra (cantata)|Phaedra]]''.

Harpsichordist [[Hendrik Bouman]] has composed pieces in the 17th- and 18th-century style, including works for solo harpsichord, harpsichord concerti, and other works that call for harpsichord continuo. Other contemporary composers writing new harpsichord music in period styles include [[Grant Colburn]], and [[Fernando De Luca]]. Notable performers include [[Oscar Milani]] and [[Mario Raskin]].

Works for harpsichord in the 21st century include Northern Irish composer Alan Mills's ''Two Cubist Inventions'' (2000 / 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Two Cubist Inventions (no date) Available at: http://www.musichaven.co.uk/Two-Cubist-Inventions.html (Accessed: 13 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and French composer Karol Beffa's ''Suite'' (2008), ''Sarabande et Doubles'' (2015) and 'Destroy'' (2007) for harpsichord and string quartet.

===Folk music===
[[Seán Ó Riada]] used the harpsichord both for the soundtracks of film music, and for interpretations of the Irish harper [[Turlough O'Carolan]] during Riada's work with the band [[Ceoltori Cualann]] (later to become [[The Chieftains]]). Riada used harpsichord for the latter with the justification that the harpsichord best replicated the sound of the metal strings of the early [[Irish harp]].&lt;ref name="CooperDawe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Cooper|author2=Kevin Dawe|title=The Mediterranean in Music: Critical Perspectives, Common Concerns, Cultural Differences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di1KQc6-HCwC&amp;pg=PA220|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5407-9|pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Love2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Mason Love|title=The Film Music of Sean O Riada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zq2J4F7cAXIC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2009|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-1-109-20305-9|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music===
The revival of the harpsichord spilled over into [[popular music]]. Its first appearance in [[jazz music]] happened around 1940, when pianist [[Johnny Guarnieri]] was asked to play a harpsichord in [[Artie Shaw]]'s [[quintet]] "[[Gramercy Five]]".&lt;ref name="berindei"&gt;Berindei, Mihai (1976). ''Jazz Dictionary'', Scientific and Encyclopedic Publishing House, Bucharest, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The band recorded eight albums between 1940 and 1945, which were reissued in 1990 (''The Complete Gramercy Sessions'').

In the 1960s and 1970s, the harpsichord was used by groups including [[The Beatles]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Monkees]], [[The Partridge Family]], [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]], and [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]]. A great number of other artists since then have used harpsichord in their work such as [[Jens Johansson]] from [[Stratovarius]].

The harpsichord also appeared in film and on television.  For example, it appeared on the television show ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', played by [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]]. It appeared in the 1960s [[Miss Marple]] films featuring [[Margaret Rutherford]] and the cult show ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

[[Boys for Pele]], the third album of American singer-songwriter [[Tori Amos]], is notable for featuring the harpsichord as the main instrument on several songs, including the lead single [[Caught a Lite Sneeze|Caught A Lite Sneeze]].

[[Image:Diamond Core.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Rock core samples, the product of a [[Drilling rig#Diamond core drilling|diamond rig]]. A [[pied butcherbird]] perches nearby.]]
A '''core sample''' is a cylindrical section of (usually) a naturally occurring substance. Most core samples are obtained by drilling with special drills into the substance, for example sediment or rock, with a hollow [[steel]] tube called a [[core drill]]. The hole made for the core sample is called the "core bowling". A variety of core samplers exist to sample different media under different conditions. More continue to be invented on a regular basis. In the coring process, the sample is pushed more or less intact into the tube. Removed from the tube in the laboratory, it is inspected and analyzed by different techniques and equipment depending on the type of data desired. 

Core samples can be taken to test the properties of [[manmade]] materials, such as [[concrete]], [[ceramic]]s, some [[metal]]s and alloys, especially the softer ones. Core samples can also be taken of living things, including human beings, especially of a person's bones for microscopic examination to help diagnose diseases.  

== Methods ==
[[Image:Granitic_core_Stillwater.jpg|thumb|60px|Granitic rock core from [[Stillwater igneous complex]], Montana (from a spoil pile).]]
The composition of the subject materials can vary from almost liquid to the strongest materials found in nature or technology, and the location of the subject materials can vary from on the laboratory bench to over 10&amp;nbsp;km from the surface of the Earth in a borehole. The range of equipment and techniques applied to the task is correspondingly great. Core samples are most often taken with their long axis oriented roughly parallel to the axis of a borehole, or parallel to the gravity field for the gravity-driven tools. However it is also possible to take core samples from the wall of an existing borehole. Taking samples from an exposure, albeit an overhanging rock face or on a different planet, is almost trivial. (The Mars Exploration Rovers carry a [[Rock Abrasion Tool]], which is logically equivalent to the "rotary sidewall core" tool described below.)

Some common techniques include:
* ''gravity coring'', in which the core sampler is dropped into the sample, usually the bed of a water body, but essentially the same technique can also be done on soft materials on land. The penetration forces, if recorded, give information about the strength of different depths in the material, which may be the only information required, with samples as an incidental benefit. This technique is common in both civil engineering site investigations (where the techniques tend towards into [[pile driving]]) and geological studies of recent aquatic deposits. The low strength of the materials penetrated means that cores have to be relatively small.
* ''vibracoring'', in which the sampler is vibrated to allow penetration into [[thixotropic]] media. Again, the physical strength of the subject material limits the size of core that can be retrieved.
* ''drilling'' [[exploration diamond drilling]] where a rotating annular tool backed up by a cylindrical core sample storage device is pressed against the subject materials to cut out a cylinder of the subject material. A mechanism is normally needed to retain the cylindrical sample in the coring tool. Depending on circumstances, particularly the consistency and composition of the subject materials, different arrangements may be needed within the core tools to support and protect the sample on its way to surface; it is often also necessary to control or reduce the contact between the [[drilling fluid]] and the core sample, to reduce changes from the coring process. The mechanical forces imposed on the core sample by the tool frequently lead to fracture of the core and loss of less-competent intervals, which can greatly complicate interpretation of the core. Cores can routinely be cut as small as a few [[millimeter]]s in diameter (in wood, for [[dendrochronology]]) up to over 150 millimeters in diameter (routine in [[oil exploration]]). The lengths of samples can range from less than a meter (again, in wood, for [[dendrochronology]]) up to around 200 metres in one run, though 27m to 54m is more usual (in [[oil exploration]]), and many runs can be made in succession if "quick look" analysis in the field suggests that the zone of interest is continuing.
* ''percussion sidewall coring'' uses robust cylindrical "bullets" explosively propelled into the wall of a borehole to retrieve a (relatively) small, short core sample. These tend to be heavily shattered, rendering [[porosity]]/ [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] measurements dubious, but are often sufficient for [[petrography|lithological]] and [[micropaleontology|micropalaeontological]] study. Many samples can be attempted in a single run of the tools, which are typically configured with 20 to 30 "bullets" and propulsive charges along the length of a tool. Several tools can often be ganged together for a single run. The success rates for firing a particular bullet, it penetrating the borehole wall, the retention system recovering the bullet from the borehole wall, and the sample being retained in the bullet are all relatively low, so it is not uncommon for only half the samples attempted to be successful. This is an important consideration in planning sample programmes.
* ''rotary sidewall coring'' where a miniaturised automated rotary drilling tool is applied to the side of the borehole to cut a sample similar in size to a percussion sidewall core (described above). These tend to suffer less deformation than percussion cores. However the core-cutting process takes longer and jams are common in the ancillary equipment which retrieves the sample from the drill bit and stores it within the tool body. This complicates the planning of a coring programme.

==Management of cores and data==
Although often neglected, core samples always degrade to some degree in the process of cutting the core, handling it, and studying it. Non-destructive techniques are increasingly common (e.g. the use of [[MRI]] scanning to characterize grains, pore fluids, pore spaces ([[porosity]]) and their interactions (constituting part of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]]) but such expensive subtlety is likely wasted on a core that has been shaken on an unsprung lorry for 300&amp;nbsp;km of dirt road.  What happens to cores between the retrieval equipment and the final laboratory (or archive) is an often neglected part of record keeping and core management.

[[File:Cut Bakken Core samples.jpg|thumb|Cut [[Bakken formation|Bakken]] Core samples]]Coring has come to be recognized as an important source of data, and more attention and care is being put on preventing damage to the core during various stages of it transportation and analysis. The usual way to do this is to freeze the core completely using liquid nitrogen, which is cheaply sourced. In some cases, special polymers are also used to preserve and seat/cushion the core from damage.

Equally, a core sample which cannot be related to its context (where it was before it became a core sample) has lost much of its benefit. The identification of the borehole, and the position and orientation ("way up") of the core in the borehole is critical, even if the borehole is in a tree trunk - [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] always try to include a bark surface in their samples so that the date of most-recent growth of the tree can be unambiguously determined.

If these data become separated from core samples, it is generally impossible to regain that data. The cost of a coring operation can vary from a few currency units (for a hand-caught core from a soft soil section) to tens of millions of currency units (for sidewall cores from a remote-area offshore borehole many kilometres deep). Inadequate recording of such basic data has ruined the utility of both types of core.

Different disciplines have different local conventions of recording these data, and the user should familiarize themselves with their area's conventions. For example, in the oil industry, orientation of the core is typically recorded by marking the core with two longitudinal colour streaks, with the red one on the right when the core is being retrieved and marked at surface. Cores cut for mineral mining may have their own, different, conventions. Civil engineering or soil studies may have their own, different, conventions as their materials are often not competent enough to make permanent marks on.

[[File:Bakken Core samples under a black light.jpg|thumb|Bakken Core samples under a black light]]It is becoming increasingly common to retain core samples in cylindrical packaging which forms part of the core-cutting equipment, and to make the marks of record on these "inner barrels" in the field prior to further processing and analysis in the laboratory.  Sometimes core is shipped from the field to the laboratory in as long a length as it comes out of the ground; other times it is cut into standard lengths (5m or 1m or 3&amp;nbsp;ft) for shipping, then reassembled in the laboratory. Some of the "inner barrel" systems are capable of being reversed on the core sample, so that in the laboratory the sample goes "wrong way up" when the core is reassembled. This can complicate interpretation. [[File:Oriented Core Goniometer commonly used when logging core.JPG|thumb|Goniometers are used to measure angles of fractures and other features in a core sample relative to its standard orientation.]]

If the borehole has [[petrophysics|petrophysical]] measurements made of the wall rocks, and these measurements are repeated along the length of the core then the two data sets correlated, one will almost universally find that the depth "of record" for a particular piece of core differs between the two methods of measurement. Which set of measurements to believe then becomes a matter of policy for the client (in an industrial setting) or of great controversy (in a context without an overriding authority. Recording that there are discrepancies, for whatever reason, retains the possibility of correcting an incorrect decision at a later date ; destroying the "incorrect" depth data makes it impossible to correct a mistake later. Any system for retaining and archiving data and core samples needs to be designed so that dissenting opinion like this can be retained.

If core samples from a campaign are competent, it is common practice to "slab" them - cut the sample into two or more samples longitudinally - quite early in laboratory processing so that one set of samples can be archived early in the analysis sequence as a protection against errors in processing. "Slabbing" the core into a 2/3 and a 1/3 set is common. It is also common for one set to be retained by the main customer while the second set goes to the government (who often impose a condition for such donation as a condition of exploration/ exploitation licensing). "Slabbing" also has the benefit of preparing a flat, smooth surface for examination and testing of profile permeability, which is very much easier to work with than the typically rough, curved surface of core samples when they're fresh from the coring equipment. Photography of raw and "slabbed" core surfaces is routine, often under both natural and ultra-violet light.

A unit of length occasionally used in the literature on seabed cores is ''cmbsf'', an abbreviation for centimeters below sea floor.

==History of coring==
The technique of coring long predates attempts to drill into the [[Earth]]’s [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Program]]. The value to oceanic and other [[geologic history]] of obtaining cores over a wide area of [[sea floor]]s soon became apparent. Core sampling by many scientific and exploratory organizations expanded rapidly. To date hundreds of thousands of core samples have been collected from floors of all the planet’s [[ocean]]s and many of its [[inland water]]s. 
Access to many of these samples is facilitated by the [[Index to Marine &amp; Lacustrine Geological Samples]],
:"A collaboration between twenty institutions and agencies that operate geological repositories."
The above agency keeps a record of the samples held in the repositories of its member organizations. Data includes

[[File:Lower Bakken-3 Forks Transition.JPG|thumb|Lower Bakken-3 Forks Transition]]
==Informational value of core samples==

Coring began as a method of sampling surroundings of ore deposits and oil exploration. It soon expanded to [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s, [[Ice core|ice]], [[mud]], [[soil]] and [[Dendrochronology|wood]]. Cores on very old [[tree]]s give information about their growth rings without destroying the tree. 

Cores indicate variations of [[climate]], [[species]] and [[sediment]]ary composition during geologic history. The dynamic phenomena of the Earth’s surface are for the most part cyclical in a number of ways, especially [[temperature]] and [[rainfall]].

There are many ways to date a core. Once dated, it gives valuable information about changes of climate and [[terrain]]. For example, cores in the ocean floor, soil and ice have altered the view of the geologic history of the [[Pleistocene]] entirely.

[[File:Jesuits at Akbar's court.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar the Great]] (r. 1556-1605) holds a religious assembly in the [[Ibadat Khana]] (House of Worship) in [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; the two men dressed in black are the [[Jesuit]] missionaries [[Rodolfo Acquaviva]] and [[Francisco Henriques (missionary)|Francisco Henriques]].  Illustration to the [[Akbarnama]], miniature painting by [[Nar Singh]], ca. 1605]]
The '''''Dabestān-e Mazāheb''''', also transliterated as '''''Dabistān-i Mazāhib''''' ({{lang-fa|دبستان مذاهب}}) "School of Religions", is an examination and comparison of [[South Asia]]n religions and sects of the mid-17th century. The work is written in Persian, probably having been composed in about 1655 CE.

The ''Dabistan-e Madahib'' is best known for its chapter on the [[Din-i Ilahi|Dīn-i Ilāhī]], the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion propounded by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar|Jalāl ud-Dīn Muḥammad Akbar]] ("Akbar the Great") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the [[Ibadat Khana|''Ibādat Khāna'']] discussions that led up to this.

This work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the ''Asiatic Researches'', xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by [[David Shea (linguist)|David Shea]] and Anthony Troyer under the title, ''The Dabistan or School of Manners'' (1843) in three volumes from London.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, M. Athar (2008). ''Mughal India'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-569661-1}}, pp.216-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The critical English-language edition by David Shea and Anthony Troyer in 1843 is slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, suggest a certain Muhsin Fani and propose 1670 as his date of death. They furthermore stated that he was "of the philosophic sect of [[Sufi]]s", but the 1993 edition of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'' suggests that the author was most likely a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], '''Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'''. The author may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sipásíán) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.

The author describes that he spent time in [[Patna]], [[Kashmir]], [[Lahore]], [[Surat]] and [[Srikakulam]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dīn-i Ilāhī.

According to ''The Jew in the Lotus'' by Rodger Kamenetz, a ''Dabistan'' was commissioned by a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] mystic prince, [[Dara Shikoh]]. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, [[Sarmad Kashani]], and his Hindu disciple from [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews and Judaism at the Court of the Moghul Emperors in Medieval India, Walter J. Fischel, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 18, (1948 - 1949), pp. 137-177&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Fischel notes: {{Quote|Through the medium of the ''Dabistan'' Sarmad thus became the channel through which Jewish ideas, though with a Sufic blending, penetrated into the religious fabric of the India of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;}} An English version of the ''Dabistan'' by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data/upload/0010/694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719101952/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata%2Fupload%2F0010%2F694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689 |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's perspective==

Although the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a [[Persian people|Persian]]. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:&lt;ref&gt;DABISTÁN, OR SCHOOL OF MANNERS. TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL PERSIAN, BY DAVID SHEA AND ANTHONY TROYER,1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

:As inconstant fortune had torn away the author from the shores of Persia, and made him the associate of the believers in transmigration and those who addressed their prayers to idols and images and worshipped demons, therefore the tenets held by this most subtle class of reasoners come to be considered next after those of the Parsees.

:... According to these sectaries, the worship offered to the forms of Mahadeo and Naráyan, and to the statues of the other spiritual beings, is highly to be commended. Strangers to their faith suppose them to look upon the idol as God, which is by no means the case, their belief being as follows: “The idol is merely a Kiblah, and they adore under that particular form, the Being who has neither accident nor form.” ...

: Rai Manuhar Kuchwáhhah has said:

::“O Moslem! if the Kâbah be the object of thy worship,
::Why dost thou reproach the adorers of idols?”

He personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the [[Jainism|Jains]] he writes:

:The author of this book affirms he has seen a great number of Srivaras &lt;ref&gt;Sevada implies a Jain monk of the [[Shvetambara]] order, from Sanskrit Shvetapata.&lt;/ref&gt; and their followers. From them he knew Meher chand, a Lúnú,&lt;ref&gt;Lunia means someone belonging to the [[Lonka Gachchha]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 1056 of the Hejira (1646 A. D.), in Dotárah, which is under the dominion of Jodpur Márawár, he found also Síva rama, a Pujári, in Mirta, which place belongs to Marawar, and one named Jagna, a Banian, in Ráwel Pandi: he was adorned with all the good qualities of Jatis. When he saw a bird in the hands of a fowler, he bought it of him and set it free. This sect do whatever they can for the liberation of living beings.

:[[Hafez|Hafiz]] Shirázi says:

::“Avoid hurting any living animal, and do whatever thou likest,
::For in my book of laws there is no crime but this.”

[[File:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" with traditional [[Parsi hat]]s, a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
He observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret:

:... there are Samradíán, Khodaníán, Radián, Shíderangíán, Pâikeríán, Mílánían, Aláríán, Shídábíán, Akhshían, and [[Mazdak]]ían, who are dispersed in Iran and Turan, and all appear in the dress of Musulmans, although in secret they follow each the path of their own chosen faith; in the same manner various sects are also established in Hindostan, but they do not appear in the dress of Musulmans.

He describes the disputations in [[Akbar]]'s [[Ibadat Khana]] in detail, as if he had been there:

:A learned philosopher came into the hall, where Hindus also were present, and three other learned men; a Musulman, a Nazarene, and a Jew: these were summoned, and ranged in opposition to the learned philosopher.The latter opened the discussion in this manner: “The divine mission of your prophets has not been proved, for several reasons: the first is, that whatever the prophet says ought to be conformable to reason; the second is, that he ought to be free from crime, and not hurtful to other beings. But Moses, according to the opinion of the Jews, was brought up by Pharâoh, and yet he caused him by a stratagem to be drowned in the waters of the Nile,... Jesus permitted the killing and ill using of animals. And Muhammed himself attacked the forces and caravans of the Koreish; he shed blood, nay, with his own hand put to death animated beings.

:... Now the Christian said: “The Messiah was born without a father.” The doctor replied: “You yourselves say that Joseph, the carpenter, had taken Mary to wife; how can it be made out that Jesus was not the son of Joseph?” The Nazarene was reduced to silence.

He describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar:

:His Majesty, Akbar, as he was ordered by God, used to read prayers, containing the praise of the sun, in the Persian, Hindi, Turkish, and Arabic languages, among which all was one prayer, which is proper to the Hindus, and which they sing at midnight and at sun-rise. Besides, the emperor forbade his subjects to kill cows and to eat their flesh; .... The Hindus say also that, as many advantages are derived from the cow, it is not right to kill it. The Yezdánian maintained that it is tyranny to kill harmless animals ...

'''Dittography''' is the accidental, erroneous act of repeating a letter, word, phrase or combination of letters by a scribe or copyist.&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Wegner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SIMsY6b2n2gC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A student's guide to textual criticism of the Bible: its history, methods, and results''], InterVarsity Press, 2006, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used in the field of [[textual criticism]]. The opposite phenomenon, in which a copyist omits text by skipping from a word or phrase to a similar word or phrase further on, is known as [[haplography]].

==Example==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13860">The '''double diversion''' is two-part theory about environmental harm that was developed by [[William Freudenburg]] and colleagues beginning in the 1990s, and focusing on "disproportionality" and "distraction."  The concept of disproportionality involves the observation that, rather than being a reflection of overall levels of [[economic activity]], the majority of [[environmental destruction]] is actually due to a relatively small number of economic actors, which enjoy privileged access to [[natural resource]]s, “diverting” those resources for the private benefit of the few.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freudenburg's original work on this concept was carried out in conjunction with his colleague from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Peter Nowak.  The reference to the "double" diversion reflects the argument that this first diversion is made possible in large part by the second—the diversion of attention, or distraction, often ironically relying on the widespread but empirically inaccurate belief that environmental harm is economically beneficial to the population as a whole.

== Historical emphasis on individual factors ==
The double diversion differs from previous theories about responsibility for environmental harm, which tend to focus on overall or average levels of environmental harm.  The most notable example is [[Garret Hardin]]’s 1968 article ''[[The Tragedy of the Commons]]'', which focuses on the conflict between individual self-interest and what benefits the society as a whole.  Hardin illustrates this concept through an example of [[herder]]s sharing an open stretch of [[Arable land|farmland]], which results in each individual developing an incentive to increase his individual number of [[cow]]s.  Hardin argued that as a result, all of the individual herders ignore long-term benefits that result from environmental [[environmental protection|conservation]], resulting in “individual [[rationality]] leading to a collective tragedy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hardin|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tendency to focus on overall impacts continued into the 1970s and 1980s with the development of the [[I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT]] equation by [[Barry Commoner]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[John Holdren]].  The formula states that human impact on the environmental equals the product of population, affluence, and technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ehrlich|Holdren|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; without considering that all individuals do not have equal environmental impacts.  This is similarly true in the case of [[William R. Catton, Jr.|William Catton]]’s 1980 book ''Overshoot: the Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change'', in which Catton emphasizes the argument that all of us have lifestyles that are based upon a time when our [[carrying capacity]] exceeded human load.  He argues that because we have been unwilling to modify our lifestyles as carrying capacities have been exceeded, subsequent generations are destined to inherit a world of increasing conflict for finite resources &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Catton|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also integral to the individual-emphasis from the writing of this period is the notion of the conflict between economic protection and [[economic growth]].  The typical feeling of this period is articulated through O’Connor (1988, 1991), who sees [[capitalism]] as relying on prosperity for the legitimization of economic expansion.  What occurs as a result, according to O’Connor, is an ever-increasing exploitation of both the environment and workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Berry|2008|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disproportionality and distraction ==
According to the double diversion hypothesis, the emphasis on overall or average levels of individual impacts, which many 20th century authors stressed, ultimately missed the importance of the disproportionate impacts that economic outliers can have on the environment.  According to [[Lisa Berry]], “For societies where a small fraction of the population consumes many more resources or produces much more [[pollution]] than other members, the I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;PAT model fails to communicate the vast differences in resource consumption that exist within groups.” &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Berry|2008|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvp|Freudenburg|2006}} traces this emphasis to the fact that most scientists are trained to focus on statistical means.  However, according to the double diversion hypothesis, rather than being discarded, the extreme cases need to be the focus of the debate.

When this privileged access is threatened, according to Freudenburg, organized producers use distraction, through privileged accounts” largely unchallenged stories and beliefs that divert attention away from their patterns of research use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These privileged accounts ultimately get repeated so often that they ultimately become “embedded” within our language and thought. If the opposition is still refuses to stay silent and challenges them on their inequitable effects on the environment they engage in a disappearing act, where they do not “respond” why their company has the right enjoy profits of a public good, but instead point to the benefits that the populace supposedly receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when laws and policies are created, organized interests can expect to receive tangible rewards from the political system, while the remainder of the citizenry can expect to receive mainly symbolic rewards in the form of rhetoric.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double diversion in practice==
The double diversion is a sufficiently new theory for it to not have been tested extensively, but several notable studies suggest that it deserves greater attention. Although no notable counter-examples have yet been provided, their existence is entirely possible.

==In agriculture==
A case study of disproportionality in [[agriculture]] is provided by [[Peter Nowak]] and colleagues, who researched the agricultural practices of several thousand farmers in [[Wisconsin]]. They discuss how the trend of subsistence farms developing into livestock ranches, where the reuse of manure is discouraged, has increased disproportionality of negative environmental practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowak ''et al.'' found that a small number of farmers using non-normative practices had a significantly greater responsibility for environmental damage.  This was true regarding the amount of [[fertilizer]] used, the degree of erosion from the production of croplands, and the amount of [[phosphorus]] that accumulated in watersheds.  The majority of the soil test results are in the high or excessively high range for phosphorus values, with a clear sub-set of outliers that have values up to 900% above the sample mean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because environmental regulations were crafted for the “average” rather than the exceptional farms, the policies did little to curb the runoff from the few farms that created significantly more than “their share” of the phosphorus problem. Nowak et al. concludes that “we are suggesting that indicators of environmental degradation in this situation […] failed to decrease during the 1976–1994 period because of the increasing important of disproportionate contributions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nowak|Bowen|Cabot|2005|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;   	
Disproportionality in agriculture has also been observed in water use, with farmers and organized farm interests in dry western states of the U.S. commonly using 80&amp;nbsp;percent of those state’s water, while only having an economic relevance of 1–3&amp;nbsp;percent of the total economy.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_2006_15"&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disproportionate effect signifies that twenty thousand times as many jobs would be created if this same amount of water was used in industry.  Nevertheless, the top four percent of all farmers received 55&amp;nbsp;percent of all federal [[crop subsidies]], with this trend of this disproportionality increasing into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reluctance to challenge this status quo can be explained through diversion via the [[Social Multiplier Effect|social multiplier effect]]: even if a given individual does not work in a given industry, that person’s attitudes may be affected by whether his or her friends and relatives do.  Therefore, it makes sense that rural resident would be especially reluctant to criticize the industries or facilities they see as providing jobs for their friends and neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In industry==
Disproportionate effects have also been observed within the [[industry|industrial]] setting in cases of both between and within-group comparisons. These inequalities can be measured using the [[Gini coefficient]], (which ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher number signifying greater inequality.) {{harvp|Freudenburg|2006}} uses this coefficient to establish both between and in-group comparisons of industry toxicity, finding that chemical companies had a level 0.865 in comparison to other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Freudenburg|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in-group disproportionality between individual chemical companies was even more substantial, with the 62 chemical company facilities he analyzed producing a Gini coefficient of 0.975. These results are consistent with the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]], which finds that expectations for proportionate relationships between economic activity and environmental harm can consistently be rejected at very high levels of significance.&lt;ref name="Freudenburg_2006_15"/&gt;

==Automobile pollution==
Disproportionality has also been observed by [[A. Kurniawan]] and [[A. Schmidt-Ott]], who developed a new sensing method in order to measure emissions of individual cars.  As in previous studies by [[Beaton (scientist)|Beaton]] ''et al.'' (1995) and [[Bishop &amp; Stedman]], (1996) they found that contrary to popular belief, a small group of “super polluters” is actually responsible for a disproportionate amount of total emissions.  In this particular study, Kurniawan ''et al.'' found that 5&amp;nbsp;percent of the total vehicles accounted for 43&amp;nbsp;percent of emissions.&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"&gt;{{harvp|Kurniawan|Schmidt-Ott|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From these findings, they conclude that “properly maintained vehicles of any age are relatively small contributors to exhaust pollution and that most of the pollution is cause by a small percentage of badly maintained cars.”&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"/&gt; Given these results, they suggest that unlike the current policies of most industrialized countries, the best solution is a targeted repair program that focuses on disproportionate polluters.  The benefits of such a policy is demonstrated through are demonstrated by Netherlands where it has been implemented, and the contribution of super-polluters has been greatly diminished.  Nonetheless, the failure of other countries to follow their lead has meant that “about half of the present particulate pollution by passenger cars would be avoidable if adequate monitoring would enable enforcement of existing laws”&lt;ref name="Kurniawan_1"/&gt;

'''Ecodesign''' is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle.  In a [[life cycle assessment]], the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.

Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our [[ecological footprint]] on the planet. Green awareness, [[overpopulation]], [[industrialization]] and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are [[environmentally friendly]] and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and [[energy consumption|energy]].

==Overview==
[[File:Stainless Steel Talbe with FSC Eucalyptus wood Ecodesign.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stainless steel]] table with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Teca wood - [[Brazil]] ecodesign]]
As the whole product's life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective, representatives from advance development, design, production, marketing, purchasing, and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product.  Together, they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact.

An eco-design product has a [[cradle-to-cradle]] life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature, eco-design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly [[circular economy]].

Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are:

* Consumption of resources (energy, materials, water or land area)
* Emissions to air, water, and the ground (our Earth) as being relevant for the environment and human health
* Miscellaneous (e.g. noise and vibration)

Waste (hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation) is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment (e.g. methane and leaching from landfills) are inventoried. All consumables, materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for, and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production.

The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters, such as extent of environmental impact, potential for improvement, or potential of change.

According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time.

==Environmental effect analysis==
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among [[designers]] in [[Brazil]].]]

One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis (EEA).

For an EEA the following are taken into account:

* Customers' wishes
* Legal requirements, market requirements (competitors)
* Data concerning the product and the manufacturing process

==Applications in design==
Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design; the impact of [[global warming]] and an increase in CO₂ emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process.
In building design and construction, designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process, from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste.

With respect to these concepts, [[online]] platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging, with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nupe.co.uk/an-interview-with-sustainable-design-company-moorbi/ Kamran Assadi for Nupè April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoMaterials''', such as the use of local raw materials, are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials, such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations, with accreditations from companies such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), or the Pan-European Forest Certification Council (PEFCC), can be used.

Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction, but it is important that they don’t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved.

'''[[Water recycling]]''' systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing [[grey water]] generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water.

'''Off-grid homes''' only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems.

==Active system==
These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy, for example; solar, wind, thermal, biomass, and geothermal energy.

'''[[Solar power]]''' is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel, and reduce CO₂ emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. However, this is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels.

'''[[Biomass]]''' is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process.

'''[[Geothermal energy]]''' is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground, making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design.

'''Wind turbines''' are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources, e.g., rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to 30% of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications, such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property.

==Passive systems==
Buildings that integrate passive energy systems ([[bioclimatic buildings]]) are heated using non-mechanical methods, thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun's rays, thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room.

A '''[[green roof]]''' is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building's temperature. It also retains water, providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing.

==In art and decorating==
Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the 20th century, when cubist artist [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) created collages from newsprints, packaging and other found materials. The "Outside Art" movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them.  The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.

There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a "green" style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries, although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials.

In [[printmaking]], an '''edition''' is a number of prints struck from one plate, usually at the same time. This may be a ''limited edition'', with a fixed number of impressions produced on the understanding that no further impressions (copies) will be produced later, or an ''open edition'' limited only by the number that can be sold or produced before the plate wears. Most modern artists produce only limited editions, normally signed by the artist in pencil, and numbered as say 67/100 to show the unique number of that impression and the total edition size.

== Original or reproduction? ==
An important and often confused distinction is that between editions of original prints, produced in the same medium as the artist worked (e.g., etching, or lithography), and reproduction prints (or paintings), which are photographic reproductions of the original work, essentially in the same category as a picture in a book or magazine, though better printed and on better paper.  These may be marketed as "limited editions" with investment potential (which is rarely realized), and even signed and numbered by the artist. Some knowledge is often required to tell the difference.

== Development of the concept ==
[[File:Rembrandt House Museum, printing studioDSCF7277.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rembrandt House Museum]], printing studio]]

One of the main reasons for the development of printmaking was the desire of artists to make more money from their work by selling multiple copies; printmaking satisfies this motive. The production of multiple copies also tends to reduce production costs and market price when compared to a single or unique image. Until the 19th century, in the period of the [[Old master print]] the concept of an edition did not really apply to prints, unlike books.  Prints were often run off as demand allowed, and often worn-out plates were reworked by the original artist or another, to produce a new [[State (printmaking)|state]]. The art market attempts to distinguish between "lifetime impressions" and "late impressions", which were produced after the death of the artist. This can be done to some extent by the study of the [[paper]] involved, and its [[watermark]], and the condition of the plate as revealed by the printed image.  But it remains a difficult area.   
[[File:Goya - Befreit uns niemand von unseren Fesseln ca 1799.jpeg|thumb|left|180px|[[Aquatint]] by [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]], from the Cycle "[[Los Caprichos]]": Can't Anyone Untie Us?]]
The [[aquatint]]s of [[Goya]], which are done in a technique that wears out quickly on the plate, were the first important prints to be published initially in limited editions, which however were not signed or numbered. In fact the plates survived, and since Goya's death several further editions have been published, showing a progressive and drastic decline in quality of the image, despite some rework. Because of this and other cases, "posthumous editions" produced after the death of an artist, and obviously not signed by him, are usually far less sought after. The plates of later prints are often "cancelled" by defacing the image, with a couple of impressions of the cancelled plate taken to document it. This is now expected by collectors and investors, who want the prints they buy to retain their value.

== Modern practice ==
Prints by artists today may potentially retain their financial value as art (i.e., as an appreciating investment) because they are created by an artistic process rather than by a strictly mechanical one, and may become scarce because the number of multiples is limited. In [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]]'s time, the limit on the size of an edition was practical: a plate degrades through use, putting an upper limit on the number of images to be struck. Plates can be reworked and restored to some degree, but it is generally not possible to create more than a thousand prints from any process except lithography or woodcut. A few hundred is a more practical upper limit, and even that allows for significant variation in the quality of the image. In drypoint, 10 or 20 may be the maximum number of top-quality impressions possible.

Today, artists will sometimes refer to a print as a "one-off," meaning that the artist has made a unique print and no reproductions of it from the original matrix, often not even a proof. In this category one sometimes finds monotypes, monoprints, collagraphs, altered prints with collage or chine colle additions, or even hand-colored prints. There remain artists who are strong advocates of "artist's prints" which are conceived, printed, signed, and given the edition number 1/1 by the artist. One contemporary printmaker says that she believes that "there is a natural sequence of actions and thoughts which cannot be approximated by the substitution of an artist/printer collaboration unless the artist is truly involved with the printer or assistant in every step of the decision-making and mark-making processes." &lt;ref&gt;Mitzi Humphrey, ''In Search of the Meandering Absolute: The Prints of Mitzi Humphrey''. Thesis (M.F.A.)Department of Painting and Printmaking,Virginia Commonwealth University, 1997. p.1, Abstract, 64 pp. https://www.worldcat.org/title/in-search-of-the-meandering-absolute-the-prints-of-mitzi-humphrey/oclc/41232924&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numbering ==
Because of the variation in quality, lower-numbered prints in an edition are sometimes favored as superior, especially with older works where the image was struck until the plate wore out. However the numbering of impressions in fact may well not equate at all to the sequence in which they were printed, and may often be the reverse of it.

In later times, printmakers recognized the value of limiting the size of an edition and including the volume of the edition in the print number (e.g., "15/30" for the 15th print in an edition of 30). Tight controls on the process to limit or eliminate variation in quality have become the norm. In [[monotyping]], a technique where only two impressions at most can be taken, prints may be numbered 1/1, or marked "unique". Artists usually print an edition much smaller than the plate allows, both for marketing reasons and to keep the edition comfortably within the lifespan of the plate. Specific steps may also be taken to strengthen the plate, such as electroplating [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] images, which uses an electric process to put a very thin coat of a stronger metal onto a plate of a weaker metal. 

The conventions for numbering prints are well-established, but other marks may indicate that a print has been made in addition to the numbered prints of an edition. [[Artist's proof]]s are marked "A. P." or "P/A", sometimes E. A. or E. d'A. (épreuve d'artiste); monoprints and uniquely hand-altered prints are marked "unique"; prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked "H. C." or "H/C", meaning "hors de commerce", not for sale. These are usually prints reserved for the publisher, like Artist's Proofs.  The printer is also often allowed to retain some proof impressions; these are marked "P. P." Finally, a master image may be printed against which the members of the edition are compared for quality: these are marked as "bon à tirer" or "BAT" ("good to print" in French). In all, the number of the main edition can represent 50% or less of the total number of good impressions taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Terms: Printmaking|url=http://www.artcellarexchange.com/glossary_printmaking.html|publisher=Art Cellar Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional artist printmakers will sometimes limit an edition to several [[artist's proof]] copies, including a "bon a tirer" print and then one unique copy designated as a "[[one-off]]" or "1/1" or "one/off".

==Consumer protection laws==
California became the first state to regulate the sale of limited edition art prints with the "California Print Law" of 1971. The state of Illinois later expanded on the California statute. However, it was not until 1986 that more comprehensive provisions, still in place today, were enacted with the passage of the "Georgia Print Law". That law became the template for statutes subsequently enacted by other states.

The '''Georgia Print Law''' written by (former) State Representative [[Chesley V. Morton]], became effective July 1, 1986. The law requires art dealers, artists, or auctioneers to supply information to prospective purchasers about the nature of the print, the number of prints and editions (including HC editions) produced, and the involvement (if any) of the artist in the creation of the print. The penalty for violation of the law ranges from simple reimbursement to treble damages, in the case of a willful violation. Those found to be in violation of the law are also liable for court costs, expenses, and attorney fees. The law applies to works of art valued at more than $100.00 (not including frame). Charitable organizations are specifically exempt from the provision of the law.  The statute of limitations is one year after discovery, and, if discovery of the violation is not made within three years of the sale, then the purchaser’s remedies are extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617081914/http://artsgeorgia.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ga-Limited-Edition-Reproduction-Act.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainability education''' ('''SE'''), '''Education for Sustainability''' ('''EfS'''), and '''Education for Sustainable Development''' ('''ESD''') are often used interchangeably to describe the practice of teaching for [[sustainability]]. ESD is the term most used internationally and by the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esdtoolkit.org/|title=Untitled Document|website=Esdtoolkit.org|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agenda 21]] was the first international document that identified education as an essential tool for achieving sustainable development and highlighted areas of action for education.

== Concept and origin ==
One definition of Education for Sustainable Development is an “interdisciplinary learning methodology covering the integrated social, economic, and environmental aspects of formal and informal curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/education-sustainable-development-0|title=Education for sustainable development {{!}} Higher Education Academy|website=www.heacademy.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This academic approach can help graduates nurture their knowledge, talents, and experience to play a role in environmental development and become responsible members of society. The Brundtland Commission defined sustainable development as meeting the needs of the present generation without putting at risk the capacity of generations to come in meeting their own requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sustainabledevelopment2015.org/AdvocacyToolkit/index.php/earth-summit-history/past-earth-summits/58-the-brundtland-commission|title=The Brundtland Commission|website=www.sustainabledevelopment2015.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Agency used to be the World Commission on Environment and Development created in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.reset.org/knowledge/advancing-sustainable-development-through-education-india|title=Education for Sustainable Development {{!}} Development|website=RESET.to|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of sustainable development originated from the United Nations Conference on Human Environment in Stockholm (Sweden 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/milestones/humanenvironment|title=UN Conference on the Human Environment .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were two more global activities since then. These were the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development 1987 (Our Common Future Report)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environmentandsociety.org/mml/un-world-commission-environment-and-development-ed-report-world-commission-environment-and|title=UN World Commission on Environment and Development, ed., Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future {{!}} Environment &amp; Society Portal|website=www.environmentandsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 1992 (Rio Earth Summit).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp317-e.htm|title=The Rio Earth Summit: summary of the United Nations conference on Environment and Development (BP-317E)|website=publications.gc.ca|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[UNESCO]], education for sustainable development involves:

{{quote|integrating key sustainable development issues into teaching and learning. This may include, for example, instruction about [[climate change]], [[disaster risk reduction]], [[biodiversity]], and [[poverty reduction]] and [[sustainable consumption]]. It also requires participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviours and take action for sustainable development. ESD consequently promotes competencies like critical thinking, imagining future scenarios and making decisions in a collaborative way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-sustainable-development|title=Education for Sustainable Development|website=UNESCO|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;}}

The aspiration of sustainable development requires us to resolve common problems and tensions and to recognize new horizons. Economic growth and the creation of wealth have reduced global poverty rates, but vulnerability, inequality, exclusion and violence have increased within and across societies throughout the world. Unsustainable patterns of economic production and consumption contribute to global warming, [[environmental degradation]] and an upsurge in natural disasters. Moreover, while international human rights frameworks have been strengthened over the past several decades, the implementation and protection of these norms remain a challenge. For example, despite the progressive empowerment of women through greater access to education, they continue to face discrimination in public life and in employment. Violence against women and children, particularly girls, continues to undermine their rights. Again, while technological development contributes to greater interconnectedness and offers new avenues for exchange, cooperation and solidarity, we also see an increase in cultural and religious intolerance, identity-based political mobilization and conflict.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=9–10, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education must find ways of responding to such challenges, taking into account multiple worldviews and alternative knowledge systems, as well as new frontiers in science and technology such as the advances in neurosciences and the developments in digital technology. Rethinking the purpose of education and the organization of learning has never been more urgent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Background==
Groundwork has been laid for sustainability education worldwide. Recent changes in [[service learning]], a focus on literacies and skills, standards that support interdisciplinary thinking, and the role of [[systems thinking]] have all increased the visibility of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Dernback, J.C. (2002) ''Stumbling toward sustainability.'' Environmental Law Institute. p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; Various approaches to ESD encourage people to understand the complexities of, and synergies between, the issues threatening planetary sustainability and understand and, specifically through EfS, assess their own values and those of the society in which they live in the context of sustainability. ESD seeks to engage people in negotiating a sustainable future, making decisions and acting on them. It is generally agreed on that sustainability education must be customized for individual learners,&lt;ref&gt;Huckle, J. and Sterling, S.R. (2006) ''Education for sustainability.'' Earthscan. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Education for Sustainability (EfS), in particular, focuses not on the environmental, social and economic loci of education but on the human skills that are needed for any environmental education to succeed. These thinking and relational skills are thus fundamental, not just to ESD, but to education in general. &lt;ref&gt; Bedi, G. and Germein, S. (2015)Simply Good Teaching: Supporting Transformation and Change Through Education for Sustainability.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292073996_Simply_Good_Teaching_Supporting_Transformation_and_Change_Through_Education_for_Sustainability] &lt;/ref&gt;  The following skills are seen as integral to Education for Sustainability (EfS):&lt;ref&gt;Tilbury, D. and Wortman, D. (2004). Engaging People in Sustainability. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Envisioning&amp;nbsp;– being able to imagine a better future. The premise is that if we know where we want to go, we will be better able to work out how to get there.
* [[Critical thinking]] and reflection&amp;nbsp;– learning to question our current belief systems and to recognize the assumptions underlying our knowledge, perspective and opinions. Critical thinking skills help people learn to examine economic, environmental, social and cultural structures in the context of sustainable development.
* [[Systems thinking|Systemic thinking]]&amp;nbsp;– acknowledging complexities and looking for links and synergies when trying to find solutions to problems.
* Building partnerships&amp;nbsp;– promoting dialogue and negotiation, learning to work together.
* Participation in decision-making&amp;nbsp;– empowering people.

==United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD)==
In recognition of the importance of ESD, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly declared 2005–2014 the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/index.php?id=961|title=The UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development 2005&amp;nbsp;– 2014|work=UNESCO|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] leads the Decade and has developed an International Implementation Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/index.php?id=990|title=UNESCO Office in Bangkok: International Implementation Scheme|website=Unescobkk.org|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Decade. The goals of the decade are to provide an opportunity for refining and promoting the vision of, and transition to, sustainable development&amp;nbsp;– through all forms of education, public awareness and training; and to give an enhanced profile to the important role of education and learning in sustainable development. Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prescott.edu/learn/phd-sustainability-education/|title=Academics at Prescott College|website=Prescott.edu|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for sustainability is the practice of learning how to achieve global and local sustainable communities.

The objectives of the DESD are to:
* facilitate networking linkages, exchange and interaction among stakeholders in ESD;
* foster increased quality of teaching and learning in ESD;
* help countries make progress towards and attain the Millennium Development Goals through ESD efforts;
* provide countries with new opportunities to incorporate ESD into education reform efforts.
The end of the Decade was marked by the [[UNESCO World Conference on Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD). Made during the conference was the 2014 [[Aichi-Nagoya Declaration on Education for Sustainable Development]], which invites governments ‘to reinforce the integration of ESD into education, training, and sustainable development policies.’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Where UNESCO serves as the lead agency to integrate the principles of sustainable development into all aspects of education to address the economic, social, cultural and environmental problems of the 21st century.

a-The United Nations Program on Education for Sustainable Development aims to
1- cultivate in every human being the knowledge and skills necessary to reach  more sustainable future.
2– Include any child in the world to the educational edifice and provide access to school.
3- Improve the quality of education.
4- Promote the concept of global citizenship.
In the future UNESCO will support its Education for All (EFA) plan and will continue to support its education line with the cooperation of other partner organizations such as UNICEF, the World Bank, the OECD,education international and NGOs.

b-UNESCO's role in education for sustainable development.
1-UNESCO Prize "Education for Sustainable Development".
UNESCO invited governments and non-governmental organizations with official partnerships with UNESCO to nominate 3 individuals, institutions or organizations working in the field of education for sustainable development In order to be part of the UNESCO award, provided that it participates in one or more of the five areas of work of the program of education for sustainable development.Where the value of the prize $150000 is divided among 3 winners.
UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova awarded the UNESCO / Japan Prize for Education for Sustainable Development to SERES from Guatemala and El Salvador, JAYAGIRL from Indonesia and ROOTABILITY from Germany at a ceremony held at UNESCO headquarters in Paris.
This award is the first to be presented since its inception in the field of education for sustainable development. This award is being funded by the Government of Japan.

==UNESCO and climate change education for sustainable development==
Education is a key component of the global response to climate change in relation to UNESCO and its partners in the United Nations. Article 6 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change states that "States should facilitate education programs for awareness on climate change".

Education in climate change for sustainable development aims to improve understanding of the key concepts of sustainability and the blood of these four directions:
:1– Provide basic education because drought, floods, high temperatures and others affect the rates of :attendance of students in basic education.
:2– Redirecting education towards critical thinking that reaches local and global solutions to climate change such as ozone hole.
:3– increase educational awareness in order to rationalize energy consumption.
UNESCO and the United Nations Convention on the Use of Climate Change Education rely not only on schools but also on online courses and More than 14 million students and 2.1 million teachers in 58 countries have been involved in such education.

On the other hand, NGOs as a partner of the government contribute to sustainable development as a real contribution, and have succeeded in building development awareness, stability and employment through a real and effective participation in the development process.  It also has a role in finding a balance between the ecosystem and the economy to conserve natural resources. Organizations are the right arm of governments in the process of sustainable development.

==Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development (GAP on ESD)==
The UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development took place from 2005 to 2014, with the goal of emphasizing education in all its forms (formal, non-formal and informal) as an indispensable element for achieving sustainable development. In November 2014, as the official follow-up to the DESD, UNESCO launched the Global Action Programme (GAP) for ESD with the overall objective to scale up action on ESD worldwide. Two basic and very important objectives of GAP on ESD are:
* Reorienting education and learning so that everyone has the opportunity to acquire the values, skills and knowledge that empower them to contribute to sustainable development; and
* Enhancing the role of education and learning in all relevant agendas, programmes and activities that promote sustainable development.
The GAP focuses on generating and scaling-up action in five Priority Action Areas: 1. Advancing policy; 2. Transforming learning and training environments; 3. Building capacities of educators and trainers; 4. Empowering and mobilizing youth; 5. Accelerating sustainable solutions at local level. Due to its strong linkages with sustainable development, the GAP on ESD provides an excellent framework for understanding the types of education, training and public awareness initiatives conducive to enabling people of all ages to understand and implement solutions for solving the complex problems presented by climate change.&lt;ref name=":06"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002464/246435e.pdf|title=Action for climate empowerment: Guidelines for accelerating solutions through education, training and public|publisher=UNESCO and UNFCCC|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3100-182-6|location=|pages=16–17, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO’s work on [[Climate change education (CCE)|Climate Change Education]] (CCE) within the framework of its GAP on ESD aims to make education a more central and visible part of the international response to climate change; to support countries to integrate CCE into their education and training systems; and to support countries in achieving a smooth transition to green economies and resilient societies through education and training.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

==Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)==
''See main article: [[Sustainable Development Goals]]''
ESD is explicitly recognized in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of Target 4.7 of the SDG on education, together with [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED), which UNESCO promotes as a complementary approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Citizenship Education: Topics and learning objectives |publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=2015|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target 4.7 of the SDGs states:&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002474/247444e.pdf |title= Education for Sustainable Development Goals: Learning Objectives|publisher= UNESCO|location= Paris |year=2017|isbn= 978-92-3-100209-0 |pages=7, 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others,In August 2015, 193 countries agreed on the following 17 goals: [4]
No to poverty. End poverty in all its forms everywhere.
Not for hunger. Ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture.
good health. Ensure healthy living and promote well-being for all ages.
Quality education. Ensure universal and equal quality education and enhance lifelong learning opportunities for all.

With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners, ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs, enabling individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal, economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behaviour. ESD can produce specific cognitive, socio-emotional and behavioural learning outcomes that enable individuals to deal with the particular challenges of each SDG, thus facilitating its achievement. In short, ESD enables all individuals to contribute to achieving the SDGs by equipping them with the knowledge and competencies they need, not only to understand what the SDGs are about, but to engage as informed citizens in bringing about the necessary transformation.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

==U.S. Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development==
The U.S. Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development (USPESD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspartnership.org/view_archive_path/1|title=U.S. Partnership|website=Uspartnership.org|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of individuals, organizations and institutions in the United States dedicated to education for sustainable development (ESD). It acts as a convener, catalyst, and communicator working across all sectors of American society.

The U.S. Partnership was conceived at a November 2003 "Open Space" gathering held in Washington, DC that included almost 100 participants from a diverse range of sectors including K-12 and higher education, science and research organizations, conservation and environmental NGOs, faith communities, living institutions, youth advocacy organizations, government agencies and others.  Convened by the National Council on Science and the Environment and University Leaders for a Sustainable Future, the group met to respond to the call by the UN General Assembly for a Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005 through 2014) and to consider specifically:
# How the Decade could be leveraged to advance education for sustainable development (ESD) in the United States;
# What were the opportunities for collaboration within and across sectors; and
# How could widespread engagement in the Decade by U.S. organizations be facilitated.

A subsequent strategic planning retreat on the campus of Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania gave shape to the emerging Partnership.  Hosted by the International Center for Leadership Results and facilitated by Group Jazz, participants agreed upon the Partnership's Vision&amp;nbsp;– "sustainable development integrated into education and learning in the United States;" and Mission&amp;nbsp;– to "leverage the UN Decade to foster education for sustainable development in the United States". They also conceived of an operating structure for the Partnership, including Action Teams (Marketing, Outreach, Funding, ICT, Youth etc.) and Sector Teams (K-12, Higher Education, Faith Communities, Business, and Communities.), whose volunteer leadership would comprise an Executive Team.  An "Interim Steward" would provide ongoing facilitation and leadership.

Participants decided that the Partnership would not design or implement programs of its own. Rather, it would serve as a clearing house&amp;nbsp;– helping to connect, highlight, and foster collaboration among partners&amp;nbsp;– and serving as a catalyst to convene groups and build community to support existing and emerging initiatives.

The Partnership supports its vision and mission through periodic conference calls, in-person meetings and events, and its website.  Action and Sector Teams remain key operational components of the Partnership, carrying out a range of activities in support of its mission and vision. Action Teams are responsible for planning and carrying out joint activities that support the entire partnership (e.g. Funding, ICT, Marketing). Sector Teams focus on the needs of their own sector (e.g. Higher Ed., K-12, Faith Communities). The Sector Teams have compiled ESD tools and resources and worked together to advance ESD through initiatives held "in collaboration with the U.S. Partnership". The Disciplinary Associations Network for Sustainability and the Higher Education Associations Sustainability Consortium are networks of national higher education associations integrating information about our urgent sustainability challenges and solutions into education. The Decade and the U.S. Partnership provide international and national context for such efforts, helping to promote and strengthen education for sustainable development in the United States.Education and sustainable development are two sides of a single coin.
Their human goal is to build human beings and develop their capacities to achieve sustainable development in an efficient and equitable manner in which life choices are available to people.
Therefore, education is the heart of development and its solidity and that the success of development in any society depends very much on the success of the educational system in this society.
Education is therefore the key to progress, the instrument of renaissance and the source of strength in societies.Therefore, there is a close relationship between education and sustainable development so that development can not achieve any step unless qualified manpower is available and therefore the process of education is the basis of the process of sustainable development.
Hence, the learning process is closely related to sustainable development, namely, investment in human beings and human beings. This has led to a radical shift in educational development thinking, which focuses on the development of human capacities and the importance of education as the focus of real development and human capacity development.
Where Chinese wisdom says: If you want to invest for one year and the wheat flour and if you want to invest for ten years tree sap and if you want to invest life and flourish in people.
Therefore, education is the one that pushed man to the heart of the development process and the slogan of no development without human beings and therefore the comprehensive sustainable development is no longer dependent on physical capital onlyBut the most important need is the presence of a trained and qualified workforce capable of producing more and more.

==Sustainable development in Canada==
Sustainable Development Strategy for organizations in Canada is about the Government of Canada finding ways to develop social, financial, and environmental resources that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs in Canada. A Sustainable Development Strategy for the organization needs to be developed that establishes the Sustainable Development goals and objectives set by the Auditor General Act of Canada and provides the written policies and procedures to achieve them. Sustainable Development is based on responsible decision-making, which considers not only the economic benefits of development, but also the short-term and long-term, Canadian environment and environmental impacts.

== Sustainability education by private industry  ==
The private sector plays an increasingly important role in environmental and sustainability education. In recent years, as the seriousness of problems such as climate change and hazards to the environment have received more emphasis, corporate environmental responsibility (CER) and sustainability education has been discussed more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Eunjeong|last2=Jang|first2=Shinho|date=2017-07-30|title=How can Corporations Contribute to the Community through Environmental Education? : Focusing on Partnerships between Corporations and Universities in Korea|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ies/article/view/58454|journal=International Education Studies|language=en|volume=10|issue=8|pages=116|doi=10.5539/ies.v10n8p116|issn=1913-9039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to recent survey research conducted by GreenBiz in partnership with National Environmental Education Foundation (NEEF) and PwC, 73% of respondents indicated that their company is educating employees across the organization about its corporate sustainability goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.neefusa.org/employee-engagement|title=Employee Engagement|work=NEEF|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies are anticipating that the value of Environment &amp; Sustainability education (E&amp;S) knowledge will increase and many are already providing some education to their employees. Nearly half of respondents to the GreenBiz survey whose companies have no current program believe their company will begin educating employees in the next two years.&lt;ref name="NEEF"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.neefusa.org/resource/engaged-organization-corporate-employee-environmental-education-survey-and-case-study|title=The Engaged Organization: Corporate Employee Environmental Education Survey and Case Study Findings|work=NEEF|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of organizational models for employee environment and sustainability education programs. For example, Cisco employees live and work in a Web 2.0 world and are comfortable collaborating online while Wal-Mart  finds a person-to-person approach the most effective.&lt;ref name="NEEF"/&gt;

Some companies aim to raise environmental literacy among their employees so they can contribute to environmental improvements both at work and in the community. Other companies, seek to leverage employees’ knowledge and expertise to transform the company and its products and services to meet a sustainability vision. Organizations use a varied, creative set of methods to reach and influence employees including multi-departmental leadership, employee-led “green” teams, awards, online training, mixed-media communications and performance incentives Several companies also with external partners including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to create successful E&amp;S education programs.&lt;ref name="NEEF"/&gt;

Through its Business Sustainability Educational Roundtable, NEEF engaged leading companies, including Kimberly-Clark, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Intel and others, to share and develop best practices on employee engagement &lt;nowiki&gt;http://64.130.52.13/business/member_resources.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;. A number of other reports have been published by the NEEF detailing the benefits of sustainability education in corporations and provide some examples and case studies of how corporations embed sustainability education into their operations.&lt;ref name="NEEF"/&gt;

==Sustainable development and education in Uganda==
From a political point of view you can say that the idea of sustainability comes from two different trends developed after the Second World War, which can be related to when colonial powers ended their occupation. Within the first trend, it was noticed that the former colonies suffered from social and economical problems like poverty and lack of food.  The United Nations therefore arranged several conferences where solutions to these problems were outlined. Several international organs were established, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WBG). The second trend stars out from the alarming reports that began to appear during the 1960s, which warned for humans’ way of using nature resources. The resources would come to an end because of the future economical growth and increase in population. A first attempt to discuss these trends could be seen during the United nations Conference on the Environment in Stockholm 1972. As a result, [[United Nations]] development Program (UNDP) was founded.

The first conference concerning environmental education (EE) was held in [[Tbilisi]] in 1977 and it resulted in the Tbilisi declaration. The document focuses on EE and maintains among others that it should be interdisciplinary, be  a  lifelong  process and develop critical thinking and problem&amp;nbsp;– solving skills. The declaration has had a large effect on curriculums, for example in  the Uganda strategy to implementing education for sustainable development The term SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT got an international breakthrough in 1987 with the Bruntland Commissions final report. Our Common Future. The definition of sustainable development was stated in this report and it is still ubiquitous.“Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”
Sustainable development is about a global responsibility and solidarity between generations, between women and men and between different cultures and countries. It is about safeguarding and efficient use of existing nature resources. Investment in management of human, social and physiological resources is also crucial parts of sustainable development. Democratic values permeate the society and the citizens feel that they can influence the development, and that they have the will of taking that responsibility for doing so.

The principles underlying sustainable  can be separated into a social, economic, and ecological dimension. The economic growth is used to be seen as a requirement for development. No country can achieve a sustainable economic growth if the environment is worsened, if the prosperity is not fairly distributed and if growth of the human resources has not taken place. Therefore, the economical dimension means that economical growth shall carry on with: first, respect taken to the environment, second, growth of the people’s health and education and third, a fair distribution of prosperity. The social dimension points out the importance resources, power and influence are fairly distributed and that people can feel security and can participate. The social dimension is therefore a requirement for economic growth. The environment dimension means that considerations are taken for the social and economical development. These three dimensions are integrated with each other as they are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The implication of this is that sustainable development to a large extent is about politics
In 1992 a UN conference, also known as Earth Summit, was held in Rio de Janeiro. The most famous agreement from that meeting is the Agenda 21, a plan of action for sustainable development. Two major differences from earlier conferences were:
*(a) the large number of participating voluntary organizations and
*(b) the emphasis of the plan of action of the regional, national and local cooperation to reach a sustainable development. Chapter 36 in Agenda 21 brings up educational issues and it emphasizes the importance of orienting the education to achieve sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwf.org|title=WWF&amp;nbsp;– Find your local WWF office|website=Wwf.org|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is critical for promoting sustainable development and improving the capacity of the people to address environment and development issues. Both formal and non-formal education are indispensable to changing people’s attitudes so that they have the capacity to assess and address their sustainable development concerns. It is also critical for achieving environmental and ethical awareness, values and attitudes, skills and behavior consistent with sustainable development and for effective public participation in decision making.
In the year 2000 the United Nations Millennium Declaration was adopted, which emphasizes that a global development demands a comprehensive view. The declaration formed the basis of time&amp;nbsp;–bound and measurable goals for development. It contained eight goals that should promote a global development. Among them were goals for reduction of poverty, reduction of infant mortality, reduction of the HIV/AIDS, malaria spreading and a sustainable development until 2015.

==Education for Sustainable Development in Germany==
Within the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development the field of ESD in Germany has expanded a lot. There are broad school-networks and strong relationships between schools and out-of-school-education. Nevertheless, estimations{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} say that the concept only has reached about 10% of the schools and many individual teachers all over the country. ESD and Global Education&amp;nbsp;– which in the past were two different concepts&amp;nbsp;– now work under the same headline. Global Education (in Germany "Global Learning") is a special entry to ESD which emphasises the relationships between north and south in a globalized world and discusses injustices between the different parts of the world, partly with reference to the postcolonial discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb05/fileadmin/datas/fb05/FG_Politikwissenschaften/FG_DidaktikderpolitischenBildung/Overwien_CORR-1-Christoforatou_01.pdf|format=PDF|author=Overwien, Bernd|title=Education for Sustainable Development and Global Learning&amp;nbsp;– References to Teaching Right Livelihood.

==Climate-friendly schools==
{{Main|Climate-friendly school}}
A climate-friendly school is a school that uses education for sustainable development (ESD) to promote a culture of sustainability in which students, staff and families hold shared values and beliefs about the importance of taking action for a more sustainable society. Taking care of the environment and contributing to reducing [[climate change]] is an integral part of this. [[Climate action]] means different things to different schools. Some schools see climate action as key to “doing their part” to take care of the planet. For other schools, it is about addressing issues directly affecting them.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002467/246740e.pdf|title=Getting Climate-Ready: A Guide for Schools on Climate Action|last=Gibb|first=Natalie|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100193-2|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The connection of ESD and TVET==
{{Main|TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)}}
TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) is education and training which provides knowledge and skills for employment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=What+is+TVET|title=What is TVET?|website=Unevoc.unesco.org|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVET is recognised to be a crucial vehicle for [[social equity]], inclusion and sustainabile development.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|location=|pages=9, 23, 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TVET systems are progressively expected to provide education for sustainability as part of their core curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curriculum.edu.au/leader/environmental_education_for_a_sustainable_future:_,4695.html|title=Environmental Education for a sustainable future: formal schooling|first=|last=Woods|date=1 January 2003|website=Curriculum.edu.au|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; TVET prepares people for work in a range of sectors, e.g construction, waste management and agriculture, industries that consume enormous amounts of energy, raw materials and water.  Sustainability requires that those working in these sectors have the requisite technical knowledge to make these industries more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=2012|title=Shanghai Consensus.

TVET systems often have a regional or international variations along with language skills needed for labour mobility. TVET systems are able to provide education for sustainable development and global citizenship, and for meeting the demand for an integrated approach to skill types and diverse fields of study.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==The connection of ESD and Global Citizenship Education (GCED)==
{{Main|Global citizenship education|l1=Global Citizenship Education}}
GCED and ESD pursue the same vision: It is all about empowering learners of all ages to become proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive and sustainable world. Both GCED and ESD:
* focus not only on the content and outcome of what is learned, but also on the process of how it is learned and in what type of environment it is learned.
* emphasize action, change and transformation.
* place importance on acquiring values and attitudes relevant to addressing global challenges.

==The connection of ESD and Climate Change Education (CCE)==
{{Main|Climate change education (CCE)|l1=Climate Change Education (CCE)}}
Climate Change Education (CCE) is grounded in the holistic approach of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which incorporates key sustainable development issues such as climate change, [[disaster risk reduction]] and others into education, in a way that addresses the interdependence of environmental sustainability, economic viability and social justice. It promotes participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233083e.pdf|title=Not Just Hot Air: Putting Climate Change Education into Practice|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100101-7|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrating ESD in curricula and textbooks==
ESD concerns the core of teaching and learning and should not be considered as an add-on to the existing curriculum. Mainstreaming ESD requires integrating sustainability topics into the curricula, but also sustainability-related intended learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Curricula need to ensure that all children and young people learn not just foundation skills, but also transferable skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, advocacy and con ict resolution, to help them become responsible global citizens” (UNESCO, 2014c: 36). From the development of sustainability curricula it is expected to “improve the capacity of our education systems to prepare people to pursue sustainable development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=2012|title=The future we want.

===Examples===
====Mauritius&amp;nbsp;– National Curriculum Framework====
The Maurice Ile Durable policy was introduced in 2008 with the objective of making [[Mauritius]] a world model of sustainable development by 2020. Education is one of its five pillars, with a multi-stakeholder working group put in place to integrate ESD into all levels of education. The goal is to reorient the education system towards sustainability, build capacity at all levels and strengthen awareness of key issues. As Mauritius reports, ESD is now ‘part of the National Curriculum Framework and because of the Maurice Ile Durable societal project, ESD is being addressed by many formal and nonformal institutions/organizations’.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

====Togo&amp;nbsp;– Quality Education for a Sustainable Future====
In [[Togo]], the educational policy framework (Lakalaka) is grounded in national culture and includes a new, ESD-oriented curriculum entitled Quality Education for a Sustainable Future.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

====Finland&amp;nbsp;– Reforming the national core curricula for pre-school and basic education====
[[Finland]] is reforming the national core curricula for pre-school and basic education to support and promote sustainable development and well-being following the value basis of education, where the necessity of a sustainable way of living and eco-social understanding is emphasized. The aim is to support all students in developing the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes that promote their ability to understand the importance of a sustainable future.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

====Manitoba, Canada&amp;nbsp;– Profile of successful leadership====
In [[Manitoba]], ESD is a priority action area of the government and has been embedded in the overall purpose of primary and secondary education. It is now government policy ‘to ensure that all Manitoba’s children and youth have access to an array of educational opportunities such that every learner experiences success through relevant, engaging and high quality education that prepares them for [[lifelong learning]] and citizenship in a democratic, socially just and sustainable society’. This statement is included in the mission of the provincial Ministry of Education and Advanced Learning. In response to this policy commitment, ESD has been integrated into the curriculum from kindergarten up to 12th grade with specific learning outcomes identified in science, social studies, health and physical education. Building the capacity of educators and school leaders, as well as dedicated funding to ensure the development of sustainability practices, principles, programmes and partnerships, helps schools to embed sustainability into their classrooms, operations and management.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, beginning on [[Easter]] Weekend, on 6 April 1744. It culminated in a 'spiritual awakening'
in which he received a revelation that he was appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ to write ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' to reform [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;See Swedenborg, E. [http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/ ''The Heavenly Doctrine'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit [[heaven]] and [[hell]] to converse with angels, demons and other spirits and the [[Last Judgment]] had already occurred the year before, in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/LJ.html Swedenborg, E. ''The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed. All the Predictions in the Apocalypse are at This Day Fulfilled.'' (Swedenborg Foundation 1952, Paragraphs 1–74)] Retrieved 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works—and several more that were unpublished. He termed himself a "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ" in ''True Christian Religion'',&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html |title=The True Christian Religion, Containing the Universal Theology of The New Church Foretold by the Lord in Daniel 7; 13, 14; and in Revelation 21; 1, 2, by Emanuel Swedenborg |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he published himself.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html |title=Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation? |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some followers of ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' believe that of his theological works, only those that were published by Swedenborg himself are fully [[divine revelation|divinely inspired]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html "Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?"]&lt;/ref&gt;   Others have regarded all Swedenborg's theological works as equally inspired, saying for example that the fact that some works were "not written out in a final edited form for publication does not make a single statement less trustworthy than the statements in any of the other works." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odhner |first1=Carl Theophilus |title="Diary" and the Spiritual Body |journal=New Church Life |date=1912 |page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Church of the New Jerusalem is a branch of Christianity that reveres Swedenborg's writings as Divinely inspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/508967814|title=Reasons for separating from the old church. : In answer to a letter received from certain persons in Manchester, who profess to believe in the heavenly doctrines of the New Jerusalem Church, as contained in the theological writings of the Late Hon.

== Early life ==
[[File:Hornsgatan 43 Emanuel Swedenborg Stockholm 2005-06-17 013.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque at the former location of Swedenborg's house at Hornsgatan on [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]].]]

Swedenborg's father, [[Jesper Swedberg]] (1653–1735), descended from a wealthy mining family. The first known paternal ancestor was Otte Persson from Sundborn parish, mentioned 1571.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/att/swedenborg/|title=Riddarhuset - Ätte- och vapendatabas - Swedenborg|last=|first=|date=2017-06-04|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He travelled abroad and studied theology, and on returning home, he was eloquent enough to impress the Swedish king, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], with his sermons in [[Stockholm]]. Through the king's influence, he would later become professor of theology at [[Uppsala University]] and Bishop of [[Skara]].&lt;ref name="Ugglan"&gt;{{sv icon}} [[Nordisk familjebok]], 2nd edition (Ugglan) ''[http://runeberg.org/nfcg/0486.html article Svedberg, Jesper]'' (1918)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|first=Alexander James |last=Grieve|wstitle=Swedenborg, Emanuel |volume=26 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesper took an interest in the beliefs of the dissenting Lutheran [[Pietism|Pietist]] movement, which emphasised the virtues of communion with [[God]] rather than relying on sheer faith (''[[sola fide]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Svedberg's pietistic interests are described in Bergquist (1999), pp. 230–232.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sola fide'' is a tenet of the [[Lutheran Church]], and Jesper was charged with being a [[pietist]] [[heresy|heretic]]. While controversial, the beliefs were to have a major impact on his son Emanuel's spirituality. Jesper furthermore held the unconventional belief that [[angels]] and [[spirit]]s were present in everyday life. This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel.&lt;ref name="Ugglan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lamm (1978 [1915]; pp.1–19) notes how all Swedenborg biographies at that draw similarities between the beliefs of Jesper and Emanuel. Lamm himself partially agrees with them, but he maintains that there were marked differences between them too.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1703–1709, Swedenborg lived in [[Erik Benzelius the Younger]]'s house. Swedenborg completed his university course at [[Uppsala]] in 1709, and in 1710, he made his [[grand tour]] through the Netherlands, France and Germany before reaching London, where he would spend the next four years. It was also a flourishing center of scientific ideas and discoveries. Swedenborg studied [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[philosophy]] and read and wrote [[poetry]]. According to the preface of a book by the Swedish critic [[Olof Lagercrantz]], Swedenborg wrote to his benefactor and brother-in-law Benzelius that he believed that Swedenborg might be destined to be a great scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, preface.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Delblanc&gt;x&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific period ==
[[File:Swdbg2.jpg|frame|The Flying Machine, sketched in his notebook from 1714. The operator would sit in the middle and paddle himself through the air.&lt;ref&gt;Söderberg, H. ''Swedenborg's 1714 Airplane: A Machine to Fly in the Air'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;32, or on the video clip at 5:48 on its timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-k6HRf0E0g |title = Splendors of the Spirit: Swedenborg's Quest for Insight, Part 1 |publisher = YouTube |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1715 Swedenborg returned to Sweden, where he devoted himself to natural science and engineering projects for the next two decades. A first step was his meeting with King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] in the city of [[Lund]], in 1716. The Swedish inventor [[Christopher Polhem]], who became a close friend of Swedenborg, was also present. Swedenborg's purpose was to persuade the king to fund an [[observatory]] in northern Sweden. However, the warlike king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint Swedenborg to be assessor-extraordinary on the [[Swedish Board of Mines]] (''Bergskollegium'') in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;The meeting between the King, Polhelm and Swedenborg is described in detail in Liljegren, Bengt, ''Karl XII i Lund : när Sverige styrdes från Skåne'', (Historiska media, Lund, 1999). {{ISBN|91-88930-51-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1716 to 1718, Swedenborg published a scientific periodical entitled ''Daedalus Hyperboreus'' (''"The Northern [[Daedalus]]"''), a record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. One notable description was that of a flying machine, the same he had been sketching a few years earlier (see [[Flying Machine (Swedenborg)]]).&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt;

In 1718, Swedenborg published an article that attempted to explain spiritual and mental events in terms of minute vibrations, or "tremulations".

Upon the death of Charles XII, [[Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden|Queen Ulrika Eleonora]] ennobled Swedenborg and his siblings. It was common in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries for the children of [[bishops]] to receive that honour, as a recognition of the services of their father. The family name was changed from Swedberg to Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp.114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1724, he was offered the chair of [[mathematics]] at [[Uppsala University]], but he declined and said that he had dealt mainly with [[geometry]], [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]] during his career. He also said that he did not have the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, as recognized by many of his acquaintances; it forced him to speak slowly and carefully, and there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public.&lt;ref&gt;Berquist (1999), pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish critic Olof Lagerkrantz proposed that Swedenborg compensated for his impediment by extensive argumentation in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Proposed by Lagercrantz, also mentioned by Bergquist (1999), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New direction of studies ahead of his time ==
During the 1730s, Swedenborg undertook many studies of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. He had the first known anticipation of the [[neuron]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;Fodstad, H. The neuron theory ''Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery'' 2001;77:20-4&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until a century later that science recognized the full significance of the nerve cell. He also had prescient ideas about the [[cerebral cortex]], the hierarchical organization of the [[nervous system]], the localization of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], the functions of the [[pituitary gland]], the perivascular spaces, the [[foramen of Magendie]], the idea of [[somatotopic arrangement|somatotopic organization]], and the association of frontal brain regions with the intellect. In some cases, his conclusions have been experimentally verified in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Gordh, E. ''et al.''Swedenborg, Linnaeus and Brain Research and the Roles of Gustaf Retzius and Alfred Stroh in the Rediscovery of Swedenborg's Manuscripts.

''Handbook Clinical Neurology'' 2010;95:557-70&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1730s, Swedenborg became increasingly interested in spiritual matters and was determined to find a theory to explain how matter relates to spirit. Swedenborg's desire to understand the order and the purpose of creation first led him to investigate the structure of matter and the process of creation itself. In the ''[[The Principia (book)|Principia]]'', he outlined his philosophical method, which incorporated experience, geometry (the means by which the inner order of the world can be known) and the power of reason. He also outlined his cosmology, which included the first presentation of his [[nebular hypothesis]]. (There is evidence that Swedenborg may have preceded Kant by as much as 20 years in the development of that hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newchurchhistory.org/articles/glb2007/baker.pdf Baker, Gregory L. (1983) "Emanuel Swedenborg – An 18th century cosmologist" in ''The Physics Teacher'', October 1983, pp. 441–6] Retrieved 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1735, in [[Leipzig]], he published a three-volume work, ''Opera philosophica et mineralis'' (''"Philosophical and mineralogical works''") in which he tried to conjoin philosophy and [[metallurgy]]. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on the analysis of the [[smelting]] of iron and copper, and it was the work that gave Swedenborg his international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 142–155.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he also published the small manuscript ''de Infinito'' ("On the Infinite") in which he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite and how the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the body. It was the first manuscript in which he touched upon such matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies since he presented the view that the soul is based on material substances.&lt;ref&gt;Lamm (1987), pp. 42–43, notes that by assuming that the soul consists of matter, as Swedenborg did, one becomes a [[materialist]]. He further notes that it was also noted by contemporaries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time such as [[John Locke]], [[Christian von Wolff]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and [[Descartes]] and earlier thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 165–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1743, at the age of 55, Swedenborg requested a leave of absence to go abroad. His purpose was to gather source material for ''Regnum animale'' (''The Animal Kingdom'', or ''Kingdom of Life''), a subject on which books were not readily available in Sweden. The aim of the book was to explain the soul from an anatomical point of view. He had planned to produce a total of 17 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc and Lönnroth, p.325.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Journal of Dreams'' ==
By 1744, Swedenborg had travelled to the Netherlands. Around the time, he began having strange dreams. Swedenborg carried a travel journal with him on most of his travels and did so on this journey. The whereabouts of the diary were long unknown, but it was discovered in the [[Royal Library of Sweden|Royal Library]] in the 1850s and was published in 1859 as ''Drömboken'', or ''Journal of Dreams''.

Swedenborg experienced many different dreams and visions, some greatly pleasurable, others highly disturbing.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, pp. 200–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiences continued as he traveled to London to progress the publication of ''Regnum animale''. This process, which one biographer has proposed as cathartic and comparable to the [[Catholic]] concept of [[Purgatory]],&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; continued for six months. He also proposed that what Swedenborg was recording in his ''Journal of Dreams'' was a battle between the love of himself and the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis by Bergquist, p. 209. Bergquist has previously published a separate book commenting on the Journal called ''Swedenborgs drömbok : glädjen och det stora kvalet'' (Stockholm, Norstedt, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visions and spiritual insights ===
In the last entry of the journal from 26–27 October 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt that he should drop his current project and write a new book about the worship of God. He soon began working on ''De cultu et amore Dei'', or ''The Worship and Love of God''. It was never fully completed, but Swedenborg still had it published in London in June 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745, Swedenborg was dining in a private room at a tavern in London. By the end of the meal, a darkness fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly, he saw a person sitting at a corner of the room, telling him: "Do not eat too much!". Swedenborg, scared, hurried home. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. The man told Swedenborg that he was the Lord, that he had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible and that he would guide Swedenborg in what to write. The same night, the spiritual world was opened to Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Small Theological Works and Letters" by Emanuel Swedenborg. Edited and published by the Swedenborg Society (London, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1747, Swedenborg resigned his post as assessor of the board of mines. He explained that he was obliged to complete a work that he had begun and requested to receive half his salary as a pension.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt; He took up afresh his study of [[Hebrew]] and began to work on the spiritual interpretation of the Bible with the goal of interpreting the spiritual meaning of every verse. From sometime between 1746 and 1747 and for ten years henceforth, he devoted his energy to the task. Usually abbreviated as ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' or under the [[Latin]] variant ''Arcana Caelestia''&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Stephen McNeilly (London: Swedenborg Society, 2002), p. 1. Accessed 2010-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; (translated as ''Heavenly Arcana'', ''Heavenly Mysteries'', or ''Secrets of Heaven'' depending on modern English-language editions), the book became his ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the basis of his further theological works.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was anonymous, and Swedenborg was not identified as the author until the late 1750s. It had eight volumes, published between 1749 and 1756. It attracted little attention, as few people could penetrate its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge. ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

His life from 1747 to his death was spent in Stockholm, the Netherlands and [[London]]. During the 25 years, he wrote another 14 works of a spiritual nature; most were published during his lifetime.

One of Swedenborg's lesser-known works presents a startling claim: that the Last Judgment had begun in the previous year (1757) and was completed by the end of that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/LJ.html ''The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed. All the Predictions in the Apocalypse are At this Day Fulfilled from Things Heard and Seen''. From 'De Ultimo Judicio Et De Babylonia Destructa'']&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had witnessed it.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Judgment'', #60.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', the Last Judgment took place not in the physical world but in the World of Spirits, halfway between heaven and hell, through which all pass on their way to heaven or hell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html Swedenborg, E. ''Heaven and Its Wonders From Things Heard and Seen''] (Swedenborg Foundation 1946, #421–535).&lt;/ref&gt; The Judgment took place because the Christian church had lost its charity and faith, resulting in a loss of spiritual free will that threatened the equilibrium between heaven and hell in everyone's life.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Judgment'' #33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For an extensive explanation of the inner spiritual sense of the book of the ''Apocalypse'', see Swedenborg, E. ''The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1928).}}

''The Heavenly Doctrine'' also teaches that the Last Judgement was followed by the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]], which occurred not by Christ in person but by a revelation from him through the inner, spiritual sense of the Word&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html |title = Swedenborg, E. ''The True Christian Religion: Containing the Universal Theology of The New Church Foretold by the Lord in Daniel 7; 13, 14; and in Revelation 21;1,2'' (Swedenborg Foundation 1952, paragraphs 193–215) |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;''True Christian Religion'', paragraphs 753–786&lt;/ref&gt;

In another of his theological works, Swedenborg wrote that eating meat, regarded in itself, "is something profane" and was not practiced in the early days of the human race. However, he said, it now is a matter of conscience, and no one is condemned for doing it.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ac&amp;section=1002 ''Arcana Coelestia'' #1002, 1003] (Swedenborg Foundation, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the early-days ideal appears to have given rise to the idea that Swedenborg was a [[vegetarian]]. That conclusion may have been reinforced by the fact that a number of Swedenborg's early followers were part of the vegetarian movement that arose in Britain in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/bible-christian.html|title=The vegetarian movement in England, 1847–1981: A study in the structure of its ideology |last=Twigg |first=Julia |publisher=University of London |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only reports on Swedenborg himself are contradictory. His landlord in London, Shearsmith, said he ate no meat, but his maid, who served Swedenborg, said that he ate eels and [[pigeon pie]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, C. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epictc.htm ''The Swedenborg Epic: The life and works of Emanuel Swedenborg''] Bookman Associates, 1952, p. 476, # 642).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Earths in the Universe'', it is stated that he conversed with spirits from [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Saturn]], [[Venus]] and the [[Moon]] as well as spirits from planets beyond the [[solar system]].&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E.[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/EU.html ''The Earths in Our Solar System Which are called Planets and the Earths in the Starry Heaven, and Their Inhabitants; Also the Spirits and Angels There From Things Heard and Seen''] 1758. Also Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 9-178.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 'encounters', he concluded that the planets of our solar system are inhabited and that such an enormous undertaking as the universe could not have been created for just one race on a planet or one 'Heaven' derived from its properties per planet. Many Heavenly societies were also needed to increase the perfection of the angelic Heavens and Heaven to fill in deficiencies and gaps in other societies. He argued: "What would this be to God, Who is infinite, and to whom a thousand or tens of thousands of planets, and all of them full of inhabitants, would be scarcely anything!"&lt;ref&gt;''Arcana Coelestia'' #6698&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg and the question of life on other planets has been extensively reviewed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Simons K. [http://swedenborgproject.org/2007/09/08/the-life-on-other-planets-question/ The Life on Other Planets Question] The Swedenborg Project 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg published his work in London or the Netherlands because of their freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 477–478.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, G. ''Swedenborg, Life and Teaching'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1976, p. 272).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Swedenborg's grave.jpg|right|thumb|Swedenborg's crypt in [[Uppsala Cathedral]].]]
In July 1770, at the age of 82, he traveled to [[Amsterdam]] to complete the publication of his last work. The book, ''Vera Christiana Religio'' (''The True Christian Religion''), was published there in 1771 and was one of the most appreciated of his works. Designed to explain his teachings to [[Lutherans]], it is the most concrete of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In the summer of 1771, he traveled to London. Shortly before [[Christmas]], he suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed and confined to bed. His health improved somewhat, but he died in 1772. There are several accounts of his last months, made by those with whom he stayed and by Arvid Ferelius, a pastor of the Swedish Church in London, who visited him several times.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 471–476. Accounts of Swedenborg's last days were collected and published in Tafel II:1, pp. 577 ff, 556 ff, 560 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that Swedenborg wrote a letter to [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], in February. Swedenborg said that he had been told in the world of spirits that Wesley wanted to speak with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5plNwQ4xyfwC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=john+wesley+swedenborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tv48ELMH0Y&amp;sig=xsFqXKc2uEibBH5YjydRkhEJmvM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K0OgTbjLM5TUgQfBsd3lBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20wesley%20swedenborg&amp;f=false |title = Documents concerning the life and character of Emanuel Swedenborg – Johann Friedrich Immanuel Tafel – Google Books |publisher = Books.google.com |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley, startled since he had not told anyone of his interest in Swedenborg, replied that he was going on a journey for six months and would contact Swedenborg on his return. Swedenborg replied that that would be too late since Swedenborg would be going to the spiritual world for the last time on March 29.&lt;ref&gt;''Epic'', pp. 430ff.&lt;/ref&gt; (Wesley later read and commented extensively on Swedenborg's work.)&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. ''True Christianity, Containing a Comprehensive Theology of the New Church That Was Predicted by the Lord in Daniel 7:13–14 and Revelation 21:1, 2'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 2006, Translator's Preface, Vol. 2, p. 36 ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg's landlord's servant girl, Elizabeth Reynolds, also said that Swedenborg had predicted the date and that he was as happy about it as if he was "going on holiday or to some merrymaking":&lt;ref&gt;''Epic'', p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|In Swedenborg's final hours, his friend, Pastor Ferelius, told him some people thought he had written his theology just to make a name for himself and asked Swedenborg if he would like to recant.  Raising himself up on his bed, his hand on his heart, Swedenborg earnestly replied,

"As truly as you see me before your eyes, so true is everything that I have written; and I could have said more had it been permitted. When you enter eternity you will see everything, and then you and I shall have much to talk about".&lt;ref name="Epic 433"&gt;''Epic'', p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

He then died, in the afternoon, on the date he had predicted, March 29.&lt;ref name="Epic 433"/&gt; |}}
[[File:Swedenborg House London.jpg|thumb|Swedenborg House, London]]

He was buried in the [[Nordic churches in London#Swedish Church|Swedish Church]] in Princes Square in [[Shadwell]], London. On the 140th anniversary of his death, in 1912/1913, his remains were transferred to [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in Sweden, where they now rest close to the grave of the [[botanist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]]. In 1917, the [[Swedish Church]] in Shadwell was demolished, and the Swedish community that had grown around the parish moved to [[Marylebone]]. In 1938, Princes Square was redeveloped, and in his honour the local road was renamed Swedenborg Gardens. In 1997, a garden, play area and memorial, near the road, were created in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ukstreetmap.info/map-london-swedenborg-gardens-street.html |title = Street map Swedenborg Gardens, map London with Swedenborg Gardens |publisher=Ukstreetmap.info |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ewan-M Ewan Munro+ Add Contact |url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/55935853@N00/3111893982/ |title = Swedenborg Gardens, London Borough of Tower Hamlets, E1 - Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastlondonhistory.com/2011/06/16/history-of-swedenborg-gardens/|title=History of Swedenborg Gardens - eastlondonhistory.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veracity ==
Swedenborg's transition from scientist to revelator or mystic has fascinated many people ever since it had occurred.

Swedenborg has had a variety of both supporting and critical biographers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html "Who Was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)?"] An article including a list of biographies about Swedenborg, with a brief analysis of each biographer's point of view. Accessed June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some propose that he did not have a revelation at all but developed his theological ideas from sources that ranged from his father to earlier figures in the history of thought, notably [[Plotinus]]. That position was first and most notably taken by the Swedish writer Martin Lamm, who wrote a biography of Swedenborg in 1915 that is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The citation "Bergquist (1999)", which is used here repeatedly, appears to contain mislabelled quotes. See the "Talk" section of this page, under the heading "Bergquist footnote problem".}} [[Olof Lagercrantz]], the Swedish critic and publicist, had a similar point of view, calling Swedenborg's theological writing "a poem about a foreign country with peculiar laws and customs".&lt;ref&gt;''en dikt om ett främmande land med sällsamma lagar och seder''. Largercrantz (1996), backpage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg's approach to demonstrating the veracity of his theological teachings was to find and use voluminous quotations from the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] to demonstrate agreement between the Bible and his theological teachings. His demonstration of the agreement is found throughout his theological writings since he rejected blind faith and declared true faith to be an internal acknowledgement of the truth.

The vast and consistent use of Biblical confirmations in Swedenborg's theological writings led a Swedish Royal Council in 1771 to examine the heresy charges of 1770 against two Swedish supporters of his theological writings: "there is much that is true and useful in Swedenborg's writings".&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt (1952), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Hugo]], in Chapter 14 of ''[[Les misérables]]'', felt that Swedenborg had "lapsed into madness".

==Scientific beliefs==
Swedenborg proposed many scientific ideas during his lifetime. In his youth, he wanted to present a new idea every day, as he wrote to his brother-in-law [[Erik Benzelius the Younger|Erik Benzelius]] in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1745, when he considered himself to have entered a spiritual state, he tended to phrase his "experiences" in [[empirical]] terms, to report accurately things he had experienced on his spiritual journeys.

One of his ideas that is considered most crucial for the understanding of his theology is his notion of [[correspondence (theology)|correspondences]]. But, in fact, he first presented the theory of correspondences only in 1744, in the first volume of ''Regnum Animale'' dealing with the human soul.&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt;

The basis of the correspondence theory is that there is a relationship among the natural ("physical"), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory can be traced to [[Neoplatonism]] and the philosopher [[Plotinus]] in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning.&lt;ref name=Korr&gt;Lamm (1987 [1915]), dedicates a chapter to the correspondence theories, pp. 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.&lt;ref&gt;(Swedenborg E, ''The True Christian Religion Containing the Universal Theology of the New Church.'' Swedenborg Foundation 1946, # 200)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophetic accounts==
Four incidents of purported psychic ability of Swedenborg exist in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several versions of each story.

=== Fire anecdotes ===
On Thursday, 19 July 1759 a great and well-documented fire broke out in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.{{efn|The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp. 312–313 and in Chapter 31 of ''The Swedenborg Epic''. The primary source for these accounts is a letter from [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1768 and the Swedenborg collection by Tafel (see [[#Further reading|Further reading]]).}}&lt;ref name="brandhistoriska.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brandhistoriska.org/olyckor_se.html |title = Årtal och händelser i Jönköping |publisher = Brandhistoriska.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staffan Högberg, ''Stockholms historia'' (Stockholm's history), part 1, p. 342; in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D-IYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR18&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;dq=%22documents+concerning+swedenborg%22+tafel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qu-XD4a3Ry&amp;sig=57fzfakBqB4wjrNlLqYXAZYycjo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LLi-SfEuhtYwnN_Qqgg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPR3,M1 For July 19 date see especially Documents 271–273 in ''Documents concerning the Life and Character of Emanuel Swedenborg Collected, Translated and Annotated by Tafel, RL.'' Volume II, Part 1. (Swedenborg Society, British and Foreign. 36 Bloomsbury Street, London, 1877)] Retrieved 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the high and increasing wind it spread very fast, consuming about 300 houses and making 2000 people homeless.&lt;ref name="brandhistoriska.org" /&gt;

When the fire broke out Swedenborg was at a dinner with friends in [[Gothenburg]], about 400&amp;nbsp;km from Stockholm.  He became agitated and told the party at six o'clock that there was a fire in Stockholm, that it had consumed his neighbor's home and was threatening his own. Two hours later, he exclaimed with relief that the fire had stopped three doors from his home. In the excitement following his report, word even reached the ears of the provincial governor, who summoned Swedenborg that same evening and asked for a detailed recounting.

At that time, it took two to three days for news from Stockholm to reach Gothenburg by courier, so that is the shortest duration in which the news of the fire could reach Gothenburg.  The first messenger from Stockholm with news of the fire was from the Board of Trade, who arrived Monday evening.  The second messenger was a royal courier, who arrived on Tuesday.  Both of these reports confirmed every statement to the precise hour that Swedenborg first expressed the information.  The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp.&amp;nbsp;312–313 and in Chapter 31 of ''The Swedenborg Epic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic31.htm |title = The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 31 |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As noted above,  primary source for these accounts is a letter from [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1768 and the Swedenborg collection by Tafel (''Documents'' #271–273)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swedenborg's biographer Lars Bergquist, however, this event took place on Sunday, July 29 – 10 days after the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Bergquist: Swedenborgs Hemlighet, Stockholm 1999. {{ISBN|91-27-06981-8}}. (In Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

(Bergquist states, but does not document, that Swedenborg confirmed his vision of the fire incident to his good  friend, Consul Christopher Springer, "one of the pillars of the church, ... "a man of enviable reputation for virtue and intelligence",&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt S. [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic35.html ''The Swedenborg Epic,'' Chapter 35] Bookman 1952&lt;/ref&gt; "and that Swedenborg's innkeeper, Erik Bergström, heard Swedenborg affirming the story.&lt;ref&gt;Berguist, L. ''Swedenborg's Secret'' Swedenborg Foundation, 2005, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;)

It seems unlikely that the many witnesses to Swedenborg's distress during the fire, and his immediate report of it to the provincial governor,&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, L, ''Swedenborg's Secret'' (London, The Swedenborg Society, 2005, p. 270).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; would have left room for doubt in the public eye of Swedenborg's report.  If Swedenborg had only received news of the fire by the normal methods there would have been no issue of psychic perception recorded for history.  Instead, "when the news of Swedenborg's extraordinary vision of the fire reached the capital, public curiosity about him was very much aroused."&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, Chapter 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A second fire anecdote, similar to the first one, but less cited, is the incident of the mill owner Bolander.  Swedenborg warned him, again abruptly, of an incipient fire in one of his mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic38.htm |title=The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 38 |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen of Sweden===
The third event was in 1758 when Swedenborg visited Queen [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Louisa Ulrika]] of Sweden, who asked him to tell her something about her deceased brother [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia]]. The next day, Swedenborg whispered something in her ear that turned the Queen pale and she explained that this was something only she and her brother could know about.&lt;ref&gt;''Swedenborg Epic'' pp. 278ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to Bergquist (1999), pp. 314–315, There are several different accounts of the events which makes it difficult to conclude the exact details of the event. Carl Robsahm (see [[#Sources|reference]]) reports the story in this way.}}

=== Lost document ===
The fourth incident involved a woman who had lost an important document, and came to Swedenborg asking if a recently deceased person could tell him where it was, which he (in some sources) was said to have done the following night.{{efn|According to Bergquist (1999), p. 316, there are some ten different reports of this event. There are two trustworthy descriptions, one by Robsahm (writing down Swedenborg's own description) and one by a priest who enquired of the woman in a letter fifteen years later.}}

Although not typically cited along with these three episodes, there was one further piece of evidence:  Swedenborg was noted by the seamen of the ships that he sailed between Stockholm and London to always have excellent sailing conditions.&lt;ref name="Sigstedt, p. 329"&gt;Sigstedt, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked about this by a friend, Swedenborg played down the matter, saying he was surprised by this experience himself and that he was certainly not able to do miracles.&lt;ref name="Sigstedt, p. 329" /&gt;

== Kant's view ==

In 1763, [[Immanuel Kant]], then at the beginning of his career, was impressed by these accounts and made inquiries to find out if they were true.  He also ordered all eight volumes of the expensive ''Arcana Cœlestia'' (''Heavenly Arcana'' or ''Heavenly Mysteries''). One Charlotte von Knobloch wrote Kant asking his opinion of Swedenborg's psychic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This letter is further discussed in Laywine, A., "Kant's Early Metaphysics". ''North American Kant Society Studies in Philosophy'', volume 3 (Atascadero, California: Ridgeview Publishing Company, 1993), pp. 72–74.}}  Kant wrote a very affirmative reply, referring to Swedenborg's "miraculous" gift, and characterizing him as "reasonable, agreeable, remarkable and sincere" and "a scholar," in one of his letters to [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]],&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and expressing regret that he (Kant) had never met Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 202, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Green (merchant)|Joseph Green]], his English friend, who investigated the matter for Kant, including by visiting Swedenborg's home, found Swedenborg to be a "sensible, pleasant and openhearted" man and here again, a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, three years later, in 1766, Kant wrote and published anonymously a small book entitled ''Träume eines Geistersehers'' (''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'')&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G., Magee, G. E. (Swedenborg Foundation 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; that was a scathing critique of Swedenborg and his writings. He termed Swedenborg a "spook hunter"&lt;ref&gt;Benz 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; "without official office or occupation."&lt;ref&gt;Benz, E., Heron, A. (Translator) ''Spiritual Vision and Revelation'', Chapter VI. ''The Mystery of a Date&amp;nbsp;– Fresh light on Kant's Criticism of Swedenborg'', p. 13, reprinted in ''The New Philosophy'' 2001 104:7,&lt;/ref&gt; As rationale for his critique, Kant said he wanted to stop "ceaseless questioning".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and inquiries about ''Dreams'' from "inquisitive" persons, both known and unknown",&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G. Did Kant dissemble his interest in Swedenborg? "The New Philosophy" 1999, 102: 531&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's friend [[Moses Mendelssohn]] thought there was a "joking pensiveness" in ''Dreams'' that sometimes left the reader in doubt as to whether ''Dreams'' was meant to make "metaphysics laughable or spirit-seeking credible".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his letters to Mendelssohn, Kant refers to ''Dreams'' less-than-enthusiastically as a "desultory little essay".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant never closed off the possibility of [[mysticism]] or spirits in ''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'' and the exact relationship of his thought to Swedenborg's remains unclear, according to contemporary scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 185-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
{{Lutheranism}}
Swedenborg claimed in ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' that the teachings of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ were revealed to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture''#4, ''True Christian Religion'' # 859, 750, 779&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg considered his [[theology]] a revelation of the true Christian religion that had become obfuscated through centuries of theology. However, he did not refer to his writings as theology since he considered it based on actual experiences, unlike theology,&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt; except in the title of his last work. Neither did he wish to compare it to [[philosophy]], a discipline he discarded in 1748 because, he claimed, it ''"darkens the mind, blinds us, and wholly rejects the faith"''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Bergquist (1999), p. 178, based on Swedenborg's ''Spiritual Experiences'' (1748), §767 (However, ''Spiritual Experiences'' is not among the works Swedenborg published himself, and thus may not be authoritative revelation. See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html "Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of Swedenborg's theology was laid down in ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' (''Heavenly Mysteries''), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In a significant portion of that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what he says is the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in ''Apocalypse Revealed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AR.html |title=The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the [[creation myth]] was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to [[Jesus Christ]], and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 286–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
One often discussed aspect of Swedenborg's writing is his ideas on marriage. Swedenborg himself remained a bachelor all his life, but that did not hinder him from writing voluminously on the subject. His work on ''Marriage Love'' (''Conjugial Love''{{efn|"[[wiktionary:conjugial|conjugial]]" should not be confused with "[[wiktionary:conjugal|conjugal]]", the general term for marriage.}} in older translations) (1768) was dedicated to this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=1 |title = ML 1 – Small Canon Search – Reading – The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God – Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible – The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher = Small Canon Search |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central question with regard to marriage is whether it stops at death or continues into heaven. The question arises due to a statement of Jesus' that there is no marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27–38, Matthew 22:23–32, and Mark 12:18–27). Swedenborg wrote ''The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven'' as a detailed analysis of what he meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.swedenborgproject.org/2011/08/22/the-lord-god-jesus-christ-on-marriage-in-heaven// |title = The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven |publisher = The Swedenborg Project |date = |accessdate = 2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of the relationship between husband and wife resumes in the spiritual world in whatever state it was at their death in this world. Thus, a couple in true marriage love remain together in that state in [[heaven]] into eternity. A couple lacking in that love by one or both partners, however, will separate after death and each will be given a compatible new partner if they wish. A partner is also given to a person who loved the ideal of marriage but never found a true partner in this world. The exception in both cases is a person who hates chaste marriage and thus cannot receive such a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=46 |title=Marriage Love 46–50) |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg saw creation as a series of pairings, descending from the Divine love and wisdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=dlw&amp;section=52 |title =Marriage Love #52 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that define [[God]] and are the basis of [[:wikt:creation|creation]]. This duality can be seen in the pairing of good and truth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=84 |title=Marriage Love #84 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; charity and faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=fa&amp;section=1 |title=Marriage Love #1 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; God and the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=117 |title = Marriage Love #117 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=83 |title=Marriage Love #83 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the goal for these pairs is to achieve [[wiktionary:conjunction|conjunction]] between the two component parts. In the case of marriage, the object is to bring about the joining together of the two partners at the spiritual and physical levels, and the happiness that comes as a consequence.

===Trinity===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
Swedenborg rejected the common explanation of the [[Trinity]] as a Trinity of Persons, which he said was not taught in the [[early Christian]] church. There was, for instance, no mention in the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic]] writings of any "Son from eternity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=tcr&amp;section=175 |title=TCR 175 – Small Canon Search – Reading – The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God – Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible – The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher=Small Canon Search |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he explained in his theological writings how the Divine Trinity exists in One Person, in One God, the Lord [[Jesus Christ]], which he said is taught in Colossians 2:9. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', Jesus, the  [[Son of God]], came into the world due to the spread of evil here.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html ''The True Christian Religion'', particularly sections 163–184 ] (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/DL.html ''The Doctrine of the Lord'']  (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AC.htm ''The Arcana Coelestia''] (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, various dates)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/njhd.html ''The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine,'' particularly sections 280–310] New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg spoke in virtually all his works against what he regarded as the incomprehensible Trinity of Persons concept. He said that people of other religions opposed Christianity because of its doctrine of a Trinity of Persons. He considered the separation of the Trinity into three separate Persons to have originated with the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[Athanasian]] Creed. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' the Athanasian Creed is true, however, if the Trinity is understood to mean a Trinity in one person and that person being the Lord God Jesus Christ.

===''Sola Fide'' (Faith Alone)===
''The Heavenly Doctrine'' rejects the concept of salvation through [[faith alone|faith-alone]] (''sola-fide'' in Latin), since he considered both [[faith]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] necessary for [[salvation]], not one without the other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although it must be a faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.

In other words, Swedenborg spoke sharply against the faith-alone doctrine of Luther and others.  He held that justification before God was not based solely upon some imputed righteousness before God, and was not achievable merely by a gift of God's grace (''sola gratia''), granted without any basis in a person's actual behavior in life.  ''Sola-fide'' was a doctrine averred by Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli and others during the Protestant Reformation, and was a core belief especially in the theology of the Lutheran reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]].

Although the ''sola-fide'' doctrine of the Reformers also emphasized that saving faith was one that effected works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org/Reformation_faith_works.html |title=Reformation Faith + Works |publisher=Peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by faith-alone, but not by a faith which is alone), Swedenborg protested against faith-alone being the instrument of justification, and held that salvation is only possible through the conjunction of faith and charity in a person, and that the purpose of faith is to lead a person to live according to the truths of faith, which is [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. He further states that faith and charity must be exercised by doing good out of willing good whenever possible, which are good works or good uses or the conjunction perishes. In one section he wrote:

{{quotation|It is very evident from their [[Epistles]] that it never entered the mind of any of the [[apostles]] that the church of this day would separate faith from charity by teaching that [[Sola fide|faith-alone]] justifies and saves apart from the works of the law, and that charity therefore cannot be conjoined with faith, since faith is from God, and charity, so far as it is expressed in works, is from man. But this separation and division were introduced into the Christian church when it divided God into three persons, and ascribed to each equal Divinity.|True Christian Religion, section 355&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblemeanings.info/books/tcr/sect-336ff.html#TCR355 |title=True Christian Religion, sections 336 ff |publisher=Biblemeanings.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Later history ==
Swedenborg made no attempt to found a church.&lt;ref&gt;Block, M.B [https://archive.org/details/newchurchinthene028276mbp ''The New Church in the New World. A Study of Swedenborgianism in America''] (Holt 1932; reprint Octagan 1968), Chapter 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz, E. ''Emanuel Swedenborg. Visionary Savant in The Age of Reason'' (translated by Goodrick-Clarke (Swedenborg Foundation, 2002, p. 487).&lt;/ref&gt; A few years after his death&amp;nbsp;– 15 by one estimate&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, S. ''Emanuel Swedenborg'' (Chelsea House, 2005, p. 76).&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– for the most part in England, small reading groups formed to study his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As one scholar states, ''The Heavenly Doctrine''  particularly appealed to the various dissenting groups that sprang up in the first half of the 18th century who were "surfeited with revivalism and narrow-mindedness" and found his optimism and comprehensive explanations appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, S. E. ''A Religious History of the American People'' (Yale 1972, p. 483).&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of important cultural figures, both writers and artists, were influenced by Swedenborg's writings, including [[Robert Frost]],&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Jeffrey, ''Robert Frost: A Biography'', Houghton Mifflin, 1996, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Johnny Appleseed]], [[William Blake]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Daniel Burnham]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-i/ebook-page-02.asp |title = Arthur Conan Doyle – The History of Spiritualism Vol I Page 02 |publisher=Classic-literature.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

T. Suzuki]], and [[W. B. Yeats]]. His philosophy had a great impact on the Duke of [[Södermanland]], later King [[Carl XIII]], who as the [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of Swedish [[Freemasonry]] (''Svenska Frimurare Orden'') built its unique system of degrees and wrote its rituals. In contrast, one of the most prominent Swedish authors of Swedenborg's day, [[Johan Henric Kellgren]], called Swedenborg "nothing but a fool".{{efn|[[Johan Henrik Kellgren]] published an often quoted satirical poem entitled ''Man äger ej snille för det man är galen'' ("''You Own Not Genius For That You are Mad''") in 1787. See Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth (1999). (''[[wikisource:sv:Man äger ej snille för det man är galen|Link to the full poem, in Swedish]]'')}} A [[heresy]] trial was initiated in Sweden in 1768 against Swedenborg writings and two men who promoted them.{{efn|The trial in 1768 was against Gabrial Beyer and Johan Rosén and was essentially concerned whether Swedenborg's theological writings were consistent with Christian doctrine. A royal ordinance in 1770 declared that writings were "clearly mistaken" and should not be taught. Swedenborg then begged the King for grace and protection in a letter from Amsterdam. A new investigation against Swedenborg stalled and was eventually dropped in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 453–463.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the two and a half centuries since Swedenborg's death, various [[The New Church (Swedenborgian)|interpretations]] of his theology have been made, and he has also been scrutinized in biographies and psychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html |title = Who was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)? |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = 2006-11-19 |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See "[[#Sources|Sources]]" and "[[#Further reading|Further reading]]" sections, below.}} Swedenborg, with his claimed new [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], has been considered by some to suffer from [[mental illness]].{{efn|[[Johan Henrik Kellgren]] published an often quoted satirical poem entitled ''Man äger ej snille för det man är galen'' (''You Own Not Genius For That You are Mad'') in 1787.

He mentions an earlier biography by the Swedish physician Emil Kleen who concluded that Swedenborg was blatantly mad, suffering "[[paranoia]] and [[hallucinations]]. A similar conclusion was proposed more recently by [[psychiatrist]] John Johnson in "Henry Maudsley on Swedenborg's messianic psychosis", ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' 165:690–691 (1994), who wrote that Swedenborg suffered hallucinations of "acute [[schizophrenia]] or epileptic [[psychosis]]". Another contemporary critique, Foote-Smith E, Smith TJ. Emanuel Swedenborg. ''Epilepsia'' 1996 Feb; 37(2):211-8, proposed that Swedenborg suffered from [[Temporal Lobe Epilepsy]]. For a detailed review of these two articles, see the special issue of the academic journal ''The New Philosophy'' [http://www.swedenborgstudy.com/articles/E.Swedenborg/sanity.htm ''The Madness Hypothesis''].)}}
While the insanity explanation was not uncommon during Swedenborg's own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish [[Riddarhuset]] (The House of the Nobility), the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] (the Swedish parliament), and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered by some to be remarkably coherent.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a "kind and warm-hearted man", "amiable in his meeting with the public", speaking "easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic37.htm |title = The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 37 |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, G.''Swedenborg, Life and Teaching'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1976, p. 202.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://archive.org/details/emanuelswedenbor00trobuoft |title = Emanuel Swedenborg : his life, teachings and influence : Trobridge, George, 1851–1909 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher = Archive.org |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pleasant and interesting conversation...

Visionary Savant in the Age of Reason''. (Swedenborg Foundation, 2002, pp. 226, 227.)&lt;/ref&gt; Of note here is Swedenborg's statement that he was commanded by the Lord to publish his writings and "Do not believe that without this express command I would have thought of publishing things which I knew in advance would make me look ridiculous and many people would think lies..."&lt;ref&gt;Block, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

''Swedenborg: his life and writings'' Bath : I. Pitman, Phonetic Institution, 1856) and this second one in 1867. White worked for the Swedenborg Society in London and wrote an affirmative biography of Swedenborg.  However, he was fired for publishing spiritist books and selling them at the Society's store, as well as otherwise interfering with the Society's function. White's response was the 1867 biography, in which he, in Tafel's words, "turn[ed] a complete somersault in his convictions," and wrote a highly derogatory biography of Swedenborg and his teachings.

'''Engineers Without Borders Ireland''' is an [[international development]] organisation for students and professionals from [[Ireland]] who share a common interest in [[sustainable development]] through engineering and [[appropriate technologies]].

The organisation was initially founded in 2007, and partook in a 2-week project in the [http://www.sonairte.ie/ Sonairte: The National Ecology Centre] in Co. Meath, Ireland. After a lull in activities, a small group of engineers began discussions on reviving EWB-Ireland in 2009. These discussions led to the formation of EWB-Ireland's first ever national committee in January 2010. The committee is a small group of committed engineers from numerous disciplines, located throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/history EWB-Ireland Website - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, EWB-Ireland has branches in [[University College Dublin]] and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/branches EWB Ireland Website - Branches]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental studies''' is a multidisciplinary academic field which systematically studies [[human behavior|human interaction]] with the [[Natural environment|environment]] in the interests of solving complex problems. Environmental studies brings together the principles of the physical sciences, commerce/economics and social sciences so as to solve contemporary environmental problems. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], the [[built environment]], and the sets of relationships between them. The field encompasses study in basic principles of [[ecology]] and [[environmental science]], as well as associated subjects such as [[environmental ethics|ethics]], [[environmental geography|geography]], [[anthropology]], [[environmental policy|policy]], [[environmental politics|politics]], [[urban planning]], [[environmental law|law]], [[environmental economics|economics]], [[environmental philosophy|philosophy]], [[environmental sociology|sociology]] and [[environmental justice|social justice]], [[environmental planning|planning]], [[pollution control]] and [[natural resource management]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Center for Education Statistics]].

==History==
The [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University]] established a BS in environmental studies degree in the 1950s, awarding its first degree in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/es/about.htm "About Environmental Studies at ESF,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031236/http://www.esf.edu/es/about.htm |date=1 December 2017 }} SUNY-ESF website.

The [[Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences]] (AESS) was founded in 2008 as the first professional association in the interdisciplinary field of environmental studies in the United States. In 2010, the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) agreed to advise and support the Association. The Association's scholarly journal, the ''Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences'' (JESS), commenced publication in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aess.info|title=Association for Environmental Studies &amp; Sciences AESSonline.org|author=|date=|website=AESSOnline.org|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310034932/http://aess.info/|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History and Development of AESS|url=https://aessonline.org/about-aess/history/|website=Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106060958/https://aessonline.org/about-aess/history/|archivedate=6 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Galileo's Middle Finger''''' is a 2015 book about the [[Medical ethics|ethics of medical research]] by [[Alice Dreger]], an American bioethicist and author.&lt;ref name="Northwestern"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=17073 |title=Alice Dreger Bio |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=Apr 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419201840/http://www.bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=17073 |archivedate=2014-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreger explores the relationship between science and [[social justice]] by discussing a number of scientific controversies. These include the debates surrounding [[intersex]] genital surgery, [[autogynephilia]], and anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]]'s work.

==Synopsis==

The first part of ''Galileo's Middle Finger'' recounts Dreger's activism against surgical "correction" of [[intersex]] individuals' genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/barronlerner/2015/03/13/science-activism-and-truth-galileos-middle-finger-by-alice-dreger/ | author = Lerner, Barron | date = March 13, 2015 | title = Science, Activism And Truth: 'Galileo's Middle Finger' by Alice Dreger | work = Forbes.com | accessdate = March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some surgeons called this "total urogenital mobilization" which is "...ripping out everything that didn't seem right to the doctor and rebuilding a girl's genitals from scratch using Frankenstein stitches..."&lt;ref name="gal47"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her book discusses the [[intersex medical interventions]] that some intersex children in the United States undergo. Based on her interactions with the intersex community as well as her own research, she advocated that genital surgery for intersex children be postponed until the individual is old enough to make an informed decision, in the absence of any evidence that the benefits of such surgery outweighed its already reported risks.

The second section provides her analysis of the controversy surrounding ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'' (2003), by sex researcher and psychologist [[J. Michael Bailey]]. In that book, Bailey summarized research on [[Blanchard's transsexualism typology]] in a way that Dreger says is scientifically accurate, well-intended, and sympathetic, but insensitive to its political implications. Dreger writes that "Bailey made the mistake of thinking that openly accepting and promoting the truth about people's identities would be understood as the same as accepting them and helping them, as he felt he was".&lt;ref name="gal65"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, many activists in the trans community objected to the contention that their transition was sexually motivated.

Bailey's book was based on the academic publications of psychologist [[Ray Blanchard]], which Bailey interpreted for a lay audience. The larger audience and potential to influence public beliefs about transgenderism led a prominent transgender activist, [[Lynn Conway]], to campaign against Bailey.  Dreger concludes that the accusations levied against Bailey by Conway and others did not hold up to scrutiny. "Conway developed what became an enormous Web site hosted by the University of Michigan for the purpose of taking down Bailey and his ideas [and] that largely enabled me to figure out what she had really done and how Bailey had essentially been set up in an effort to shut him up about [[autogynephilia]]".&lt;ref name="gal65" /&gt; Dreger wrote that some activists had turned their horror at Bailey's findings into a very public vendetta against him and his family, including thinly veiled allegations that he sexually abused his children.&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bartlett, Tom | date = March 10, 2015 | title = Reluctant Crusader: Why Alice Dreger’s writing on sex and science makes liberals so angry | work = [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | url = http://chronicle.com/article/Reluctant-Crusader/228377/?cid=gn | accessdate = March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After researching the allegations against Bailey, she concluded that they were false.  Moreover, Dreger observed that "the most interesting mail, from my perspective, came from trans women who wrote to tell me that, though they weren't thrilled with Bailey's oversimplifications of their lives, they also had been harassed and intimidated by [[Andrea James]] for daring to speak anything other than the politically popular 'I was always just a woman trapped in a man's body' story.

Dreger also investigates the controversy surrounding biologist [[Randy Thornhill]] and anthropologist Craig T. Palmer's ''[[A Natural History of Rape]]'' (2000) and accusations by Patrick Tierney in his book ''[[Darkness in El Dorado]]'' that anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] seriously abused the [[Yanomamo]].

==Reception==

''[[The New York Times]]'' described the book as "a rant, a manifesto, a treasury of evocative new terms ([[sissyphobia]], [[autogynephilia]], [[Phall-O-Meter|phall-o-meter]]) and an account of the author’s transformation" from activist to scientist and back again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/books/review/galileos-middle-finger-by-alice-dreger.html?_r=0 |title=‘Galileo’s Middle Finger,’ by Alice Dreger |last1=Dobbs |first1=David |date=April 17, 2015 |website= |publisher= [[The New York Times]] |access-date=2015-07-20 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' describes the book as "highly readable" with an important message: "Science and social justice require each other to be healthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Miller, Laura | title = "Galileo’s Middle Finger": When scholars and activists clash over controversial research, we all lose.

The book was at first selected as 2016 finalist for a [[Lambda Literary Award]] in the LGBTQ nonfiction category, but the foundation rescinded this nomination on March 22, 2016, describing the book as "inconsistent with its mission of affirming LGBTQ lives."&lt;ref name="Lambda Literary award withdrawal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/712366965466206208|title=Lambda Literary award withdrawal|accessdate=Mar 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brynn Tannehill, writing for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', compared arguments made in the book to the arguments made by anti-transgender groups like the [[Family Research Council]]. She wrote that the book promoted a theory that trans people are "just self-hating homosexual men who believe they could have guilt-free sex if they were female and heterosexual men with an out-of-control fetish (autogynephilia)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tannehill |first=Brynn |date=March 25, 2016 |title=Lambda Literary Foundation Snuffs Out Anti-Trans Scandal |url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2016/3/25/lambda-literary-foundation-snuffs-out-anti-trans-scandal |newspaper=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |access-date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinnia Jones, a trans activist writer, criticised the book as providing an "incomplete and sensationalized" depiction of the subject which selectively covers claims made by proponents, ignoring those which might present it in a worse light.

Released in 2016, '''Guess the Correlation''' is a minimalistic [[Browser game|browser-based]] [[game with a purpose]] developed by Omar Wagih at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]].&lt;ref name=Yong&gt;{{cite news |title=The 8-Bit Game That Makes Statistics Addictive |author=Ed Yong |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/the-8-bit-game-that-makes-statistics-addictive/475848/ |newspaper=[[The Atlantic (magazine)|The Atlantic]] |date=30 March 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wagih&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guessthecorrelation.com|title=Guess the Correlation|author=Omar Wagih|date=10 December 2015|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed to study human perception in scatter plots.&lt;ref name=Tarran&gt;{{cite news |title=A game about correlations that's more than just fun |author=Brian Tarran |url=https://www.statslife.org.uk/the-statistics-dictionary/2675-a-game-about-correlations-that-s-more-than-just-fun |newspaper=[[Significance (magazine)|Significance]] |date=9 February 2016 |accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are presented with a stream of scatter plots depicting the relationship between two random variables and are asked to guess how positively correlated they are.

Collected guesses are used to better understand how humans perceive correlations in scatter plots by identifying features within scatter plots, such as outliers, that cause players to over or under estimate the true correlation.&lt;ref name=Tarran/&gt; 

By 1 February 2016, over 2 million guesses had been collected from 100,000 participants.&lt;ref name=Tarran/&gt; 

==Gameplay==



In the single-player mode, players are presented with a stream of scatter plots depicting the relationship between two random variables. The aim is to guess the true [[Pearson correlation coefficient]], where the guess can range from 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation). Players start out with three lives and no points. Guesses made within 0.05 of the true correlation are awarded a life and five points. Guesses made within 0.10 are awarded one point, and guesses over 0.10 are not awarded any points and a life is deducted. The game ends when the player has run out of lives.&lt;ref name=Wagih/&gt;

In the two player mode, opponents challenge each other at guessing the true correlation. Once a session has been initiated between two players, both players are presented with the same scatter plot. The player with the closest guess to true correlation is awarded a point. In the event of a draw, no points are awarded to either player. The first player to reach 10 points is declared the winner.&lt;ref name=Wagih/&gt;

The '''hype cycle''' is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and [[information technology]] firm [[Gartner]], for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific [[Technology|technologies]]. The hype cycle provides a graphical and conceptual presentation of the maturity of emerging technologies through five phases.

An example of a hype cycle is found in ''Amara's law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|title=Amara's Law|publisher=|accessdate=April 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410135130/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|archive-date=April 10, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined by [[Roy Amara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/05/Four-Geeky-Laws-That-Rule-Our-World/ |title=Four Geeky Laws That Rule Our World |first1=Alex |last1=Santoso |date=September 5, 2012|publisher=Neatorama |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that &lt;blockquote&gt;We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.&lt;ref name=PC_Mag&gt;{{cite journal|title=Encyclopedia: Definition of: Amara's law|journal=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/37701/amara-s-law|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isen.com/archives/011126.html|title=isen.com: Amara's Law -- SMART Letter #63|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Five phases==
[[File:Hype-Cycle-General.png|thumb|right|320px|General hype cycle for technology]]

Each hype cycle drills down into the five key phases of a technology's life cycle.

{|class="wikitable"
!align=center|No.
!align=center width=180px|Phase
!align=center|Description
|-
!align=center|1
|Technology Trigger
|A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.
|-
!align=center|2
|Peak of Inflated Expectations
|Early publicity produces a number of success stories—often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; most don't.
|-
!align=center|3
|Trough of Disillusionment
|Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investment continues only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.
|-
!align=center|4
|Slope of Enlightenment
|More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.
|-
!align=center|5
|Plateau of Productivity
|Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off. If the technology has more than a niche market then it will continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital marketing|last=1963-|first=Chaffey, Dave|publisher=Pearson|others=Ellis-Chadwick, Fiona|year=2016|isbn=9781292077611|edition= Sixth |location=Harlow|pages=140–141|oclc=942844494}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
The term "hype cycle" and each of the associated phases are now used more broadly in the [[marketing]] of new technologies.

==Hype in new media==
Hype (in the more general media sense of the term "hype"&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia /&gt;) plays a large part in the adoption of [[new media]] forms by society. [[Terry Flew]] states{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} that hype (generally the enthusiastic and strong feeling around new forms of media and technology in which people expect everything will be modified for the better{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}) surrounding [[new media]] technologies and their popularization, along with the development of the Internet, is a common characteristic. But following shortly after the period of 'inflated expectations', as per the diagram above, the new media technologies quickly fall into a period of disenchantment, which is the end of the primary, and strongest, phase of hype.

Many analyses of the Internet in the 1990s featured large amounts of hype,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Negroponte |first=Nicolas |title=Being Digital |publisher=Vintage |date=1996-01-03 |edition= 1st |isbn= 978-0-679-76290-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |title=New Rules For The New Economy |journal=Wired |date=1997-09-01 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.09/newrules.html |accessdate=2011-12-30 |volume=5.09 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Dyson |first=Esther |title=Release 2.0: A Design For Living In The Digital Age |publisher=Broadway Books |location=New York |year=1997 |edition= 1st}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which created "debunking" responses.&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Terry |title=New Media: An Introduction |publisher=OUP Australia and New Zealand |location=South Melbourne |year=2008 |edition= 3rd |isbn=978-0-19-555149-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such hype and the negative and positive responses toward it have given way to research that looks empirically at new media and its impact.

A longer-term historical perspective on such cycles can be found in the research of the economist [[Carlota Perez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henton|first=Doug|last2=Held|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=The dynamics of Silicon Valley: Creative destruction and the evolution of the innovation habitat|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=539–557|doi=10.1177/0539018413497542|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; D R Laurence in clinical pharmacology described a similar process in drug development in the seventies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Another is that it is limited in its application, as it prioritizes economic considerations in decision-making processes. It seems to assume that a business' performance is tied to the hype cycle, whereas this may actually have more to do with the way a company devises its branding strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rootbranded.com/mindshift-magazine/branding-strategy-cut-hype-cycles|title=RootBranded {{!}} Mindshift Magazine|website=RootBranded {{!}} Saving Great Ideas from Obscurity|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related criticism is that the "cycle" has no real benefits to the development or marketing of new technologies and merely comments on pre-existing trends. Specific disadvantages when compared to, for example, [[technology readiness level]] are:
* The cycle is not scientific in nature, and there is no data or analysis that would justify the cycle.
* With the (subjective) terms ''disillusionment'', ''enlightenment'' and ''expectations'' it can not be described objectively or clearly where technology now really is.
* The terms are misleading in the sense that one gets the wrong idea what he or she can use a technology for. The user does not want to be disappointed, so should he or she stay away from technology in the Trough of Disillusionment?
* No action perspective is offered to move technology to a next phase.
* This appears to be a very simplified impulse response of an elastic system representable by a differential equation.  Perhaps more telling would be to formulate a system model with solutions conforming to observable behavior.
An analysis of Gartner Hype Cycles since 2000&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; shows that few technologies actually travel through an identifiable hype cycle, and that in practice most of the important technologies adopted since 2000 were not identified early in their adoption cycles.

[[File:Lazio Roma Gesu2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Triumph of the Name of Jesus'', by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]], on the ceiling of the [[Church of the Gesu]]. The decorations of the vault over the nave date back to the 17th century. The fresco is the work of Giovanni Battista Gaulli, known as Baciccia. The stucco reliefs were executed by Ercole Antonio Raggi and Leonardo Reti, following the drawings of Baciccia who wanted to effect a real continuity between painting and sculpture.]]

'''Illusionism''' in [[art history]] means either the artistic tradition in which artists create a work of art that appears to share the physical space with the viewer&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;"Illusionism," ''Grove Art Online''. [[Oxford University Press]], [accessed 17 March 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; or more broadly the attempt to represent physical appearances precisely – also called [[mimesis]].  The term [[realism (art)|realist]] may be used in this sense, but that also has rather different meanings in art, as it is also used to cover the choice of ordinary everyday subject-matter, and avoiding idealizing subjects. Illusionism encompasses a long history, from the deceptions of [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]] to the works of [[mural]]ist [[Richard Haas]] in the twentieth century, that includes [[trompe-l'oeil]], [[anamorphosis]], [[Op art]], [[Abstract Illusionism]], and [[Illusionistic ceiling painting]] techniques such as ''di sotto in sù'' and ''quadratura''.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; [[sculpture|Sculptural]] illusionism includes works, often painted, that appear real from a distance.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; Other forms, such as the [[illusionistic tradition]] in the theatre, and [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]]'s "peepshow"-boxes from the seventeenth century, combine illusionistic techniques and media. 

==Illusionistic realism==

[[File:Frederic Leighton - Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|left|340px|[[Lord Leighton]]'s ''Cimabue's Madonna Carried in Procession'' of 1853-55 is at the end of a long tradition of illusionism in painting, but is not Realist in the sense of Courbet's work of the same period.]]
The development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art. It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and beasts, of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]] in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of beasts, and [[Ancient Egyptian art]] developed conventions involving both [[stylization]] and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. [[Ancient Greek art]] is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in [[mosaic]]) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by [[Zeuxis]] in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective.  This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly [[Socrates]], were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. [[Roman portraiture]], when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.

[[File:Camera picta, ceiling 3.jpg|alt=Illusionistic ceiling fresco by Andrea Mantegna in the Camera degli Sposi, Ducal Palace, Mantua|left|thumb|[[Andrea Mantegna]]'s late-[[Quattrocento]] ceiling fresco in the ''[[Camera degli Sposi]]''  (commissioned by [[Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua|Ludovico III Gonzaga]] for Mantua's Ducal Palace) is an early example of [[illusionistic ceiling painting]].]]
The art of [[Late Antiquity]] famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the [[Late medieval]] or [[Early Renaissance]] period, and were helped by the development of new techniques of [[oil painting]] which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze.  Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, idealism remained the norm.

The accurate depiction of [[landscape painting|landscape in painting]] had also been developing in Early Netherlandish and Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. [[Still life]] paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked "realism", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of [[Flower bouquet|bouquet]]s in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time.  Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in [[Cubism]].

==Donald Judd==


In his writings and art criticisms during the mid-1960s [[art critic]]/artist [[Donald Judd]] claimed that illusionism in painting undermined the artform itself. Judd implied that painting was dead, claiming painting was a ''lie'' because it depicted the ''illusion'' of three-dimensionality on a flat surface. Judd claimed that painting needed to recognize its objecthood in real space and reject illusion. Donald Judd wrote in “Specific Objects” in 1965:
{{quote|Three dimensions are real space. That gets rid of the problem of illusionism and of literal space, space in and around marks of color… Actual space is intrinsically more powerful and specific than paint on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2011/07/artseen/donald-judd Greg Lindquist, The Brooklyn Rail, ''Donald Judd'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern Illusion==
In the Webster Texas Holiday Inn, close to the Houston Space Center, there is a double illusion ceiling by muralist Frank Wilson, commissioned in honor of US astronauts. Other double illusion murals exist in rooms for officials as well as the dining room, depicting a night sky under darkness and illuminated by glowing minerals.  Under normal light, clouds and birds are observed.

'''Interdisciplinarity''' or interdisciplinary studies involves the combining of two or more [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] into one activity (e.g., a research project).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M|date=1995|title=Fruits, Salads, and Smoothies: A Working definition of Interdisciplinarity|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23767672|journal=The Journal of educational Thought (JET)/revue de La Pensée Éducative|volume=29(2)|pages=121-128|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws knowledge from several other fields like sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics etc.  It is about creating something by thinking across boundaries. It is related to an ''[[interdiscipline]]'' or an ''interdisciplinary field,'' which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between [[Outline of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] or [[School of thought|schools of thought]], as new needs and professions emerge. Large [[engineering]] teams are usually interdisciplinary, as a [[power station]] or [[mobile phone]] or other project requires the melding of several specialties. However, the term "interdisciplinary" is sometimes confined to academic settings.

The term ''interdisciplinary'' is applied within education and training pedagogies to describe studies that use methods and insights of several established disciplines or traditional fields of study. Interdisciplinarity involves researchers, students, and teachers in the goals of connecting and integrating several academic schools of thought, professions, or technologies—along with their specific perspectives—in the pursuit of a common task. The [[epidemiology]] of [[HIV/AIDS]] or [[global warming]] requires understanding of diverse disciplines to solve complex problems. ''Interdisciplinary'' may be applied where the subject is felt to have been neglected or even misrepresented in the traditional disciplinary structure of research institutions, for example, [[women's studies]] or ethnic area studies. Interdisciplinarity can likewise be applied to complex subjects that can only be understood by combining the perspectives of two or more fields.

The [[adjective]] ''interdisciplinary'' is most often used in educational circles when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand, including the case of the team-taught course where students are required to understand a given subject in terms of multiple traditional disciplines.  For example, the subject of [[land use]] may appear differently when examined by different disciplines, for instance, [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[economics]], [[geography]], and [[politics]].

==Development==
Although “interdisciplinary” and “interdisciplinarity” are frequently viewed as twentieth century terms, the concept has historical antecedents, most notably [[Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref name="ausburg"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ausburg, Tanya|title=Becoming Interdisciplinary: An Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies|edition=2nd |location= New York|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julie Thompson Klein]] attests that "the roots of the concepts lie in a number of ideas that resonate through modern discourse—the ideas of a unified science, general knowledge, synthesis and the integration of knowledge",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klein, Julie Thompson|title=Interdisciplinarity: History, Theory, and Practice|location=Detroit|publisher=Wayne State University|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Giles Gunn says that [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historians]] and [[Playwright|dramatists]] took elements from other realms of knowledge (such as [[medicine]] or [[philosophy]]) to further understand their own material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gunn, Giles|chapter=Interdisciplinary Studies|editor=Gibaldi, J.|title= Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Language and Literatures|location=New York|publisher=Modern Language Association|year=1992|pp=239–240|isbn= 978-0873523851}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of [[Roman roads]] required men who understood [[surveying]], [[material science]], [[logistics]] and several other disciplines. Any broadminded humanist project involves interdisciplinarity, and history shows a crowd of cases, as seventeenth-century Leibniz's task to create a system of universal justice, which required linguistics, economics, management, ethics, law philosophy, politics, and even sinology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=José Andrés-Gallego|title=Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related? Leibniz's Universal (Chinese) Dream|journal=Journal of Mixed Methods Research|volume=29|issue=2|year=2015|pages=118–132|url=http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/118.abstract|doi=10.1177/1558689813515332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdisciplinary programs sometimes arise from a shared conviction that the traditional disciplines are unable or unwilling to address an important problem. For example, social science disciplines such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] paid little attention to the social analysis of [[technology]] throughout most of the twentieth century. As a result, many social scientists with interests in technology have joined [[science, technology and society]] programs, which are typically staffed by scholars drawn from numerous disciplines. They may also arise from new research developments, such as [[nanotechnology]], which cannot be addressed without combining the approaches of two or more disciplines. Examples include [[quantum information processing]], an amalgamation of [[quantum physics]] and [[computer science]], and [[bioinformatics]], combining [[molecular biology]] with computer science. [[Sustainable development]] as a research area deals with problems requiring analysis and synthesis across economic, social and environmental spheres; often an integration of multiple social and natural science disciplines. Interdisciplinary research is also key to the study of health sciences, for example in studying optimal solutions to diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J.S. Edge|author2=S.J. Hoffman|author3=C.L. Ramirez|author4=S.J. Goldie|year=2013|title=Research and Development Priorities to Achieve the "Grand Convergence": An Initial Scan of Priority Research Areas for Public Health, Implementation Science and Innovative Financing for Neglected Diseases: Working Paper for the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health|location=London, UK|publisher=The Lancet|url=http://globalhealth2035.org/sites/default/files/working-papers/goldie-team-rd-cih-working-paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some institutions of higher education offer accredited degree programs in Interdisciplinary Studies.

At another level, interdisciplinarity is seen as a remedy to the harmful effects of excessive specialization and isolation in [[information silo]]s. On some views, however, interdisciplinarity is entirely indebted to those who specialize in one field of study—that is, without specialists, interdisciplinarians would have no information and no leading experts to consult. Others place the focus of interdisciplinarity on the need to transcend disciplines, viewing excessive specialization as problematic both epistemologically and politically. When interdisciplinary collaboration or research results in new solutions to problems, much information is given back to the various disciplines involved. Therefore, both disciplinarians and interdisciplinarians may be seen in complementary relation to one another.

==Barriers==
Because most participants in interdisciplinary ventures were trained in traditional disciplines, they must learn to appreciate differing of perspectives and methods. For example, a discipline that places more emphasis on quantitative "rigor" may produce practitioners who think of themselves (and their discipline) as "more scientific" than others; in turn, colleagues in "softer" disciplines may associate quantitative approaches with an inability to grasp the broader dimensions of a problem. An interdisciplinary program may not succeed if its members remain stuck in their disciplines (and in disciplinary attitudes). On the other hand, and from the disciplinary perspective, much interdisciplinary work may be seen as "soft", lacking in rigor, or ideologically motivated; these beliefs place barriers in the career paths of those who choose interdisciplinary work.  For example, interdisciplinary grant applications are often refereed by [[peer review]]ers drawn from established [[Academic discipline|disciplines]]; not surprisingly, interdisciplinary researchers may experience difficulty getting funding for their research. In addition, untenured researchers know that, when they seek [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] and [[tenure]], it is likely that some of the evaluators will lack commitment to interdisciplinarity. They may fear that making a commitment to interdisciplinary research will increase the risk of being denied tenure.

Interdisciplinary programs may fail if they are not given sufficient autonomy. For example, interdisciplinary faculty are usually recruited to a [[joint appointment]], with responsibilities in both an interdisciplinary program (such as [[women's studies]]) and a traditional discipline (such as [[history]]). If the traditional discipline makes the tenure decisions, new interdisciplinary faculty will be hesitant to commit themselves fully to interdisciplinary work. Other barriers include the generally disciplinary orientation of most scholarly journals, leading to the perception, if not the fact, that interdisciplinary research is hard to publish. In addition, since traditional budgetary practices at most universities channel resources through the disciplines, it becomes difficult to account for a given scholar or teacher's salary and time. During periods of budgetary contraction, the natural tendency to serve the primary constituency (i.e., students majoring in the traditional discipline) makes resources scarce for teaching and research comparatively far from the center of the discipline as traditionally understood. For these same reasons, the introduction of new interdisciplinary programs is often resisted because it is perceived as a competition for diminishing funds.

Due to these and other barriers, interdisciplinary research areas are strongly motivated to become disciplines themselves. If they succeed, they can establish their own research funding programs and make their own tenure and promotion decisions. In so doing, they lower the risk of entry. Examples of former interdisciplinary research areas that have become disciplines, many of them named for their parent disciplines, include [[neuroscience]], [[cybernetics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[biomedical engineering]]. These new fields are occasionally referred to as "interdisciplines". On the other hand, even though interdisciplinary activities are now a focus of attention for institutions promoting learning and teaching, as well as organizational and social entities concerned with education, they are practically facing complex barriers, serious challenges and criticism. The most important obstacles and challenges faced by interdisciplinary activities in the past two decades can be divided into "professional", "organizational", and "cultural" obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Khorsandi Taskoh, Ali|title=Interdisciplinary Higher Education; Criticism, Challenges and Obstacles|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=researchday|date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary studies and studies of interdisciplinarity==
An initial distinction should be made between interdisciplinary studies, which can be found spread across the academy today, and the study of interdisciplinarity, which involves a much smaller group of researchers. The former is instantiated in thousands of research centers across the US and the world. The latter has one US organization, the Association for Interdisciplinary Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.units.muohio.edu/aisorg/|title=Association for Interdisciplinary Studies Homepage - Association for Interdisciplinary Studies - Oakland University|website=www.units.muohio.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 1979), two international organizations, the International Network of Inter- and Transdisciplinarity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inidtd.org/|title=INIT-Home|website=www.inidtd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 2010) and the Philosophy of/as Interdisciplinarity Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pin-net.gatech.edu/|title=PIN / HOME|website=pin-net.gatech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (founded in 2009), and one research institute devoted to the theory and practice of interdisciplinarity, the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity at the University of North Texas (founded in 2008). As of September 1, 2014, the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity has ceased to exist. This is the result of administrative decisions at the University of North Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=University of Texas|title=Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity|url=https://webarchive.library.unt.edu/unt/csid/20140911224746/http://csid.unt.edu/news.html#closing|website=University of Texas|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''interdisciplinary study''' is an academic program or process seeking to synthesize broad [[perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]], knowledge, skills, interconnections, and [[epistemology]] in an educational setting. Interdisciplinary programs may be founded in order to facilitate the study of subjects which have some coherence, but which cannot be adequately understood from a single disciplinary perspective (for example, women's studies or [[medievalism|medieval studies]]). More rarely, and at a more advanced level, interdisciplinarity may itself become the focus of study, in a critique of institutionalized disciplines' ways of segmenting knowledge.

In contrast, '''studies of interdisciplinarity''' raise to self-consciousness questions about how interdisciplinarity works, the nature and history of disciplinarity, and the future of knowledge in [[post-industrial society]]. Researchers at the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity have made the distinction between philosophy 'of' and 'as' interdisciplinarity, the former identifying a new, discrete area within philosophy that raises epistemological and metaphysical questions about the status of interdisciplinary thinking, with the latter pointing toward a philosophical practice that is sometimes called 'field philosophy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/experiments-in-field-philosophy/?_r=0 | title=Experiments of Field Psychology | work=Opinionator | date=November 23, 2010 | accessdate=July 30, 2016 | author=Frodeman, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frodeman | first1 = Robert | last2 = Briggle | first2 = Adam | last3 = Holbrook | first3 = J. Britt | year = 2012 | title = Philosophy in the Age of Neoliberalism | url = | journal = Social Epistemology | volume = 26 | issue = 3–4| pages = 311–330 | doi = 10.1080/02691728.2012.722701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most common complaint regarding interdisciplinary programs, by supporters and detractors alike, is the lack of synthesis—that is, students are provided with multiple disciplinary perspectives, but are not given effective guidance in resolving the conflicts and achieving a coherent view of the subject. Others have argued that the very idea of synthesis or integration of disciplines presupposes questionable politico-epistemic commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holbrook | first1 = J. Britt | year = | title = What is interdisciplinary communication? Reflections on the very idea of disciplinary integration | url = | journal = Synthese | volume = 190| issue = | pages = 1865–1879| doi = 10.1007/s11229-012-0179-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of interdisciplinary programs feel that the ambition is simply unrealistic, given the knowledge and intellectual maturity of all but the exceptional undergraduate; some defenders concede the difficulty, but insist that cultivating interdisciplinarity as a habit of mind, even at that level, is both possible and essential to the education of informed and engaged citizens and leaders capable of analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing information from multiple sources in order to render reasoned decisions.

While much has been written on the philosophy and promise of interdisciplinarity in academic programs and professional practice, social scientists are increasingly interrogating academic discourses on interdisciplinarity, as well as how interdisciplinarity actually works—and does not—in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barry, A.|author2=G.

=== Politics of interdisciplinary studies ===

Since 1998, there has been an ascendancy in the value of interdisciplinary research and teaching and a growth in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded at U.S. universities classified as multi- or interdisciplinary studies.  The number of interdisciplinary bachelor's degrees awarded annually rose from 7,000 in 1973 to 30,000 a year by 2005 according to data from the National Center of Educational Statistics (NECS). In addition, educational leaders from the Boyer Commission to Carnegie's President [[Vartan Gregorian]] to [[Alan I. Leshner]], CEO of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] have advocated for interdisciplinary rather than disciplinary approaches to problem solving in the 21st century.  This has been echoed by federal funding agencies, particularly the [[National Institutes of Health]] under the direction of [[Elias Zerhouni]], who has advocated that grant proposals be framed more as interdisciplinary collaborative projects than single researcher, single discipline ones.

At the same time, many thriving longstanding bachelor's in interdisciplinary studies programs in existence for 30 or more years, have been closed down, in spite of healthy enrollment. Examples include Arizona International (formerly part of the [[University of Arizona]]), the School of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Miami University]], and the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Wayne State University]]; others such as the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Appalachian State University]], and [[George Mason University]]'s [[New Century College]], have been cut back. Stuart Henry{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} has seen this trend as part of the [[hegemony]] of the disciplines in their attempt to recolonize the experimental knowledge production of otherwise marginalized fields of inquiry. This is due to threat perceptions seemingly based on the ascendancy of interdisciplinary studies against traditional academia.

==Historical examples==
There are many examples of when a particular idea, almost on the same period, arises in different disciplines. One case is the shift from the approach of focusing on "specialized segments of attention" (adopting one particular perspective), to the idea of "instant sensory awareness of the whole", an attention to the "total field", a "sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity", an "integral idea of structure and configuration". This has happened in painting (with [[cubism]]), physics, poetry, communication and [[educational theory]]. According to [[Marshall McLuhan]], this [[paradigm shift]] was due to the passage from an era shaped by [[mechanization]], which brought sequentiality, to the era shaped by the instant speed of electricity, which brought simultaneity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall McLuhan]] (1964) ''[[Understanding Media]]'', p.13 {{cite web |url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011132326/http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to simplify and defend the concept ==
An article in the ''Social Science Journal''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1997|title=Ten cheers for interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=|journal=Social Science Journal|volume=34|pages=201–216|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0362-3319(97)90051-3|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to provide a simple, common-sense, definition of interdisciplinarity, bypassing the difficulties of defining that concept and obviating the need for such related concepts as [[transdisciplinarity]], [[pluridisciplinarity]], and [[multidisciplinarity]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"To begin with, a discipline can be conveniently defined as any comparatively self-contained and isolated domain of human experience which possesses its own community of experts. Interdisciplinarity is best seen as bringing together distinctive components of two or more disciplines. In academic discourse, interdisciplinarity typically applies to four realms: knowledge, research, education, and theory. Interdisciplinary knowledge involves familiarity with components of two or more disciplines. Interdisciplinary research combines components of two or more disciplines in the search or creation of new knowledge, operations, or artistic expressions. Interdisciplinary education merges components of two or more disciplines in a single program of instruction. Interdisciplinary theory takes interdisciplinary knowledge, research, or education as its main objects of study."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In turn, interdisciplinary ''richness'' of any two instances of knowledge, research, or education can be ranked by weighing four variables: number of disciplines involved, the "distance" between them, the novelty of any particular combination, and their extent of integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1995|title=Fruits, Salads, and Smoothies:  A Working Definition of Interdisciplinarity|url=http://www.uta.edu/faculty/repko/INTS_4391/SMOOTHIE.htm|journal=Journal of Educational Thought|volume=29|pages=119–126|issue=2|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdisciplinary knowledge and research are important because:
#"Creativity often requires interdisciplinary knowledge.
#Immigrants often make important contributions to their new field.
#Disciplinarians often commit errors which can be best detected by people familiar with two or more disciplines.
#Some worthwhile topics of research fall in the interstices among the traditional disciplines.
#Many intellectual, social, and practical problems require interdisciplinary approaches.
#Interdisciplinary knowledge and research serve to remind us of the unity-of-knowledge ideal.
#Interdisciplinarians enjoy greater flexibility in their research.
#More so than narrow disciplinarians, interdisciplinarians often treat themselves to the intellectual equivalent of traveling in new lands.
#Interdisciplinarians may help breach communication gaps in the modern academy, thereby helping to mobilize its enormous intellectual resources in the cause of greater social rationality and justice.
#By bridging fragmented disciplines, interdisciplinarians might play a role in the defense of academic freedom."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Johann Jakob Wettstein''' (also '''Wetstein'''; 5 March 1693 – 23 March 1754) was a Protestant Swiss theologian, best known as a [[New Testament]] critic.

==Biography==

===Youth and study===
Johann Jakob Wettstein was born in [[Basel]]. Among his tutors in theology was [[Samuel Werenfels]] (1657–1740), an influential anticipator of modern critical [[exegesis]]. While still a student, Wettstein began to direct his attention to the special pursuit of his life, the text of the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[New Testament]]. A relative, Johann Wettstein, who was the university librarian, gave him permission to examine and collate the principal [[manuscript]]s of the New Testament in the library, and he copied the various readings which they contained into his copy of [[Gerard of Maastricht]]'s edition of the [[Greek language|Greek]] text.

In 1713 in his public examination he defended a dissertation entitled ''De variis Novi Testamenti lectionibus'', and sought to show that variety of readings did not detract from the authority of the Bible. Wettstein paid great attention also to [[Aramaic]] and [[Talmud]]ic Hebrew. In the spring of 1714 he undertook an academic tour, which led him to Paris and England, the great object of his inquiry everywhere being to examine manuscripts of the New Testament. In 1716 he made the acquaintance of [[Richard Bentley]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]; Bentley took great interest in his work and persuaded him to return to Paris to collate carefully the ''Codex Ephraemi'', Bentley having then in view a critical edition of the New Testament.

===Basel===
In July 1717 Wettstein returned to take the office of a minister at large (''diaconus communis'') at Basel, a post which he held for three years, after which he became his father's colleague and successor in the parish of St Leonard's. At the same time he pursued his favourite study, and gave private lectures on New Testament [[exegesis]]. It was then that he decided to prepare a [[textual criticism|critical edition]] of the [[Textus Receptus]] (Greek New Testament}. He had in the meantime broken with Bentley, whose famous ''Proposals'' appeared in 1720. His earlier teachers, however, [[J. C. Iselin]] and [[J. L. Frey]], who were engaged upon work similar to his own, became so unfriendly towards him that after a time he was forbidden any further use of the manuscripts in the library.

A rumour began to be circulated that Wettstein's projected text would take the [[Socinian]] side in the case of such passages as [[First Epistle to Timothy|i Timothy]] iii. 16;&lt;ref&gt;See [[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in other ways (e.g. by regarding Jesus's temptation as a subjective experience, and by explaining some of the miracles in a naturalistic way) he began to be suspected of [[heresy]]. At length in 1729 the charge of projecting an edition of the Greek Testament savouring of [[Arianism|Arian]] and Socinian views was formally laid against him. The end of the long and unedifying trial was his dismissal, on 13 May 1730, from his office of minister of St Leonard's.

===Amsterdam===
He then moved from Basel to [[Amsterdam]], where another relative, [[Johann Heinrich Wettstein]] (1649–1726), had an important printing and publishing business. Here excellent editions of the classics were being published, as well as Gerard of Maastricht's edition of the Greek Testament. Wettstein had begun to print an edition of the Greek Testament, but this was suddenly stopped for some unknown reason. As soon as he reached Amsterdam, in 1730, he published anonymously the ''Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci editionem'', which he had proposed should accompany his Greek Testament, and which was later republished by him, with additions, in 1751. The next year (1731) the [[Remonstrants]] offered him the chair of philosophy in their college at [[Amsterdam]], vacated by the illness of [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Leclerc]], on condition that he clear himself of the suspicion of [[heresy]]. He returned to Basel, and received a reversal (22 March 1732) of the previous decision, and re-admission to all his clerical offices. But, on his becoming a candidate for the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] chair at Basel, his [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] opponents blocked his appointment, and he retired to Amsterdam.

At length, he was allowed to instruct the Remonstrant students in philosophy and Hebrew on certain humiliating conditions. For the rest of his life he continued as professor in the Remonstrant college, declining in 1745 the Greek chair at Basel. In 1746 he once more visited England, and collated [[Syriac language|Syriac]] manuscripts for his final, great work. At last this appeared in 1751–1752, in two folio volumes, under the title ''Novum Testamentum Graecum editionis receptae cum lectionibus variantibus codicum'' manuscripts, etc. He did not venture to put new readings in the body of his page, but consigned them to a place between the Textus Receptus and the full list of various readings. Beneath the latter he gave a commentary, consisting principally of a mass of valuable illustrations and parallels drawn from classical and rabbinical literature, which has formed a storehouse for all later commentators. In his ''Prolegomena'' he gave an admirable methodical account of the manuscripts, the versions and the readings of the fathers, as well as the troubled story of the difficulties with which he had had to contend in the prosecution of the work of his life. He was the first to designate uncial manuscripts by Roman capitals, and cursive manuscripts by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] figures. He did not long survive the completion of this work. He died in Amsterdam. 
&lt;!--OUT OF DATE
Wettstein's New Testament has never been republished in its entirety. The London printer, [[William Bowyer]], published, in 1763, a text in which he introduced the readings recommended by Wettstein; [[J. S. Semler]] republished the ''Prolegomena'' and appendix (''Wetstenii libelli ad crisin atque interpretationem Novi Testamenti'', Halle, 1764); [[A. Lotze]] commenced a new edition of the work, but the ''Prolegomena'' only appeared later (Rotterdam, 1831), and this with much negative criticism --&gt;

===Work===
Wettstein rendered service to textual criticism by his collection of various readings and his methodical account of the manuscripts and other sources.

Through his laborious study of [[Codex Alexandrinus]], he found misinterpretations or calculated mistakes of New Testament written in Greek that question the very basis of Christianity. For example, the misreading of Greek word "God" with "who", so the passage from the book of I Timothy no longer read: "Christ as God made manifest in the flesh, and justified in Spirit", but instead read: "Christ who was made manifest in the flesh, and justified in Spirit". This finding, and some others led him to question his faith in the Divinity of Christ, which is evidenced by his later works.

Some opponents considered his work to be less valuable because of his prejudice against the Latin version and the principle of grouping manuscripts in families which had been recommended by Richard Bentley and [[Johann Albrecht Bengel|J. A. Bengel]].

See Wettstein's account of his labours and trials in his ''Nov. Test. i.'': 1751. ''Novum Testamentum Græcum editionis receptæ, cum Lectionibus Variantibus Codicum MSS., Editionum aliarum, Versionum et Patrum, necnon Commentario pleniore ex Scriptoribus veteribus, Hebræis, Græcis, et Latinis, historiam et vim verborum illustrante'', in two volumes. Amsterdam: Amstelædami. Reprinted in 1962 by Graz, Austria: Akademische Druck-u. Verlagsanstalt.

'''Judicial interference''' is the actions of [[courts]] or [[judicial officer]]s in matters that are interpreted by some as beyond their [[constitution]]ally established role. &lt;!-- I believe I have that constitutional part correct; if not, it demonstrates the original author's need to have been more accurate/complete in his description. --&gt;

== Philosophy ==
The cornerstone of the “More philosophy” is the concept of perfection - the belief that people and situations are right the way they are&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Life in a Commune Doesn’t Have to Be Spartan and Dreary|last=Sansweet|first=Stephen|date=9 April 1974|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/vic-flash.html|title=Vic's flash to perfection|last=Baranco|first=Victor|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that perfection includes the potential for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunkissedhiker.com/blog/purple-people-lafayette-morehouse-lafayette-ca/|title=Purple People, Lafayette Morehouse {{!}} Lafayette, CA|last=Chelsea|first=|date=|website=Sunkissed Hiker|archive-url=|archive-date=24 August 2015|dead-url=|access-date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ic.org/directory/lafayette-morehouse/|title=Lafayette Morehouse|last=|first=|date=|website=Fellowship for Intentional Community|archive-url=|archive-date=28 February 2016|dead-url=|access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the viewpoint that individuals are totally responsible for their lives, including thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mhsmirador.com/feature/2010/05/28/lafayette-charitable-group-life-thrives/|title=Lafayette Charitable Group Life Thrives|last=Lee|first=Mackenzie|date=28 May 2010|website=The Mirador Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=New Life Style Flourishes|last=Yarrow|first=Russ|date=6 July 1976|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The community was founded by Dr. Victor Baranco (son of the Oakland jazz pianist [[Wilbert Baranco]]), a self-made millionaire who had achieved “the American dream” but was still looking for more in life.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One night in 1966 he deliberately examined his life and concluded that he and everything in the world were perfect and that he was responsible for everything that had happened to him.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Based on this realization, in 1968 he conceived of the Morehouse lifestyle as one in which people could live together pleasurably without doing anything they didn’t want to do,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maxim.com/maxim-man/how-to-free-love-commune-neil-strauss-2018-6|title=INSIDE THE WORLD'S LONGEST-RUNNING, MOST SUCCESSFUL FREE LOVE COMMUNE|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=17 June 2018|work=Maxim|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://livingexperiment.com/resistance/|title=Resistance to Pleasure|last=Gerasimo|first=Pilar|date=|website=The Living Experiment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while serving the world unselfishly and profiting by it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since its inception, Lafayette Morehouse has conducted extensive research in how a group can live together pleasurably,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; including groups as small as two, focusing on topics such as lifestyles, communication, coupled relationships, and sensuality.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=We’re Just People’ At More University|last=Dewolk|first=Roland|date=|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sensuality was only one among many areas of investigation, this was the topic for which the group became best known.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Their investigations of female equality and the importance of the clitoris in female orgasm were pioneering in the late 1960s and 1970s, and these findings were sometimes sensationalized in the press.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The group gained notoriety for the 1976 public demonstrations of a woman in continuous orgasm for three hours, which it claims were the first known demonstrations of that kind. The group has since trained many people to this standard.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The findings of their social experiments were initially presented as courses under the auspices of the Institute of Human Abilities.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In 1977 the State of California adopted laws to encourage and regulate new educational institutions, and More University was created as a DBA of Lafayette Morehouse Inc., a for-profit corporation that had been formed in 1972.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/more-university.html|title=More University|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More University was authorized to grant bachelor of humanities degrees, master’s degrees in communication, as well as doctoral degrees in lifestyles and sensuality, with the faculty drawn from senior members of the group.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/purple-haze/Content?oid=2132347|title=Purple Haze A speedy tour of the Morehouse commune|last=Boulware|first=Jack|date=23 August 1995|work=SF Weekly|access-date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49248350|title=Planet medicine|last=1944-|first=Grossinger, Richard,|date=2000|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=1556433913|edition= Rev., 7th|location=Berkeley, Calif.|oclc=49248350}}&lt;/ref&gt; It completely complied with the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 1977 as a “State Authorized” university.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031203150354/http://www.bppve.ca.gov/reform_act/index.html Private Postsecondary and Vocational Reform Act of 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; Although criticized as a “diploma mill,” over a 20-year period it granted degrees to fewer than 90 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=No More Degrees, state orders School.|last=Edwards|first=Katherine|date=5 November 1996|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, responding to a change in the law, Lafayette Morehouse declined to pursue recertification of the University under the new rules, and More University was dissolved.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; No further degrees were granted and the group resumed doing business as Lafayette Morehouse, with much of the same curriculum.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beneteau: A brief history &amp; resource guide"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.trellishouse.org/lafayette-morehouse/|title=A brief history &amp; resource guide|website=Lafayette Morehouse and Victor Baranco|last=Beneteau|first=Marc|series=Adventures in Relationship and Community|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Victor Baranco’s death in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2002/09/12/news/obits.html|accessdate=June 7, 2008|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|date=September 12, 2002|quote='''Victor Baranco Jr.''', 68, of Haleiwa, educator and founder of the More Phylosophy, died Saturday.

Over the years a substantial number of communal living experiments using Morehouse principles have been conducted.{{refn|group=note|name="quantity"|Sources have estimated between 30 and 100 such communities existed at the peak in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beneteau: A brief history &amp; resource guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/sgt-bilko-meets-the-new-culture-19711209|title=Sgt Bilko Meets the New Culture|last=Green|first=Robin|date=9 Dec 1971|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Most of these have been in northern California,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; but related communities have also been located in New York,&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/what-this-66-year-old-model-learned-on-a-commune-women-bring-the-joy-to-the-table-172820996.html|title=66-Year-Old Model on Her Unconventional Beauty, Hedonistic Commune Life|last=Greenfield|first=Beth|date=8 March 2017|website=Yahoo!

== Life in the Community ==
The everyday goal is to live pleasurably with one’s friends.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The group has found that people who live deliberately and with awareness enjoy more fun relationships, which have tended to endure and deepen in intimacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Residents pursue their individual goals with the support of the group.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Residents also share group goals and participate in group activities, such as maintenance of the property, entertaining family and friends, putting on courses and holiday celebrations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

People have their own money and make contributions to communal expenses, goals, and projects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some residents have jobs outside of Morehouse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

One group goal is taking care of the less fortunate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Residents are encouraged to include this as an ongoing part of their lives, according to the viewpoint that the best life includes serving the world unselfishly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

According to their website, “There is no label regarding sexual choices that applies across the board for our group. Sexual preference is a personal choice. Some people here are celibate, many are monogamous and some have more than one partner.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/faq.html#poly|title=Are you polyamorous?|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents adhere to a strict sexual health screening program, begun in the late 1970s, to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/faq.html#std|title=How do you maintain the sexual health of your community in this age of STDs that are incurable or potentially fatal?|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political expression of the More philosophy is called the one no-vote, a decision-making system in which any participant, regardless of age, gender, time with the community, or any other factor can cast an irrevocable “no-vote” which stops any proposed new action.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/one_no-vote.html|title=One no-vote|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is meant to encourage open communication and ensure that all voices are heard and considered before moving forward.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ic.org/directory/oakland-morehouse/|title=Oakland Morehouse|last=|first=|date=|website=Fellowship for Intentional Community|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
The business of Lafayette Morehouse Inc. relies on word of mouth, without advertising.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The courses, in which research findings are presented, are held at various locations and produce income for communally-held goals, communal financial obligations and the ongoing research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Course topics include pleasurable interpersonal relationships, effective communication, alternative lifestyles, jealousy, money, philosophical viewpoints on perfection, and a gratifying sensual life.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; “It is not our goal to have others live as we do, but rather to offer our findings so that our students can use whatever elements they find beneficial. Those situations that all people encounter and must resolve in order to have happy, fulfilling lives are addressed in these courses.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One source estimates that, as of 1997, over 100,000 people had taken at least one Lafayette Morehouse course, and over 1,000 people had lived in a Morehouse and participated in the social research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Criticisms and Controversies ==

One widely cited criticism of Victor Baranco and the Morehouse community was in David Felton's book ''Mindfuckers''.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/516433|title=Mindfuckers; a source book on the rise of acid fascism in America, including material on Charles Manson, Mel Lyman, Victor Baranco, and their followers,|last=Felton.|first=David,|date=1972|publisher=Straight Arrow Books|others=Green, Robin., Dalton, David, 1945-|isbn=0879320389|location=[San Francisco]|oclc=516433}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section on Baranco was repackaged from two Rolling Stone articles, and the principle allegation was that he profited excessively by having group members pay to live in houses while renovating them.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.trussel.com/lyman/guru.html|title=Beyond Shazam at Guru Gulch|last=Green|first=Robin|date=3 August 1972|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=3 June 2018|issue=114|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Jann Wenner, the editor of Rolling Stone, said the material on Baranco was written to personally attack Baranco.{{refn|group=note|name="hagan"|''[Jann Wenner,] in an Oedipal rage...attacked Baranco in the only way he knew how: He assigned writer Robin Green, his resident assassin, to profile him [Baranco] in Rolling Stone and "really expose him for the hustler he was."'' - in ''Sticky Fingers: The Life and Times of Jann Wenner'' by Joe Hagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987992115|title=Sticky fingers : the life and times of Jann Wenner and Rolling stone magazine|last=1971-|first=Hagan, Joe,|pages=253–254|isbn=9781101874370|edition= First |location=New York|oclc=987992115}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} These allegations against Baranco have not been repeated since 1972.

Many journalists have described Morehouse as a “sex commune”&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; or “sex cult,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Nicole-Daedone-s-mission-of-orgasmic-meditation-2368554.php|title=Nicole Daedone's mission of orgasmic meditation|last=Bowles|first=Nellie|date=12 June 2011|work=SF Gate|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the group’s sexual research and courses taught on sexual topics.

The group has been criticized for having poor relationships with its neighbors.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Billingsley-1994-p-13" /&gt;  Most of these criticisms date to the period of time (1991 – 2000) in which the group opened its doors and provided food and shelter to a large number of homeless people as their guests, using military surplus tents.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Lawyers Open Morehouse Court Fight|last=Wasiczko|first=Donna|date=25 May 1994|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors were angered by the influx of unattractive people,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; and the county sought to enforce zoning codes to end the activity. The group argued it was their right to use their own home to take care of people that were homeless.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; In an effort to mute extensive criticism in the press, the group undertook a lawsuit against the San Francisco Chronicle, which they lost. After a long court battle with Contra Costa County, Lafayette Morehouse was ordered to take down the tents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6915">This is a list of organizations and institutions of professional sexologists, sex researchers, and sexual behavior scientists.  These do not include organizations of non-professionals, political advocacy or activist groups (although some organizations may engage in some advocacy as one of their activities), self-help or social groups, groups of enthusiasts for a topic in sexology, or websites unassociated with any actual organization or institution.  These organizations and institutions are recognized by their local governments (such as by incorporation) or are administrative units within a larger organization that is.

'''Liturgics''' is the [[academic discipline]] dedicated to the study of [[liturgy]] (public worship rites, rituals, and practices). Liturgics scholars typically specialize in a single approach drawn from another scholarly field.  The most common sub-disciplines are: [[history]] or [[church history]], [[theology]], and [[anthropology]]. Although liturgics scholars using these approaches apply the principles of their respective disciplines to their research, all liturgics scholars focus their work in the [[ritual]] behaviors of the members of faith communities.

'''Mensural notation''' is the musical notation system used for European vocal [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music from the later part of the 13th century until about 1600. The term "mensural" refers to the ability of this system to describe precisely measured rhythmic durations in terms of numerical proportions between note values. Its modern name is inspired by the terminology of medieval theorists, who used terms like ''musica mensurata'' ("measured music") or ''cantus mensurabilis'' ("measurable song") to refer to the rhythmically defined polyphonic music of their age, as opposed to ''musica plana'' or ''musica choralis'', i.e., Gregorian [[plainchant]]. Mensural notation was employed principally for compositions in the tradition of vocal polyphony, whereas plainchant retained its own, older system of [[neumes|neume notation]] throughout the period. Besides these, some purely instrumental music could be written in various forms of instrument-specific [[tablature]] notation.

Mensural notation grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called [[rhythmic modes]], which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' ("The art of measured chant") by [[Franco of Cologne]] ({{nowrap|c. 1280}}). A much expanded system allowing for greater rhythmic complexity was introduced in France with the stylistic movement of the [[Ars nova]] in the 14th century, while [[Trecento music|Italian 14th-century music]] developed its own, somewhat different variant. Around 1400, the French system was adopted across Europe, and became the standard form of notation of the [[Renaissance music]] of the 15th and 16th centuries. After around 1600, mensural notation gradually evolved into modern [[bar (music)|measure]] (or bar) notation.

The decisive innovation of mensural notation was the systematic use of different note shapes to denote rhythmic durations that stood in well-defined, hierarchical numerical relations to each other. While less context dependent than notation in rhythmic modes, mensural notation differed from the modern system in that the values of notes were still somewhat context-dependent. In particular, a note could have the length of either two or three units of the next smaller order, whereas in modern notation these relations are invariably binary. Whether a note was to be read as ternary ("perfect") or binary ("imperfect") was a matter partly of context rules and partly of a system of mensuration signs comparable to modern time signatures. There was also a complex system of temporarily shifting note values by proportion factors like 2:1 or 3:2. Mensural notation used no bar lines, and it sometimes employed special connected note forms (ligatures) inherited from earlier medieval notation. Unlike in the earliest beginnings of the writing of polyphonic music, and unlike in modern practice, mensural notation was usually not written in a [[Sheet music|score]] arrangement but in individual parts.

Mensural notation was extensively described and codified by contemporary theorists. As these writings, like all academic work of the time, were usually in Latin, many features of the system are still conventionally referred to by their Latin terms.

The system of note types used in mensural notation closely corresponds to the modern system. The mensural ''brevis'' is nominally the ancestor of the modern [[double whole note|double whole note (breve)]]; likewise, the ''semibrevis'' corresponds to the [[whole note|whole note (semibreve)]], the ''minima'' to the [[half note|half note (minim)]], the ''semiminima'' to the [[Quarter note|quarter note (crotchet)]], and the ''fusa'' to the [[Eighth note|eighth note (quaver)]]. Very rarely, mensural notation also used yet smaller subdivisions, such as the ''semifusa'' (corresponding to the [[sixteenth note]] or semiquaver). On the other hand, there were also two larger values, the ''[[Longa (music)|longa]]'' (quadruple whole note or long) and the ''[[Maxima (music)|maxima]]'' (or ''duplex longa'', called a ''large'' in Britain), which are no longer in regular use today.

Despite these nominal equivalences, each note had a much shorter temporal value than its modern counterpart. Between the 14th and 16th centuries, composers repeatedly introduced new note shapes for ever smaller temporal divisions of rhythm, and the older, longer notes were slowed down in proportion. The basic metrical relationship of a long to a short beat shifted from longa–breve in the 13th century, to breve–semibreve in the 14th, to semibreve–minim by the end of the 15th, and finally to minim–semiminim (i.e., half and quarter notes, or minim and crotchet) in modern notation. Thus, what was originally the shortest of all note values used, the semibreve, has become the longest note used routinely today, the whole note.

Originally, all notes were written in solid, filled-in form ("black notation"). In the mid-15th century, scribes began to use hollow note shapes ("white notation"), reserving black shapes only for the smallest note values. This change was probably motivated by the change from [[parchment]] to paper as the most common writing material, as paper was less suited to holding large dots of ink.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the notes, the shapes of the rest symbols in mensural notation are already similar to their modern descendants (with the smaller values being successively introduced in the course of the period of mensural notation). The rest symbols of the larger values had a clear visual logic reflecting their time durations, based on the breve rest being a vertical stroke the length of one staff space. For the longa rests, a visual distinction was made depending on whether the longa was imperfect (two breves long) or perfect. Accordingly, their signs were visually twice or three times the length of a breve rest respectively, while the semibreve rest was half that length. Maxima rests, in turn, were groups of two or three longa rests combined. If several longa rests followed each other, groups of either two or three of them were written together on the same staff line to indicate whether they were supposed to be grouped into perfect or imperfect maxima units.

Ligatures are groups of notes written together, usually indicating [[melisma]]tic singing of the same syllable over several notes. Ligature forms exist only for the larger note values from the semibreve upwards. Their use in mensural notation was a holdover from the earlier [[Modal notation|modal rhythmic system]], of which they inherited some of their rhythmic meaning.

The rhythmic values of ligatures in modal notation had been based on a metric reinterpretation of the ligature [[neume]]s used since much earlier in the notation of [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian plainchant]]. In modal notation, ligatures represented stereotyped rhythmic sequences of short and long notes, typically involving groups of one or more initial short notes (i.e., breves) and one final long note (i.e., a longa). In mensural notation, this rule was generalized, with all other rhythmic combinations being classified in terms of deviation from this basic pattern. In medieval terminology, a ligature possessed ''perfectio'' ("perfection")&lt;ref&gt;Note that the term "perfection" is here used in a different sense than that of the ternary versus binary note durations. Whether any breve or longa in a ligature was itself of perfect or imperfect duration was a matter independent of the ligature forms.&lt;/ref&gt; if its final note was a longa (L), and it had ''proprietas'' ("its [normal] property") if its first note was a breve (B).&lt;ref&gt;Eggebrecht 1991: 152f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, a note pair of B–L ''(cum proprietate et cum perfectione)'' could be written with the most basic of ligature shapes, those inherited from plainchant, namely the descending ''[[clivis]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature descending BL black.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in descending order, connected with a vertical stroke and with a second vertical downward stroke on the left]]) and the ascending ''[[podatus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending BL black 1.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads on top of each other, connected by a vertical line on the right]]). Likewise, three-note groups of B–B–L could be written with some of the inherited ternary neumes, such as the ''[[porrectus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature BBL black porrectus.svg|x20px]], direction down–up), the ''[[torculus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature BBL black torculus.svg|x20px]], direction up–down), or the ''[[scandicus]]'' ([[File:Mensural ligature BBL black scandicus.svg|x20px]], direction up–up).

If, by way of exception, the first note was to be a longa, this was signaled by a reversal of its visual "property", namely the use of initial stems: the descending clivis had its downward stem removed ([[File:Mensural ligature descending LL black.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in descending order, connected with a vertical stroke]]), while, conversely, the ascending podatus had one added to it ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending LL black 1.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads on top of each other, connected by a vertical line on the right, with a descending stroke on the left]] or [[File:Mensural ligature ascending LL black 2.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads on top of each other, connected by a vertical line on the right, with a descending stroke on the right]]).

On the other hand, if the final note was to be a breve ''(sine perfectione)'', this was signaled by a change in the noteheads themselves: the descending sequence of square heads was replaced with a single diagonal beam ([[File:Mensural ligature descending BB black.svg|x20px|alt=black downward rhomboid with a descending stroke on the left]]), while the ascending podatus had its second note folded out to the right ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending BB black.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in ascending order connected by a vertical stroke]]). Both sequences correspond to the initial B–B segments of the ternary porrectus and torculus respectively.

If both exceptions co-occurred ''(sine proprietate et sine perfectione)'', both graphical alterations were combined accordingly.

In addition to sequences of longa and breve, ligatures could also contain pairs of semibreves (but not normally a single one).&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 100 mentions some rare exceptions&lt;/ref&gt; These were called ''cum opposita proprietate'', and always marked by an upward-pointing stem to the left of the note pair.

There were also some alternate versions of the ascending ligatures. Thus, the basic ascending B–L podatus shape was replaced by one where the second note was both folded out to the right and marked with an extra stem ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending BL black 2.svg|x20px|alt=two square black noteheads in ascending order, connected with a vertical stroke and with a second vertical downward stroke on the right]]), as if these two modifications were meant to cancel each other out.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The ascending L–L ''(sine proprietate)'' was modified accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Some rare variants also existed for ascending ligatures with a final breve ''(sine perfectione)'', involving a reversed form of the descending oblique stroke, either with or without an initial stem ([[File:Mensural ligature ascending oblique white 1.svg|x20px]][[File:Mensural ligature ascending oblique white 2.svg|x20px]]). However, contemporary theorists could not agree which of these two was supposed to be the B–B and which the L–B version (Apel 1962: 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligatures could contain any number of notes. In multi-note ligatures, the rules about initial and final values are applied in analogy to those in the binary forms. In addition, the following rules hold for notes in all positions:&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Any notehead with an upward stem to its left is the first of a pair of semibreves ''(cum opposita proprietate)''.
*Any medial notehead with a downward stem to its right is a longa.
*A prolonged, double-width notehead with or without a downward stem to its right is a maxima.
*Any other notehead not covered by any of the rules above is a breve.

Mensural notation distinguished between several basic metric patterns of a piece of music, which were defined as combinations of ternary and binary subdivisions of time on successive hierarchical levels and roughly correspond to modern [[bar (music)|bar]] structures. The division of the semibreve into minims was called ''prolatio'', that of the breve into semibreves was called ''tempus'', and that of the longa into breves was known as ''modus''. The division of the maxima into longas was called ''modus maximarum'' or ''modus maior''; in the modern literature it is also sometimes called ''maximodus''. Each of these levels could be either perfect (ternary) or imperfect (binary). The two types of prolatio were also known as "major prolation" and "minor prolation" respectively.

The perfect modus and maximodus became rare in practice after the 14th century. Of most practical importance were the subdivisions from the breve downwards, as by that time the semibreves rather than the breves had taken over the function of the basic counting unit. The four possible combinations of tempus and prolatio could be signaled by a set of mensuration signs at the beginning of a composition: a circle for tempus perfectum, a semicircle for tempus imperfectum, each combined with a dot for prolatio maior, or no dot for prolatio minor. These correspond to modern measures of {{music|time|9|8}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|6|8}}, and {{music|time|2|4}} respectively (assuming a reduction factor of 1:4 in transcription, i.e., mapping mensural minims to modern quavers), or alternatively {{music|time|9|4}}, {{music|time|3|2}}, {{music|time|6|4}} and {{music|time|2|2}} respectively (with a reduction factor of 1:2). In each case, one breve corresponds to one modern bar. In addition, each of these basic patterns had a diminished (''diminutum'') variant, indicated by a vertical stroke through the sign ([[File:Tempus perf prol mai dim.svg|x22px]], [[File:Tempus perf prol min dim.svg|x22px]], [[File:Tempus impf prol mai dim.svg|x22px]], [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]]). These so-called "cut signs" indicated a reduction of all temporal values by a factor of two. (The signs [[File:Tempus impf prol min.svg|x22px]] and [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]] are the source of the modern "[[common time]]" and "[[alla breve]]" signatures {{music|common-time}} and {{music|cut-time}} respectively.) A reversed semicircle [[File:Tempus impf rev.svg|x22px]] was usually understood to be the same as [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]].

There were normally no special signs for indicating the higher divisions of modus and maximodus. However, groups of longa rests at the beginning of a piece (which occurred frequently, as often some voices in a polyphonic composition would enter later than others) could be used as an indicator of the intended meter. If longa rests were written across three staff spaces, they were perfect; moreover, if they occurred in groups of three written together on the same staff line they indicated perfect maximodus. Occasionally, if no voice happened to have a sufficiently long rest at the beginning of the piece, a dummy rest symbol of one maxima's worth of longae would be written to the left of the mensuration sign; in that case it was understood as part of the time signature and not actually executed as a rest.

==Imperfection and alteration==

The time value of some notes could change according to their immediate context in certain situations. The rules for this were developed on the basis of the typical rhythmic nature of medieval music in the 13th century. Most of this music followed the same basic metric pattern, which in modern notation would be written as a swift {{music|time|6|4}} (or {{music|time|6|8}}) meter.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 242f.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, melodies consisted mainly of ternary long notes (in modern notation, dotted minims), or alternating sequences of binary long notes and short notes (minims and crotchets), or groups of three short notes. In the 13th century, all of these were notated using only the longa and breve notes. A longa was automatically understood to fill a whole ternary metric group whenever it was in the neighborhood of other notes that did the same, i.e., whenever it was followed either by another longa or by a full group of three breves. When, however, the longa was preceded or followed by a single breve, then both filled a ternary group together. Thus, the longa had to be reduced to a value of two (it was "imperfected"). When, finally, there were only two breves in between two longae, then the two breves had to fill up a metrical group together. This was done by lengthening the second breve ''(brevis altera)'' to a value of two, while the first ''(brevis recta)'' kept its normal value.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two breves in m.&amp;nbsp;22 would normally imply alteration (s-l), but harmonic considerations lead most editors to assume the scribe simply forgot to add a stem to the first note.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} {{audio|Sumer is icumen.ogg|play}}]]

[[File:Dufay Ave Regina cantus.svg|thumb|right|400px|Upper voice of "Ave Regina" by [[Guillaume Dufay]], a mid-15th century piece in largely homophonic tempus perfectum. Arrows are added to indicate imperfection of breves by subsequent semibreves and alteration in pairs of semibreves. Breves marked with a blue cross are perfect. Note the separator dots in the second line, enforcing a syncopated rhythm on the Sb groups. ([[:File:Dufay Ave Regina.pdf|Full score]]; {{audio|Dufay Ave Regina.ogg|listen}})]]

At the earliest stage, this basic principle applied only to the relation between longa and breve. Beginning with [[Franco of Cologne]], the same pattern was also applied between breves and semibreves,&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 344.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, with [[Philippe de Vitry]]'s theory of the [[Ars nova]], it was taken yet another level down, to the newly introduced minims. From that time onwards, imperfection and alteration could happen on the level of breves and semibreves whenever the piece was in tempus perfectum, and it could happen between semibreves and minims if the piece was in prolatio maior. The divisions below the minim were invariably binary. Theorists developed an intricate set of precedence rules for when and how to apply imperfection, together with a complex terminology for its different types.&lt;ref&gt;The following overview is based on Apel 1962: 115–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, a note was imperfected by one of the next smaller order, e.g., a breve (B) by a semibreve (Sb), and thereby lost one third of its own nominal value (ex. [a–c]). This was called "full imperfection" ''(imperfectio ad totum)''. It could be induced either backwards (''a parte post''), or forwards (''a parte ante'', ex. [c]). If both readings were possible, backwards imperfection took precedence. The smaller unit could also be replaced by a group of yet smaller notes of equivalent length, e.g., a semibreve's worth of minims or semiminims (ex. [d]). Imperfection could also apply recursively, for instance with an Sb imperfecting a preceding B and being itself imperfected by a following minim (ex. [e]), if the meter was suitable (e.g., tempus perfectum and prolatio maior).

Imperfection typically occurred if two larger notes were separated by a single smaller unit, as in a sequence of B–Sb–B–Sb. If, however, they were separated by a group of either two or three of the smaller units, there was no imperfection: in the case of two, alteration was applied instead (ex. [f]); while in the case of three the group was simply left to fill the space of a perfect unit by themselves (ex. [g]). If, in turn, there was a longer sequence of four or more smaller units before the next longer value, then the first of them induced imperfection (ex. [h]). Imperfection was barred on any note that was followed directly by another of the same order ''(similis ante similem perfecta)''. Thus, the middle part of a sequence like [[File:Mensural alteration modern.svg|x25px|alt=dotted half + quarter + half + dotted half in modern 3/4 time]] could only be written using alteration (as shown in ex.[f]); the use of imperfection like in ex.(c) was excluded, because the presence of the subsequent breve blocked it.

The normal reading of the groups could be overridden by placing a separator dot ''(punctus divisionis)'' between the notes to indicate which of them were meant to form a ternary unit together (ex. [i]). If the separator dot was placed after a potentially ternary note (e.g., a breve in tempus perfectum), it typically had the effect of keeping it perfect, i.e., overriding an imperfection that would otherwise have applied to it. In these cases it was also called ''punctus perfectionis''. Besides this, a dot could also be used in the same way as today: when it was placed after a note that was nominally binary (e.g., a breve in tempus imperfectum), it augmented it by one half ''(punctus augmentationis)''.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 122–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some situations, imperfection could be induced not by a note of the next smaller order but by an even smaller one. For instance, a breve in prolatio maior, which could be thought of as being composed of two perfect semibreves, could be imperfected by an adjacent minim, taking away one third of one of its two halves, thus reducing its total length from 6 to 5 (ex.[j]). This was called "partial imperfection" ''(imperfectio ad partem)''. Imperfection involving note values two orders apart (e.g., a breve by a minim, or a longa by a semibreve) was called "imperfection of an immediate part" ''(ad partem propinquam)''; while the (rarer) case where it occurred across even greater distances (e.g., between a longa and a minim) was known as "imperfection of a remote part" (''ad partem remotam'', ex. [k]). Finally, partial imperfection could also apply from both sides of a long note at once (''ad partes'', ex [l–m]). In this way, a note that was nominally 9 beats long could be reduced to any value down to 4, or a note that was 12 beats long to any value down to 7.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 118, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rests, unlike notes, had an invariable duration and could not be imperfected or altered; however, they could induce imperfection or alteration on a neighboring note.
{{clear}}
==Proportions and colorations==

An individual composition was not limited to a single set of tempus and prolatio. Meters could be shifted in the course of a piece, either by inserting a new mensuration sign, or by using numeric proportions. A "3" indicates that all notes will be reduced to one-third of their value; a "2" indicates double tempo; a fraction "{{sfrac|3|2}}" indicates three in the time of two, and so forth. The proportion 2 is usually understood to have the same effect as the use of a cut sign with a vertical stroke ([[File:Tempus impf prol min duplum.svg|x22px]] = [[File:Tempus impf prol min dim.svg|x22px]]).

The use of numeric proportions can interact with the use of different basic mensurations in fairly complex ways. This has led to a certain amount of uncertainty and controversy over the correct interpretation of these notation devices, both in contemporary theory and in modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Busse Berger 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of altering the metrical value of notes was coloration. This refers to the device of literally marking a note as rhythmically exceptional by writing it in a different color. In the earlier period, when normal notes were black, the exceptional ones were written in red, or sometimes hollow. In the later period, the practice was reversed; as the normal notes were now hollow, the exceptional ones were filled out in black. In either case, "colored" notes are understood to have {{frac|2|3}} of their normal duration, and are always imperfect with respect to their next smaller sub-divisions.

Coloration applied to a group of breves (ex. [a]) was known as ''color temporis'', while that of a group of semibreves (ex. [b–c]) was called ''color prolationis''. The resulting rhythmic effect, as expressed in modern notation, differs somewhat according to whether the affected notes were normally perfect or imperfect according to the basic mensuration of the music. Applied to perfect notes (ex. [a–b]), coloration creates the effect of a [[hemiola]]: three binary rhythmic groups in the space normally taken up by two ternary ones, but with the next smaller time units (semibreves in [a], minims in [b]) remaining constant. When applied to notes that were already imperfect according to their normal values (ex. [c]), coloration results in the effect of a group of triplets, with all rhythmic units reduced by two thirds.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 134f.&lt;/ref&gt; Another special form of coloration was that applied to a group of a single semibreve and a following minim, called ''minor color'' (ex. [d]). Whereas it would logically be expected to result in a triplet group ([[File:Figure rythmique noire croche en triolet.svg|x20px]]), it was instead conventionally executed as a dotted group equivalent to a dotted minim and a semiminim (note that in the context of white notation, the colored – i.e., blackened – version of the minim in the ''minor color'' group happened to look just like a normal semiminim [[File:Black mensural minim.svg|x20px]] anyway, even though nominally it was considered a different type of note.)&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of colored notes (at that time written in red) was introduced by Philippe de Vitry and flourished in the so-called [[ars subtilior]] of the late 14th century.

The example above, the chanson "Belle, bonne, sage" by [[Baude Cordier]], written in a heart-shaped manuscript, is a rhythmically complex piece of [[ars subtilior]]. It uses several notation techniques for shifting between rhythms:&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 482f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*red notes: diminution {{frac|2|3}}
*shift to ''prolatio maior'': here with implied augmentation minim→semibreve
*white notes: diminution {{frac|1|2}} (two breves in the time of one)
*proportion "3": diminution {{frac|1|3}}
*proportion "{{sfrac|8|9}}": eight notes in the time of nine notes of the preceding bar

===Mensural canons===
Sometimes, music was written in such a way that the same line of music had to be performed under two or more mensuration schemes, typically leading to slower (augmented) and faster (diminished) versions of the same passage. In such cases, the music was typically notated only once, and several different mensuration signs were placed in front of it together, often supplemented with a verbal instruction of how it should be executed (called a "canon").

This technique could be applied both successively and simultaneously. Successive mensural canons were a characteristic feature of late 14th and early 15th century [[isorhythmic motet]]s. A famous example is ''[[Nuper rosarum flores]]'' by [[Guillaume Dufay]], where the tenor (notated all in longa and a few breve values) is performed first as tempus perfectum ({{music|time|3|2}}), then tempus imperfectum ({{music|time|2|2}}), then tempus imperfectum diminutum ({{music|time|2|4}}), and finally tempus perfectum diminutum ({{music|time|3|4}}), leading to length relations of 6:4:2:3 between the four repetitions.

Pieces that demanded simultaneous execution of versions of the same music, i.e., [[Prolation canon|contrapunctal canons]], were written by several composers of the [[Franco-Flemish school]] in the late 15th and early 16th century, such as [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Johannes Ockeghem]] or [[Pierre de la Rue]]. Ockeghem's ''[[Missa prolationum]]'' is famous for systematically exploring different ways of combining pairs of voices in mensural canons. In the example given below, from the first "Kyrie" of this mass, both upper voices sing the same notated line, one reading it as "tempus imperfectum" and the other as "tempus perfectum". The two lower voices are similarly coupled with each other. Each of the four voices thus starts the piece in a different mensuration, leading to different bar length in the modern transcription. (The lower voices, which are written in prolatio maior, later shift to a meter where all semibreves are imperfected through black coloration, which means they end up having the same length as those of the upper voices after all.)

==Pitch notation==

Whereas the rules of notating rhythm in Mensural notation were in many ways different from the modern system, the notation of [[pitch (music)|pitch]] already followed much the same principles. Notes were written on [[staff (music)|staves]] of five (sometimes six) lines, prefixed with [[clef]]s, and could be altered by [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s.

===Clefs===
[[File:Clef ranges.svg|thumb|right|377px|Clefs and their typical voice ranges]]
Mensural notation generally uses C and F [[clef]]s, on various lines. G-clefs, while used infrequently throughout the period,  did not come into completely routine use until the later 16th century. Clefs were generally chosen to match the vocal range of a given voice, so as to avoid the need of [[ledger line]]s. Since [[middle C]] lies within that range for most voices, the C-clef is the one most frequently used. For mixed voices, a typical combination of clefs would have the bass clef ([[f (musical note)|F]] on the fourth staff line) in the lowest voice, and tenor clef, alto clef and soprano clef ([[middle C]] on the fourth, third, and first staff line respectively) in the remaining voices. An alternative arrangement, known as ''[[chiavette]]'', had the range of each voice shifted one third up, leading to a combination of F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clefs.

Clefs originally bore shapes more or less closely resembling the letter they represented, but came to develop more ornamental shapes over time. In the F-clef, the two arms of the "F" were changed into two dots sitting to the right of a vertical stem. All three elements could be further modified; in particular, they were often styled as if they were note heads. The C-clef remained a simple, often square, "C"-like shape in most manuscripts, but its arms tended to become hollow rectangles or [[rhomboid]]s in later manuscripts and especially in music prints of the 16th century. The G-clef developed a curved ornamental [[swash (typography)|swash]] typically attached to the top of the letter, which ultimately evolved into the loop shape of the modern form.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1962: 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidentals===

The use of [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] in medieval and renaissance music differs significantly from modern practice. Medieval notation used two accidental signs, the "[[b molle]]" ([[File:B molle.svg|x20px]]) and the "[[b durum]]" ([[File:B durum.svg|x20px]]). While the former was identical in form to the modern [[flat (music)|flat]] sign ({{music|flat}}), the latter could be written in forms that resemble either the modern [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{music|sharp}}) or the modern [[Natural (music)|natural]] ({{music|natural}}), but these functions were not distinguished from each other as they are today. The ''b molle'' served to pick out the lower of two alternative semitone steps for a given note (e.g., a B{{music|flat}} as opposed to a B{{music|natural}}), while the ''b durum'' served to pick out the higher one (e.g., B{{music|natural}} as opposed to B{{music|flat}}, but also F{{music|sharp}} as opposed to F{{music|natural}}, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Apel|first=Willi|encyclopedia=Harvard Dictionary of Music|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1970|article=accidentals}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meanings of both signs thus overlaps with that of the natural sign today. Until the 16th century, only the flat signs regularly occurred as [[key signature]]s at the beginning of a staff (one or at most two flats).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Apel|first=Willi|encyclopedia=Harvard Dictionary of Music|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1970|article=key signature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knighton|first1=Tess|last2=Fallows|first2=David|title=Companion to Medieval and Renaissance Music|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both forms of accidentals could occur as temporary accidentals elsewhere; however, in practice they were often not written but left to the performer to infer according to the rules of [[counterpoint]] and [[musica ficta]].

==Miscellaneous symbols==

Mensural notation may contain a number of other symbols.

===Custos===

The custos (pl. custodes) appears at the end of the staff on or between the staff lines. It indicates the pitch of the first note that occurs on the following staff that belongs to that part relative to the clef of the current staff. This helps performers to prepare to sing the next note. If the next staff for the part occurs on the following page, two custodes may appear immediately next to each other.

===Corona===

The corona appears above the last note of the piece (or section). It is similar to the [[fermata]] in modern notation. It typically appears above the last note at each part of a piece to indicate the note should be held longer that its value indicates. If it does not appear at the end of a piece, typically a short pause is expected before proceeding with the notes after the note with the corona.

===Signum Congruentiae===

The signum congruentiae indicates the position of entry of another voice. This is used to denote [[Canon (music)|canons]]. Instead of writing out all parts, only one part is written out. The signum congruentiae indicates that when the previous part has progressed up to the point where the signum congruentiae appears, the next part should enter (from the start).

There is some variation in the way signum congruentiae are denoted.

==History==

The most important early stages in the historical development of mensural notation are the works of [[Franco of Cologne]] ({{nowrap|c. 1260}}), [[Petrus de Cruce]] ({{nowrap|c. 1300}}), and [[Philippe de Vitry]] (1322). Franco, in his ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'', was the first to describe the relations between maxima, longa and breve in terms that were independent of the fixed patterns of earlier [[rhythmic mode]]s. He also refined the use of semibreves: while in earlier music, one breve could occasionally be replaced by two semibreves, Franco described the subdivision of the breve as ternary (perfect), dividing it either into three equal or two unequal semibreves (resulting in predominantly triplet rhythmic micro-patterns.)

Petrus de Cruce introduced subdivisions of the breve into even more short notes. However, he did not yet define these as separate smaller hierarchy levels (minim, semiminim etc.), but simply as variable numbers of semibreves. The exact rhythmic interpretation of these groups is partly uncertain. The technique of notating complex groups of short notes by sequences of multiple semibreves was later used more systematically in the notation of [[Music of the Trecento|Italian Trecento]] music.

The decisive refinements that made notation even of extremely complex rhythmic patterns on multiple hierarchical metric levels possible were introduced in France during the time of the [[Ars nova]], with [[Philippe de Vitry]] as the most important theoretician. The Ars nova introduced the shorter note values below the semibreve; it systematicized the relations of perfection and imperfection across all levels down to the minim, and it introduced the devices of proportions and coloration.

During the time of the [[Franco-Flemish]] school in [[Renaissance music]], use of the French notation system spread throughout Europe. This period brought the replacement of black with white notation. It also brought a further slowing down of the duration of the larger note values while introducing even more new small ones (fusa, semifusa etc.). Towards the end of this period, the original rules of perfection and imperfection became gradually obsolescent, as did the use of ligatures. During the 17th century, the system of mensuration signs and proportions gradually developed into the modern time signatures, and new notation devices for time measurements, such as bar lines and ties, were introduced, thus ultimately leading towards the modern notation system.

==Modern use==

[[File:Josquin Domine ne in furore.svg|thumb|right|350px|Beginning of a modern score of a Renaissance piece, [[Josquin des Prez|Josquin]]'s "Domine, ne in furore", showing the use of mensural incipits and [[mensurstrich]] layout. ([[:File:Josquin Domine ne in furore.pdf|Full score]]; {{audio|Josquin Domine ne in furore.mid|listen}})]]
Today, music from the mensural period is normally transcribed into modern notation for performance or study, using a modern score layout, bar lines and often a modernized choice of clefs. A number of special editorial conventions for such transcriptions are common, especially in scholarly editions, where it is desirable that the basic characteristics of the original notation should be recoverable from the modern text.

While 19th and early 20th century editions of Renaissance music often preserved the large note values of the originals, including breves and longs, most modern editions will use scaled-down note values in order to match modern reading habits regarding tempo and beat structure. For 16th century music, a frequent scheme is diminution by a factor of 2 (i.e., rendering semibreves as modern minims), in a modern ''alla breve'' bar. Older music might be diminished by a factor of 4 (rendering semibreves as crotchets) or sometimes 8 (rendering breves as crotchets). For 13th-century pieces, diminution by 16 (rendering breves as quavers) is also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Julie E.|last=Cumming|chapter=Motet and cantilena|editor-last=Duffin|editor-first=Ross W.|title=A Performer's Guide to Medieval Music|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2000|pages=55, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 15th and 16th century music, bar divisions are usually chosen to match the time of a breve, while 14th century Ars nova pieces may be written in measures the length of a longa, and 13th century music in measures the length of a maxima.

To account for these editorial changes, scholarly editions often print a brief notation fragment in the original form in front of each staff at the beginning of a piece, called an "incipit", including the original clefs, mensuration signs, accidentals, and often the first few notes.&lt;ref&gt;Grier 1996: 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, an annotation defining the mapping scheme may be provided over the staff, e.g., "[[File:White mensural semibrevis.svg|x20px|alt=semibreve]]={{music|halfnote}}".

Where ligatures occur in the original text, this is conventionally marked by square brackets over the transcribed notes, while the use of coloration is sometimes marked by broken brackets (⌜...⌝). Flats or sharps that are not written in the original but suggested by the editor are typically indicated by placing them above the note rather than in front of it.

A special issue in representing Renaissance music is how to deal with its characteristic free-flowing rhythms, where modern bar lines can seem to overly highlight what is part of the natural articulation points of the melodic units. To avoid the excessive use of [[tie (music)|ties]] and to allow for a notation more closely reflecting the original, some editions will print bar lines not across the staves, but only in the intermediate spaces between them (a convention sometimes referred to by the German term ''[[Mensurstrich]]''), allowing notes to be read as lasting across a bar line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Werner|last=Breig|chapter=Die Editionsgeschichte der ''Geistlichen Chormusik'' von Heinrich Schütz|editor-first=Helga|editor-last=Lühning|title=Musikedition: Mittler zwischen Wissenschaft und musikalischer Praxis|location=Tübingen|publisher=Niemeyer|year=2002|pages=237–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grier 1996: 165f.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microecosystems''' can exist in locations which are precisely defined by critical [[Natural environment|environmental]] factors within small or tiny spaces.

Such factors may include [[temperature]], [[pH]], [[chemical]] milieu, [[nutrient]] supply, presence of symbionts or solid substrates, gaseous atmosphere ([[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]] or [[Wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]]) etc.

==Some examples==
===Pond microecosystems===
These microecosystems with limited [[water]] volume are often only of temporary duration and hence colonized by organisms which possess a drought-resistant [[spore]] stage in the lifecycle, or by organisms which do not need to live in water continuously. The ecosystem conditions appliying at a typical pond edge can be quite different from those further from shore. Extremely space-limited water ecosystems can be found in, for example, the water collected in [[bromeliad]] leaf bases and the "pitchers" of ''[[Nepenthes]]''.

===Soil microecosystems===
A typical soil microecosystem may be restricted to less than a millimeter in its total depth range owing to steep variation in humidity and/or atmospheric gas composition. The soil grain size and physical and chemical properties of the substrate may also play important roles. Because of the predominant solid phase in these systems they are notoriously difficult to study microscopically without simultaneously disrupting the fine spatial distribution of their components.

===Terrestrial hot-spring microecosystems===
These are defined by gradients of water temperature, nutrients, dissolved gases, [[salt]] concentrations etc. Along the path of terrestrial water flow the resulting temperature gradient continuum alone may provide many different minute microecosystems, starting with thermophilic bacteria such as [[Archaea]] "Archaebacteria" (100+ °C), followed by conventional [[thermophiles]] (60–100 °C), [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) such as the motile filaments of ''Oscillatoria'' (30–60 °C), [[protozoa]] such as Amoeba, [[rotifers]], then [[green algae]] (0–30 °C) etc.
Of course other factors than temperature also play important roles. Hot springs can provide classic and straightforward ecosystems for microecology studies as well as providing a haven for hitherto undescribed organisms.

===Deep-sea microecosystems===
The best known contain rare specialized organisms, found only in the immediate vicinity (sometimes within centimeters) of underwater [[volcanic vent]]s (or "smokers"). These ecosystems require extremely advanced diving and collection techniques for their scientific exploration.

===Closed microecosystem===
One that is sealed and completely independent of outside factors, except for temperature and light. A good example would be a plant contained in a sealed jar and submerged under water. No new factors would be able to enter this ecosystem.

A '''modello''' {{IPA-it|moˈdɛllo|}} (plural '''modelli'''), from Italian,&lt;ref&gt;The term ''modello'' avoids the ambiguity in English of ''model'', which may equally refer to the finished [[work of art]] that provided detailed inspiration for a variant or later copy.&lt;/ref&gt; is a preparatory study or model, usually at a smaller scale, for a work of art or architecture, especially one produced for the approval of the commissioning patron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Modello Glossary, National Gallery, London]; Irene Earls; [https://books.google.com/books?id=xAdrziNnqLIC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U36ePp8oMeVe0otIfoYZyo8eDz0Yw ''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary''], Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained currency in art circles in [[Tuscany]] in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The texts from five contracts and other documents 1376–1508 published by Michael Hirst (Hirst and Carmen Bambach Cappel, "A Note on the Word Modello', ''The Art Bulletin'' '''74'''.1 (March 1992:172–173) are all Tuscan, as Hirst remarks, though the contemporaneous term extended as far as the [[Marche]].&lt;/ref&gt; Modern definitions in reference works vary somewhat. Alternative and overlapping terms are "[[oil sketch]]" (''schizzo'') and "[[cartoon]]" for [[painting]]s or [[stained glass]], [[maquette]], plastico or bozzetto&lt;ref&gt;A ''bozzetto'' is a roughly-modelled preliminary sketch in clay for a sculpture; those that survive have mostly been kiln-fired to preserve them.&lt;/ref&gt; for sculpture or architecture, or [[architectural model]].&lt;ref&gt;Fourteenth century uses of ''modello'' in connection with [[Santa Reparata, Florence]], are noted in A. Grote, ''Studien zur Geschichte der Opera Santa Reparata zu Florenz in Vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' (Munich 1960:113ff).&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in Gothic figural arts bishops and abbots are often represented carrying small simulacra&lt;ref&gt;The Latin term ''modulus'', a synonym of ''typus'', "[[archetype]]" is given as source for the usage in the Tusacan [[Accademia della Crusca]]'s early dictionaries; other early dictionary definitions in Italian are noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel 1992:173. See also [[Donor portrait]]&lt;/ref&gt; of buildings they had constructed—"models" in the familiar modern sense—''modello'' is only used of pieces which pre-date the finished work, and were at least in part produced by the main artist involved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michelangelo]] was in the habit of assigning to members of his studio ''modelli'' done to his specifications: "in Michelagelo studies the presentation drawings are understood to be the group of finished drawings that Michelangelo gave to his friends such as [[Tommaso de' Cavallieri]]", remarked Bernadine Barnes (Barnes "A Lost Modello for Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment'" ''Master Drawings'' '''26'''.3 (Autumn 1988:239–248) p. 247 note 4) in justifying her use of ''modello'' for the lost original of two copies in public collections.

Mann; ''Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth Through Nineteenth Centuries: The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue'', National Gallery of Art, Oxford University Press US, 1990, {{ISBN|0-521-40107-0}}. In the [https://books.google.com/books?id=JIb45zQG-o4C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=modello+art&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U27JzKo-RkzM5KkC7v3NlImFkIOig#PPA73,M1 last paragraph of p.73], the view is advanced that an [[El Greco]] was produced as a ''ricordo'' for the first version of a work, and then used as the ''modello'' for a second version.&lt;/ref&gt; No doubt a modello was often modified after the main work was completed to reflect any changes in the composition during painting, thus making it a ricordo also; this would normally be impossible for art historians to distinguish from a modello altered during its original production. 

The [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] at right was catalogued as a modello by [[Michael Levey]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]], ''The 17th and 18th century Italian Schools; National Gallery Catalogues'', p.223, 1971, National Gallery, London, {{ISBN|0-901791-09-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent [[x-ray]] investigation of the huge finished work in Munich has revealed that in its [[underpainting]] it was closer to another, very different and less finished modello, now in the [[Courtauld Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;Braham Helen, ''The Princes Gate Collection'', p. 74, Courtauld Institute Galleries, London 1981, {{ISBN|0-904563-04-9}} [http://www.courtauldprints.com/image.php?id=147902&amp;idx=1&amp;fromsearch=true Courtauld Institute image] – note this is reversed compared to the final painting.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been asserted that the National Gallery picture illustrated is a ricordo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/886961 Francisco Bayeu.

JSTOR – on free page&lt;/ref&gt; The National Gallery still describe it as "probably a modello", presumably produced after work had already begun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng6273 National Gallery, London]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ghiberticompetition.jpg|thumb|left|''Sacrifice of Isaac''; [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s successful competition modello for the bronze doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare with [http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Galleria/Brunelleschi%20Filippo/imagepages/image2.html Brunelleschi's unsuccessful version]. Both are in the [[Bargello]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
"Cartoon", named for the sturdy ''cartone'' paper on which they were generally executed, is usually used of working drawings, often at full scale,&lt;ref&gt;Cartoons for [[tapestry]] were always at full scale; often cut into loom-width strips, they were set behind the warps of the loom as a direct guide for the weavers. The most famous tapestry cartoons are the "[[Raphael Cartoons]]" conserved in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]; they were re-used in the 17th century in England to produce series of [[Mortlake|Mortlake tapestries]].&lt;/ref&gt; but the distinction is not a firm one, and the terms ''cartoon'' and ''working drawing'' are often used interchangeably. ''Modello'' is especially used of older Italian art and architecture from the late Middle Ages onwards; initially these were mostly drawings, perhaps with some colour from chalk or [[watercolour]], or with colours indicated in writing. The diminutive term '''modeletto''' will always be used of small-scale versions. As an Italian word, ''modello'' may be printed in [[italic type|italic]]s, or not.&lt;ref&gt;Surprisingly, the word does not appear in the original ''[[OED]]'' or the First Supplement of 1933&lt;/ref&gt; The French version of the word, ''modèle'', may be used of French works, and is normally italicised.

Especially in the case of oil sketches, many ''modelli'' are greatly valued in their own right, as they may show a freedom in execution and freshness of inspiration missing in the final work, and also may show changes in composition from the finished work, throwing light on the process of artistic creation. Earlier stages of the creative process may be recorded in "preparatory drawings" or "studies", either for the whole composition, or a part of it, such as a single figure.

[[File:Passignano Michelangelo che da il modellino di San Pietro a Paolo IV.jpg|thumb|[[Michelangelo]] shows [[Pope Julius II]] his ''modellino'' of St Peter's in this 19th-century artist's impression]]
An example of a modello of a fresco cycle, which was rescued for its intrinsic value is in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of [[Rosso Fiorentino]]: Vasari reports that a modello for Rosso's frescoes in Santa Maria delle Lagrime, Arezzo, was carried out by Rosso for Giovanni Pollastra, the inventor of the complex program there, "un bellisimo modello di tutto l'opera, che è oggi nelle nostre case di Arezzo."&lt;ref&gt;"A most beautiful ''modello'' of all the works, which is today in our houses in Arezzo."&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary ''modello colorito'' in the form of a painted three-dimensional model was especially important to prejudge the finished effect of [[Illusionistic ceiling|illusionistic ''sotto-in-su'' perspectives]] on the curved surfaces of vaulted ceilings, as [[Andrea Pozzo]], the perfector of the illusionistic ceiling, noted in his ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'' (1700–17)&lt;ref&gt;In vol. II, section "Breve instruttione per dipingere a fresco", noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel, ''loc. cit.''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many modelli show versions of works which were never actually realised, or have been lost. Famous examples are the alternative designs produced for the competition in 1401 to design the North doors of the [[Florence Baptistry]]. [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] won, beating six other artists, including [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and [[Jacopo della Quercia]]; the modelli survive, for a single panel, of the first two named ([[Bargello]] – picture above).

There are alternative, unrealised, modelli for many famous buildings, including [[St Peter's, Rome]] and the "Great Model" of [[St Paul's Cathedral, London]], showing a different design by [[Sir Christopher Wren]] from that actually built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.explore-stpauls.net/oct03/textMM/TriforumGreatModelN.htm Explore St Paul's – Wren's Great Model]&lt;/ref&gt; When accepted, such models were retained during the work, as concrete expressions of what was expected under the terms of the contract, and afterwards were preserved in storage through salutary neglect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6955">'''Modern studies''' is a subject unique to the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish secondary school curriculum|secondary school curriculum]]. The focus of Modern Studies is to develop learners' knowledge and understanding of contemporary political and social issues in local, Scottish, United Kingdom and international contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/45629.html|title=SQA|last=resources@sqa.org.uk|first=Scottish Qualifications Authority, Resource Management,|website=www.sqa.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Studies is offered both at National Qualification level and also in the Broad General Education stage of Scottish education. Pupils in primary school and up to S3 in secondary school have the opportunity to study Modern Studies concepts through the 'People in Society, Economy and Business' area of the broader Social Studies Curriculum for Excellence experiences and outcomes. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.scot/Documents/social-studies-eo.pdf|title=Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=Education Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Senior Phase, Modern Studies is offered as a discrete subject. Ray Gunnion, history teacher in Brannock High School until 2004, was largely involved in introducing Modern Studies into the Scottish Education system as he felt it was a valuable subject for kids in Scotland.

== The Value of a Modern Studies Course ==
Modern Studies helps you develop knowledge and understanding of the processes that determine political, social and economic life. These processes are studied locally, nationally and internationally.

Modern Studies helps you develop important skills. For example you will become better at critically evaluating information, analysing complex sources and report writing. In some instances, the skills involved in using information technology will also be developed.

Together, the knowledge you acquire and the skills you develop will allow you to become a more informed individual, able to participate more effectively in society in a more tolerant and responsible manner.

== Study Themes ==
Common study themes exist across Modern Studies qualifications, from Broad General Education to Senior Phase.

=== Democracy in the UK ===
Pupils are given the opportunity to learn about the democratic processes of the United Kingdom with a focus on either UK democracy or Scottish democracy.  This includes examining rights and responsibilities, the political process, participation and representation at various levels.

=== Social Issues ===
Pupils examine social issues in society using sociological processes.  The focus of this unit is either Social Inequality or Crime and the Law.

A focus on social inequalities would examine issues of health, education, income and wealth inequalities in the UK by studying selected groups such as the unemployed, working poor, women, children, the elderly, [[LGBT|LBGT]]* people, [[Black and Minority Ethnic|BME]] people and others.

A focus on Crime and the Law would explore the types of crime committed in the UK, the sociological and individualistic theories of the causes of crime, the impact of crime and attempts to tackle crime.  The unit would examine the role of the criminal justice system, the police and the government.

=== International Issues ===
The International Issues unit is intended to broaden the scope of pupils' experiences to international contexts.  The focus of this unit will examine either a World Power or a World Issue.

A focus on a World Power will consist of a socioeconomic and political study of a [[G20]] country (excluding the United Kingdom).  This focus will be on the country's constitutional arrangements and opportunities for participation, the nature of recent socioeconomic issues and attempts to revolve them and the international influence of the world power.

A focus on a World Issue would put in the spotlight a contemporary significant conflict or issue which extends beyond the borders of a single country and has had impacts regionally or globally.  Examples of areas of study in this area would be [[terrorism]] or the [[Syrian Civil War]].  A study of a world issue would focus on the causes of, the impacts of and attempts to resolve the issue.

==The Primary Curriculum==

All schools in Scotland follow the 3-18 Curriculum for Excellence. Modern Studies is not offered as a discrete subject at primary school level, rather, it is delivered within the integrated Social Studies curricular area (which also encompasses history and geography themes).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the early, first and second stages (P1-P7); pupils are introduced to social studies key themes and are encouraged to develop analytical and evaluative skills.

==In S1, S2 &amp; S3==
Each school has the freedom to develop a course to suit the needs and interests of both pupils and teachers within the parameters of the Social Studies Experiences and Outcomes.

==National Qualifications==
Modern Studies is offered at National 3, 4 &amp; 5 levels and at Higher and Advanced Higher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is scope for a great deal of personalisation and choice across the NQ levels within the Course Assessment Specification. There are three areas of study and within these areas, teachers have the opportunity to teach a number of combinations of topic; these are:
* Democracy in Scotland and the UK:
** Democracy in Scotland OR
** Democracy in the United Kingdom
* Social Issues
** Social Inequality OR
** Crime and the Law
* International Issues
** World Power OR
** World Issue
At Advanced Higher level, there is a greater emphasis on depth of knowledge and so, one area of study is chosen from: Political Issues OR Law and Order OR Social Inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Studies Advanced Higher Course Assessment Specification|last=|first=|publisher=SQA|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At each level above National 3, there also exists the requirement for pupils to complete an independent research project under the supervision of their teacher.  This project makes up some of the final overall award.

==University==

Modern Studies does not exist as a separate subject at [[University]] level though it is a sound basis for further study of a range of subjects from which Modern Studies is composed, such as Crime and the Law, [[Politics]], [[International Relations]], [[Sociology]], [[Criminology]], [[Economics]], [[Social Policy]] and [[Public Policy]].

'''Musicology''' ({{ety|gre|''μουσική'' (mousikē)|music||''-λογία'' (-logia)|study of}}) is the scholarly analysis and research-based study of [[music]]. Musicology is part of the [[humanities]]. A scholar who participates in musical research is a '''musicologist'''.&lt;ref&gt;John Haines, ''Eight Centuries of Troubadours and Trouvères: The Changing Identity of Medieval Music'' (Cambridge, 2004), '55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For broad treatments, see the entry on "musicology" in [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's dictionary]], the entry on "Musikwissenschaft" in ''Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', and the classic approach of Adler (1885).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Guido (1885). Umfang, Methode und Ziel der Musikwissenschaft. Vierteljahresschrift für Musikwissenschaft, 1, 5-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[historical musicology]] (commonly termed "music history") has been the most prominent sub-discipline of musicology. In the 2010s, historical musicology is one of several large musicology sub-disciplines. Historical musicology, [[ethnomusicology]], and [[systematic musicology]] are approximately equal in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=whatisethnomusicol|title=What is Ethnomusicology? - Society for Ethnomusicology|website=The Society for Ethnomusicology|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnomusicology is the study of music in its cultural context. Systematic musicology includes music acoustics, the science and technology of acoustical musical instruments, and the musical implications of physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy and computing. [[Cognitive musicology]] is the set of phenomena surrounding the computational modeling of music. In some countries, [[music education]] is a prominent sub-field of musicology, while in others it is regarded as a distinct academic field, or one more closely affiliated with [[teacher education]], [[educational research]], and related fields. Like music education, [[music therapy]] is a specialized form of applied musicology which is sometimes considered more closely affiliated with health fields, and other times regarded as part of musicology proper.

==Parent disciplines==
The parent disciplines of musicology include:
* General [[history]]
* [[Cultural studies]]
* [[Philosophy]] (particularly [[aesthetics]] and [[semiotics]])
* [[Ethnology]] and [[cultural anthropology]]
* [[Archeology]] and [[prehistory]]
* [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]]
* [[Physiology]] and [[neuroscience]]
* [[Acoustics]] and [[psychoacoustics]]
* Computer/[[information sciences]] and [[mathematics]]

Musicology also has two central, practically oriented sub-disciplines with no parent discipline: [[performance practice]] and research (sometimes viewed as a form of [[Research#Artistic research|artistic research]]), and the [[music theory|theory]], [[musical analysis|analysis]] and composition of music. The disciplinary neighbors of musicology address other forms of [[art]], [[performance]], [[ritual]] and [[communication]], including the history and theory of the visual and plastic arts and of architecture; [[linguistics]], [[literature]] and [[theater]]; religion and [[theology]]; and sport. Musical knowledge is applied in medicine, [[education]], and [[music therapy]]—which, effectively, are parent disciplines of applied musicology.

==Subdisciplines==

===Historical musicology===
{{Main|Music history}}
[[File:Beethoven opus 101 manuscript.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Historical musicology, which was traditionally the most prominent subdiscipline of musicology, studies the history of music. Central to this study is the examination of historical [[sheet music|scores]], such as this original manuscript sketch by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] for [[Piano Sonata No. 28 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 28]], Movement IV, ''Geschwind, doch nicht zu sehr und mit Entschlossenheit'' ([[Tempo|Allegro]]), in his own handwriting. The piece was completed in 1816.]]
'''Music history''' or '''historical musicology''' is concerned with the composition, performance, reception, and criticism of [[music]] over [[time]]. Historical studies of music are for example concerned with a composer's life and works, the developments of styles and genres, ''e.g.'', baroque concertos, the social function of music for a particular group of people, ''e.g.'', court music, or modes of performance at a particular place and time, ''e.g.'', Johann Sebastian Bach's choir in Leipzig. Like the comparable field of [[art history]], different branches and schools of historical musicology emphasize different types of musical works and approaches to music.  There are also national differences in various definitions of historical musicology.  In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music, ''e.g.'', the history of [[Music of India|Indian music]] or the history of [[Rock music|rock]]. In practice, these research topics are more often considered within [[ethnomusicology]] (see below) and "historical musicology" is typically assumed to imply Western Art music of the European tradition.

The methods of historical musicology include source studies (especially [[manuscript]] studies), [[Palaeography|paleography]], [[philology]] (especially [[textual criticism]]), style criticism, historiography (the choice of [[historical method]]), musical analysis (analysis of music to find "inner coherence"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beard, David | author2=Gloag, Kenneth | title=Musicology: The Key Concepts | year=2005 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-31692-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iconography]]. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of [[music theory]]. Music historians create a number of written products, ranging from journal articles describing their current research, new editions of musical works, [[Biography|biographies]] of composers and other musicians, book-length studies or university textbook chapters or entire textbooks. Music historians may examine issues in a close focus, as in the case of scholars who examine the relationship between [[word]]s and music for a given composer's [[art song]]s. On the other hand, some scholars take a broader view, and assess the place of a given type of music, such as the [[symphony]] in [[society]] using techniques drawn from other fields, such as economics, sociology, or philosophy.

''[[New musicology]]'' is a term applied since the late 1980s to a wide body of work emphasizing [[cultural studies|cultural study]], analysis, and criticism of music. Such work may be based on [[Feminism|feminist]], [[gender studies]], [[queer theory]], or [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] theory, or the work of [[Theodor W. Adorno]]. Although New Musicology emerged from within historical musicology, the emphasis on cultural study within the Western art music tradition places New Musicology at the junction between historical, ethnological and sociological research in music.

New musicology was a reaction against traditional historical musicology, which according to [[Susan McClary]], "fastidiously declares issues of musical signification off-limits to those engaged in legitimate scholarship." [[Charles Rosen]], however, retorts that McClary, "sets up, like so many of the 'new musicologists', a [[straw man]] to knock down, the [[dogma]] that music has no meaning, and no political or social significance."&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Rosen | first=Charles | chapter=The New Musicology&lt;!--pp.&amp;nbsp;255–272.--&gt; | title=Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-674-00684-3 | page=264}} "(I doubt that anyone, except perhaps the nineteenth-century critic Hanslick, has ever really believed that, although some musicians have been goaded into proclaiming it by the sillier interpretations of music with which we are often assailed.)"&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many musicologists no longer distinguish between musicology and new musicology, since many of the scholarly concerns once associated with new musicology have now become mainstream, and they feel the term "new" no longer applies.

===Ethnomusicology===
{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}

[[Ethnomusicology]], formerly '''comparative musicology''', is the study of [[music]] in its [[cultural]] context.  It is often considered the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. [[Jeff Todd Titon]] has called it the study of "people making music". Although it is most often concerned with the study of non-[[Western world|Western]] musics, it also includes the study of Western music from an anthropological or sociological perspective, [[cultural studies]] and [[sociology]] as well as other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Some ethnomusicologists primarily conduct historical studies,&lt;ref&gt;McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David, Eds., (2014). ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology'' Lanham, MD: Rowman&amp;Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; but the majority are involved in long-term participant observation, or combine ethnographic and historical approaches in their fieldwork. Therefore, ethnomusiological scholarship can be characterized as featuring a substantial, intensive fieldwork component, often involving long-term residence within the community studied.
Closely related to ethnomusiology is the emerging branch of [[sociomusicology]]. For instance, Ko (2011) proposed the hypothesis of "Biliterate and Trimusical" in Hong Kong sociomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;Ko, C. K. S. (2011). ''An analysis of sociomusicology, its issues; and the music and society in Hong Kong''. Hong Kong: Ko Ka Shing. {{ISBN|978-9-881-58021-4}}. This book has been selected for inclusion in the Association for Chinese Music Research Bibliography in 2012, see [http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/23174].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music studies===
 &lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Popular musicology]] --&gt;

Popular music studies, known, "misleadingly,"&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Allan, ed. (2003). ''Analyzing Popular Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;2. {{ISBN|978-0-521-77120-7}}. p.&amp;nbsp;2n2 reads: "'Popular musicology' should be read as the musicological investigation of popular music, rather than the accessible investigation of music!"&lt;/ref&gt; as ''popular musicology'', emerged in the 1980s as an increasing number of musicologists, ethnomusicologists, and other varieties of historians of American and European culture began to write about popular musics past and present. The first journal focusing on popular music studies was [https://web.archive.org/web/20080411140144/http://www.cambridge.org/journals/journal_catalogue.asp?mnemonic=pmu Popular Music], which began publication in 1981. The same year an academic society solely devoted to the topic was formed, the [http://www.iaspm.net/ International Association for the Study of Popular Music]. The Association's founding was partly motivated by the interdisciplinary agenda of popular musicology though the group has been characterized by a polarized 'musicological' and 'sociological' approach also typical of popular musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music theory, analysis and composition===
{{Main|Music theory}}

'''Music theory''' is a field of study that describes the elements of [[music]] and includes the development and application of methods for composing and for analyzing music through both [[musical notation|notation]] and, on occasion, musical sound itself.  Broadly, theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music ([[Benjamin Boretz|Boretz]], 1995).  A person who studies or practices music theory is a '''music theorist'''.

Some music theorists attempt to explain the techniques composers use by establishing rules and patterns.  Others model the experience of listening to or performing music.  Though extremely diverse in their interests and commitments, many Western music theorists are united in their belief that the acts of composing, performing, and listening to music may be explicated to a high degree of detail (this, as opposed to a conception of musical expression as fundamentally ineffable except in musical sounds). Generally, works of music theory are both descriptive and prescriptive, attempting both to define practice and to influence later practice.  Thus, music theory generally lags behind practice but also points towards future exploration, composition, and performance.

Musicians study music theory to understand the structural relationships in the (nearly always notated) music. Composers study music theory to understand how to produce effects and structure their own works.  Composers may study music theory to guide their [[precompositional]] and compositional decisions.  Broadly speaking, music theory in the Western tradition focuses on [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]], and then uses these to explain large scale structure and the creation of [[melody]].

Music psychology applies the content and methods of all subdisciplines of [[psychology]] ([[perception]], [[cognition]], [[motivation]], etc.) to understand how music is created, perceived, responded to, and incorporated into individuals' and societies' daily lives.&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |pages=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary branches include [[cognitive musicology]], which emphasizes the use of computational models for human musical abilities and cognition, and the [[cognitive neuroscience of music]], which studies the way that music perception and production manifests in the brain using the methodologies of [[cognitive neuroscience]]. While aspects of the field can be highly theoretical, much of modern music psychology seeks to optimize the practices and professions of music performance, composition, education, and therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ockelford |first=Adam |chapter=Beyond music psychology |editor1-last=Hallam |editor1-first=Susan |editor2-last=Cross |editor2-first=Ian |editor3-last=Thaut |editor3-first=Michael |title=The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology |date=2009 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929845-7 |page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance practice and research===
{{Main|Authentic performance}}

Performance practice draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Although previously confined to early music, recent research in performance practice has embraced questions such as how the early history of recording affected the use of [[vibrato]] in classical music, or instruments in [[Klezmer]].

Within the rubric of musicology, performance practice tends to emphasize the collection and synthesis of evidence about how music should be performed.  The important other side, learning how to sing authentically or perform a historical instrument is usually part of [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] or other performance training.  However, many top researchers in performance practice are also excellent musicians.

Music performance research (or music performance science) is strongly associated with music psychology. It aims to document and explain the psychological, physiological, sociological and cultural details of how music is actually performed (rather than how it should be performed). The approach to research tends to be systematic and empirical, and to involve the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings of music performance research can often be applied in [[music education]].

==Education and careers==
[[File:Satchmofest07JackStewartSpeaks.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Music historian Jack Stewart lectures at a conference.]]
Musicologists in tenure track professor positions typically hold a [[Ph.D]] in musicology. In the 1960s and 1970s, some musicologists obtained [[professor]] positions with an [[M.A.]] as their highest degree, but in the 2010s, the Ph.D is the [[terminal degree|standard minimum credential]] for [[tenure track]] professor positions. As part of their initial training, musicologists typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[B.A.]] in music (or a related field such as history) and in many cases an [[M.A.]] in musicology. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for musicology Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and an M.A. in psychology). In music education, individuals may hold an [[M.Ed]] and an [[Ed.D]].

Most musicologists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure track professor positions is very competitive. Entry-level applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree and applicants to more senior professor positions must have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding musicologists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a musicologist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: she teaches undergraduate and/or graduate classes in her area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music History), conducts research in her area of expertise, publishes articles about her research in peer-reviewed journals, authors book chapters, books or textbooks, travels to conferences to give talks on her research and learn about research in her field, and, if her program includes a [[graduate school]], supervises M.A. and Ph.D students and gives them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some musicology professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.

==Role of women==
[[File:Rosetta Reitz.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rosetta Reitz]] (1924–2008) was an American [[jazz]] historian who established a record label producing 18 albums of the music of the early women of jazz and the blues.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/music/15reitz.html "Rosetta Reitz, Champion of Jazz Women, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2008. Accessed 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The vast majority of major musicologists and music historians from past generations have been men, as in the 19th century and early 20th century; women's involvement in teaching music was mainly in [[Women in music education|elementary and secondary music teaching]].&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015) When looking beyond bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

The '''New Bach Edition''' (NBE), in [[German language|German]] '''Neue Bach-Ausgabe''' (NBA), is the second complete edition of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], published by [[Bärenreiter]]. The name is short for Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works (Johann Sebastian Bach: Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke). It is a historical-critical edition (German: ''historisch-kritische Ausgabe'') of Bach's complete works by the [[Johann Sebastian Bach Institute]] (Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Institut) in Göttingen and the [[Bach Archive]] (Bach-Archiv) in Leipzig,

When Bach died most of his work was unpublished. The first complete edition of Bach's music was published in the second half of the nineteenth century by the [[Bach Gesellschaft]] ([[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]], BGA). The second complete edition includes some discoveries made since 1900, but there are relatively few such scores.  The significance of the NBE lies more in its incorporation of the latest scholarship.&lt;ref name="musiclibrary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53519953.html | title=Joahann Sebastian Bach: Ratswahlkantaten, II.(Review) | publisher=[[Music Library Association]]  via [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required) | work=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] | date=1998 | accessdate=September 26, 2012 | author=Melamed, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the NBE is an [[urtext edition]] rather than a facsimile edition, it includes many facsimiles of Bach manuscripts. 

==History==

In 1950, the commemorations of the bicentennial of Bach's death in [[Göttingen]] and [[Leipzig]] led to the initiative to publish his complete works in a critical scientific edition. Musicologists such as [[Friedrich Blume]], Max Schneider, {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Smend|de}} and [[Heinrich Besseler]], and sponsors such as [[Bernhard Sprengel]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Otto Benecke|de}} made the project possible, supported by the editor {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Vötterle|de}}.

The [[Neue Bachgesellschaft]] recommended to pursue the project as a joint venture of musicologists in Göttingen, then [[West Germany]], and Leipzig, then [[East Germany]], in order to stress that the common cultural heritage was indivisible. The Bach Archive and the Johann Sebastian Bach Institute collaborated, their directors [[Werner Neumann]] and [[Alfred Dürr]] made the new edition their life's project.  The publishers were [[Bärenreiter]] in [[Kassel]], chosen in 1951 by the Federal Government, and from 1954 the Deutscher Verlag für Musik, a new publisher in Leipzig which was involved until the unification of Germany.

Initially the duration of the edition was estimated as 15 to 20 years, but the scientific work with the sources required much more time than anticipated. The first volumes appeared in 1954. The edition was completed in June 2007.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article939434/Praeludium_zur_Deutschen_Einheit.html |title=Präludium zur Deutschen Einheit |author=Volker Tarnow |date=12 June 2007 |language=German |accessdate=9 January 2011 |publisher=[[Die Welt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraries.uc.edu/libraries/ccm/incs/neuebachausgabe.html |title=Neue Bach-Ausgabe |accessdate=9 January 2011 |publisher=[[University of Cincinnati]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The edition contains in eight series over 100 volumes of scores (Notenbände), each Score (Partitur) volume complemented with a Critical Commentary (Kritischer Bericht) volume. The ninth series contains Addenda (7 volumes), and furthermore there is a  Supplement of 9 volumes (Supplementbände):&lt;ref name="NBA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baerenreiter.com/html/completeedi/Bach/bach-ga.htm |title=Johann Sebastian Bach / 1685-1750 / New Edition of the Complete Works |accessdate=7 January 2011 |publisher=[[Bärenreiter]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103204656/http://baerenreiter.com/html/completeedi/Bach/bach-ga.htm |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:IX. Addenda (approximately 7 volumes)
:Supplement: Bach Documents (9 volumes)

Each Score volume contains a preface and a selection of [[facsimile]]s of its sources. In the Score volumes variants and fragments of compositions are published along with complete works. The Critical Commentary volumes describe the history and sources (manuscript sources, early editions), and their interdependence, for each composition, and discuss editorial issues.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;

== Relevance ==

The New Bach Edition presents a reliable version of Bach's music for both scientists and performers. Its strict philological methods were exemplary for critical scientific editions in the second half of the 20th century. 

In preparation for the NBE, lost compositions were found, whereas some known compositions proved to be not Bach's works. The examination of the sources corrected the chronology of his compositions.&lt;ref name="NBA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Welt" /&gt;

The second revised edition of the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], and the Bach-Digital website refer to the NBE volume and page number for every listed composition by Bach. In addition to listing the page number of the score, the Bach Digital website also mentions the page number where the composition is discussed in the corresponding Critical Commentary volume.&lt;ref&gt;(BWV&lt;sup&gt;2a&lt;/sup&gt;) [[Alfred Dürr]], Yoshitake Kobayashi (eds.), Kirsten Beißwenger.

In February 2010 the Bach Archive and the publisher announced a revision of single volumes, in order to include new sources and findings. The first in this series of revisions was the [[Mass in B minor]] (updating the second volume of the NBE).
Approximately 15 more volumes are planned, including [[Bach cantata#Weimar|Weimar cantatas]] (five works), the ''[[St John Passion]]'', the motets, the [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|violin sonatas]], the [[Cello Suites (Bach)|cello suites]] and others.&lt;ref name="Revised"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baerenreiter.com/en/spotlight-on/gesamt-und-werkausgaben/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ | title=New Bach Edition – Revised (NBArev) | publisher=Baerenreiter | accessdate=September 28, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AYaBsn3W?url=https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/spotlight-on/gesamt-und-werkausgaben/bach-johann-sebastian/nbarev/ | archivedate=September 9, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What ''type'' of thing is social science? ==

Social science can be described as all of the following:
* Branch of [[science]] &amp;ndash; systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Edward O. |title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge |edition=1st |publisher = Vintage Books |location = New York, NY |year = 1998 |isbn = 0-679-45077-7 |pages=49–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by [[mathematics]]; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions."&amp;nbsp;—p.vii, [[J.

* [[List of academic disciplines and sub-disciplines#Social sciences|Major category]] of [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with academic areas of study or areas of professional practice. For example, the branches of science are commonly referred to as the scientific disciplines. For instance, gravitation is strongly associated with the discipline of physics, and is considered to be part of that disciplinary knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5091">'''Papyrology''' is the study of ancient literature, correspondence, legal archives, etc., as preserved in [[manuscript]]s written on [[papyrus]], the most common form of writing material in the ancient civilizations of [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Papyrology includes both the translation and interpretation of ancient documents in a variety of languages and the care and preservation of rare papyrus originals.

Papyrology as a systematic discipline dates from the 1890s, when large caches of well-preserved papyri were discovered by [[archaeologist]]s in several locations in [[Egypt]], such as Arsinoe ([[Faiyum]]) and [[Oxyrhynchus]]. Leading centres of papyrology include [[Oxford University]], [[Heidelberg University]], [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Leiden University]], the [[Österreichische Nationalbibliothek]], 
[[University of California, Berkeley]] and the Istituto Papirologico "G. Vitelli" connected to the [[University of Florence]]. Founders of papyrology were the Viennese orientalist {{ill|Joseph von Karabacek|de}} (Arabic papyrology),&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner, ''The Dictionary of Art'', Grove's Dictionaries, 1996, p.548&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Schubart]] (Greek papyrology),&lt;ref&gt;''The Harvard Theological Review'', Harvard Divinity School 1941, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; the Austrian antiquarian {{ill|Theodor Graf|de}} who acquired more than 100,000 Greek, Arabic, Coptic and Persian papyri in Egypt, which were bought by the Austrian [[Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Rainer]],&lt;ref&gt;Glenn W. Most, ''Disciplining Classics: Altertumswissenschaft als Beruf'', 2002, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grigol Tsereteli|G. F. Tsereteli]] who published papyri of Russian and Georgian collections,&lt;ref&gt;Bobodzhan Gafurovich Gafurov, Yuri Vladimirovich Gankovskiĭ, ''Fifty Years of Soviet Oriental Studies'', Institut narodov Azii (Akademii︠a︡ nauk SSSR) 1968, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Frederic George Kenyon]],&lt;ref&gt;Leo Deuel, ''Testaments of Time: The Search for Lost Manuscripts and Records'', Knopf, 1965, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulrich Wilcken]], [[Bernard Pyne Grenfell]], [[Arthur Surridge Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies, ''The Journal of Jewish Studies'', Jewish Chronicle Publications, 1974, p.420&lt;/ref&gt; and other distinguished scientists. 

The collection of pagan, Christian and Arabic [[papyrus|papyri]] in Vienna called the {{ill|Rainer papyri|de|Papyrussammlung und Papyrusmuseum Wien}} represents the first large discovery of manuscripts on papyrus found in the [[Fayum]] in [[Egypt]]. Around 1880, a carpet trader in Cairo acquired on behalf of Karabacek over 10,000 papyri and some texts written on linen. Of those Fayum papyri, over 3000 are written in Arabic. The papyri originated from Kôm Fâris ([[Crocodilopolis|Krokodílon Pólis]]) and Ihnasiyyah al-Madinah ([[Herakleopolis Magna]]), the textile pages from Kôm al-‘Azâma. They were exported to Vienna in 1882, and presented in a public exhibition the following year that caused a sensation. Later the papyri were bought by the Grand Duke Rainer and presented to the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences|Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften]] in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Anker, ''Libri: International Library Review'', International Federation of Library Associations  1951, p.234&lt;/ref&gt;

The first papyrus was published in the West by Cardinal [[Stefano Borgia]] in [[Velletri]] in 1778, with the title "Charta papyracea Graece scripta Museums Borgiani Velitris" famous by the name of Charta Borgiana.

'''Philology''' is the study of language in oral and written historical sources; it is the intersection between [[textual criticism]], [[literary criticism]], [[history]], and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2joVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |title=Philology |last=Peile |first=John |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |year=1880 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philology is more commonly defined as the study of literary texts as well as oral and written records, the establishment of their authenticity and their original form, and the determination of their meaning. A person who pursues this kind of study is known as a philologist.

In older usage, especially British, philology is more general, covering comparative and historical linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/philology |title=philology |website=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/philology |title=philology |website=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical philology]] studies [[classical languages]]. Classical philology principally originated from the [[Library of Pergamum]] and the [[Library of Alexandria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=F. W.|title=A Companion to Classical Texts|year=1968|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford, England|pages=22–52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzW7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the fourth century BCE, continued by Greeks and Romans throughout the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire]]. It was preserved and promoted during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and eventually resumed by European scholars of the [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance]], where it was soon joined by philologies of other non-Asian (European) ([[Germanic philology|Germanic]], [[Celtic studies|Celtic]]), Eurasian ([[Slavistics]], etc.) and Asian ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Sanskrit grammarians|Sanskrit]], [[Sinology|Chinese]], etc.) languages. [[Indo-European studies]] involves the [[comparative linguistics|comparative]] philology of all [[Indo-European languages]].

Philology, with its focus on historical development ([[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic]] analysis), is contrasted with [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistics]] due to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s insistence on the importance of [[Synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic analysis]]. The contrast continued with the emergence of [[structuralism]] and [[Chomskyan]] linguistics alongside its emphasis on [[syntax]].
{{wiktionary}}

== Etymology ==
The term "[[:wikt:philology|philology]]" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλολογία}} (''philología''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111282 |chapter=φιλολογία |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the terms {{lang|grc|φίλος}} (''phílos'') "love, affection, loved, beloved, dear, friend" and {{lang|grc|λόγος}} (''[[lógos]]'') "word, articulation, reason", describing a love of learning, of literature, as well as of argument and reasoning, reflecting the range of activities included under the notion of {{lang|grc|[[logos|λόγος]]}}. The term changed little with the Latin ''philologia'', and later entered the English language in the 16th century, from the [[Middle French]] ''philologie'', in the sense of "love of literature".

The adjective {{lang|grc|φιλόλογος}} (''philólogos'') meant "fond of discussion or argument, talkative", in [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic Greek]], also implying an excessive ("[[sophism|sophistic]]") preference of argument over the love of true wisdom, {{lang|grc|[[philosophy|φιλόσοφος]]}} (''philósophos'').

As an [[allegory]] of literary erudition, ''philologia'' appears in fifth-century postclassical literature ([[Martianus Capella]], ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii''), an idea revived in Late Medieval literature ([[Chaucer]], [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]]).

The meaning of "love of learning and literature" was narrowed to "the study of the historical development of languages" ([[historical linguistics]]) in 19th-century usage of the term. Due to the rapid progress made in understanding [[sound law]]s and [[language change]], the "golden age of philology" lasted throughout the 19th century, or "from [[Giacomo Leopardi]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] to [[Nietzsche]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/nwegmann/ |title=Nikolaus Wegmann, Princeton University Department of German |publisher=Scholar.princeton.edu |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglo-Saxon world, the term philology to describe work on languages and literatures, which had become synonymous with the practices of German scholars, was abandoned as a consequence of anti-German feeling following [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]]. "Them Philologists: Philological Practices and Their Discontents from Nietzsche to Cerquiglini." ''The Year's Work in Medievalism'' 26 (2011): 4–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Most continental European countries still maintain the term to designate departments, colleges, position titles, and journals. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] opposed the nationalist reaction against philological practices, claiming that "the philological instinct" was "universal as is the use of language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tolkien |first=J. R. R. |authorlink=J. R. R. Tolkien |title=Philology: General Works |journal=The Year's Work of English Studies |volume=4 |number=1 |year=1923 |pages=36–37 |doi=10.1093/ywes/IV.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]]. "''Englische Philologie'' vs. English Studies: A Foundational Conflict", in ''Das Potential europäischer Philologien: Geschichte, Leistung, Funktion'', ed. Christoph König (Göttingen: Wallstein, 2009), pp. 34–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British English]] usage, and in British academia, "philology" remains largely synonymous with "historical linguistics", while in [[US English]], and US academia, the wider meaning of "study of a language's grammar, history and literary tradition" remains more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Morpurgo Davies|A. Morpurgo Davies]], ''History of Linguistics'' (1998) 4 I. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. M. Bravmann, ''Studies in Semitic Philology''. (1977) p.&amp;nbsp;457.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the harsh critique of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], US scholars since the 1980s have viewed philology as responsible for a narrowly [[scientism|scientistic]] study of language and literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Utz|Utz, Richard]].

== Branches ==

=== Comparative ===
{{main article|Comparative philology}}
[[File:Indo European philology historical and comparative 1969.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Indo-European Philology: Historical and Comparative'' by [[William Burley Lockwood]] (1969)]]

The [[comparative linguistics]] branch of philology studies the relationship between languages. Similarities between [[Sanskrit]] and [[European languages]] were first noted in the early 16th century&lt;ref&gt;This is noted in Juan Mascaro's introduction to his translation of the ''Bhagavad Gita'', in which he dates the first ''Gita'' translation to 1785 (by Charles Williams). Mascaro claims the linguist [[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Hamilton]] stopped in Paris in 1802 after returning from India, and taught Sanskrit to the German critic [[Friedrich von Schlegel]]. Mascaro says this is the beginning of modern study of the roots of the Indo-European languages.&lt;/ref&gt; and led to speculation of a common ancestor language from which all these descended. It is now named [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. Philology's interest in ancient languages led to the study of what were, in the 18th century, "exotic" languages, for the light they could cast on problems in understanding and [[decipher]]ing the origins of older texts.

=== Textual ===
{{main article|Textual criticism}}
Philology also includes the study of texts and their history. It includes elements of [[textual criticism]], trying to reconstruct an author's original text based on variant copies of manuscripts. This branch of research arose among Ancient scholars in the 4th century BC Greek-speaking world, who desired to establish a standard text of popular authors for the purposes of both sound interpretation and secure transmission.  Since that time, the original principles of textual criticism have been improved and applied to other widely distributed texts such as the Bible.  Scholars have tried to reconstruct the original readings of the [[Bible]] from the manuscript variants. This method was applied to Classical Studies and to medieval texts as a way to reconstruct the author's original work. The method produced so-called "critical editions", which provided a reconstructed text accompanied by a "[[critical apparatus]]", i.e., footnotes that listed the various manuscript variants available, enabling scholars to gain insight into the entire manuscript tradition and argue about the variants.&lt;ref name = GB1&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JewJCYZlYV8C&amp;pg=PA9 |title=Textual Scholarship: An Introduction |first=D. C. |last=Greetham |publisher=Garland Publishing |year=1994 |accessdate=2011-07-16 |isbn=9780815317913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related study method known as [[higher criticism]] studies the authorship, date, and provenance of text to place such text in historical context.&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; As these philological issues are often inseparable from issues of interpretation, there is no clear-cut boundary between philology and [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; When text has a significant political or religious influence (such as the reconstruction of Biblical texts), scholars have difficulty reaching objective conclusions.

Some scholars avoid all critical methods of textual philology,&lt;ref name = GB1/&gt; especially in historical linguistics, where it is important to study the actual recorded materials. The movement known as [[New Philology]] has rejected textual criticism because it injects editorial interpretations into the text and destroys the integrity of the individual manuscript, hence damaging the reliability of the data. Supporters of New Philology insist on a strict "diplomatic" approach: a faithful rendering of the text exactly as found in the manuscript, without emendations.

=== Cognitive ===
{{main article|Cognitive philology}}
Another branch of philology, cognitive philology, studies written and oral texts. Cognitive philology considers these oral texts as the results of human mental processes. This science compares the results of textual science with the results of experimental research of both psychology and artificial intelligence production systems.

=== Decipherment ===
In the case of [[Bronze Age literature]], philology includes the prior [[decipherment]] of the language under study. This has notably been the case with the [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Ugaritic]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]] languages. Beginning with the famous decipherment and translation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] by [[Jean-François Champollion]] in 1822, a number of individuals attempted to decipher the writing systems of the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]]. In the case of [[Old Persian]] and [[Mycenaean Greek]], decipherment yielded older records of languages already known from slightly more recent traditions ([[Middle Persian]] and [[Ancient Greek|Alphabetic Greek]]).

Work on the ancient languages of the Near East progressed rapidly. In the mid-19th century, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] and others deciphered the [[Behistun Inscription]], which records the same text in [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], using a variation of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] for each language. The elucidation of cuneiform led to the decipherment of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. [[Hittite language|Hittite]] was deciphered in 1915 by [[Bedřich Hrozný]].

[[Linear B]], a script used in the ancient Aegean, was deciphered in 1952 by [[Michael Ventris]] and [[John Chadwick]], who demonstrated that it recorded an early form of Greek, now known as [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean Greek]]. [[Linear A]], the writing system that records the still-unknown language of the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]], resists deciphering, despite many attempts.

Work continues on scripts such as the [[Maya script|Maya]], with great progress since the initial breakthroughs of the phonetic approach championed by [[Yuri Knorozov]] and others in the 1950s. Since the late 20th century, the Maya code has been almost completely deciphered, and the Mayan languages are among the most documented and studied in Mesoamerica. The code is described as a [[logosyllabic]] style of writing, which could be used to fully express any spoken thought.

==In popular culture==

In the ''[[The Space Trilogy|Space Trilogy]]'' by [[C.S. Lewis]], the main character, Elwin Ransom, is a philologist - as was Lewis' close friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

Dr. Edward Morbius, one of the main characters in the science-fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', is a philologist.

[[Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld]], the main character in [[Alexander McCall Smith]]'s 1997 comic novel ''[[Portuguese Irregular Verbs]]'' is a philologist, educated at Cambridge.

The main character in the [[List of submissions to the 84th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language film]] in 2012, ''[[Footnote (film)|Footnote]]'', is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] philologist, and a significant part of the film deals with his work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15557">'''Praxeology''' or '''praxiology''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɹ|æ|k|s|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; {{etymology|grc|''πρᾶξις'' (praxis)|deed, action||''-λογία'' (-logia)|study of}}) is the study of human [[Action (philosophy)|action]], based on the notion that humans engage in purposeful behavior, as opposed to [[Reflex|reflexive behavior]] like sneezing and unintentional behavior.

French social philosopher [[Alfred Espinas]] gave the term its modern meaning, and its study was developed independently by two principal groups: the [[Austrian school]] created by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and the Polish school created by [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ryan |editor1-first=Leo V. |editor2-last=Nahser |editor2-first=F. Byron |editor3-last=Gasparski |editor3-first=Wojciech |date=2002 |title=Praxiology and pragmatism |series=Praxiology: the international annual of practical philosophy and methodology |volume=10 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] |pages=7–9 |isbn=0765801671 |oclc=49617735 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and etymology==
Coinage of the word ''praxeology'' is often credited to Louis Bourdeau, the French author of a classification of the sciences, which he published in his ''Théorie des sciences: Plan de Science intégrale'' in 1882:

{{quote|On account of their dual natures of specialty and generality, these functions should be the subject of a separate science. Some of its parts have been studied for a long time, because this kind of research, in which man could be the main subject, has always presented the greatest interest. Physiology, hygiene, medicine, psychology, animal history, human history, political economy, morality, etc. represent fragments of a science that we would like to establish, but as fragments scattered and uncoordinated have remained until now only parts of particular sciences. They should be joined together and made whole in order to highlight the order of the whole and its unity. Now you have a science, so far unnamed, which we propose to call Praxeology (from πραξις, action), or by referring to the influence of the environment, [[Mesology]] (from μεσος, environment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdeau|first=Louis|title=Théorie des sciences: Plan de Science intégrale|volume=Tome Second|publisher=Librarie Germer Baillière|location=Paris|date=1882|quote=À raison de leur double caractère de spécialité et de généralité, les fonctions doivent constituer l'objet d'une science distincte. Quelques—unes de ses parties ont été étudiées de bonne heure, car ce genre de recherches, dont l'homme pouvait se faire le sujet principal, a présenté de tout temps le plus vif intérêt. La physiologie, l'hygiène, la médecine, la psychologie, l'histoire des animaux, l'histoire humaine, l'économie politique, la morale, etc., représentent des fragments de la science que nous voudrions établir; mais fragments, épars et sans coordination, sont restés a l'état de sciences particulières. Il faudrait les rapprocher et en faire un tout afin de mettre en lumière l'ordre de l'ensemble et son unité. On aurait alors une… science, innommée jusqu'ici et que nous proposons d'appeler Praxéologie (de πραξις, action), ou, en se référant a l'influence des milieu, Mésologie (de μεơος, milieu).|page=463|url=http://iris.univ-lille1.fr/handle/1908/3842|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the term was used at least once previously (with a slight spelling difference), in 1608, by [[Clemens Timpler]] in his ''Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum'':

{{quote|There was Aretology: Following that Praxiology: which is the second part of the Ethics, in general, commenting on the actions of the moral virtues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Timpler|first=Clemens|title=Philosophiae practicae systema methodicum|volume=libris IV pertractatam|location=Hanoviae|publisher=Apud Gulielmum Antonio|date=1608|page=388|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_IaPUCZDkdQYC#page/n418/mode/1up|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}|quote=Fuit Aretologia: Sequitur Praxiologia: quæ est altera pars Ethicæ, tractans generaliter de actionibus moralibus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was later mentioned by [[Robert Flint]] in 1904 in a review of Bourdeau's ''Théorie des sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Flint|title=Philosophy as Scientia Scientiarum|location=Edinburgh|date=1904|pages=254–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern definition of the word was first given by [[Alfred Espinas|Alfred V. Espinas]] (1844–1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrowski|first=Jean J.|title=Notes biographiques et bibliographiques sur Alfred Espinas|journal=Review Philosophique de la France et de l'Etranger|location=Paris|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|number=3|date=July–September 1967|pages=385–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French philosopher and sociologist; he was the forerunner of the Polish school of the science of [[Efficiency|efficient]] action. The Austro-American school of economics was based on a philosophical science of the same kind.

With a different spelling, the word was used by the English psychologist [[Charles Arthur Mercier]] (in 1911), and proposed by [[Knight Dunlap]] to [[John B. Watson]] as a better name for his [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=John B.|title=Behaviourism: The Early Years|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} Watson rejected it. But the Chinese physiologist of behavior, [[Zing-Yang Kuo]] (b. 1898) adopted the term in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Murchison, Carl Allanmore, ''[[The Journal of Psychology]]'', Volumes 3–4, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2018}} It was also used by [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] (in 1928 and later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=McDougall|title=The Battle of Behaviorism: An Exposition and an Exposure|date=1928|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Previously the word ''praxiology'', with the meaning Espinas gave to it, was used by [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] (in 1923). Several economists, such as the Ukrainian, [[Eugene Slutsky]] (1926) used it in his attempt to base economics on a theory of action. It was also used by [[Austrian economics|Austrian economist]] Ludwig von Mises (1933), Russian Marxist [[Nikolai Bukharin]] (1888–1938) during the [[Second International]] Congress of History of Science and Technology in London (in 1931), and Polish scholar [[Oskar R. Lange|Oscar Lange]] (1904–1965) in 1959, and later.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Italian philosopher, Carmelo Ottaviano, was using the Italianised version, ''prassiologia'', in his treatises starting from 1935, but in his own way, as a theory of politics. After the [[Second World War]] the use of the term ''praxeology'' spread widely. After the emigration of Mises to America his pupil [[Murray Rothbard]] defended the praxeological approach. A revival of Espinas's approach in France was revealed in the works of [[Pierre Massé]] (1946), the eminent cybernetician, Georges Théodule Guilbaud (1953), the Belgian logician, [[Leo Apostel]] (1957), the cybernetician, [[Anatol Rapoport]] (1962), Henry Pierron, psychologist and lexicographer (1957), [[François Perroux]], economist (1957), the social psychologist, Robert Daval (1963), the well-known sociologist, [[Raymond Aron]] (1963) and the methodologists, Abraham Antoine Moles and Roland Caude (1965).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Under the influence of [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], praxeology flourished in Poland. A special "Centre of Praxeology" (''Zaklad Prakseologiczny'') was created under the organizational guidance of the Polish Academy of Sciences, with its own periodical (from 1962), called at first ''Materiały Prakseologiczne'' (''Praxeological Papers''), and then abbreviated to ''Prakseologia''. It published hundreds of papers by different authors, and the materials for a special vocabulary edited by Professor Tadeusz Pszczolowski, the leading praxeologist of the younger generation. A sweeping survey of the praxeological approach is to be found in the paper by the French [[statistician]] Micheline Petruszewycz, "A propos de la praxéologie".&lt;ref&gt;In 'Mathématiques et Sciences Humaines', Paris, Centre de mathématique sociale et de statistique-Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, No. 11. Ete, 1965, pp. 11–18, and a rejoinder 'Réponse a un appel' by J. Ostrowski, ''ibid'',, No. 19, Ete, 1967, pp. 21–26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig von Mises]] was influenced by several theories in forming his work on praxeology, including [[Immanuel Kant]]'s works, [[Max Weber]]'s work on [[methodological individualism]], and [[Carl Menger]]'s development of the [[subjective theory of value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selgin|first=George A.|title=Praxeology and Understanding: An Analysis of the Controversy in Austrian Economics|url=https://mises.org/library/praxeology-and-understanding-analysis-controversy-austrian-economics-0|journal=Review of Austrian Economics|volume=2|date=1987|page=22|access-date={{date|2017-02-04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Austrian economics==
{{Austrian School sidebar |expanded=Theory}}
[[Austrian economics]] relies heavily on praxeology in the development of its economic theories.&lt;ref name="rothmeth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothbard|first=Murray N.|chapter=Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics|title=The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics|date=1976|pages=19–39|chapterurl=https://mises.org/library/praxeology-methodology-austrian-economics|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig von Mises considered economics to be a sub-discipline of praxeology.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Austrian School economists continue to use praxeology and deduction, rather than empirical studies, to determine economic principles. According to its theorists, with the [[action axiom]] as the starting point, it is possible to draw conclusions about human behavior that are both objective and universal. For example, the notion that humans engage in acts of choice implies that they have preferences, and this must be true for anyone who exhibits intentional behavior.

Advocates of praxeology also say that it provides insights for the field of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. "Praxeology, value judgments, and public policy." ''The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics'' (1976): 89–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdivisions===
In 1951, [[Murray Rothbard]] divided the subfields of praxeology as follows:
: A. The Theory of the Isolated Individual ([[Robinson Crusoe Economy|Crusoe Economics]])
: B. The Theory of Voluntary Interpersonal Exchange ([[Catallactics]], or the Economics of the Market)
:: 1. [[Barter]]
:: 2. With [[Money|Medium of Exchange]]
::: a. On the [[Free Market|Unhampered Market]]
::: b. Effects of [[government|Violent Intervention]] with the Market
::: c. Effects of Violent Abolition of the Market (Socialism)
: C. The Theory of [[War]] – Hostile Action
: D. The Theory of Games (e.g., [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]])
: E. Unknown
At the time, topics C, D, and E remained open research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard. [https://www.mises.org/library/praxeology-reply-mr-schuller "Praxeology: Reply to Mr. Schuller"], ''[[American Economic Review]]'', December 1951, pp. 943–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
[[Thomas Mayer (American economist)|Thomas Mayer]] has argued that, because praxeology rejects [[positivism]] and [[empiricism]] in the development of [[Scientific theory#Pedagogical definition|theories]], it constitutes nothing less than a rejection of the [[Scientific method#Characterizations|scientific method]]. For Mayer, this invalidates the methodologies of the [[Austrian school of economics]].&lt;ref name="Mayer1998"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thomas |last=Mayer |title=Boettke's Austrian critique of mainstream economics: An empiricist's response |publisher=Routledge|journal=Critical Review |date=Winter 1998 |pages=151–71 |ref=harv|doi=10.1080/08913819808443491|volume=12 |quote=}}{{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton1999"&gt;"Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]", {{harvnb |Newton |1999 |pp=794–96 }}, from Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Austrians argue that that empirical data itself is insufficient to describe economics; that consequently empirical data cannot falsify economic theory; that logical positivism cannot predict or explain human action; and that the methodological requirements of logical positivism are impossible to obtain for economic questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ludwig von|last=Mises|title=Epistemological Problems of Economics|edition=3rd|date=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|translator-last=Reisman|translator-first=George|url=https://mises.org/library/epistemological-problems-economics|accessdate={{date|2017-02|04}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rothmeth" /&gt; Ludwig von Mises in particular argued against empiricist approaches to the social sciences in general, because human events are unique and "unrepeatable," whereas scientific experiments are necessarily reducible.&lt;ref name="MisesHumanAction"&gt;Mises, Ludwig von. ''[[Human Action]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

However, economist Antony Davies argues that because statistical tests are predicated on the independent development of theory, some form of praxeology is essential for model selection; conversely, the praxeology can illustrate surprising philosophical consequences of economic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cato-unbound.org/2012/09/12/antony-davies/complementary-approaches|title=Complementary Approaches|first=Antony|last=Davies|date={{date|2012-09-12}}|website=Cato Unbound|access-date={{date|2016-12-27}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been a growth in academic and policy discussions around product lifetimes. For example, discussion of product lifetimes are an integral part of the European Commission's action plan for the circular economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:8a8ef5e8-99a0-11e5-b3b7-01aa75ed71a1.0012.02/DOC_1&amp;format=PDF|title=Closing the loop - An EU action plan for the Circular Economy|last=European Commission|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' In academia, the PLATE (Product Lifetimes and the Environment) Consortium hosts regular conferences and seminars around the topic of product lifetimes and the environment (see: http://www.plateconference.org/).

This article examines how product lifetimes are defined in the academic literature and discusses how product lifetimes can be measured. A distinction is made between the definition and measurement of ''actual'' and ''expected'' product lifetimes.

== Defining product lifetimes ==

Definitions of product lifetimes vary depending on what aspects those conducting research are interested in. Generally, actual product lifetimes refer to the actual time that a product exists in a particular state.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In contrast, expected product lifetimes refer to users' expectations for the lifetime of a product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, actual and expected product lifetimes are influenced by durability and longevity; these concepts are briefly outlined below.

Durability is described by Cooper&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond recycling: the longer life option|last=Cooper, T.|publisher=New Economics Foundation|year=1994|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal use conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). In contrast, longevity encompasses more than just the material properties of the product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cooper&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; notes that user behaviour, and broader social and cultural trends play important roles in the product's longevity. The paragraphs below outline the definitions of actual and expected product lifetimes.

=== Actual product lifetimes ===
Exhaustive work has been undertaken by Murakami et al.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murakami|first=Shinsuke|last2=Oguchi|first2=Masahiro|last3=Tasaki|first3=Tomohiro|last4=Daigo|first4=Ichiro|last5=Hashimoto|first5=Seiji|date=2010-08-01|title=Lifespan of Commodities, Part I|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00250.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=598–612|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00250.x|issn=1530-9290}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oguchi|first=Masahiro|last2=Murakami|first2=Shinsuke|last3=Tasaki|first3=Tomohiro|last4=Daigo|first4=Ichiro|last5=Hashimoto|first5=Seiji|date=2010-08-01|title=Lifespan of Commodities, Part II|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00251.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=613–626|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00251.x|issn=1530-9290}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to outline several definitions and discuss methods for identifying actual product lifetimes. Murkami et al.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; identify the following overarching concepts in product lifetime definitions which are discussed below: Age, Residential time, Service life, Possession span and Duration of use.

==== Age ====
A product's age is the time from when the product was created to either the present or "the time of interest" (:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 600) for the researchers.

==== Residential time ====
Residential time is considered to be time in which a product, its constituent materials and parts, exists in society.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Residential time includes the time in which a product may be broken and/ or discarded.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Service life ====
{{Main|Service life}}

According to Murkami et al.,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; the service life of a product refers to the duration of time for which products continue to work and can be used.

==== Possession span ====
The possession span is the period of time that a user has possession of the product.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Duration of use ====
The duration of use indicates how long a user uses the product for.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Murkami et al.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; distinguish duration of use from [[Service life]] by noting that duration of use is measured for a specific user, whereas [[Service life]] describes the total in-service use of the product for all its users (accounting for transfers of ownership e.g. reuse). Additionally, possession span is distinguished from duration of use, as possession span includes "dead storage" (:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 601) time, where a product is owned by a user but not in use (i.e. in storage).

=== Expected product lifetimes ===
A conference paper by Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/28621/|title=Electronics Goes Green 2016+ Conference|last=Oguchi, M., Tasaki, T., Daigo, I., Cooper, T., Cole, C. and Gnanapragasam, A.|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=|chapter=Consumers' expectations for product lifetimes of consumer durables.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought to identify and test differences in definitions of product lifetime expectations. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; illustrated that previous research into expected product lifetimes has been inconsistent in its use of the term expected product lifetimes. For example, Cooper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|title=Inadequate Life?

Wieser et al.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www4.ntu.ac.uk/plate_conference/proceedings/index.html|title=Product Lifetimes and The Environment|last=Wieser, H., Tröger, N. and Hübner, R.|publisher=Nottingham Trent University|year=|isbn=|location=Nottingham|pages=388–393|chapter=The consumers’ desired and expected product lifetimes|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified the tension between everyday expectations and desires, distinguishing between these expectations in his study of 21 products.

Building on these previous studies (''described above''), Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; identified and tested three distinct definitions of expected product lifetimes, these are outlined below.

==== Intended lifetime ====
Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; define the intended lifetime as the length of time for which a user intends to use the product in question.

==== Ideal lifetime ====
The ideal length of time for which a user expects their product to last. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; describe this as "the highest preference of consumers".

==== Predicted lifetime ====
The realist prediction by the user of how long a product will last. The user is thought to make this prediction based on their previous experiences and "other relevant factors" (Oguhci et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

== Measuring product lifetimes ==
Academic enquiry into the product lifetimes of electrical and electronic equipment was undertaken in 2000 by Cooper and Mayers&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/6671/|title=Prospects for household appliances|author1=Cooper, T.  |author2=Mayers, K.|publisher=Sheffield Hallam University for E-SCOPE|year=2000|isbn=|location=Sheffield|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who conducted household interviews and focus groups to establish the age at discard (actual product lifetime) and expected lifetimes for 17 products. Since this study, work has been undertaken by other academics into measuring actual and expected product lifetimes; the methods employed are outlined below.

=== Actual product lifetimes ===
Actual product lifetimes can be measured using a variety of methods which include: product testing, discard surveys, user interviews and modelling. These are discussed below.

==== Product testing ====
Products can be tested under laboratory conditions to assess their lifetime under different conditions of use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Discard surveys ====
Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; identify that surveys of waste treatment and recycling facilities can provide information on the age of the appliance at break or discard. Identifying information such as the product serial and/ or batch number can be used to find out a date of manufacturer from which the age of the appliance at break or discard can be calculated.

==== User interviews ====
Cooper and Mayers&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; conducted household [[interview]]s to establish the age of 17 electrical and electronic items at discard and break. However it has been noted that user interviews are subject to the accuracy of [[memory]], and that reviews of products which have failed in the past only provides information on "a historical situation" (:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;10), not taking into account the features and lifetime of extant products.

==== Modelling ====
Product lifetimes can be modelled using extant data from surveys with the application of [[probability]] and other [[Statistics|statistical concepts]] (e.g. [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www4.ntu.ac.uk/plate_conference/proceedings/index.html|title=Product Lifetimes and The Environment|last=Oguchi, M.|publisher=Nottingham Trent University|year=2015|isbn=|location=Nottingham|pages=388–393|chapter=Methodologies for estimating actual lifetime distribution of products|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest attempts to estimate product lifetimes was undertaken by Pennock and Jaeger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pennock|first=Jean L.|last2=Jaeger|first2=Carol M.|date=1957-06-01|title=Estimating the Service Life of Household Goods by Actuarial Methods|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1957.10501377|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=52|issue=278|pages=175–185|doi=10.1080/01621459.1957.10501377|issn=0162-1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; who utilised actuarial methods to measure the [[Service life]] of household goods for one owner. In the 1990s, Bayus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayus|first=Barry L.|date=1991-01-01|title=The Consumer Durable Replacement Buyer|jstor=1252202|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–51|doi=10.2307/1252202}}&lt;/ref&gt; modelled car replacement rates and Bayus and Gupta&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayus|first=Barry L.|last2=Gupta|first2=Sachin|date=1992-08-01|title=An empirical analysis of consumer durable replacement intentions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016781169290021C|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|volume=9|issue=3|pages=257–267|doi=10.1016/0167-8116(92)90021-C}}&lt;/ref&gt; evaluated the user decision making process and factors around replacement car purchases.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In 2010, Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; proposed modelling product lifetimes factoring the total number of products shipped and discarded in a year. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; outlined a series of equations which represent lifespan distributions for a given product at a particular point in time.

=== Expected product lifetimes ===
Expected product lifetimes are measured at the individual level using survey methods and collectively using focus groups. With the exception of Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Wieser et al.,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; many studies into expected product lifetimes have not distinguished between the different definitions (outlined above). The methods for measuring expected product lifetimes are outlined below.

==== Survey methods ====
Survey methods into expected product lifetimes encompass [[Online Questionnaires|online questionnaires]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; household&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and telephone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Echegaray|first=Fabián|date=2016-10-15|title=Consumers' reactions to product obsolescence in emerging markets: the case of Brazil|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652615012202|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|series=Special Volume: Transitions to Sustainable Consumption and Production in Cities|volume=134, Part A|pages=191–203|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.08.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[interview]]s. These studies asked individual participants to report their expectations for product lifetimes in units of time. Survey methods (such as Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) can also use [[Likert scale|Likert items]] to evaluate if current products meet users expectations with regards to durability and longevity.

==== Focus groups ====
[[Focus group]]s can be convened where participants take part in discussions to reach a group consensus on product lifetime expectations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Pseudorealism''', also spelled '''pseudo-realism''', is a term used in a variety of discourses connoting [[art]]istic and dramatic techniques, or work of art, film and literature perceived as superficial, ''not-real'', or non-realistic.&lt;ref name="ELS-AM"&gt;Eric Loren Smoodin, Ann Martin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R-Fs0Vwa_nQC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=%22pseudo-realism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xaHOTtSkB8OViQKC6LXPBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pseudo-realism%22&amp;f=false ''Hollywood quarterly: film culture in postwar America, 1945-1957.''

''Use of term: pseudo-realism.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term pseudo-realism has been used to describe a certain type of cultural commodities such as film productions and TV programmes which portray everyday life in excessively realistic detail in order to achieve greater impact on viewers.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite book |title=The Culture Industry Revisited: Theodor W.

Following the great shift towards expressionism in painting, André Bazin used the word ''pseudoreal'' in reference to mechanical means which freed the plastic arts from the drive toward 'unachievable likeness'. Meanwhile, [[photorealist]]ic CGI animation and [[3D computer graphics]] used today have become indistinguishable from cine-photography. In that regard, the [[special effects]] augmenting feature film through photographic deception of the eye have gained an entirely different dimension.&lt;ref name="Surman"&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Surman |url=https://www.academia.edu/168038/CGI_Animation_Pseudorealism_Perception_and_Possible_Worlds  |title=CGI Animation - Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds |work=Master's Thesis |publisher=GameCareerGuide.com (reprint)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer generated imagery and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] animation are used not only to bolster reality based images but also to create imaginary worlds.  
{{quote|We understand the CGI feature film to be an image of pseudorealism in Bazin’s terms – a fundamental deception of the eye. Of course the cinema itself in whatever incarnation involves a deception of the eye, that of the ‘persistence of vision’ effect. Though things appear to exist and have causal properties, they are the product of man-made parameters. — David Surman, "CGI Animation: Pseudorealism, Perception and Possible Worlds" &lt;ref name="Surman"/&gt;}}

[[Image:Religious syms.svg|thumb|Various [[religious symbols]]]]
'''Religious studies''', alternately known as the '''study of religion''', is an academic field devoted to research into [[religion|religious]] beliefs, [[religious behaviour|behaviors]], and institutions. It describes, compares, interprets, and explains religion, emphasizing systematic, historically based, and cross-cultural perspectives.

While [[theology]] attempts to understand the nature of transcendent or supernatural forces (such as [[deities]]),  religious studies tries to study religious behavior and belief from outside any particular religious viewpoint. Religious studies draws upon multiple disciplines and their methodologies including [[anthropology of religion|anthropology]], [[sociology of religion|sociology]], [[psychology of religion|psychology]], [[philosophy of religion|philosophy]], and [[history of religion]].

Religious studies originated in the 19th century, when scholarly and historical analysis of the [[Bible]] had flourished, and [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist texts]] were first being translated into European languages. Early influential scholars included [[Friedrich Max Müller]], in England, and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Cornelius P. Tiele]], in the Netherlands. Today religious studies is practiced by scholars worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C.S. Adcock|title=The Limits of Tolerance: Indian Secularism and the Politics of Religious Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UMfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, it was known as "[[comparative religion]]" or the '''science of religion''' and, in the USA, there are those who today also know the field as the History of religion (associated with methodological traditions traced to the University of Chicago in general, and in particular [[Mircea Eliade]], from the late 1950s through to the late 1980s). 

The religious studies scholar [[Walter Capps]] described the purpose of the discipline as to provide "training and practice... in directing and conducting inquiry regarding the subject of religion".{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xiv}} At the same time, Capps stated that its other purpose was to use "prescribed modes and techniques of inquiry to make the subject of religion intelligible."{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xiv}}
Religious studies scholar Robert A. Segal characterised the discipline as "a subject matter" that is "open to many approaches", and thus it "does not require either a distinctive method or a distinctive explanation to be worthy of disciplinary status."{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xvii}}

Different scholars operating in the field have different interests and intentions; some for instance seek to defend religion, while others seek to explain it away, and others wish to use religion as an example with which to prove a theory of their own.{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xvi}} Some scholars of religious studies are interested in primarily studying the religion to which they belong.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=15}}

Scholars of religion have argued that a study of the subject is useful for individuals because it will provide them with knowledge that is pertinent in inter-personal and professional contexts within an increasingly [[globalisation|globalised]] world.{{sfn|Herling|2016|pp=6–7}} It has also been argued that studying religion is useful in appreciating and understanding sectarian tensions and religious violence.{{sfn|Herling|2016|pp=7–10}}

==Etymology==
The term "[[religion]]" originated from the Latin noun ''religio'', that was nominalized from one of three verbs: ''relegere'' (to turn to constantly/observe conscientiously); ''religare'' (to bind oneself [back]); and ''reeligere'' (to choose again).&lt;ref&gt;McBrien, Richard P.  ''Catholicism.'' New York: HarperCollins, 1994, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of these three different potential meanings, an [[etymology|etymological]] analysis alone does not resolve the ambiguity of defining religion, since each verb points to a different understanding of what religion is. During the Medieval Period, the term "religious" was used as a noun to describe someone who had joined a monastic order (a "religious").

==Defining "religion"==
[[File:Totem poles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Totem pole]]s reflect the beliefs of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]]; some religious studies scholars argue that the term "religion" is too Western-centric to encompass the beliefs and practices of communities such as these]]

Throughout the history of religious studies, there have been many attempts to define the term "religion".{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xviii}} Many of these have been ''monothetic'', seeking to determine a key, essential element which all religions share, which can be used to define "religion" as a category, and which must be necessary in order for something to be classified as a "religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Capps|1y=1995|1p=xviii|2a1=Herling|2y=2016|2p=37}} There are two forms of monothetic definition; the first are ''substantive'', seeking to identify a specific core as being at the heart of religion, such as a belief in a God or gods, or an emphasis on power.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}} The second are ''functional'', seeking to define "religion" in terms of what it does for humans, for instance defining it by the argument that it exists to assuage fear of death, unite a community, or reinforce the control of one group over another.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}} Other forms of definition are ''polythetic'', producing a list of characteristics that are common to religion. In this definition there is no one characteristic that need be common to every form of religion.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}}

Causing further complications is the fact that there are various [[secularism|secular]] world views, such as [[nationalism]] and [[Marxism]], which bear many of the same characteristics that are commonly associated with religion, but which rarely consider themselves to be religious.{{sfn|Smart|1998|pp=22–26}}

Conversely, other scholars of religious studies have argued that the discipline should reject the term "religion" altogether and cease trying to define it.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=36}} In this perspective, "religion" is argued to be a Western concept that has been forced upon other cultures in an act of intellectual imperialism.{{sfn|Hinnells|2005|p=2}} According to scholar of religion [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], "many of the peoples that we study by means of this category have no equivalent term or concept whatsoever".{{sfn|McCutcheon|2001|p=10}} There is, for instance, no word for "religion" in languages like [[Sanskrit]].{{sfn|Hinnells|2005|p=2}}

==Intellectual foundation and background==
Before religious studies became a field in its own right, flourishing in the United States in the late 1960s,  several key intellectual figures explored religion from a variety of perspectives. One of these figures was the famous [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[William James]]. His 1902 [[Gifford lectures]] and book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' examined religion from a psychological-philosophical perspective and is still influential today. His essay ''[[The Will to Believe]]'' defends the rationality of faith.

[[Max Weber]] studied religion from an economic perspective in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1904-1905), his most famous work. As a major figure in [[sociology]], he has no doubt influenced later sociologists of religion.
[[Émile Durkheim]] also holds continuing influence as one of the fathers of sociology. He explored [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] attitudes and doctrines regarding suicide in his work ''Suicide''. In 1912, he published his most memorable work on religion, ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''.

==History==
[[Image:Max Muller.jpg|thumb|right|[[Max Müller]]]]Interest in the general study of religion dates back to at least [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] ([[ca.]] 550 [[Common Era|BCE]] &amp;ndash; ca. 476 BCE) and [[Herodotus]] (ca. 484 BCE &amp;ndash; 425 BCE). Later, during the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]]ic scholars such as [[Ibn Hazm]] (d. 1064 CE) studied [[Zoroastrianism|Persian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Indian religions]], among others. The first history of religion was the ''Treatise on the Religious and Philosophical Sects'' (1127 CE), written by the Muslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]]. [[Peter the Venerable]], also working in the twelfth century, studied Islam and made possible a Latin translation of the [[Qur'an]].
Notwithstanding the long interest in the study of religion, the academic discipline Religious Studies is relatively new. Dr. Chris Partridge notes that the "first professorships were established as recently as the final quarter of the nineteenth century."[http://www.uccf.org.uk/yourcourse/rtsf/docs/academicstudyofreligion.pdf]
In the nineteenth century, the study of religion was done through the eyes of science. [[Max Müller]] was the first Professor of Comparative Philology at [[Oxford University]], a chair created especially for him. In his ''Introduction to the Science of Religion'' (1873) he wrote that it is "the duty of those who have devoted their life to the study of the principal religions of the world in their original documents, and who value and reverence it in whatever form it may present itself, to take possession of this new territory in the name of true science."

Many of the key scholars who helped to establish the study of religion did not regard themselves as scholars of religious studies, but rather as theologians, philosophers, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and historians.{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xv}}

Partridge writes that "by the second half of the twentieth century the study of religion had emerged as a prominent and important field of academic enquiry." He cites the growing distrust of the empiricism of the nineteenth century and the growing interest in non-Christian religions and spirituality coupled with convergence of the work of social scientists and that of scholars of religion as factors involved in the rise of Religious Studies.

One of the earliest academic institutions where Religious Studies was presented as a distinct subject was University College Ibadan, now the [[University of Ibadan]], where [[Geoffrey Parrinder]] was appointed as lecturer in Religious Studies in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/05/guardianobituaries.religion|title=Obituary: Geoffrey Parrinder|first=Ursula|last=King|date=4 August 2005|website=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710093222/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/05/guardianobituaries.religion|archivedate=10 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the term "religious studies" became common and interest in the field increased. New departments were founded and influential journals of religious studies were initiated (for example, ''Religious Studies and Religion''). In the forward to ''Approaches to the Study of Religion'', [[Ninian Smart]] wrote that "in the English-speaking world [religious studies] basically dates from the 1960s, although before then there were such fields as 'the comparative study of religion', the 'history of religion', the 'sociology of religion' and so on..."

In the 1980s, in both [[UK|Britain]] and [[United States|America]], "the decrease in student applications and diminishing resources in the 1980s led to cut backs affecting religious studies departments." (Partridge) Later in the decade, religious studies began to pick up as a result of integrating religious studies with other disciplines and forming programs of study that mixed the discipline with more utilitarian study.

Philosophy of religion uses philosophical tools to evaluate religious claims and doctrines.  Western philosophy has traditionally been employed by English speaking scholars.  (Some other cultures have their own philosophical traditions including [[Hinduism|Indian]], [[Islam|Muslim]], and [[Judaism|Jewish]].)  Common issues considered by the (Western) philosophy of religion are the existence of [[God]], belief and rationality, [[religious cosmology|cosmology]], and logical inferences of logical consistency from sacred texts.

Although philosophy has long been used in evaluation of religious claims (''e.g.'' [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]]'s debate concerning original sin), the rise of [[scholasticism]] in the 11th century, which represented "the search for order in intellectual life" (Russell, 170), more fully integrated the Western philosophical tradition (with the introduction of translations of [[Aristotle]]) in religious study.

There is some amount of overlap between subcategories of religious studies and the discipline itself.  Religious studies seeks to study religious phenomena as a whole, rather than be limited to the approaches of its subcategories.

===Anthropology of religion===
The [[anthropology of religion]] is principally concerned with the common basic human needs that religion fulfills.

===Cultural anthropology of religion===
The [[cultural anthropology]] of religion is principally concerned with the cultural aspects of religion. Of primary concern to the cultural anthropologist of religions are rituals, beliefs, religious art, and practices of piety.

===Economics of religion===
Gallup surveys have found that the world's poorest countries may be the most religious. Of those countries with average per-capita incomes under $2000, 95% reported that religion played an important role in their daily lives. This is contrasted by the average of 47% from the richest countries, with incomes over $25000 (with the United States breaking the trend by reporting at 65%).&lt;ref name=GallupE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|title=Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|date=|website=gallup.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823202612/http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|archivedate=23 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social scientists have suggested that religion plays a functional role (helping people cope) in poorer nations.&lt;ref name=GallupE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/Religion-Provides-Emotional-Boost-World-Poor.aspx|title=Religion Provides Emotional Boost to World’s Poor|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|date=|website=gallup.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912113232/http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/religion-provides-emotional-boost-world-poor.aspx|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The New York Times offers a graphic illustrating the correlation (not necessarily causation) [http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/09/religions-correlation-with-poverty/ between religion and poverty].

===Geography of religion===
The geography of religion is principally concerned with the spatial elements of religious practice and embodiment.  In the 1960s and 1970s, geographers of religion such as Wilbur Zelinsky and David Sopher were mostly associated with the "Berkeley school" of cultural geography and focused mostly on the cultural imprints of religion on the landscape. 
Since the turn in the new cultural geography of religion through the work of James Duncan on the City as Text, geographers of religion have focused on what Lily Kong has called the "politics and poetics" of religion, especially in relation to the political geographies of secular nation-states. Recent interest{{when|date=September 2018}} in the geography of religion has focused on how religious practitioners enact sacred space through their embodied sacred practices as well as the relationship between religion and geopolitics.

===History of religion===
{{See also|History of religion}}
The history of religions is not concerned with theological claims apart from their historical significance.  Some topics of this discipline are the [[historicity]] of religious figures, events, and the evolution of doctrinal matters.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin M. Schultz and Paul Harvey, "Everywhere and Nowhere: Recent Trends in American Religious History and Historiography," ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', 78 (March 2010), 129–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary approaches===
There are many approaches to the study of sacred texts.  One of these approaches is to interpret the text as a literary object.  Metaphor, thematic elements, and the nature and motivations of the characters are of interest in this approach. An example of this approach is ''[[God: A Biography]]'', by [[Jack Miles]].

===Neurological approaches===
The [[temporal lobe]] has been of interest which has been termed the "God center" of the brain. (Ramachandran, ch. 9) [[Neurological]] findings in regard to religious experience is not a widely accepted discipline within religious studies. Scientific investigators have used a [[SPECT]]scanner to analyze the brain activity of both Christian contemplatives and Buddhist meditators, finding them to be quite similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Origin of religion===
{{main|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Revelation}}
The "origin of religion" refers to the emergence of religious behavior in [[prehistory]], before written records.

===Psychology of religion===
{{Main|Psychology of religion}}

The psychology of religion is concerned with the psychological principles operative in religious communities and practitioners. [[William James]]'s [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]] analyzed personal experience as contrasted with the social phenomenon of religion. Some issues of concern to the psychologist of religions are the psychological nature of [[religious conversion]], the making of religious decisions, [[religion and happiness]], and the psychological factors in evaluating religious claims.

[[Sigmund Freud]] was another figure in the field of psychology and religion.  He used his psychoanalytic theory to explain religious beliefs, practices, and rituals, in order to justify the role of religion in the development of human culture.

===Sociology of religion===
{{main|Sociology of religion}}
The sociology of religion concerns the [[dialectic]]al relationship between religion and [[society]]; the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Christiano, et al., (2nd ed., 2008), Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments, Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-6111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs, though the process of comparing multiple conflicting [[dogma]]s may require what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as inherent "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: {{ISBN|0-385-07305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from theology in assuming the invalidity of the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural [[Concretization|reification]] of religious practise.

It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology ''began'' with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. The works of Max Weber emphasised the relationship between religious belief and the [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|economic foundations of society]]. Contemporary debates have centred on issues such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]].

The sociology of religion also deals with how religion impacts society regarding the positive and negatives of what happens when religion is mixed with society. Theorist such as Marx states that “religion is the opium of the people” - the idea that religion has become a way for people to deal with their problems. At least one comprehensive study refutes this idea. Research has found that secular democracies like [[France]] or [[Scandinavia]] outperform more theistic democracies on various measures of societal health. The authors explains, "Pressing questions include the reasons, whether theistic or non-theistic, that the exceptionally wealthy U.S. is so inefficient that it is experiencing a much higher degree of societal distress than are less religious, less wealthy prosperous democracies. Conversely, how do the latter achieve superior societal health while having little in the way of the religious values or institutions?"&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Paul, "Cross-national correlations of quantifiable societal health with popular religiosity and secularism in the prosperous democracies," ''Journal of Religion &amp; Society'' (2005) 1#1 pp 1-17 [http://globalhealth.washington.edu/docs/Bezruchka%202.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123104528/http://globalhealth.washington.edu/docs/Bezruchka%202.pdf |date=2014-01-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law and religion ===
{{main|Law and religion}}
Vogel reports that in the 1970s a new "law and religion" approach has progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the ''Journal of Law and Religion'' first published that year and the ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' opened in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vogel | first1 = Howard J. | year = 1983 | title = A Survey and Commentary on the New Literature in Law and Religion | journal = Journal of Law and Religion | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 79–169 | jstor=1051074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. As of 2012, major Law and Religion organizations in the U.S. included 500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics on interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion interrelations in law and religion in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elizabeth Mayer | first1 = Ann | year = 1987 | title = Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East | journal = American Journal of Comparative Law | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 127–184 | jstor=840165}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pagan Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and film===
The earliest serious writing on the interface between religion and film appeared in the work of film critics like [[Jean Epstein]] in the 1920s.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=16}}
The subject has grown in popularity with students and is cited as having particular relevance given the pervasiveness of film in modern culture.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=13}} Approaches to the study of religion and film differ among scholars; functionalist approaches for instance view film as a site in which religion is manifested, while theological approaches examine film as a reflection of God's presence in all things.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=14}}

==Methodologies==
A number of methodologies are used in Religious Studies.  Methodologies are [[hermeneutic]]s, or interpretive models, that provide a structure for the analysis of religious phenomena.

===Phenomenology===
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}
[[phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology ]] is "arguably the most influential approach to the study of religion in the twentieth century." (Partridge)  The term is first found in the title of the work of the influential philosopher of [[German Idealism]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], entitled [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]].  Phenomenology had been practiced long before its being made explicit as a philosophical method by [[Edmund Husserl]], who is considered to be its founder.  In the context of [[Phenomenology of religion]] however, the term was first used by [[Pierre Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye]] in his work "Lehrbuch der Religiongeschichte" (1887). Chantepie's phenomenology catalogued observable characteristics of religion much like a zoologist would categorize animals or an entomologist would categorize insects.

In part due to [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] influence, "phenomenology" came to "refer to a method which is more complex and claims rather more for itself than did Chantepie’s mere cataloguing of facts." (Partridge)  Husserl argued that the foundation of knowledge is [[consciousness]].  He recognized "how easy it is for prior beliefs and interpretations to unconsciously influence one’s thinking, Husserl’s phenomenological method sought to shelve all these presuppositions and interpretations." (Partridge)  Husserl introduced the term "eidetic vision" to describe the ability to observe without "prior beliefs and interpretations" influencing understanding and perception.

His other main conceptual contribution is the idea of the [[epoche]]: setting aside metaphysical questions and observing phenomena in and of themselves, without any bias or commitments on the part of the investigator.  The epoche, also known as phenomenological reduction or bracketing, involves approaching a phenomenon or phenomena from a neutral standpoint, instead of with our own particular attitudes.  In performing this reduction, whatever phenomenon or phenomena we approach are understood in themselves, rather than from our own perspectives.  In the field of religious studies, a contemporary advocate of the phenomenological method is Ninian Smart. He suggests that we should perform the epoche as a means to engage in cross-cultural studies.  In doing so, we can take the beliefs, symbols, rituals etc. of the other from within their own perspective, rather than imposing ours on them.  Another earlier scholar who employs the phenomenological method for studying religion is [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]].  In his ''Religion in Essence and Manifestation'' (1933), he outlines what a phenomenology of religion should look like:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Firstly, argues van der Leeuw, the student of religion needs to classify the religious phenomena into distinct categories: e.g. sacrifice, sacrament, sacred space, sacred time, sacred word, festivals, and myth.
* Secondly, scholars then need to interpolate the phenomena into their own lives. That is to say, they need to empathetically (Einfühlung) try and understand the religion from within....The life examined by the religious studies scholar, insists van der Leeuw, needs to "acquire its place in the life of the student himself who should understand it out of his inner self."
* Thirdly, van der Leeuw stresses perhaps the fundamental phenomenological principle, namely epoch, the suspension of value-judgements and the adoption of a neutral stance.
* Fourthly, scholars needs to clarify any apparent structural relationships and make sense of the information. In so doing, they move towards a holistic understanding of how the various aspects of a religion relate and function together.
* Fifthly, this leads naturally to a stage at which "all these activities, undertaken together and simultaneously, constitute genuine understanding [Verstehen]: the chaotic and obstinate 'reality' thus becomes a manifestation, a revelation" (eidetic vision).
* Sixthly, having thus attained this general grasp, there is a continual need to make sure that it tallies with the up-to-date research of other disciplines, such as archaeology, history, philology etc. For van der Leeuw, as for other phenomenologists, the continual checking of one’s results is crucial to the maintenance of scholarly objectivity. In order to avoid degeneration into fantasy, phenomenology must always feed on facts.
* Finally, having gone through the above six stages, the phenomenologist should be as close as anyone can be to an understanding of the 'meaning' of the religious phenomena studied and be in a position to relate his understanding to others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The subjectivity inherent to the phenomenological study of religion makes complete and comprehensive understanding highly difficult. However, phenomenologists aim to separate their formal study of religion from their own theological worldview and to eliminate, as far as possible, any personal biases (e.g., a Christian phenomenologist would avoid studying Hinduism through the lens of Christianity).

There are a number of both theoretical and methodological attitudes common among phenomenologists:[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817094359/http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/phenom.htm source]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose the acceptance of unobservable matters and grand systems erected in speculative thinking;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose naturalism (also called objectivism and positivism), which is the worldview growing from modern natural science and technology that has been spreading from Northern Europe since the Renaissance;
* Positively speaking, phenomenologists tend to justify cognition (and some also evaluation and action) with reference to what Edmund Husserl called Evidenz, which is awareness of a matter itself as disclosed in the most clear, distinct, and adequate way for something of its kind;
* Phenomenologists tend to believe that not only objects in the natural and cultural worlds, but also ideal objects, such as numbers, and even conscious life itself can be made evident and thus known;
* Phenomenologists tend to hold that inquiry ought to focus upon what might be called "encountering" as it is directed at objects and, correlatively, upon "objects as they are encountered" (this terminology is not widely shared, but the emphasis on a dual problematics and the reflective approach it requires is);
* Phenomenologists tend to recognize the role of description in universal, a priori, or "eidetic" terms as prior to explanation by means of causes, purposes, or grounds; and
* Phenomenologists tend to debate whether or not what Husserl calls the transcendental phenomenological epochê and reduction is useful or even possible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scholars of religious studies argued that phenomenology was "the distinctive method of the discipline".{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xiii}}
In 2006, the phenomenologist of religion [[Thomas Ryba]] noted that this approach to the study of religion had "entered a period of dormancy".{{sfn|Ryba|2006|p=119}}
Phenomenological approaches were largely taxonomical, with [[Robert A. Segal]] stating that it amounted to "no more than data gathering" alongside "the classification of the data gathered".{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xiii}}

===Functionalism===
[[Structural functionalism|Functionalism]], in regard to religious studies, is the analysis of religions and their various communities of adherents using the functions of particular religious phenomena to interpret the structure of religious communities and their beliefs. The approach was introduced by British anthropologist [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Connolly|title=Approaches to the Study of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0PUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=2001|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major criticism of functionalism is that it lends itself to [[teleology|teleological]] explanations.  An example of a functionalist approach is understanding the dietary restrictions contained in the [[Pentateuch]] as having the function of promoting health or providing social identity (''i.e.'' a sense of belonging though common practice).

===Lived religion===
[[Lived religion]] is the ethnographic and holistic framework for understanding the beliefs, practices, and everyday experiences of religious and spiritual persons in religious studies. The name lived religion comes from the French tradition of sociology of religion "la religion vécue".&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of lived religion was popularized in the late 20th century by religious study scholars like [[Robert A. Orsi]] and [[David D. Hall|David Hall]]. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.

==Religious studies and theology==
Western philosophy of religion, as the basic ancestor of modern religious studies, is differentiated from theology and the many Eastern philosophical traditions by generally being written from a third party perspective. The scholar need not be a believer. Theology stands in contrast to the philosophy of religion and religious studies in that, generally, the scholar is first and foremost a believer employing both logic ''and'' scripture as evidence.  Theology according to this understanding fits with the definition which [[Anselm of Canterbury]] gave to it in the 11th century, [[credo ut intelligam]], or faith seeking understanding (literally, "I believe so that I may understand").  The theologian then has the task of making intelligible, or clarifying, the religious commitments to which he or she subscribes.  The scholar of religious studies has no such allegiances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John M. Riddle|title=A History of the Middle Ages, 300-1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&amp;pg=PA291|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A group of scholars have criticized religious studies beginning in the 1990s as a theological project which actually imposes views onto the people it aims to survey. Prominent voices in this critical view include [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], [[Tomoko Masuzawa]], Geoffrey A. Oddie, [[Richard E. King]], [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], and Daniel Dubuisson. Their areas of research overlap heavily with [[postcolonial studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dubuisson. "Exporting the Local: Recent Perspectives on 'Religion' as a Cultural Category." ''Religion Compass'' 1.6 (2007), pp. 787-800.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly journals==
Much of the latest scholarship appears in the scholarly journals, which also typically review and evaluate new monographs. There are a large numbers of peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the discipline of Religious Studies. Many journals focus on historical or sociological topics or concentrate on particular religious traditions, such as Judaism or Islam. Religious studies journals have been laggard in gaining accessibility through the Internet, but libraries specializing in religious history have started to catch up.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Eidson, "Electronic journals in religious studies: Theological libraries prepare for the digital future." ''Journal of Religious &amp; Theological Information'' 3.3-4 (2001): 45-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate L. Ganski, "Accessibility of E-resources from Theological Library Websites."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8781">The '''STEPS Centre''' (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) is an interdisciplinary global research and policy engagement hub at the [[University of Sussex]]. It is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]. The Centre brings together [[development studies]] with [[science and technology studies]] and was launched at [[Portcullis House]] in London on 25 June 2007 &lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,,2111237,00.html STEPS towards better development by Mark Tran, The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

By acknowledging the interactions between social, technological and environmental factors in diverse local settings the STEPS Centre seeks to help create more sustainable and socially just conditions for poorer people. Based at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS) and the [[Science Policy Research Unit]] ([[SPRU]]) at the [[University of Sussex]] in the UK, the Centre works with partners in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Professor Ian Scoones &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/ian-scoones IDS Profile for Ian Scoones]&lt;/ref&gt; is the director of the STEPS Centre and Professor [[Andy Stirling]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/300596/Path-finder.htm Path-finder by Andrew Lee, The Engineer, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829000212/http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/300596/Path-finder.htm |date=29 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; its co-director. Professor [[Melissa Leach]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/academicexperts/story/0,,2127736,00.html Melissa Leach: Village voice. To know what's happening around the world, you must ask the locals by Jessica Shepherd, The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wpsite/wp-content/uploads/ML_-Lunch-with-the-Lancet_-Vol-371-June-21-2008.pdf Perspectives by Priya Shetty, The Lancet, Jun 2008]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; stepped down as STEPS Director in 2014 to become Director of the [[Institute of Development Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/2013/blog/melissa-leach-ids-director/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advisory board ==

The STEPS Centre Advisory Board is chaired by Mike Hulme ([[King's College London]]) with members including [[Brian Wynne]] (CESAGEN, [[University of Lancaster]]), Carl Folke ([[Stockholm Resilience Centre]]), Dipak Gyawali ([[Nepal Academy of Science and Technology]]), [[Fred Pearce]] (science writer), [[Sue Hartley]] (Director, York Environmental Sustainability Institute), [[Suman Sahai]] (Convenor, [[Gene Campaign]]), and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaslingard Thomas Lingard] (Global External Affairs Director, [[Unilever]]).

== Areas of work ==

The STEPS Centre brings together [[social scientists]] and [[natural science|natural scientists]] to work together to try and achieve a breakthrough in thinking and action for development. The Centre's unique ‘pathways’ approach interweaves social, technological and environmental conditions with dynamic change &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/CP/the_edge/issue27/pathways.aspx?ComponentId=26077&amp;SourcePageId=26118 Building genuine pathways to a more secure future, ESRC Today]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; across three domains - food and agriculture; health and disease; water and sanitation - and three themes - dynamics; governance; designs.

Through linking across domains and themes in its projects, the STEPS Centre connects new theory with practical approaches in a bid to help provide sustainable opportunities for poor and marginalised people.

== Pathways approach ==

The STEPS Centre's pathways approach aims to understand the complex, non-linear interactions between social, technological and environmental systems. Some pathways may threaten poor peoples’ livelihoods and health while others create opportunities for sustainability.

The Centre aims to link social scientists, natural scientists and users to develop new tools and methods linking theory with practical solutions. It also offers teaching, in conjunction with IDS and SPRU, to help train a new generation of researchers on MA and PhD courses.

A paper published in 2007 entitled Pathways to Sustainability: an Overview of the STEPS Centre Approach &lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wpsite/wp-content/uploads/final_steps_overview.pdf Pathways to Sustainability: An overview of the STEPS Centre's Approach]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; outlined the STEPS Centre approach to understanding dynamic systems and their governance. The paper laid out the ingredients of the STEPS Centre's work, including linking diverse social and natural science perspectives, connecting theory, policy and practice and an engaged, interactive approach to communications. Promoting pathways to Sustainability that meet the perspectives and priorities of poor and marginalised groups is at the heart of the pathways approach.

'''Socioscientific Issues (SSI)''' are controversial social issues which relate to science.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Keefer, M. (2003). The role of moral reasoning and the status of socioscientific issues in science education: Philosophical, psychological and pedagogical considerations. In D.L. Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt; They are ill-structured, open-ended problems which have multiple solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D. (2004). Informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: A critical review of research. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 41, 513-536&lt;/ref&gt;

SSI are utilized in [[science education]] in order to promote [[scientific literacy]], which emphasizes the ability to apply scientific and moral reasoning to real-world situations.  Some examples of SSI include issues such as [[genetic engineering]], [[climate change]], [[animal testing]] for medical purposes, oil drilling in national parks, and "fat taxes" on "unhealthy" foods, among many others.  Research studies have shown SSI to be effective at increasing students' understanding of science in various contexts, [[Argumentation theory|argumentation skills]], [[empathy]], and [[Moral philosophy|moral reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2005). The significance of content knowledge for informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: Applying genetics knowledge to genetic engineering issues. Science Education, 89(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., &amp; Sadler, T. D. (2008). The role of moral reasoning in argumentation: Conscience, character and care. In S. Erduran &amp; M. Pilar Jimenez-Aleixandre (Eds.), Argumentation in science education: Perspectives from classroom-based research (pp. 201-216). The Netherlands: Springer Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals of SSI ==
Supporters of SSI argue that it can:
* 1) Cultivate a scientifically literate citizens who are able to apply evidence-based scientific content knowledge to real-world socioscientific scenarios;
* 2) Foster a collective [[social conscience]] whereby students consistently reflect upon the formation and implications of their own reasoning;
* 3) Encourage [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]] skills that are essential for thinking and reasoning processes and mirror the types of discourse utilized in real-world scientific deliberations;
* 4) Promote [[critical thinking]] skills, such as analysis, inference, explanation,
evaluation, interpretation, and self-regulation&lt;ref&gt;Facione, P. A. (2007). Critical thinking: What it is and why it counts (2007 update). Millbrae, CA: Insight Assessment/California Academic Press LLC. Retrieved April 28, 2009, from www.insightassessment.com/pdf_files/what&amp;why2006. pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Science educators often refer to all of these aspects together as,"functional scientific literacy."&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical Context of SSI ==

=== Scientific Literacy - Vision I and II ===
Scientific literacy has been defined by two competing visions. A Vision I approach to scientific literacy is characterized by content-driven, decontextualized science knowledge.  A Vision II approach to scientific literacy is a context-driven, student-centered approach which seeks to prepare students for informed [[civic engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, D.A. (2007). Scientific literacy / science literacy. In S.K. Abell &amp; N.G. Lederman (Eds.), Handbook of research on science education (pp. 729-780). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSI framework follows a Vision II approach as it is believed to provide an opportunity for contextualized learning of science content as well as an opportunity for moral development.

=== SSI Distinguished from Science, Technology, and Society (STS) ===
SSI is conceptually related to [[Science, technology and society|Science, Technology, and Society]] (STS) education.  However, while both approaches connect science to societal issues, SSI is distinguished from STS because of its emphasis on the development of character and virtue as well as content knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeidler|first=D.|author2=Sadler, T.D. |author3=Simmons, M.L. |author4=Howes, E.V. |title=Beyond STS: A Research-Based|journal=Science Education|year=2005|volume=89|issue=3|pages=357–377|doi=10.1002/sce.20048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SSI and Moral Reasoning ==
Research suggests that SSI creates [[cognitive dissonance]] by compelling students to consider claims that may be at odds with their own beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Nichols, B.H. (2009). Socioscientific Issues: Theory and Practice. Journal of Elementary Science Education, 21, 2, 49-58&lt;/ref&gt; Dissonance of this nature is believed by some to advance [[moral reasoning]] by ‘empowering students to consider how science based issues and the decisions made concerning them reflect, in part, the moral principles and qualities of [[virtue]] that encompass their own lives, as well as the physical and social world around them.'&lt;ref&gt;
Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Supporting SSI ==
SSI education has been [[empirically]] investigated and linked to particular outcomes including:
• Promoting developmental changes in reflective judgment;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D., Sadler, T., Applebaum, S., &amp; Callahan, B. (2009). Advancing reflective
judgment through socioscientific issues. Journal of Research in Science Teaching,

Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt;
• Improve [[argumentation]] skills;&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Donnelly, L. A. (2006). Socioscientific argumentation: The effects of content knowledge and
morality. International Journal of Science Education.&lt;/ref&gt;
• Promote understanding of eco-justice and [[environmental awareness]];&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, M.P. &amp; Zeidler, D.L. (2010). Moral-ethical character and science education:

M., van Eijck &amp; Adams, J. (Eds), Cultural studies and environmentalism: The
confluence of ecojustice, place-based (science) education, and indigenous
knowledge systems (pp 105-128). New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and
• Engage students’ interest in the [[Inquiry-based science|inquiry of science]].

More recently, SSI research has been focused on cross-cultural comparisons and research has reflected international partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H.; Chang, H., Choi, K., Kim, S., Zeidler, D.L. (2011). "Developing Character and Values for Global Citizens: Analysis of pre-service science". International Journal of Science Education: 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized by some that more advanced stages of epistemological reasoning allows individuals to apply a kind of socioscientific reasoning (SSR)&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D., Barab, S.A. and Scott, B. 2006. What do students gain by engaging in socio‐scientific inquiry?. Research in Science Education, 37: 371–391.&lt;/ref&gt; akin to scientific habits of mind. SSR is a theoretical construct that entails the ability to tap key traits while negotiating SSI. These include [[skepticism]], [[complexity]], [[multiple perspective]] and [[inquiry]].

== SSI in the Classroom ==

Teachers utilize SSI to foster understanding of science content and consequences involved in everyday scientific issues.  For example, in a study of [[ecology]], an elementary class might consider whether pesticides confer more benefit or harm to our ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, C., &amp; Davis, E. A. (2008a). Exploring preservice elementary teachers’ critique and adaptation of science curriculum materials in respect to socioscientific issues. Science and Education, 17(8–9),829–854.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of analysis would require students to research the interractions between organisms in food webs and food chains, as well as the human impacts of pesticides. Students could make [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based decisions]] and discuss them through various means including whole-class discussions, [[debates]], [[discussion boards|online discussion boards]], etc... Similarly, older grades might consider issues such as whether [[genetic engineering]] should be used to treat genetic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2004). Negotiating gene therapy controversies. The
American Biology Teacher, 66, 428–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of analysis would require extensive study of genetics and modern genetic engineering techniques, as well as the ethical issues involved in [[personal freedom]]s, religious prohibitions on intervention, and so on.  Advocates suggest that, through evidence-based [[discourse]], students learn to formulate their own informed decisions and understand those whose views differ from themselves.  An essential aspect of the implementation of SSI is that the teacher is not promoting any particular belief; rather, the teacher's role is to promote evidence-based critical thinking and argumentation.

The '''sociology of art''' is a subfield of [[sociology]] concerned with the social worlds of [[art]] and [[aesthetics]].

Studying the sociology of art throughout history is the study of the [[social history of art]], how various societies contributed to the appearance of certain artists.

In her 1970 book ''Meaning and Expression: Toward a Sociology of Art'', Hanna Deinhard gives these defining features of a sociology of art: "The point of departure of the sociology of art is the question: How is it possible that works of art, which always originate as products of human activity ''within'' a particular time and society and ''for'' a particular time, society, or function -- even though they are not necessarily produced as 'works of art' -- can live beyond their time and seem expressive and meaningful in completely different epochs and societies? On the other hand, how can the age and society that produced them be recognized in the works?&lt;ref name="M&amp;E" /&gt;"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8053">'''Space in landscape design''' refers to theories about the meaning and [[nature]] of [[space]] as a [[volume]] and as an element of [[design]]. The concept of space as the fundamental medium of [[landscape design]] grew from debates tied to [[modernism]], [[contemporary art]], Asian art and design as seen in the [[Japanese garden]], and [[architecture]].

==Europe==
[[Elizabeth K. Meyer]] cites [[Claude-Henri Watelet|Claude-Henri Watelet's]] ''Essay on Gardens'' (1774) as perhaps the first reference to space in garden/architectural theory.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, lecture notes: "The Spatial medium of modernism between open space and figural space/Kiley's articulated spaces and multivalent landscapes: abstract modern grid and contextual response/The grid, the bosque, the allée. Planted form as spatial device".&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] in 1918 wrote "Space Composition in Architecture", which directly linked [[painting]] and [[gardens]] as arts involved in the creation of space.

The origins of modern northern European thought is a German [[aesthetic philosophy]] of the 1890s. By the 1920s,  [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theories of relativity were replacing [[Sir Isaac Newton|Newton's]] conception of universal space. Practitioners such as [[Fletcher Steele]], [[James C. Rose|James Rose]], [[Garrett Eckbo]], and [[Dan Kiley]] began to write and design through a vocabulary of lines, volumes, masses and planes in an attempt to replace the prevalent debate, centered around ideas of the formal and informal, with one that would more closely align their field with the [[fine art]]s.

According to [[Adrian Forty]],&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Forty, ''Words and Building: A Vocabulary of Modern Architecture'' (New York: Thames and Hudson, 2000), 256-275.&lt;/ref&gt; the term "[[space]]" in relation to design was all but meaningless until the 1890s. At that time two schools began to develop. Viennese [[Gottfried Semper]] in 1880 developed an [[architectural theory]] based the idea that the first impulse of [[architecture]] was the enclosure of space. [[Camillo Sitte]] extended Semper's ideas to exterior spaces in his ''City Planning According to Artistic Principles'' (1889). Concurrently, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] built on ideas from [[Emmanuel Kant|Kant]] which emphasized the experience of space as a force field generated by human movement and perception. [[Martin Heidegger]] would later contradict both of these schools. In his 1927 ''Being and Time'' and 1951 "Building, Dwelling, Thinking" he claimed that space was neither a construct of the mind nor a given, but was "that for which a room has been made" and was created by the object within a room rather than the room itself. [[Henri Lefebvre]] would call all of this into question, linking designers' notions of themselves as space-makers to a subservience to a dominant [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. He felt that the [[abstract space]] they had created had destroyed [[social space]] through alienation, separation, and a privileging of the eye.

[[James C. Rose|James Rose]] and [[Garrett Eckbo]], colleagues at [[Harvard]] in the 1930s, were the pioneers of a movement which adopted ideas about space from artists such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Naum Gabo]] and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]], and from architectural ideas based om [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe's]] [[free plan]]. Seeing gardens as outdoor rooms or [[sculptures]] to be walked through, they prioritized movement. In analogy to [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], Rose in particular saw elements of [[landscape]] as having architectural volume, not just mass: "In pure landscape, we drop the structural shell and the volume is defined by earth, paving, water and ground cover; foliage, walls, structures and other vertical elements on the sides, and sky, branching and roofing above."&lt;ref&gt;James Rose, "Plant Forms and Space" Pencil Points 10(1938), 227.&lt;/ref&gt;   Eckbo adopted the grid of [[columns]] and thin [[wall]]s of the free plan to make a statement about the social function of the [[garden]] as a place where the [[individual]] and the [[collective]] coincide.

By the 1940s, writings about space in landscape design had proliferated. [[Siegfried Giedion]], in his ''Space, Time and Architecture'', reframed the history of architecture as that of the history of space. [[Ernő Goldfinger]] wrote several influential articles in ''Architectural Review''&lt;ref&gt;"The Sensation of Space", "The Elements of Enclosed Space", and "Urbanism and Spatial Order", 1941-1942.&lt;/ref&gt;  addressing the subconscious effect of the sizes and shapes of spaces. He notes that [[perception]] of space happens in a state of distraction: we are required to move through a landscape in order to fully experience it. [[Dan Kiley]] absorbed these writings and built upon the work of Rose and Eckbo, promoting asymmetry over [[symmetry]], [[balance in art|balance]] over [[hierarchy]], multiple centers, and figure-ground ambiguity.

==Minimalism==
[[Minimalism|Minimalist art]] would have a profound influence on designers of the 1960s such as [[Peter Walker (architect)|Peter Walker]], [[Martha Schwartz]], and [[Hideo Sasaki]]. On the one hand, [[Sol LeWitt|Sol LeWitt's]] space-frame sculptures and [[Carl Andre|Carl Andre's]] floor sculptures of [[mass production|mass-produced objects]] allowed a re-thinking of the necessity for [[wall]]s in the formation of [[space]]. [[Geometry]], repetition, and changes in ground plane created a "field of making" in which walls and even plantings were questioned as essential elements of landscape. Equally at issue in applied practice was the [[perception]] on the part of Sasaki that landscape had come to be seen as "open space", a white sheet of paper on which to display [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] buildings. This disconnection with the [[landscape]] was especially notable in corporate office parks, and Sasaki and Walker addressed this through an attempt to connect interior and exterior spaces.

[[James Corner]] considers landscape spatiality to be one of the three things that distinguish the medium of landscape (the others are landscape temporality and landscape materiality). He refers to [[Gaston Bachelard]]&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard's ''The Poetics of Space'' was published in 1951 and had immense influence on designers and artists.&lt;/ref&gt;  in emphasizing the role of scale and psychic location, which distinguish the space of landscape from that of [[architecture]] and [[painting]]: "the immediate immensity of the world from the inner immensity of the imagination, the inner space of the self&lt;ref&gt;James Corner, "Representation and landscape: drawing and making in the landscape medium" Word &amp; Image 8(July-Sept. 1992) 246.&lt;/ref&gt;".

[[Augustin Berque]] analyses landscape space by comparing Newtonian [[universal space]] and [[René Descartes|Cartesian dualistic space]], in which there is a distinct separation between subject and object, and Chinese mediumistic space, in which a unity of landscape and environment corresponds to a unity of mind and body. Thus [[postmodernism|postmodern thought]] brings together the concepts of space as product of [[mind]], [[Human body|body]] and [[culture]]. Rather than being the negative of the objects that occupy it, space can be seen as its own volume with undeniable importance as a design tool. In contemporary design, it is considered a palpable, lived [[phenomenon]] that contributes to our [[perception]] and [[experience]] of the world in subtle but often intentional ways.

'''Technology dynamics''' is broad and relatively new scientific field that has been developed in the framework of the postwar [[science and technology studies]] field. It studies the process of [[technological change]]. Under the field of Technology Dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from "internal factors" as well as from "external factors". Internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various (changing) characteristics of the [[social environment]], in which a particular [[technology]] is embedded.

==Overview==

For the last three decades, it has been argued that [[technology development]] is neither an autonomous process, determined by the "inherent progress" of human history, nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate (develop) a technology, as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking. In mainstream neoclassical economic thinking, technology is seen as an exogenous factor: at the moment a technology is required, the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor, capital and eventually raw materials.

Conversely, modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not "self-evident" or market-demanded, but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social, economic and political factors. in this sense, technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct "internal" and "external" points of views by presenting co-evolutionary approach regarding technology development.

In general, technology dynamics studies, besides giving a "thick description" of technology development, uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context. Accordingly, Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining [[social control]] of technology, and also provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies. In that respect, it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies, besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations.

An important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi-evolutionary character of technological change: change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge, systems and [[institutions]] develop in interaction with each other. Processes of 'path dependence' are crucial in explaining technological change.

Following these lines, there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics.

==Different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology==
*[[Social construction of technology]]
*[[Actor–network theory]]
*[[Systems theory]]
*[[Normalization process theory]]
*Quasi-evolutionary theories
*[[Innovation system]]
*[[Technological innovation system]]

Based on the analysis of the various perspectives, one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology. Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change:

*[[Technology assessment]]
*[[Backcasting]]
*Strategic niche management 
*[[Transition management (governance)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Timbral listening''' is the process of actively listening to the [[timbre|timbral]] characteristics of sound.

==Concept==
In timbral listening, 'pitch is subordinate to timbre'.  Instead, the specific quality of a musical tone is determined by considering 'the presence, distribution and relative [[amplitude]] of [[overtones]].'&lt;ref&gt;Süzükei, V., ''Listening The Tuvan Way'' in Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using this listening technique/ method of perception / interpretation there is 'a relation between timbre and [[Harmonic series (music)|spectral]] content which is analogous to that between pitch and [[frequency]] in that one is the prevalent cultural construct of the other'&lt;ref&gt;Waters, S., "Timbre Composition: Ideology, Metaphor and Social Process", Contemporary Music Review, 10:2 (1994), p133-134&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of timbral listening is listening to [[speech]]. This is demonstrated by listening to, for example, the vowels /a/ and /i/ spoken at the same [[pitch accent|pitch]] and intensity. The difference between the two sounds is entirely one of spectrum, or as the term is used in this article, [[timbre]].

==Nature==

It has been suggested that "timbral listening is an ideal sonic mirror of the natural world".&lt;ref&gt;Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p58&lt;/ref&gt; It is often (but not always) used in association with musics that are based in [[mimicry]] of sounds in the natural environment. [[Valentina Suzukei]] suggests that 'it was the [[nomadic]] way of life and its focus on the timbral qualities of natural sounds that created this kind of musicality'.&lt;ref&gt;Süzükei, V., ''Listening The Tuvan Way'' in Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p51.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially prevalent in Canada where composers such as [[Hildegard Westerkamp]] apply the thinking of [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s World [[Soundscape]] Project to their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, L., 'The Something to Hold on to Factor in Timbral Composition', "Contemporary Music Review" 10:2 (1994): 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive language and notation==

As timbre has 'no domain-specific adjectives' it 'must be described in metaphor or by analogy to other senses',&lt;ref&gt;Fales, C., "The Paradox of Timbre", Ethnomusicology, 46:1 (Winter, 2002), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; This method also has limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, S., "Timbre Composition: Ideology, Metaphor and Social Process", Contemporary Music Review, 10:2 (1994), p131, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

*Traditional music in [[Tuva]] and other Turkic cultures of inner Asia
The composition of timbre-centered music in the nomadic communities of Tuva involves mimicry of sounds heard in the environment. Timbral listening is a fundamental component of listening to, understanding and being able to correctly perform this music using vocal techniques such as [[Overtone singing|throat singing]] "khoomei" and harmonic producing instruments such as the [[jaw harp]], bzaanchy, shoor, qyl qiyak, qyl-gobyz, ku-rai and [[igil]].

*[[Burundi|Barundi]] whispered [[Inanga (instrument)|Inanga]] or ''Inanga Chucotée'' in Africa
This music employs a fundamental [[Drone (music)|drone]] and overtone harmonics. It consists of "a whispered text, accompanied by the ''inanga'', a trough [[zither]] of eight strings. To listen correctly (using timbral listening), one must consider "the effect of the combined timbres of the noisy whisper and the inanga" as a whole sound.&lt;ref&gt;Fales, C., "The Paradox of Timbre", Ethnomusicology, 46:1 (Winter, 2002), 56&lt;/ref&gt;

*Some forms of contemporary electronic music
More recently, computers and [[synthesizers]] are being used by contemporary composers to produce timbral-centered music. Contemporary composers state timbral listening as the correct technique to adopt in listening to and analysing their timbre (as opposed to pitch) based compositions. 'Pure timbres' are explored using methods such as [[granular synthesis]] in works such as ''Dragon of the Nebula'' by [[Mara Helmuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth, M., "Timbral Composition and Gesture" Columbia University Music Department, available at {{cite web |url=http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~mara/papers/TimbralCompGest.Greece92.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20020121195155/http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~mara/papers/TimbralCompGest.Greece92.html |archivedate=2002-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Shakuhachi]] music in Japan
The music produced by the Shakuhachi end blown flute such as [[honkyoku]], contains timbral variations that are of equal importance to pitch variations. These timbral variations are indicated in [[Shakuhachi musical notation]].&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Donald Paul (Autumn, 1969). "The Shakuhachi and the Kinko Ryu Notation". Asian Music 1 (2): 32–72. Springer. {{doi|10.2307/833910}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

The technique of timbral listening is used by sound engineers to evaluate timbre difference.&lt;ref&gt;Quesnel, R., "Timbral Ear Trainer: Adaptive, Interactive Training of Listening Skills for Evaluation of Timbre Differences", paper presented at the 100th Audio Engineering Society Convention, Copenhagen, May 11th–14th, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

A top is usually a person who [[Sexual penetration|penetrates]], a bottom is usually one who receives penetration, and a versatile engages in both activities or is open to engaging in either activity. These terms may be elements of [[self-identity]] that indicate an individual's usual preference, but might also describe broader sexual identities.&lt;ref name="Underwood"&gt;{{cite book | author =Steven Gregory Underwood|title =Gay men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles|isbn = 1-56023-375-3|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|pages=225 pages|accessdate=2011-12-02|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i4wRl0_8NuUC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' are also used in [[BDSM]] to describe unrelated identities and practices.

==Top==
A top is usually a person who engages in the penetrative role during sexual activity; for [[Men who have sex with men|men who have sex with men (MSMs)]], this often involves penetration using the [[Human penis|penis]] during [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[Oral sex|oral]] sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Top'' is also used as a verb meaning "to penetrate another". ''Top'' may also describe a broader [[self-identity|personal identity]] involving [[Dominance and submission|dominance]] in a [[romantic relationship|romantic]] or [[sexual relationship]]; however, this stipulation is not a requisite element of being a top.

Several related terms exist. With regard to gay male sexuality, a ''{{visible anchor|total top}}'' is one who assumes an exclusively penetrative role for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gremore|first1=Graham|title=What Do You Do When Your Total Top Boyfriend Refuses To Bottom?|url=http://www.queerty.com/what-do-you-do-when-your-total-top-boyfriend-refuses-to-bottom-20150504|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=Queerty|date=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''{{visible anchor|power top}}'' is one noted for their great skill or aggressiveness in topping.

Trevor Hart of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that self-identified tops were more likely to act as the penetrative partner in other sexual activities (besides anal intercourse), including oral sex and [[sex toy]] play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bering |first=Jesse |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles |title=Top Scientists Get to the Bottom of Gay Male Sex Role Preferences |publisher=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=2011-01-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319014720/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=gay-male-sex-roles|archivedate=2011-03-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bottom==

A bottom is usually the receptive partner during sexual penetration. This frequently refers to MSMs who are penetrated through the [[Human anus|anus]] during anal sex.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; ''Bottom'' is also used as a verb meaning "to be penetrated by another, whether anally or orally". ''Bottom'' may also describe a wider social context of [[Dominance and submission|submission]] within a romantic or sexual relationship, though this element does not apply to all people who prefer to bottom.

In gay male sexuality, a ''total bottom'' is someone who assumes an exclusively passive or receptive role during anal or oral intercourse. A ''{{visible anchor|power bottom}}'' is someone who aggressively enjoys being the receptive partner.  A ''{{visible anchor|versatile bottom}}'' is one who prefers to bottom but who tops occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/lovesex/g/versatilebottom.htm Versatile Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The term {{visible anchor|receiver}} or {{visible anchor|receptive partner}} may be preferred by some. An ''oral bottom'' (alternatively described as being the "oral active" partner) is the exclusively receptive partner in oral sex, providing the penetrative partner, or ''oral top'' (alternatively described as being the "oral passive" partner), with unreciprocated [[fellatio]] and [[irrumatio]].

==Versatile==

''Versatile'' refers to a person who enjoys both topping and bottoming, or being dominant and submissive, and may alternate between the two in sexual situations.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 17879166|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Role+versatility+among+men+who+have+sex+with+men+in+urban+Peru.-a0168586762 |title=Role versatility among men who have sex with men in urban Peru|year= 2007|last1= Goodreau|first1= SM|last2= Peinado|first2= J|last3= Goicochea|first3= P|last4= Vergara|first4= J|last5= Ojeda|first5= N|last6= Casapia|first6= M|last7= Ortiz|first7= A|last8= Zamalloa|first8= V|last9= Galvan|first9= R|last10=Sanchez |first10=Jorge R. |volume= 44|issue= 3|pages= 233–9|doi= 10.1080/00224490701443676|journal= Journal of Sex Research|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maennerarzt-linz.at/index.php?id=84 "Männer, die sowohl passiven als auch aktiven Analsex praktizieren, nennt man ''versatile''."] Georg Pfau, Präventionsmedizin für den Mann, Linz 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Flip-flop'' or ''flip fuck'' commonly describes switching from top to bottom during one sexual encounter between two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18288599|author=Michael D.

Versatility is a concept of [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name="martinplevine1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=Martin P. |authorlink= |author2=Kimmel, Michael S.  |title=Gay Macho: The Life and Death of the homosexual Clone |year=1998 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Versatility'', though, is not limited to the simple acts of anal, oral, or vaginal penetration, but also includes the splitting of duties and responsibilities in the relationship.&lt;ref name="jayyoung1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jay |first=Karla |authorlink= |author2=Young, Allen  |title=The gay report: Lesbians and gay men speak out about sexual experiences and lifestyles |year=1979 |publisher=Summit |location=New York |isbn=0-671-40013-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The reciprocal scenario, where both men take turns fucking each other, is often exercised as a celebration of equality. What sets this scenario apart from the others is the versatility of the men involved. Versatility is a unique and important feature of male anal sex. Some men consider it liberating;&amp;nbsp;... Versatility to them is akin to speaking two different languages. It requires a special kind of playfulness, creativity, curiosity, and coordination. |Steven G. Underwood|''Gay Men and anal eroticism: tops, bottoms, and versatiles'', Harrington Park Press 2003}}

According to some, living a ''versatile lifestyle'' implies a certain openness to new things and an opposition to [[labels]], [[stereotype]]s and [[generalization]]s. Therefore, this concept differs from heterosexual relationships where sexual compatibility does not begin with guessing who will end up as top or bottom.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt;
In self descriptions of men seeking sex with other men, they may refer to themselves as a versatile top or versatile bottom in addition to other commonly used terms.

A 2009 Austrian study on [[gay pornography]] has shown that at least 82.4% of all men performing in the male [[porn industry]] are versatile at some point during their career. In this study, the performances of 5,556 actors were considered. 10.8% performed only in the top role, 6.8% only as bottoms. The study also found that the actor with the [[human penis size|larger penis]] was more likely to act as the top.&lt;ref&gt;Michelides, Christian: ''Männlichkeitskonstruktionen der Pornografie zur Jahrtausendwende,'' Wien 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Versatility is a common theme of [[erotic artist]] [[Tom of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Arell| first = Berndt  | last2 = Mustola  | first2 = Kati | title = Tom of Finland: Ennennäkemätöntä – Unforeseen  | publisher = Like| year = 2006 | isbn = 952-471-843-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[trans men]] who still have a [[vagina]], topping and bottoming can also involve penile penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hivplusmag.com/sex-dating/2015/11/23/gay-sex-ed-staying-safe-while-topping-or-bottoming |title=Gay Sex Ed: Staying Safe While Topping or Bottoming |publisher=[[LPI Media|HIV Plus Magazine]] |accessdate=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role vs. position among sexualities==

''Top'', ''bottom'' and ''versatile'', with regard to sexual activity between males, refer specifically to the penetrative role, regardless of the physical positioning during sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaylife.about.com/od/anal/a/amitoporbottom.htm Topping or Bottoming – How To Know If You're A Top Or Bottom]. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in positions where the inserting partner lies on his back and the receptive partner straddles the inserting partner, the inserting partner is still considered to assume the "top" role, even though he is positioned on the bottom (and vice versa). When used in reference to heterosexual and [[Lesbian sexual practices|lesbian sex]], the terms ''top,'' ''bottom'' and ''versatile'' usually refer only to position and not to the penetrative role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Prevalence==

No scientific study has ever been conducted as to what percentage of the gay and bisexual male population prefers any given role. The popular assumption is that the majority prefer to bottom and that those who prefer to top are in the minority. A tally of 55,464 profiles on [[gay.com]] from the [[United States]] showed that 26.46% preferred top, while 31.92% preferred bottom, and the largest group (41.62%) preferred versatile. The preferences seemed to vary by state, however. In Wyoming, for example, 16% preferred top, 44% preferred bottom, and 40% preferred versatile. In West Virginia, tops outnumbered bottoms by a slim margin (32% top, 29% bottom, and 39% versatile). In Oregon, "versatile" profiles made up nearly half (48.42%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightacting.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?p=222697#p222697 Best states for tops, bottoms, versatiles]. Straightacting.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==BDSM==

In [[BDSM]], the terms ''top'', ''bottom'' and ''switch'' are related, but are a BDSM-distinct phenomenon. BDSM seems to have adopted and [[derivation (linguistics)|derived]] these terms as [[loan words]] from [[gay culture]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Other==

In the [[hanky code]], a person flagging the top or active  role would wear the hanky in the left pocket, the bottom or passive role on the right. Acts which were not divisible into distinct roles however, such as "69" or "anything" followed a pattern where one flagged interest by wearing the hanky on the right, uninterest by wearing it on the left, and preferences that did not relate to sexual mechanics, such as uniform fetishism or prostitution, followed a pattern where the seeker flagged on the left and the object of desire flagged on the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://user.xmission.com/~trevin/hanky.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''side'' has been proposed by Huffington Post contributor [[Joe Kort]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-kort-phd/guys-on-the-side-looking-beyond-gay-tops-and-bottoms_b_3082484.html Guys on the 'Side': Looking Beyond Gay Tops and Bottoms] Huffingtonpost.com Retrieved 2014-10-02&lt;/ref&gt; for gay men who are not interested in anal sex.

The '''Triad''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triadcentral.org Triad Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to decision-making for [[Hazardous waste|hazardous-waste]] [[waste dump|site]] cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;pp.91-111, Crumbling, Griffith, Powell&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, technology advocates from the environmental sector in the United States developed the approach by combining innovations in management and technology with ideas from hazardous-waste site cleanup experience.

Their goal was to form a framework for real-time [[environmental sensor]]s and tools, to improve decision-making at contaminated sites. This resulted in a more formalized set of ideas in [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag-a/0000/35/i19/html/19crumbling.html 2001] that soon became known as the Triad approach. The ideas spawned a [[Community of practice|Community of Practice]] by 2005.

The Triad Community of Practice&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/user/cop/&lt;/ref&gt; includes representatives of federal, state, and private sector organizations in the U.S. and abroad. By 2008, a European CoP had been formed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cysense.com/index.asp?pageID=133 European CoP Info]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a technical conference led largely by the CoP and covering the Triad Approach was held at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, "Triad Investigations: New Approaches and Innovative Strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/tei/conferences/platforms.html 2008 Triad Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314225529/http://www.umass.edu/tei/conferences/platforms.html |date=2011-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The term Triad represents three elements: systematic project planning (SPP), dynamic work strategies, and innovative rapid sampling and analytical technologies. While elements of the Triad have long been used for site cleanup, Triad packages these [[best practices|best management practices]] together with the guiding principles:

# Use a planning process, which includes participation of all stakeholders (including a multidisciplinary project team, federal and state regulators, legal counsel, community members, and other environmental professionals), to determine the types of data required and to evaluate whether the site could benefit from real-time measurement technologies.
# Discussion of uncertainty management, data representativeness, and site closure strategies.
# Use of a site model that recognizes site characterization is an element used at all stages of remediation.   
# Use of sampling, measurement, and data management technologies to support [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag-a/0000/35/i19/html/19crumbling.html uncertainty management strategies].  
# Project teams that have communication, trust, discussion of individual interests and goals, and expertise in the appropriate fields.

Triad is an open-marketplace idea that is not owned by one entity. There is considerable U.S. Multiagency support for Triad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/multiagency/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2006, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation expressed support of Triad by requesting the cooperation of its regional managers to expand the use of Triad at Superfund sites, where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/ref/ref/documents/Triad_Policy_Memo.pdf EPA Memo OSWER-9200.1-55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of the Triad==
Although the following elements are the legs that gave the impetus for calling the process "Triad," the goal of the Triad approach is to infuse the concepts into hazardous-waste site cleanups, no matter what the lead organization calls the process. (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Technical Project Planning Process (TPP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em200-1-2/entire.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715135918/http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em200-1-2/entire.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for systematic planning, for example.)

===Systematic Project Planning===
Project planning identifies the problems and encourages stakeholders to negotiate the steps necessary to mediate the risks the environmental contamination pose to human health and ecology. The specific goals of a project (redevelopment, revitalization, etc.) may differ, but the specific objectives during the SPP process are:

*Frame the problem: identify project objectives, constraints, stakeholders, the regulatory framework, and primary/secondary decisions.
*Develop a site model: construct and maintain a site model that captures information pertinent to the primary/secondary decisions that must be made. The term CSM is updated by identifying data gaps, and developing a dynamic work strategy to fill in the data gaps.
*Evaluate and manage uncertainty: evaluate and manage the uncertainty associated with decision-making in the context of the CSM so that decisions can be made with acceptable levels of confidence.

===Dynamic work strategies===
Dynamic work strategies are strategies that can be adapted to site conditions as new information becomes available while work is underway. This adaptation may be in response to data collection activities designed to address CSM unknowns, or it may be in response to completely unexpected site conditions encountered during the course of work.

Dynamic work strategies as part of a Triad approach can be included in almost every activity associated with hazardous waste site characterization and remediation. This includes overall project strategies, dynamic sampling and analysis programs (DSP,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Robbat, Jr., 1997, A Guideline for Dynamic Workplans and Field Analytics: The Keys to Cost-Effective Site Characterization and Cleanup [http://ase.tufts.edu/chemistry/robbat/documents/DynamicWorkplans.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ASAP &lt;ref&gt;US-DOE, 2001. Adaptive Sampling and Analysis Programs (ASAPs). Report DOE/EM-0592 [https://frtr.gov/pdf/asap_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;) for characterization purposes, remedial action design, implementation, and performance monitoring, long-term monitoring for sites that require it, closure plans, and quality assurance/quality control activities.

===Innovative rapid sampling===
Sometimes referred to as 'real-time' measurement systems, these are analytical or measurement technologies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cluin.org/char1_tech.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; capable of producing data quickly enough to direct the progress of field activities (characterization or remediation) while they are underway [http://www.triadcentral.org/mgmt/meas/key/index.cfm], analogous to [[Real time business intelligence|Real-time business intelligence]]. Example analytical methods include portable or handheld X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF [http://www.cluin.org/char/technologies/xrf.cfm XRF]), portable gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technologies, and [[immunoassay]] [[test kit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cluin.org/char/technologies/immunoassay.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; New field analytical methods are fast developing. However, some have used standard laboratory approaches with quick turn-around results. The analysis enables in-field decision-making ''and'' ensures logical internal consistency among Triad concepts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/tio/download/char/epa542f07001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual site models==
At the core of each project is the conceptual site model (CSM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/ref/ref/documents/CSM_checklist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The term CSM is sometimes used to only describe pieces of the whole model. Geological, hydrogeological, contaminant fate and transport all may have computer models referred to as 'conceptual,' and a risk assessment may contain a CSM, but in a Triad sense, a CSM is the holistic model that can effectively portray site concerns significant to the decisions that must be made.

'''Truth to materials''' is a tenet of [[modern architecture]] (as opposed to [[postmodern architecture]]), which holds that any material should be used where it is most appropriate and its nature should not be hidden. Concrete, therefore, should not be painted and the means of its construction should be celebrated &amp;ndash; by, for instance, not sanding away marks left by timber shuttering (''[[béton brut]]'').  As another example, [[porcelain]] is infrequently used in the exterior facing of buildings, but one modern example is the [[Dakin Building]], [[Brisbane, California]]; therefore, the porcelain panels of this building have been left uncovered by any paint or preservative.
