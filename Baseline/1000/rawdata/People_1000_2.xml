'''Amati''' is the last name of a family of [[Italy|Italian]] [[violin]] makers who lived at [[Cremona]] from about 1538 to 1740. Their importance is considered equal to those of the [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], [[Guarneri]], and [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]] families. Today, violins created by Nicolò Amati are valued at around $600,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.violinadvisor.com/pricehistory.htm Violin Price Histories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210444/http://www.violinadvisor.com/pricehistory.htm |date=2011-07-17 }}, violinadvisor.com, accessed 18 martie 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family members==

===Andrea Amati===
{{main|Andrea Amati}}
'''Andrea Amati''' ({{circa|1505}}{{snd}}{{circa|1578}}) designed and created the violin, viola and cello known as the "violin family". He standardized the basic form, shape, size, materials and method of construction. Makers from nearby [[Brescia]] experimented, such as Gasparo da Salò, Micheli, Zanetto and Pellegrino, but it was Andrea Amati in Cremona, Italy, who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile.

The first violin was ordered by [[Lorenzo De Medici|Lorenzo de' Medici]] in 1555. His letter to Amati stated the instrument was to be "made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute, but simple to play". What became of this first violin is not known. A number of his instruments survived for some time, dating between 1538 (Amati made the first Cello called "The King" in 1538 [1]{{Clarify|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--Does this bracketed number mean the first instrument Amati produced in that year, January [or possibly March, considering that Italian years at the time were often reckoned as starting in that month], or is it an artifact from a cut-and-paste job from a possibly copyrighted webpage?--&gt;) and 1574. The largest number these are from 1560, a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by [[Catherine De Medici|Catherine de Médicis]] the regent queen of France and bore hand painted royal French decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son [[Charles IX of France]]. Of these 38 instruments ordered, Amati created violins of two sizes, violas of two sizes and large-sized cellos. They were in use until the French revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived. His work is marked by selection of the finest materials, great elegance in execution, soft clear amber, soft translucent varnish, and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design.

Ed. Robin Stowell. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992. 1–29. {{doi|10.1017/CCOL9780521390330.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antonio and Girolamo Amati ===
Andrea Amati was succeeded by his sons [[Antonio Amati]] ({{circa|1537}}–1607) and [[Girolamo Amati]] ({{circa|1551}}–1630). "The Brothers Amati", as they were known, implemented far-reaching innovations in design, including the perfection of the shape of the [[f-holes]]. They are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of [[viola]], in contrast to older tenor violas, but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that [[Gasparo da Salo]] made violas ranging from altos of 39&amp;nbsp;cm to tenors of 44.7&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Nicolo Amati===
{{main|Nicolò Amati}}
'''Nicolò Amati''' (December 3, 1596{{snd}}April 12, 1684) was the son of Girolamo Amati. He was the most eminent of the family. He improved the model adopted by the rest of the Amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of [[timbre|tone]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amati|volume=1|page=783}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pattern was unusually small, but he also made a wider model now known as the "Grand Amati", which have become his most sought-after violins.

Of his pupils, the most famous were [[Antonio Stradivari]] and [[Andrea Guarneri]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; the first of the Guarneri family of violin makers. (There is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of Antonio Stradivari. While the label on Stradivari's first known violin states that he was a pupil of Amati, the validity of his statement is questioned.)

=== Girolamo Amati (Hieronymus II) ===
The last maker of the family was Nicolò's son, [[Girolamo Amati]], known as '''Hieronymus II''' (February 26, 1649{{snd}}February 21, 1740). Although he improved on the arching of his father's instruments, by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day, Antonio Stradivari.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=July 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7001">[[Image:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds 2.png|thumb|200px|upright|Samuel Johnson's ''Lives of the Poets'' (1779–81) was possibly the first thorough-going exercise in biographical criticism.&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/criticism&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Biographical criticism''' is a form of [[literary criticism]] which analyzes a writer's biography to show the relationship between the author's life and their works of literature.&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Criticism", ''Writing essays about literature: a guide and style sheet'' (2004), Kelley Griffith, University of North Carolina at Greensborough, Wadsworth Publishing Company , pages 177-178, 400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25111810 Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism]" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; Biographical criticism is often associated with [[historical-biographical criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/college_literature/v030/30.1knoper.html&lt;/ref&gt; a critical method that "sees a literary work chiefly, if not exclusively, as a reflection of its author's life and times".&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred L. Guerin, A handbook of critical approaches to literature, Edition 5, 2005, page 51, 57-61; Oxford University Press, University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;

This longstanding critical method dates back at least to the [[Renaissance]] period,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Duane Reed (1922) "Biographical Criticism of Vergil since the Renaissance" ''Studies in Philology'' 19(1): pp. 1-30, page 1 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and was employed extensively by Samuel Johnson in his ''[[Lives of the Poets]]'' (1779–81).&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/criticism "Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets (1779–81) was the first thorough-going exercise in biographical criticism, the attempt to relate a writer's background and life to his works."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any critical methodology, biographical criticism can be used with discretion and insight or employed as a superficial shortcut to understanding the literary work on its own terms through such strategies as [[Formalism (literature)|Formalism]].  Hence 19th century biographical criticism came under disapproval by the so-called [[New Critics]] of the 1920s, who coined the term "[[biographical fallacy]]"&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Francis Noel (1967) "The Keys Are at the Palace: A Note on Criticism and Biography" pp. 135-149 ''In'' Damon, Philip (editor)  (1967) ''Literary Criticism and Historical Understanding: Selected Papers from the English Institute'' Columbia University Press, New York, {{OCLC|390148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussed extensively in Frye, Herman Northrop (1947) ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey,  page 326 and following, {{OCLC|560970612}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe criticism that neglected the imaginative genesis of literature.

Notwithstanding this critique, biographical criticism remained a significant mode of literary inquiry throughout the 20th century, particularly in studies of [[Charles Dickens]] and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], among others. The method continues to be employed in the study of such authors as [[John Steinbeck]],&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Whitman]]&lt;ref&gt;Knoper, Randall (2003)[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_200301/ai_n9212440/ "Walt Whitman and New Biographical Criticism"] ''College Literature'' 30(1): pp. 161-168&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer, James (ed), ''Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays'' (1999),pp. 19-27, 40-43, 45, 47, 395&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peripatetic biographical criticism ==
In ''The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism'', in a chapter titled "Peripatetic Biographical Criticism", George Alexander Kennedy notes that in the [[Hellenistic]] age, "The works of authors were read as sources of information about their lives, personalities and interests. Some of this material was then used by other commentators and critics to explain passages in their works. The process became a circular one in that, though Peripatetic biographers utilized external evidence where available, they had little to go on and quarried the texts for hints".&lt;ref&gt;George Alexander Kennedy, The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism, page 205, Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of otherness ==
Jackson J. Benson describes the form as a "'recognition of 'otherness'—that there is an author who is different in personality and background from the reader—appears to be a simple-minded proposition. Yet as a basic prerequisite to the understanding and evaluation of a literary text it is often ignored even by the most sophisticated literary critics. The exploration of otherness is what literary biography and biographical criticism can do best, discovering an author as a unique individual, a discovery that puts a burden on us to reach out to recognize that uniqueness before we can fully comprehend an author's writings.'"&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to other modes of criticism==
Biographical criticism shares in common with [[New Historicism]] an interest in the fact that all literary works are situated in specific historical and biographical contexts from which they are generated. Biographical Criticism, like New Historicism, rejects the concept that literary studies should be limited to the internal or formal characteristics of a literary work, and insists that it properly includes a knowledge of the contexts in which the work was created. Biographical criticism stands in ambiguous relationship to [[Romanticism]]. It has often been argued that it is a development from Romanticism, but it also stands in opposition to the Romantic tendency to view literature as manifesting a "universal" transcendence of the particular conditions of its genesis.

== Assessments of biographical criticism and literary biography ==
In ''The Art of Literary Biography'' (1995), John Worthen writes:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;'The fact that we ''want'' an emergent sense of the inevitable development suggests the enormously soothing quality which biographies have come to have in our age. Not only do biographies suggest that things as difficult as human lives can – for all their obvious complexity – be summed up, known, comprehended: they reassure us that, while we are reading, a world will be created in which there are few or no unclear motives, muddled decisions, or (indeed) loose ends.'&lt;ref&gt;John Worthen, 'The Necessary Ignorance of a Biographer,' in John Batchelor (ed.) ''The Art of Literary Biography'', Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995 pp.227-244, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Biographical evaluation''' ({{lang-ar|عِلْمُ الرِّجال|`Ilm al-Rijāl}}), literally meaning'' 'Knowledge of Men' ''but more commonly understood as the ''Science of Narration'', refers to a discipline of [[Islam|Islamic]] religious studies within [[hadith terminology]] in which the narrators of [[hadith]] are evaluated. Its goal is to distinguish [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|authentic]] and [[Hadith terminology#Hasan|reliable]] [[hadith|hadiths]] from [[Hadith terminology#Da'if|unreliable]] [[hadith|hadiths]] in establishing the credibility of the narrators, using both historic and religious knowledge.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 101"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 101, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; ''`Ilm ar-rijal'' is synonymous with what is commonly referred to as ''al-jarḥ wa al-taʻdīl'' (discrediting and accrediting) – the criticism and declared acceptance of hadith narrators.{{#tag:ref|Al-[[al-Suyuti|Suyūṭī]] mentioned in the chapter of ''Tadrib al-Rawi'' entitled 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable': "''al-Jarḥ wa al-Taʻdīl'' is permissible..."&lt;ref name= "tadrib" /&gt;|group=footnote}}&lt;ref name= "tadrib"&gt;''Tadrib al-Rawi'', vol. 2, p. 495, ''Dar al-'Asimah'', first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=[[Ali ibn al-Madini]], an early authority on the subject, said, "Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge."&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam" /&gt;}}

In his ''[[Introduction to the Science of Hadith]]'', [[Ibn al-Salah]], a renowned [[hadith]] specialist, explained the importance of the study of hadith narrators. Introducing the chapter entitled, 'Recognizing the trustworthy, reliable narrators and those who are weak and unreliable,' [[Ibn al-Salah]] said, "This is from the most distinguished and noble types (of hadith study) as it results in recognizing the authenticity of a hadith or its weakness."&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, published with ''Muhasin al-Istilah'' by al-Bulqini, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 654, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; He then explained that any criticism directed at a narrator was permissible due to the "maintenance of the [[Sharia]]h, purging it of any mistakes or misinformation".&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"/&gt;

Stressing the importance of biographical evaluation, [[Ali ibn al-Madini]], an early authority on the subject, said, "Knowing the narrators is half of knowledge."{{#tag:ref|The other half of knowledge, according to Ibn al-Madini, is "having understanding of the meanings of hadith".&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam" /&gt;|group=footnote}}&lt;ref name="Siyar al-`Alam"&gt;''Siyar 'Alam al-Nubala’'', by [[al-Dhahabi]], vol. 11, p. 48, ''Mu'assasah al-Risalah'', Beirut, 11th edition, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=The following [[Qur'an]]ic verse established a general principal in '''biographical evaluation''':&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt; "O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done."&lt;ref name="Quran"/&gt;}}

===Beginning of narrator evaluation===
The [[Qur'an]]ic verses are numerous that praise the Companions and criticize the hypocrites, both as a group and specific individuals from amongst them–as well as criticism of specific individuals other than the hypocrites. The most well-known of these is a verse of the Quran stating, "O you who believe, if a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that so as not to fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done."&lt;ref name="Quran"&gt;The [[Qur'an|Quran]], ''Surah al-Hujarat'', 6th verse.&lt;/ref&gt; While this verse was revealed regarding a particular individual, it is a general principle. Following this example, were the Prophet and then His [[Sahaba|Companions]].&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"&gt;''ʻIlm al-rijāl wa Ihimmiyyatuh'', by al-Mu'allimee, pp. 18–20, Dar al-Rayah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time of the Companions===
While many [[Sahaba|Companions]] narrated [[hadith]], according to [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] there were six who were the most prolific narrators of them, who lived long lives enabling them narrate to a large extent. They were: [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Umar|Abdullah ibn Umar]], [[Aisha]], [[Jabir ibn Abd-Allah|Jabir ibn Abdullah]], [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] and [[Anas ibn Malik]] with [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] being the most prolific of them.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 492"&gt;''Muqadimah Ibn al-Salah'', by Ibn al-Salah, edited by 'Aishah bint 'Abd al-Rahman, p. 492, ''Dar al-Ma'arif'', Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn al-Salah]] the most prolific narrators from the [[Sahaba|Companions]] was [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] followed by [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]].&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 492"/&gt;

In spite of the Companions' efforts in narrating their [[hadith]], there was no need for them to evaluate each other's narrating capabilities or trustworthiness. This is because, as [[Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]] said, that Allah and his Prophet declared the [[Sahaba|Companions]] to be upright and trustworthy, and, therefore, there is no need to investigate their reliability, however, one must investigate the condition of those after them.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Kifayah'', by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, p. 46, ''Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyyah'', Beirut, Lebanon, 1988; this edition is apparently based upon the original Indian printing.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many established narrations originating from the Companions praising some of the [[Tabi'un|Followers]] with some criticism of specific individuals from them.&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

===After the Companions===
As for the [[Tabi'un|Followers]], the generation following the [[Sahaba|Companions]], their praise of narrators was plentiful, while disparagement from them was seldom. Those narrators who were criticized from the Followers were not criticized for [[Hadith terminology#Mawdo|fabricating hadith]], but, instead, due to heresy, such as the [[Kharijites]], or due to weak memory or due to their condition as narrators being unknown.&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

Evaluating the narrators of [[hadith]] began in the generation following that of the Companions based upon the statement of Muhammad [[Ibn Sirin]], "They did not previously inquire about the [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|''isnad]]''. However, after the turmoil occurred they would say, 'Name for us your narrators.' So the people of the [[Sunnah]] would have their hadith accepted and the people of [[Bid‘ah|innovation]] would not."&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Muslim in the introduction to his [[Sahih Muslim|''Sahih]]'', vol. 1, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''turmoil'' referred to is the conflicting ideologies of the Kharijites and extreme [[Shia Islam|Shias]] that had emerged at the time of the third ''khalifas'' [[Uthman ibn Affan]]'s assassination and the social unrest of the Kharijites in opposition to the succeeding rulers, [[Ali]] and [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]].&lt;ref&gt;This is the explanation provided by al-Qurtubi in ''al-Mufhim'', vol. 1, pgs. 122-3 as quoted in ''Qurrah Ayn Al-Muhtaj'', vol. 2, pg 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Uthman was in the year 35 after the migration.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Bidayah wa Al-Nihayah'', by [[Ibn Kathir]], vol. 10, p. 323, ''Dar Alam al-Kutub''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following generation, [[Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in|that after the Followers]], and afterward, the weak, unacceptable narrators increased in number, necessitating that a group of scholars clarify the condition of the narrators and distinguishing any narrations that were not [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|authentic]].&lt;ref name="Ilm R 18-20"/&gt;

====Early specialists====
According to [[Ibn al-Salah]], quoting an early religious authority, the first to specialize in the study of [[hadith]] narrators was [[Shuʿba Ibn al-Ḥajjāj]], followed by Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Qattan and then [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] and [[Yahya ibn Ma'in]].&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 101"/&gt; Al-Bulqini added some names to the aforementioned: [[Ali ibn al-Madini]] and 'Amr ibn 'Ali al-Fallas, and then mentioned [[Malik ibn Anas]] and [[Hisham ibn Urwah]] as having preceded them in evaluating narrators.&lt;ref name="Muqaddimah 654-5"/&gt;

== Overview ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision.}}

===Narrator criteria===
A [[hadith]] is subject to criticism on the basis of two matters. The first relates to the continuity of the hadith's [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|chain of narration]]; if there is [[Hadith terminology#Categories of discontinuity|discontinuity]] between two or more narrators, that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the [[hadith terminology]] article. The second relates to criticism of a narrator, or more, in the [[Science of hadith#The sanad and the matn|chain of narration]] of a particular hadith.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', by Ibn Ḥajr, published as ''an-Nukat'', p. 108, ''Dar Ibn al-Jawzi'', Dammam, Saudi Arabia, sixth edition, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadith]] narrators are evaluated in light of two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith. These qualities are derived from the definition of a hadith that is [[Hadith terminology#Sahih|''sahih]]'' constituting two of its five conditions. The first, uprightness (''al-ʻadālah''), is defined as the ability an individual possesses to adhere to moralistic decorum (''al-taqwā'') and maintaining proper social graces (''al-murūʼah''). The second, precision (''al-ḍabṭ''), is of two types, the first is pertaining to memorization and the second to writing. Precision in memorization (''ḍabṭ al-ṣadr'') refers to the ability to retain the specified information, recalling and conveying it at will. Precision in writing (''ḍabṭ al-kitāb'') is the preservation of the written information from the time it was heard until its transmission.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grounds for criticism===
The grounds upon which a narrator is subject to criticism are numerous some relating to moral uprightness and others to precision. [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] identified and enumerated ten qualities in which a narrator could be criticized. Five relate to trustworthiness and the other five to precision; however, he presented these ten qualities in order according to severity:
# A narrator intentionally lying, claiming a statement to be a Prophetic [[hadith]] when it is not. The inclusion of a narrator of a hadith as such renders that hadith [[Hadith terminology#Maw.E1.B8.8D.C5.AB.CA.BB|fabricated (''Mawḍūʻ'')]].
# An accusation of fabricating a hadith. This would be due a narration that clearly contradicts established religious principles originating from the direction (as it pertains to that hadith's chain of narration) of that individual. Or, that a narrator is known to lie in his ordinary speech but not while narrating hadith.
# Plenitude of mistakes in a narrator's hadith.
# Lack of attention to accuracy.
# The commission of wrongdoing by statement or action as long as it does not constitute apostasy.
# Misconception due to narrating on the basis of misunderstanding.
# Contradiction of that narrator's hadith of another established narrator.
# Unspecification of that narrator's standing in their narrating capabilities.
# [[Bid‘ah|Heresy]], being the belief in an innovated matter that contradicts the established religious practice originating with the Prophet due to a misconception, not obstinateness.
# Poor memory, differing from number three above in that the mistakes of that narrator outnumber instances in which they are correct.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', pgs. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of evaluation===
[[Hadith]] scholars of the past employed various methods by which to evaluate the narrating abilities of a narrator. From these means are the following:
# Observing that narrator's religiosity and asking others about it.
# Requesting the narrator in question to narrator from a particular living scholar and then returning to that scholar and comparing his narrations with those of the narrator under examination.
# If the narrator narrates from a deceased scholar, inquiring when he, the narrator in question, was born, when he met that scholar and where and then comparing the dates provided in his response to the recognized dates of that scholars death and travels. So, perhaps, the dates provided by the narrator may contradict the established dates, for example, claiming that he heard from a particular scholar after the recognized death of that scholar.
# Comparing the narrations of the narrator with those of narrators of established reliability, comparing them seeking any distinctions that might be unique to that narrator, in particular, while contradicting the others.
# Examination of the narrations either written or memorized by that narrator after the passage of time observing any discrepancies with their initial narrations.&lt;ref&gt;''Ilm al-rijāl wa Ihimmiyyatuh'', pp. 22–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deliberately altering the wording of a hadith or more for the purpose of examining the ability of the narrator being examined to detect those alterations. This is considered an acceptable practice as long as those alterations are brought to light following the examination process.&lt;ref&gt;''Nuzhah al-Nathar'', [ 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation terminology ==
{{quote box |align=right |width=29% |quote=A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator...}}

As a result of the evaluation of narrators, each scholar would then conclude by describing the standing of each narrator. A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator, with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators. These are divided into two categories, those terms that constitute praise (''taʻdīl'') and those that constitute criticism (''jarḥ''). [[al-Suyuti|al-Suyūṭī]] gathered the various terms and arranged them in order of strength. He quoted four levels of strength for praise from Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah, adding that [[al-Dhahabi]] and [[Abd al-Rahim ibn al-Husain al-'Iraqi]] added an additional level and [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] one above that. Thus according to al-Suyūṭī, there are six levels of praise. Similarly, al-Suyūṭī described six levels of terms used to criticize a narrator; he arranged them beginning with the least severe and concluding with the most severe criticism.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"&gt;''Tadrib al-Rawi'', by al-Suyūṭī, vol. 1, pp. 573-8, ''Dar al-'Asimah'', Riyadh, first edition, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of praise===
#[[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]] held that the highest level of praise was expressed was through the use of the superlative, for example, ''the most established of the people'' (''athbat al-nās''), or ''the most reliable of the people'' (''awthaq al-nās'').
#Al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi were of the opinion that the highest level was the repetition of adjective, or adjectives, in praising a narrator. For example, ''reliably reliable'' (''thiqah thiqah''), or ''reliable, firm'' (''thiqah thabt'').
#The highest level according to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah the highest is the use of a single adjective in describing a narrator. Examples of this are: ''reliable'' (''thiqah''), ''precise'' (''mutqin'') or ''firm'' (''thabt'').
#''Trustworthy'' (''ṣadūq'') and ''worthy of trust'' (''maḥallahu al-ṣidq'') are both examples of the next category to Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah while al-'Iraqi and al-Dhahabi consider the latter term to be from the next level.
#Next is ''respectable'' ([[Sheikh#Religious usage|''shaykh]]'') along with ''worthy of trust'' (''maḥallahu al-ṣidq'') according to some. This level would also be inclusive of an individual accused of heresy.
#The lowest of the levels of praise is, for example, ''satisfactory in hadith'' (''ṣāliḥ al-ḥadīth''), meaning according to [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Ḥajr]], this includes ''acceptable'' (''maqbūl'') meaning, when supported by other narrators.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As he explained in the introduction to ''Taqrib al-Tahthib'', pp. 14, ''Mu'assasah al-Risalah'', Beirut, first edition, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels of criticism===
#The least severe level for the criticism of a narrator is ''soft in hadith'' (''layyin al-ḥadīth'') and, according to al-'Iraqi, ''they have spoken about him'' (''takallamū fīhi''). This level would also be taken into consideration as a corroborating narrator, but at a level less than the lowest level of praise.
#Next is ''he is not strong'' (''laysa bi l-qawī''). The hadith of a narrator determined to be at this level would also be taken into consideration, as with the previous level, however, this narrator is weaker than one of the previous level.
#More severe than ''he is not strong'' is ''weak in hadith'' (''ḍaʻīf al-ḥadīth''), however, none of these first three categories are rejected outright.
#The fourth of the levels of severity of criticism includes terms such as: ''his hadith is rejected'' (''rudd al-ḥadīth'') and ''very weak'' (''ḍaʻīf jiddan'').
#The fifth includes terms such as: ''his hadith is abandoned'' (''matrūk al-ḥadīth'') and ''destroyed'' (''hālik'').
#From the most severe level of terms of criticism are: ''compulsive liar'' (''kadhdhāb''), ''he lies'' (''yakdhib'') and ''fabricator'' (''waḍḍāʻ'') among other terms.&lt;ref name="Tadrib 1/573-80"/&gt;

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Galahad]], Bors the Younger, and [[Percival]] achieve the Grail ([[Edward Burne-Jones]] C. 1895)]]

'''Bors''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|z}}; {{lang-fr|Bohort}}) is the name of two knights in the [[Arthurian legend]], one the father of the other. Bors the Elder is the King of Gaunnes or [[Gaul]] during the early period of [[King Arthur|King Arthur's]] reign, and is the brother of [[King Ban]] of Benoic. The two first appear in the 13th-century [[Lancelot-Grail]] cycle. Bors the Younger later becomes one of the best [[Round Table|Knights of the Round Table]], and even achieves the [[Holy Grail]].

==King Bors the Elder==
As Ban's brother, King Bors is [[Lancelot|Lancelot's]] and [[Hector de Maris|Hector de Maris']] uncle. He marries [[Evaine]], the sister of Ban's wife [[Elaine (legend)|Elaine]], and has two sons, Bors the Younger and [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]. Ban and Bors become Arthur's early allies in his fight against eleven rebel kings in [[Great Britain|Britain]], including [[King Lot|Lot]], [[Urien]], and [[Caradoc]], and he vows to help them against their enemy [[Claudas]], who has been threatening their lands. Arthur is late on his promise, however, and Claudas succeeds in his invasion, resulting in both kings' deaths. Ban's son Lancelot is taken by the [[Lady of the Lake]], but Bors' children are raised in captivity by Claudas' retainers.

==Sir Bors the Younger==
Sir Bors the Younger is better known than King Bors throughout Arthurian studies. Sir Bors and Lionel live for several years at Claudas' court. But they eventually rebel against him and even slay his cruel son Dorin. Before Claudas can retaliate, the boys are rescued by a servant of the Lady of the Lake and are spirited off to be raised with their cousin Lancelot. All three grow to be excellent knights and go to [[Camelot]] to join King Arthur's retinue. Bors is recognizable by a distinctive scar on his forehead, and participates in most of the King's conflicts, including the eventual battle with Claudas that liberates his father's lands. Bors fathers Sir [[Elyan the White]] when the daughter of King Brandegoris tricks him into sleeping with her by way of a magic ring; he later introduces his son into the Round Table.

[[Image:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|right|Bors chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother Lionel]]

Bors is always portrayed as one of the Round Table's finest, but his real glory comes on the [[Grail Quest]], where he proves himself worthy enough to witness the Grail's mysteries alongside [[Galahad]] and [[Percival]]. Several episodes display his virtuous character; in one, a lady approaches Bors vowing to commit suicide unless he sleeps with her. He refuses to break his vow of [[celibacy]]; the lady and her maidens threaten to throw themselves off the castle battlements. As the ladies jump off, they reveal themselves to be demons set on deceiving him by playing to his sense of compassion. In another, Bors faces a dilemma where he must choose between rescuing his brother Lionel, being whipped with thorns by villains in one direction, and saving a young girl who has been abducted by a rogue knight in the other. Bors chooses to help the maiden, but prays for his brother's safety. Lionel escapes his tormentors and tries to murder Bors, and Bors does not defend himself, refusing to raise a weapon against his kinsman. Fellow Knight of the Round Table Sir [[Calogrenant]] and a religious hermit try to intervene, but Lionel slays them both when they get in the way. Before he can kill his brother, however, God strikes him down with an immobilizing column of fire. Bors, Galahad, and Percival go on to achieve the Holy Grail and accompany it to [[Sarras]], a mystical island in the [[Middle East]]. Both Galahad and Percival pass away while there; Bors is the only one to return.

In [[Thomas Malory|Thomas Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Sir Bors agrees to fight as Guinevere's champion when she is accused of poisoning a knight. Bors is reluctant, as her first choice, Lancelot, left Camelot because of Guinevere. He relents when Arthur sees Guinevere kneeling before him.  He is about to joust for her sake when Lancelot arrives to take his place.

Like the rest of his family, Bors joins Lancelot in exile after his affair with [[Guinevere]] is exposed, and helps rescue the Queen from her execution at the stake. Bors becomes one of Lancelot's most trusted advisors in the ensuing war between Lancelot and Arthur, and becomes ruler of Claudas' former lands. When Arthur and [[Gawain]] must return to Britain to fight the evil usurper [[Mordred]], Gawain sends a letter to Lancelot asking for aid. Lancelot's men arrive to put down the remainder of the rebellion led by Mordred's sons [[Sons of Mordred|Melehan and Melou]]; Lionel is killed by Melehan, and Bors avenges his death.

==Modern portrayals==
*In [[T.H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Bors is described as a "misogynist" and an "almost-virgin", and generally something of a curmudgeon.
*In 1975's ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', Sir Bors (played by [[Terry Gilliam]]) is the first Knight of the Round Table to succumb to the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog|Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog]]. Arthur, dismissive of the Rabbit despite Tim the Enchanter's warnings, orders Bors to kill the Rabbit to demonstrate that it is of no threat. However, the Rabbit leaps through the air and onto Sir Bors, and he is quickly decapitated before he can attempt a single blow.
*In 2004's ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', British actor [[Ray Winstone]] plays a different Bors. He is one of the Sarmatian 'knights', and is brash, bold and violent in a departure from the saintly earlier figure. He is brother to [[Dagonet]]; has a native lover Vanora, and more than ten illegitimate children. [[Vanora]] is believed to be an early identity of Guenevere; the Vanora of the film is also some-time mistress to fellow Sarmatian knight Lancelot, who is strongly hinted to be the father of Bors' youngest child, and possibly others (for example Gilly, the eldest), as they have dark hair whereas neither of their parents do.
*In ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'', a Columbia serial from 1949, Sir Bors is played by [[Charles King (character actor)|Charles King]] as a comedy relief sidekick for Galahad.

"'''Brit Pack'''" is a term that has been used to refer to specific groups of young British actors who have achieved success in Hollywood, as well as more generally to the entire group of such actors. According to one article, "every decade brings a new Brit Pack, another disparate group of actors backed by the media to achieve simultaneous Hollywood stardom."&lt;ref name="talktalk.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/tim-roth/biography/122|title=Tim Roth – Biography|author=TalkTalk web studio|publisher=talktalk.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is most closely associated with the crop of British actors which emerged in the late 1980s, because of the prominence of the American [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] actors at that time.

==1980s Brit Pack==
The journalist Elissa Van Poznak interviewed [[Gary Oldman]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Paul McGann]], [[Bruce Payne]], [[Spencer Leigh (actor)|Spencer Leigh]], and [[Colin Firth]] for ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' magazine, in January 1987. The magazine had also intended to interview [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] but he was busy filming ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agwlbp.com/facejan.html|title=HugeDomains.com – Agwlbp.com is for Sale (Agwlbp)|publisher=agwlbp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the interview was "The Brit Pack". The moniker stuck and has been referenced in subsequent articles concerning the actors.&lt;ref name="talktalk.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tim-roth.com/index.php?id=facejul90|title=Tim Roth: Press|publisher=tim-roth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue of the 1988 magazine [[Film Comment]] stated that '[[Rupert Everett]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Miranda Richardson]], and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' were the leaders of the pack.&lt;ref name="americancinemapapers.com"&gt;[http://www.americancinemapapers.com/files/BRIT_PACK.htm BRIT PACK: A CLUTCH OF ACTORS], Harlan Kennedy, ''American Cinema Papers'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Brit Pack==
In July 1993, an article for ''The Face'' was titled ''The New Brit Pack'', which included [[Jaye Davidson]], [[Naveen Andrews]], [[Jude Law]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Craig Kelly (actor)|Craig Kelly]], [[Samuel West]] and [[Rufus Sewell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Face Magazine Editors|title=The Face Magazine – Jaye Davidson Cover|url=http://www.crazyaboutmagazines.com/ourshop/prod_571877-The-Face-magazine-Jaye-Davidson-cover-July-1993-Volume-2-No-58.html|accessdate=1 November 2015|work=[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]|date=10 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from other "packs"==
Unlike the Brat Pack or other similarly defined groups of American actors, "Brit Pack" actors have rarely associated with each other socially or in film. As a 1988 article put it, the Brit Pack "aren't seen together at parties or in restaurants or in gossip columns. And since British cinema has had no equivalent to Hollywood's Eighties conveyor-belt youth movies – ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', ''[[About Last Night...]]'', ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'', et al. – they don't keep re-meeting each other on-screen either".&lt;ref name="americancinemapapers.com"/&gt; Nonetheless, [[Bruce Payne]] and [[Tim Roth]] had both appeared in the ''Tales Out of School'' television series, [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Tim Roth]] both appeared in ''[[Meantime (film)|Meantime]]'' and ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'', Gary Oldman and Colin Firth appeared together in [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]] and [[Bruce Payne]] and Spencer Leigh both appeared in ''[[Smart Money (1986 film)|Smart Money]]''.

==Later uses of the term==
Currently, the phrase 'Brit Pack' is often used to describe any disparate group of young British actors and actresses of rising prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-britpack--our-new-generation-of-movie-stars-takes-tinseltown-841199.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=6 June 2008 | title=The Britpack – Our new generation of movie stars takes Tinseltown}}&lt;/ref&gt; No group has emerged which is as readily identifiable as the group from the 1980s.{{whom| date=November 2017}}

In 2014, it was used to describe a new wave of actors born in the late 1970s and early 1980s who were garnering success in Hollywood. These actors include [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Henry Cavill]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Eddie Redmayne]] and [[Rupert Friend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/best-of-british-tom-hiddleston|title=Best of British|work=ShortList Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/hot-british-men?src=spr_TWITTER&amp;spr_id=1447_64563853#slide-1|title=Hottest British Actors – 10 Best British Actors|author=Rebecca Cope|work=Harper's BAZAAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic '''[[Label (heraldry)|labels]]''' are used to [[cadency|differentiate]] the personal [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of members of the [[royal family of the United Kingdom]] from that of the monarch and from each other.  In the Gallo-British heraldic tradition, cadency marks have been available to "difference" the arms of a son from those of his father, and the arms of brothers from each other, and traditionally this was often done when it was considered important for each man to have a distinctive individual coat of arms and/or to differentiate the arms of the head of a house from junior members of the family.  This was especially important in the case of arms of sovereignty: to use the undifferenced arms of a kingdom is to assert a claim to the throne. Therefore, in the English royal family, cadency marks were used from the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], typically a label or bordure alluding to the arms of the bearer's mother or wife. After about 1340, when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] made a claim to the throne of France, a blue label did not contrast sufficiently with the blue field of the French quarter of the royal arms; accordingly most royal cadets used labels [[argent]]: that of the heir apparent was plain, and all others were charged.&lt;ref&gt;''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'' by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies (1909), p.&amp;nbsp;494.  (Online texts at https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft or http://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~bprince/hr/foxdavies/index.htm .)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bordures of various tinctures continued to be used into the 15th century.

==The label==
{{Main|Label (heraldry)}}
In the ordinary system of differences a label of three points (which has also been termed a label with three files) is the distinction of the eldest son during the lifetime of his father. In the oldest rolls of arms the labels are all of five points; but labels of three points were at an early period used interchangeably. Besides being used as mere temporary marks of cadency, labels are also employed as permanent distinctions, borne (like any other charge) by every member of some particular branches of certain families. Labels are the principal cadency marks used in certain royal families.  In the British royal family, all labels are ''[[argent]]'' (white). The sons and daughters of the sovereign all bear labels of three points argent; that of the [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|arms of the Prince of Wales]] is plain, but all others are charged. Further descendants of princes bear labels of five points charged. All such differences should be borne on the arms, crest, and supporters.

The system of a special mark for difference for each member of the family goes back to the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], whose successor, as a prince, placed such a mark on the shield of England. Since 1340 this label has almost always been white, and overlaid with small figures, or charges, such as red [[St George's cross|crosses of St George]].&lt;ref name="Neubecker"&gt;[[Ottfried Neubecker]] &amp; [[John Brooke-Little]]: ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'' (1997). {{ISBN|0-316-64141-3}}. "Signs of Differencing" (pp. 96–97).&lt;/ref&gt; This red cross represents England and its [[patron saint]], and was first borne by Richard of Bordeaux (future king [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]) before the death of his father [[Edward, the Black Prince]] in 1376. Other charges used:
* A '''blue anchor''', a symbol of hope, or of naval service, as borne by several Dukes of York.
* The '''Crown''' of England (sometimes called the Imperial or [[St Edward's Crown]]) borne by the abdicated king the [[Duke of Windsor]], which is as unusual as the occurrence itself.
* '''[[Rose (symbolism)|Roses]]''': the [[Tudor Rose]] (combined red and white) has been used as an English [[Royal Supporters of England|royal badge]] since 1485.
* Red '''[[heart (symbol)|hearts]]''' may allude to the arms of [[Lüneburg]] (part of the Hanoverian arms) or – for the descendants of Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark – to the [[coat of arms of Denmark]].
* The blue '''[[fleur-de-lis]]''' appears amongst the Royal Badges in England of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]].
* The '''[[thistle#Heraldry|thistle]]''' is an ancient badge of [[Scotland]].
* The '''escallop shell''' was traditionally a token of pilgrimage on the [[Way of St James]].  The shell in the labels of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Prince Harry]] alludes to their [[Diana, Princess of Wales|mother's Spencer]] arms.
* The '''bee''' is a canting charge in the label of [[Princess Beatrice of York]].
* The '''[[trefoil]]''' is a badge of Ireland, associated with [[St Patrick]], who used it to illustrate the [[doctrine of the Trinity]].

The '''Cambridge Spy Ring''' was a ring of [[espionage|spies]] in the [[United Kingdom]], who passed information to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]] and was active at least into the early 1950s. None were ever prosecuted for spying. The number and membership of the ring emerged slowly from the 1950s onwards. As far as the general public was concerned, this started with the sudden flight of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] ([[cryptonym]]: Homer) and [[Guy Burgess]] (cryptonym: Hicks) to the Soviet Union in 1951. Suspicion immediately fell on [[Kim Philby]] (cryptonym: Stanley), but he did not follow them until 1963. [[Anthony Blunt]] (cryptonyms: Tony, Johnson) and [[John Cairncross]] (cryptonym: Liszt) confessed to British intelligence but this remained secret for many years, until 1979 in the case of Blunt. It therefore took several years for the usual modern name to evolve through the '''Cambridge Four''' to the '''Cambridge Five'''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In the innermost circles of the KGB, they were supposedly known as the '''Magnificent Five'''.

The term "Cambridge" refers to the recruitment of the group during their education at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the 1930s. Debate surrounds the exact timing of their recruitment by [[KGB|Soviet intelligence]]; Anthony Blunt claimed that they were not recruited as agents until they had graduated. Blunt, an [[Honorary Fellow]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], was several years older than Burgess, Maclean, and Philby; he acted as a talent-spotter and recruiter for most of the group save Burgess.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-fourth-man-speaks-last-testimony-of-anthony-blunt-1757483.html The fourth man speaks: Last testimony of Anthony Blunt] ''The Independent'' McSmith, Andy. 23 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the five were convinced that the [[Marxism–Leninism]] of [[Soviet Communism]] was the best available political system, and especially the best defence against the rise of [[fascism]]. All pursued successful careers in branches of the British government. They passed large amounts of intelligence to the Soviet Union, so much so that the KGB became suspicious that at least some of it was false. Perhaps as important as the intelligence they passed was the demoralizing effect to the [[The Establishment|British Establishment]] of their slow unmasking, and the mistrust in British security this caused in the United States. 

Many others have also been accused of membership in the Cambridge ring. Blunt, Burgess and Cairncross were all members of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], an exclusive and prestigious society based at Trinity and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] Colleges. Other Apostles accused of having spied for the Soviets include [[Michael Straight]] and [[Guy Liddell]].

==Membership==

===Maclean and Burgess===
All five were active during [[World War II]]. Philby, when he was posted in the British embassy in Washington, DC, after the war, learned that US and British intelligence were searching for a British embassy [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] ([[Codename|cryptonym]] Homer) who was passing information to the [[Soviet Union]], relying on material uncovered by the [[Venona project]].

Philby learned one of the suspects was Maclean. Realizing he had to act fast, he ordered Burgess, who was also on the embassy staff and living with Philby, to warn Maclean in England, where he was serving in the [[Foreign Office]] headquarters. Burgess was recalled from the United States due to "bad behaviour" and upon reaching London, warned Maclean.

In early summer 1951, Burgess and Maclean made international headlines by disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Turner |first=Lauren |date=October 23, 2015 |title=Cambridge spies: Defection of 'drunken' agents shook US confidence |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34596824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their whereabouts were unclear for some time and the suspicion that they had [[defector|defected]] to the Soviet Union turned out to be correct but was not made public until 1956 when the two appeared at a press conference in Moscow.

It was obvious they had been tipped off and Philby quickly became the prime suspect, due to his close relations with Burgess. Though Burgess was not supposed to defect at the same time as Maclean, he went along. It has been claimed that the [[KGB]] ordered Burgess to go to Moscow. This move damaged Philby's reputation, with many speculating that had it not occurred, Philby could have climbed even higher in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]].&lt;ref name=The_Philby_Files&gt;''The Philby Files'' by [[Genrikh Borovik]], edited by [[Phillip Knightley]], published by [[Little, Brown and Company]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philby===
Investigation of Philby found several suspicious matters but nothing for which he could be prosecuted. Nevertheless, he was forced to resign from [[MI6]]. In 1955 he was named in the press, with questions also raised in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], as chief suspect for "the Third Man" and he called a [[news conference|press conference]] to deny the allegation. That same year, Philby was ruled out as a suspect when British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan cleared him of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/933590602|title=Villainy in Western culture : historical archetypes of danger, disorder and death|last=1953-|first=Kendrick, M. Gregory,|isbn=9780786498680|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|oclc=933590602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later 1950s, Philby left the secret service and began working as a [[journalist]] in the [[Middle East]]; both ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine and ''[[The Observer]]'' provided his employment there. MI6 then re-employed him at around the same time, to provide reports from that region.

In 1961, defector [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] provided information which pointed to Philby. An [[MI6]] officer and friend of Philby from his earlier MI6 days, [[John Nicholas Rede Elliott]], was sent in 1963 to interview him in [[Beirut]] and reported that Philby seemed to know he was coming (indicating the presence of yet another [[mole (espionage)|mole]]). Nonetheless, Philby allegedly confessed to Elliott.

Shortly afterwards, apparently fearing he might be abducted in [[Lebanon]], Philby defected to the Soviet Union under cover of night, aboard a Soviet freighter.

===Blunt===
In 1964, MI5 received information from the American [[Michael Whitney Straight]] pointing to Blunt's espionage; the two had known each other at Cambridge some thirty years before and Blunt had tried to recruit Straight as a spy. Straight, who initially agreed, changed his mind afterwards.

Blunt was interrogated by MI5 and confessed in exchange for immunity from prosecution. As he was—by 1964—without access to classified information, he had secretly been granted immunity by the [[Attorney General]], in exchange for revealing everything he knew. [[Peter Wright]], one of Blunt's interrogators, describes in his book ''[[Spycatcher]]'' how Blunt was evasive and only made admissions grudgingly, when confronted with the undeniable.

By 1979, Blunt was publicly accused of being a Soviet agent by [[investigative journalist]] [[Andrew Boyle]], in his book ''Climate of Treason''. In November 1979, [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] admitted to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that Blunt had confessed to being a Soviet spy fifteen years previously.

The term "Five" began to be used in 1961, when [[KGB]] defector [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] named Maclean and Burgess as part of a "Ring of Five", with Philby a 'probable' third, alongside two other agents whom he did not know.

Of all the information provided by Golitsyn, the only item that was ever independently confirmed was the Soviet affiliation of [[John Vassall]]. Vassall was a relatively low-ranking spy who some researchers{{Who|date=December 2013}} believe may have been sacrificed to protect a more senior one.

At the time of Golitsyn's defection, Philby had already been accused in the press and was living in a country with no extradition agreement with Britain. Select members of MI5 and MI6 already knew Philby to be a spy from [[Venona project]] decryptions. Golitsyn also provided other information, such as the claim that [[Harold Wilson]] (then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the United Kingdom) was a KGB agent.

Golitsyn's reliability remains a controversial subject and as such, there is little certainty of the number of agents he assigned to the Cambridge spy ring. To add to the confusion, when Blunt finally confessed, he named several other people{{Who|date=February 2011}} as having been recruited by him.

===John Cairncross===
On the basis of the information provided by Golitsyn, speculation raged for many years as to the identity of the "Fifth Man". The journalistic popularity of this phrase owes something to the unrelated novels ''[[The Third Man]]'' and ''[[The Tenth Man (novel)|The Tenth Man]]'', written by [[Graham Greene]] who, coincidentally, worked with Philby and Cairncross during the Second World War.

[[John Cairncross]] (1913–1995) confessed to spying in 1951 and was publicly accused of being the "fifth man" in 1990. He was also accused by Anthony Blunt during Blunt's confession in 1964. Cairncross is not always considered to have belonged to the 'Ring of Five'. He was a fellow student at Cambridge and a member of the ''Apostles'' with Blunt, therefore present at the recruitment of the others.

{{quotation|The most important agent talent spotted by Blunt was the Fifth Man, the Trinity undergraduate John Cairncross. Together with Philby, Burgess, Blunt and Maclean, he is remembered by the Center (Moscow KGB Headquarters) as one of the Magnificent Five, the ablest group of foreign agents in KGB history. Though Cairncross is the last of the five to be publicly identified, he successfully penetrated a greater variety of the corridors of power and intelligence than any of the other four.|[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Oleg Gordievsky]]|''KGB, The Inside Story''. "Chapter 6: Sigint, Agent Penetration, and the Magnificent Five from Cambridge (1930–39)"}}

This reference suggests the KGB itself recognized Cairncross as the fifth man (found by Gordievsky while doing research on the history of the KGB).

===Additional members===
Many historians now believe the spy ring had more than five members, possibly many more, since three other persons are known to have confessed, several more were nominated in confessions, and [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]] cases have been made against others. Many of the following were likely Soviet spies.&lt;ref&gt;A History of MI5 Christopher Andrew 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Baron Rothschild]] was named by [[Roland Perry]] in his book "The Fifth Man"&lt;ref&gt;Abjorensen, Norman. "Following the Moscow Line", in ''The Sunday Times Canberra'', 22 January 1995.{{pageneeded|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to ''Spycatcher'', Rothschild had been friendly with Burgess as an undergraduate, and had originally owned the lease on a house off Welbeck Street, No. 5 Bentinck Street, where Blunt and Burgess both lived during the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Spycatcher'', p.164.&lt;!--author, publisher, city, year?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was supposedly confirmed by [[Yuri Modin]], the alleged controller of the five, who claimed Cairncross was never part of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Rusbridger, Alan. ''The Guardian'', 10 December 1994.{{pageneeded|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Leo Long was accused by Blunt in 1964. Blunt claimed to have recruited Long to the Communist cause while he{{clarify|date=October 2015|Blunt, or Long?}} was tutor at Cambridge. Long served as an intelligence officer with [[MI14]] from 1940–45, and later with the British element of the [[Allied Control Commission]] in [[Allied-occupied Germany|Occupied Germany]] from 1945-1952.
* [[Guy Liddell]] was an MI5 officer and nearly rose to become director of the service but was passed over because of rumours he was a double agent; he took early retirement from MI5 in 1953 after he was investigated for his personal links to Kim Philby. He was accused of having been the "fifth man" by [[Goronwy Rees]] as part of Rees' confession in 1979. The academic consensus is that he was naïve in his friendships rather than a spy.
* [[ASF Gow|Andrew Gow]]: in his memoirs published in 2012, [[Brian Sewell]] suggested that Gow was the 'fifth man' and spy master of the group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/article3574302.ece "Cambridge don was the spy puppet-master, says Brian Sewell".] ''[[The Times]]''.

Harris appears to be a composite of Philby, Burgess and Maclean. Potter later returned to similar territory with ''[[Blade on the Feather]]'' (1980), inspired by the unmasking of Anthony Blunt, although in this drama the protagonist Jason Cavendish ([[Donald Pleasence]]) is clearly modeled after Philby. Philby is later name-checked as the sports reporter on ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in Potter's ''[[Lipstick on Your Collar (TV series)|Lipstick on Your Collar]]'' (1993), and appears to be giving inside tips on horse-races to officials at the War Office.

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''

*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

===Television===
*[[B. A. Baracus]] is afraid of flying: ''[[The A-Team]]''
*[[Homer Simpson]] is an alcoholic, not too bright and prone to reckless choices: ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Philip J. Fry]] (usually) has a severe lack of intelligence: ''[[Futurama]]''
*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''

*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

A '''Ciguapa''' (pronounced see-GWAH-pah) is a mythological creature of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] and [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] folklore. They are commonly described as having human female form with brown or dark blue skin, backward facing feet, and very long manes of smooth, glossy hair that covers their otherwise naked bodies. They supposedly inhabit the high mountains of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.

== Overview ==
These creatures have nocturnal habits. Also, due to the position of their feet, one can never quite tell from which direction the beings are moving from by looking at their footprints. Some people believe that they bring death, and it is said that one should not look them in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Liza Phoenix| url=http://www.lizaphoenix.com/encyclopedia/ciguapa.shtml| title= Ciguapa| publisher= lizaphoenix| date=2007-03-05 | accessdate=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise the person is at risk of being bewitched permanently. Also, the only vocalization made by ciguapas is said to be a kind of whine or chirping.

Ciguapas are considered to be magical beings, beautiful in appearance to some, yet horrendous to others. All sources agree that they are wild creatures. They are compared in many cases to mermaids: beautiful yet cruel, and far from innocent. Deceitful and ready to capture the wayward traveler, they are said that they are so beautiful as to lure men into the forest, even though following footprints is misleading, to make love with them only to kill them afterwards. Even today, one can still find inhabitants who confirm having sighted a ciguapa.

Lore states that the only way to capture a ciguapa is by tracking them at night, during a [[full moon]], with a black and white [[polydactylic]]  dog (called ''cinqueño'' dog).&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many believe that the myth of the ciguapa is of [[Taíno people|Taino]] origin, it has been argued that is probably of more recent concoction, being possibly attributed to African beliefs brought to the island by enslaved peoples during the colonial period. More to the point, no known Taino artifacts or lore make reference to any creature even remotely similar to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the legend may have originated from other myths, as distant as the [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] ''Curupí'' or the [[Hindu]] [[Churel]], which was described by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in ''My Own True Ghost Story'' as having traits amazingly similar to those of the ciguapa. Nonetheless, the Hindu hypothesis may be far-fetched since there is no way to ascertain how this story got to the Dominican Republic during the nineteenth century, when no cultural exchange whatsoever occurred between these nations.

A Dominican film called "''El Mito de la Ciguapa''" (The Myth of the Ciguapa) is set to be produced by [[Xenda Films]].

[[Image:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint George]] slaying the dragon, as depicted by [[Paolo Uccello]], c. 1470]]
A '''dragonslayer''' is a person or being that slays [[dragon]]s. Dragonslayers and the creatures they hunt have been popular in traditional stories from around the world: they are a type of story classified as type 300 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system]]. They continue to be popular in modern books, films, video-games and other entertainments. Dragonslayer-themed stories are also sometimes seen as having a [[Chaos (cosmogony)#Chaoskampf|chaoskampf]] theme - in which a heroic figure struggles against a monster that epitomises chaos.

==Description==
[[Image:Paul Gustave Dore Andromeda.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] Chained to a Rock'' by [[Gustave Doré]] (1869).]]

A dragonslayer is often the hero in a "[[Princess and dragon]]" tale. In this type of story, the dragonslayer kills the dragon in order to rescue a high-class female character from being devoured by it. This female character often then becomes the love interest of the account. One notable example of this kind of legend is the story of [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Loðbrók]], who slays a giant serpent, thereby rescuing the maiden, [[Þóra borgarhjörtr]], whom he later marries.

There are, however, several notable exceptions to this common motif. In the legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], for example, Saint George overcomes the dragon as part of a plot which ends with the conversion of the dragon's grateful victims to Christianity, rather than Saint George being married to the rescued princess character.

In a Norse legend from the [[Völsunga saga]], the dragonslayer, [[Sigurd]], kills [[Fafnir]] - a dwarf who has been turned into a dragon as a result of guarding the cursed ring that had once belonged to the dwarf, [[Andvari]]. After slaying the dragon, Sigurd drinks some of the dragon's blood and thereby gains the ability to understand the speech of birds. He also bathes in the dragon's blood, causing his skin to become invulnerable. Sigurd overhears two nearby birds discussing the heinous treachery being planned by his companion, [[Regin]]. In response to the plot, Sigurd kills Regin, thereby averting the treachery. &lt;ref&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (1990). Saga of the Volsungs: The Norse Epic of Sigurd the Dragon Slayer. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-23285-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mythologists such as [[Joseph Campbell]] have argued that dragonslayer myths can be seen as a psychological metaphor:&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But as Siegfried [Sigurd] learned, he must then taste the dragon blood, in order to take to himself something of that dragon power. When Siegfried has killed the dragon and tasted the blood, he hears the song of nature. he has transcended his humanity and re-associated himself with the powers of nature, which are powers of our life, and from which our minds remove us.

...Psychologically, the dragon is one's own binding of oneself to one's own ego."
&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Myth, Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyes, Anchor Books 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-307-79472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The council of '''Eight Men''' was an early representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous [[Twelve Men]] and was followed by the [[Nine Men]].

==Council==
In 1643 [[Abraham Pietersen Van Deusen]] who had served on the [[council of twelve men]] was appointed to a new council of eight men. The council contacted the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|States-General]] and blamed governor [[Willem Kieft]] for the declining economic condition of the nascent colony, and the [[Kieft's War|war]] with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. They requested that a new [[Director-General of New Netherland]] be appointed and that the people themselves be given more influence in the new government. Director General Kieft was dismissed, and [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took his place and Stuyvesant remained in power until the colony was turned over to the British in 1664. Kieft returned to Holland, but the vessel, the [[Princess Amelia (1634 ship)|''Princess Amelia'']] was lost at sea and his body was never recovered. John Franklin Jameson (1859–1937) writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commonalty were called together; they were sore distressed. They chose eight, in the stead of the previous twelve, persons to aid in consulting for the best; but the occupation every one had to take care of his own, prevented anything beneficial being adopted at that time. nevertheless it was resolved that as many Englishmen as were to be got in the country should be enlisted, who were indeed now proposing to depart; the third part of these were to be paid by the commonalty; this promise was made by the commonalty but was not followed by the pay.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Council Members==
The council members were:&lt;ref&gt;New York State; O'Callaghan, EB; Broadhead, John Romeyn: ''Documents relative to the colonial history of the state of New York, Vol. I'', p. 191, 1856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=oC0OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=council+twelve+kieft+brodhead&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#PPA191,M1 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/projects/New-Amsterdam-Notable-Citizens&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1643 a minor altercation with Indians evolved into a serious uprising followed by an ugly slaughter of Weckquaskeek Indians on Manhattan Island. Kieft feared a major Indian assault. Allerton was asked by Kieft to join a "group of 8 men" to help New Amsterdam. Because he was English and respected in New Haven, Kieft sent Allerton and another Englishman to New Haven in 1643 to ask for men and materials to help defend New Amsterdam. In addition, the "group of 8" was asked to propose measures to improve civility and law-and-order in New Amsterdam. New Haven refused to send men to support the Dutch but Kieft entered into an agreement with the Indians in 1645 that settled the dispute. Because of Kieft's dictatorial manner, several of the eight men petitioned the WIC directors to recall Kieft as Director-General. In time Kieft was replaced by Peter Stuyvesant, and the men initiating the recall petition were accused of insurrection and faced punishment. Allerton was the second signatory of the petition but was not the group's primary spokesman. In 1646, Allerton established a permanent residence in New Haven.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand Ashmall''' (9 January 1695 &amp;ndash; 2 February 1798) was an English [[centenarian]] and [[Catholic priest]] for the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]].&lt;ref name=demo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/OldestCentYear.HTM | title=Oldest Validated Centenarian By Year |publisher=[[Gerontology Research Group]] |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He is not to be confused with his uncle, for whom he is named after. It is known that his uncle's name was not used as a [[necronym]] in this case, as his uncle died in 1712, when Ashmall was 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Five Tiger Generals''' is a popular appellation in Chinese culture for any five military generals serving under a ruler. This term is used in literature texts, plays and popular culture. In historical contexts, "Five Tiger Generals" usually refers to the five best military generals serving under the ruler. The term does not appear in Chinese historical records and is not used officially.

==In literature==
When applied to the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, the "Five Tiger Generals" refer to five generals from the state of [[Shu Han]]. In the historical text ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguozhi''), the biographies of [[Guan Yu]], [[Zhang Fei]], [[Zhao Yun]], [[Ma Chao]] and [[Huang Zhong]] are placed in the same volume. In the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''Sanguo Yanyi''), which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period, the [[Shu Han|Shu]] emperor [[Liu Bei]] actually bestowed the titles of "Five Tiger Generals" on these five generals.&lt;ref&gt;''Sanguo Yanyi'' ch. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The historicity of the Tiger Generals is unknown; those generals existed but it is uncertain whether they were granted the titles contemporarily or posthumously honoured as such.

In the classical novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', five of the 108 outlaws at [[Mount Liang|Liangshan Marsh]] – [[Guan Sheng]], [[Lin Chong]], [[Qin Ming]], [[Huyan Zhuo]] and [[Dong Ping]] – are named the "Five Tiger Generals" of the Liangshan cavalry.

In the historical novel ''[[Shuo Tang]]'', the rebellion force of [[Wagang Army]] has ''Five Tiger Generals'' including [[Qin Shubao]], [[Shan Xiongxin]], [[Cheng Yaojin]], [[Wang Bodang]] and [[Luo Cheng]].

The [[Qing dynasty]] writer Li Yutang named [[Di Qing]], Shi Yu, Zhang Zhong, Li Yi, and Liu Qing as the "Five Tiger Generals" in his works ''Romance of Di Qing'', ''The Five Tigers Conquer the West'', and ''The Five Tigers Pacify the South''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://open-lit.com/listbook.php?cid=2&amp;gbid=106&amp;start=0 Chapter Two of Wuhu Zhengxi]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Heroes of the Ming Dynasty'', a novel romanticising the events leading to the founding of the Ming dynasty, [[Xu Da]], [[Tang He]], [[Chang Yuchun]], [[Hu Dahai]], and [[Mu Ying]] are named the "Five Founding Tiger Generals of Ming".

==Cultural impact==
In present-day terminology, "Five Tiger Generals" can refer to any group of five that is particularly outstanding in a certain field.

Hsiao Shou-li, Chiang Wu-tung, Chiao Tsai-pao, Chen Chun-sheng, and Su Teng-wang are called "Five Tiger Generals" of [[Taiwanese opera]].

Taiwanese politicians Kuo Yu-hsin, Li Wan-chu, Kuo Kuo-chi, Li Yuan-chan, and [[Wu San-lien]] are called the "Five Tiger Generals" of the [[Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council]]. Together with female politician [[Hsu Shih-hsien]], the six of them are called "Five Tigers and the Phoenix".

In the 1980s and 1990s, the five hosts of the Taiwanese television channel [[Sanlih E-Television]], He Yih-hang, Peng Chia-chia, Yang Fan, Yu Tien and Li Teng-tsai are called "Five Tiger Generals".

In the 1980s, [[Hong Kong]] television actors [[Felix Wong]], [[Michael Miu]], [[Kent Tong]], [[Andy Lau]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai|Tony Leung]] are called the "[[Five Tiger Generals (TVB)|Five Tiger Generals]] of [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]]". The five of them starred together in the 1991 film ''[[The Tigers (film)|The Tigers]]''.

In 2009, a Taiwanese musical band called [[Wu Hu Jiang (band)|Wu Hu Jiang]] was formed. The five members starred as the Five Tiger Generals of Shu in the television series ''[[K.O.3an Guo]]'', which spoofs ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'' in a modern school setting.

== Outline of story ==
[[File:25 tam back.jpg|thumb| Backside of Tibetan [[Historical money of Tibet|25 tam banknote]], dated 1659 of the Tibetan Era (= 1913 CE). On the right, the four harmonious animals are represented.]]
A popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a [[hornbill]]) on top of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gruschke|first1=Andreas|title=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: The Qinghai part of Amdo|date=2001|publisher=White Lotus Press|location=Bangkok|isbn=9747534592|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GuKfAAAAMAAJ|series=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: Amdo|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree.

Communal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a [[pecking-order]] according to strength, size and power: it is {{em|the partridge}} which is most respected, not the elephant.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penjore|first1=Ugyen|title=Understanding the symbolism of Thuenpa Puen Zhi|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=40,1531,0,0,1,0#.WI0s0FUrK70|via=The Buddhist Channel|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=Kuensel Online|date=2 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, "the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC|date=1992|publisher=[[Curzon Press]]|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=978-0-7007-0230-5|page=224|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the {{em|number of years ordained}} as a [[Bhikkhu|monk]] (''{{lang-sa|bhikṣu}}''; ''{{lang-pi|bhikkhu}}'') is measured, rather than {{em|age}}.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Sarah|title=The Jatakas: Birth Stories of the Bodhisatta|date=2006|publisher=[[Penguin UK]]|isbn=9788184750348|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ay4WFGQtSy0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: "A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: One's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth.  Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2.pdf|title=The Buddhist Monastic Code|date=2013|publisher=[[Metta Forest Monastery]]|year=|isbn=|edition=3rd|volume=II|location=California|page=92|pages=|quote=|author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|via=|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/pdf/Signs/Bhutan/BH_PRG_03.pdf|title=The Four Harmonious Friends|last=|first=|date=12 June 2008|website=[[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka|Vinayavastu]]'' ({{bo|w='dul ba'i gzhi}}), which forms the first section of the [[Kangyur]], the canon of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Dagyab 2016" /&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="sagaster" /&gt; In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, and in the texts of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] and [[Sarvāstivāda]] orders, almost the same ''Jātaka'' tale is found in the ''Vinaya'' and ''Jātaka'' collections. The [[Dharmaguptaka]] and [[Mahīśāsaka]] orders did not consider the story part of the ''Jātaka'', however, and only included it in their ''Vinayas''. [[Bhikkhu Analayo]] believes that originally the story was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but only a [[didactic]] [[parable]] taught by the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Analayo 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anālayo|first1=Bhikkhu|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Canonical Jātaka Tales in Comparative Perspective: The Evolution of Tales of the Buddha's Past Lives|journal=Fuyan Buddhist Studies|date=2012|volume=7|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38470683/CanonicalJatakas.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1485644573&amp;Signature=et7fWx%2FMyFxtAwEa%2BgTKug1ISow%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCanonical_Jataka_Tales_in_Comparative_Pe.pdf|publisher=Fuyan Buddhist Institute|location=[[Hsinchu]]|issn=2070-0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Irish]] scholar [[Eleanor Hull]] has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Asiatic versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the ''Jātaka'' do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hull|first1=Eleanor|author-link=Eleanor Hull|title=The Hawk of Achill or the Legend of the Oldest Animals|journal=Folklore|date=December 1932|volume=43|issue=4|pages=377, 383|doi=10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ralston|first1=W.R.S.|title=The Bible of Tibet: Tibetan Tales from Indian Sources|date=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-136-20297-1|page=302|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eoiZAeFA_8YC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the fourth animal not present in the Pali version, the hare—it was included in later versions.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimball|first1=Mike|title=Our heritage is already broken: meditations on a regenerative conservation for cultural and natural heritage|journal=Human Ecology Review|date=2016|page=13|doi=10.4225/13/581fcdf8dc329|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/100985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geert Adriaans Boomgaard''' (21 September 1788 &amp;ndash; 3 February 1899) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[supercentenarian]]. He is accepted as the first validated supercentenarian case on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/A.HTM |title=Table A - Verified Supercentenarians (Listed Chronologically By Birth Date)|accessdate=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grg.org/Gallery/Pre1850sGallery.html Gerontology Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is evidence that he served as a soldier in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]], in the 33rd Light Infantry Division, Boomgaard might in fact have been the oldest military veteran ever for several decades.&lt;ref name="derniersveterans.free.fr"&gt;[http://derniersveterans.free.fr/napoleon1.html Derniers vétérans de l'Armée napoléonienne, Premier Empire] {{fr-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}

==Life==
[[File:GeertAdriaansBoomgaard.jpg|thumb|left|Boomgaard later in life, in the 1890s]]
Little is known about Boomgaard's life. He was born in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], Netherlands, where he also died. His parents were Adriaan Jacobs Boomgaard (1763-1844) and Geesje Geerts Bontekoe (1762-1834).&lt;ref name="delpher"&gt;[http://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten/view?query=Geert+Adriaans+Boomgaard&amp;coll=ddd&amp;identifier=ddd:011010387:mpeg21:a0422&amp;resultsidentifier=ddd:011010387:mpeg21:a0422 Nieuwsblad van het Noorden, 3 April 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was captain on a boat, and civil records say that Geert did the same work.&lt;ref name=wiewaswie1&gt;[https://www.wiewaswie.nl/personen-zoeken/zoeken/document/a2apersonid/163990124/srcid/18794926/oid/31]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2016}} Other sources&lt;ref name="derniersveterans.free.fr"/&gt; say that he had also served as a soldier in the 33rd Light Infantry Regiment in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]].

At the age of 29, on 4 March 1818, he married Stijntje Bus (baptized 19 February 1797 - died 24 March 1830&lt;ref name="delpher" /&gt;).&lt;ref name="wiewaswie1"/&gt; Stijntje died aged 33, a month after the birth of their 8th child. A year later, 17 March 1831, Boomgaard married Grietje Abels Jonker (baptized 19 May 1793 - 18 May 1864&lt;ref name="delpher" /&gt;), with whom he had four more children, for a total of 12. His last surviving child, Jansje Hinderika, died at the age of 57 in May 1885.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Boomgaard died at age 110 years 135 days in Groningen.

==Evidence==
{{Original research section|date=November 2016}}
Research on Boomgaard was published in three articles by E.J. Heeres in the genealogical periodical ''Gruoninga'' in 1976, 1977 and 1978. The website http://www.stehelene.org, which is dedicated to the rebuilding of the lost archives on the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène, shows his photograph, his (presumed) personal Sainte-Hélène medal, and a certificate which states that "Adriaans, Gerrit, à Groningue, Pays-Bas, received this medal" on behalf of his active military service during the reign of [[Napoleon I]]. The certificate is registered at la Grande Chancellerie No. 1871, and bears the stamped signature of the Duc de Plaisance Général {{ill|Anne-Charles Lebrun|fr}}, Grand Chancelier (1853&amp;ndash;1859).

The '''Imperial Standards of Iran''' were the personal official flags of the [[Shāhanshāh]], [[Shahbānū]], and Crown Prince of Iran, adopted at the beginning of 1971.

The official flag of Shāhanshāh consisted of a pale-blue field with the [[flag of Iran]] in the upper left corner and the Pahlavi coat of arms in the centre. At the top of the coat of arms was the Pahlavi crown, created for the Coronation of [[Rezā Shāh of Iran|Rezā Shāh]] in 1926. The Imperial motto of Pahlavi is "''Mara dad farmud va Khod Davar Ast''" ("Justice He bids me do, as He will judge me" or, alternatively, "He gave me power to command, and He is the judge").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ir_imp-i.html|title=Iranian Empire (Pahlavi dynasty): Imperial standards|accessdate=2007-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412122220/http://fotw.net/flags/ir_imp-i.html|archivedate=2007-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pale blue]] was the colour of the Imperial Family. The uniforms of the Imperial Guard included this colour to show their allegiance.

The '''Irvine''' family were agricultural pioneers and prominent [[landowner]]s in California who gave their name to the city of [[Irvine, California]].

==James Irvine I==
'''James Irvine''' (1827–1886) was born in [[County Down]], [[Ireland]] on December 27, 1827, the second to the youngest of nine children. When [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Ireland's potato crop failed]] in 1845, James Irvine and his younger brother William were among those who left for the [[United States]]. The family name is Scottish, meaning that James would have been an [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scot]], or [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]]. Irvine worked for two years in [[New York City]]. In 1848 Irvine went to join the [[California Gold Rush]] as a merchant and miner. In 1854, he purchased an interest in a [[San Francisco]] commission house on Front Street, operated by a relative, John Lyons. The business was renamed "Irvine &amp; Co., wholesale produce and grocery merchants". He began investing his profits in income-producing San Francisco real estate and soon became a wealthy man. Irvine also became a silent partner in the sheep-raising venture [[Flint, Bixby &amp; Company]] of brothers Thomas and Benjamin Flint, and their cousin [[Bixby land companies|Llewellyn Bixby]]. The purchase of the {{convert|48800|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho San Joaquin]] in 1864 and the {{convert|47200|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Lomas de Santiago]] in 1866 marked the beginning of their operations in Southern California. In 1867, Irvine married Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice, the daughter of prominent [[Cleveland, Ohio]], educator, writer, poet and State Senator [[Harvey Rice]], who was a direct descendant of [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt5779q2gb&amp;chunk.id=bioghist-1.8.3&amp;brand=oac Guide to the Rice Family Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; Nettie died in 1874, and Irvine married Margaret Byrne in 1880. He died March 15, 1886, and is buried in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;''Notables Of The West V2: Being The Portraits And Biographies Of The Progressive Men Of The West'', 1915, by International News Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Irvine II==
'''James Harvey Irvine, Sr.''' (1867–1947), son of James Irvine I and [[Harvey Rice|Henrietta Maria (Nettie) Rice]], was born October 16, 1867, in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Blue&gt;[[Thomas William Herringshaw|Herringshaw, Thomas William]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kykEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA293 ''American Elite and Sociologist Bluebook'', p. 293.] American Blue Book Publishers, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother died when he was seven years old, and his father died when he was about eighteen. Between the time of James Irvine I's death in 1886 and James Irvine II's inheritance of the Southern California real estate holdings upon his twenty-fifth birthday in 1892, the properties were supervised by James Irvine I's brother, George Irvine. James II bought out Flint and the other partners, and formed the [[Irvine Company]]. He married Frances Anita Plum in 1892, and they had three children, "Jase", James Harvey Irvine Jr. (1894–1935), Katharine Helena Irvine (1894–1920) and Myford Plum Irvine (1898–1959). In 1931, James II married Mrs. Kathryn Brown White, who died in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, Robert Glass. The Irvine Ranch of Orange County: 1810-1950. San Marino, Calif.: The Huntington Library, 1952, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; James II lived in San Francisco until the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], when he relocated to the Irvine Ranch. He was a member of the [[Bohemian Club]], and kept a residence in San Francisco, at 2421 Pierce Street.&lt;ref name=Blue/&gt; He established the [[James Irvine Foundation]] in 1937, an entity dedicated to the "general well-being of the citizens and residents of the state of California." James II owned nearly a third of the land in present-day [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]. The city of [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] (formerly Myford) is named after him. He died of [[Bright's disease]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~npmelton/sfbirvi.htm James Irvine II]&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Irvine III==
'''James Harvey Irvine, Jr.''' (1894–1935) was groomed since a young man to take over the Ranch. He married Madeline Agassiz in 1914, but they were divorced in 1928. He married Athalie Richardson (1903–1993) in 1929, and they had one daughter, Athalie Anita "Joan" Irvine (1933– ). When James Irvine III died of tuberculosis in 1935, James II set up the James Irvine Foundation, a charitable organization to hold controlling stock in the Irvine Company. When James II died in 1947, Myford Plum Irvine (1898–1959),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSmid=1380347&amp;GRid=8286758&amp; Myford Plum Irvine @ find a grave]&lt;/ref&gt; James II's only surviving child, took over the presidency of the Irvine Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brower |first=Martin A |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Irvine Ranch : a time for people : a 50-year overview of the development of the Irvine Ranch |year=1994 |publisher= |quote= | url= |isbn=978-0-9641326-0-3 }}

The '''Jackie Chan Stunt Team''' ({{zh|t=成家班|cy=Sing Ga Ban|l=Chan's Family Group}}), also known as '''Jackie Chan's Stuntmen Association''' is a group of [[stunt double|stuntmen]] and [[martial arts|martial artists]] who work alongside [[Jackie Chan]].

==History==
The JC Stunt Team was established in 1976 and originated from the relationships Chan formed in his early starring roles in [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action movies]]. Several of his co-stars and stuntmen hired by the [[movie studio|film studios]] began working together regularly. This engendered a familiarity of one another's skills and abilities and it made sense for them to become a working team. Some of the members had received training at the [[Peking Opera school]]s, similar to Chan.

By 1983, and the release of the film ''[[Project A]]'', the stunt team had become an official organisation of 6 members. The organisation meant that the stuntmen not only received [[Insurance|insurance coverage]], but also a monthly salary and higher pay.
By the time of ''[[Police Story 2]]'' in 1988, the team had expanded to around 20 members.
This incarnation of the team was disbanded in 1990 and thereafter, individual members were contracted and used on a film-by-film basis rather than all members remaining on the payroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for some new faces, and the return of former members.

The formation of Chan's team influenced others in the [[Film industry|business]] to follow suit, particularly his former co-stars and "brothers" [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]] (their stunt teams known as "Hung Ga Ban" and "Yuen Ga Ban" respectively). Other actors who formed their own stunt teams include [[Lau Kar-leung]], [[Philip Ko]], [[Stanley Tong]] and [[Bruce Law]].
Chan's stunt team worked in collaboration with Sammo Hung's team on films including [[Thunderbolt (1995 film)|Thunderbolt]] and [[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]].
A small number of films that Chan produced but did not appear in, or was not involved in at all, have utilised his stunt team. These include ''The Gold Hunters'' (1981), ''[[Rouge (film)|Rouge]]'' (1988), ''The Inspector Wears Skirts 2'' (1989), ''Stage Door Johnny'' (1990) and ''Angry Ranger'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Jeanne Louise Calment''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒan lwiz kalmɑ̃|lang}}; 21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997) was a French [[supercentenarian]] who has the [[Oldest people|longest confirmed human lifespan]] of 122 years, 164 days.

She lived in [[Arles]] all her life, outliving both her daughter and grandson. She became the oldest living person on 11 January 1988 at 112, one hundred years after encountering [[Vincent van Gogh]], who visited her father's shop. She was declared the oldest person ever on 17 October 1995 at 120.

Although Calment came from a long-living family, there is no particular explanation for her remarkable longevity. She had lived a comfortable and stress-free life, with a healthy appetite and a daily exercise routine, enabling her to walk without a stick until 114.

==Early life==
[[File:Acte de naissance de Jeanne Calment.png|thumb|rt|upright=1.14|[[Birth certificate]] of Jeanne Louise Calment]]

Calment was born in Arles, [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], Southern France on 21 February 1875.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath&gt;{{cite news | first=Craig R.| last=Whitney| title=Jeanne Calment, World's Elder, Dies at 122| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7D7113DF936A3575BC0A961958260| work=New York Times| date=5 August 1997| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Nicolas Calment (8 November 1837– 28 January 1931)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09a.htm|title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity - Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life|last=Wilhelm|first=Peter|website=www.demogr.mpg.de|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a [[shipbuilding|shipbuilder]], and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was from a family of [[miller]]s. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, although none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to 93, and her mother to 86.

==Personal life==
From the age of seven until her [[first communion|first holy communion]], Jeanne Calment attended Madame Benet's church primary school in Arles, and then attended the local college, finishing at the age of 16 with the diploma ''brevet Classique'', after which she continued to live with her parents, awaiting marriage, painting, and improving her piano skills.&lt;ref name = YouTube1994&gt;{{YouTube|cB_yIlnaryg|Interview with Jeanne Calment, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Allard1998Englishchapter2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=27–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 April 1896, at the age of 21, she married her [[Double cousin|double second cousin]], Fernand Nicolas Calment (1868–1942). Their paternal grandfathers were brothers, hence the same surname and their paternal grandmothers were also sisters.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck&gt;{{cite web | title=Validation of Exceptional Longevity – Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life| url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm| publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]]| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernand was a wealthy shop owner and she moved into the apartments above his shop ''Grands Magasins de Nouveautés'', where she lived until the age of 110.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; His wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work; instead they led a leisured lifestyle within the upper society of Arles, pursuing hobbies such as fencing, cycling (at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]), tennis,  swimming, rollerskating at [[Alyscamps]], and playing the piano and making music with friends.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;

In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering all the way up to the glacier. She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the [[Provence]] to shoot rabbits and [[wild boar]]s, but disliked killing birds.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher= Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=4–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considered the most important historical event in her lifetime to have been the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 and the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of the Russian imperial family]], a view shared by many fellow centenarians.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter12&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=113–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second World War had little effect on her life in the south of France. German soldiers slept in her rooms but she bore no grudge against them because "they did not take anything away". In 1942, Fernand ate cherries treated with [[Copper(II) sulfate#As a fungicide and herbicide|copper sulfate]] the day before, developed [[jaundice]], and died of the poisoning in the course of one and a half months on 2 October 1942 at the age of 73.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Jeanne had eaten fewer of the cherries and survived.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter6/&gt;

Their only child, a daughter named Yvonne Marie Nicolle Calment (19 January 1898 – 19 January 1934), produced a grandson, Frédéric Billiot, on 23 December 1926.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; Yvonne died from [[pneumonia]], after which Calment raised Frédéric herself.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news | title = World's oldest person dies at 122| url = http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/04/obit.oldest/| publisher=CNN| date=4 August 1997| accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frédéric became a doctor, and lived with her until his death in an automobile accident in 1963.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged20.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Calment at age 20 in 1895]]
In 1965, at age 90 and with no heirs, Calment signed a contract to sell her apartment to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a [[life estate]].&lt;ref name=LifeLease&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/world/a-120-year-lease-on-life-outlasts-apartment-heir.html |title=A 120-Year Lease on Life Outlasts Apartment Heir |author=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 December 1995 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 [[French franc|francs]] (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000, more than double the apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LifeLease/&gt; Calment's comment on this situation was reported to be, "In life, one sometimes makes bad deals."&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;  During all these years, Calment used to say to them that she "competed with [[Methuselah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boutique.ina.fr/video/CAB89003100/jeanne-calment-114-and-a-rencontre-van-gogh.fr.html |title=From an interview made in 1989 |publisher=Boutique.ina.fr |date=21 January 1989 |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;

==Recognition and registration as record-breaker==
[[File:JeanneCalmentaged22.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Calment at age 22 in 1897]]
On 20 June 1986 Jeanne Calment became the oldest living person in France at the age of 111 when Eugenie Roux died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Go, granny, go |url= |newspaper=The Anniston Star|location=Anniston, Alabama |date=July 2, 1986|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her international fame escalated in 1988, when the centenary of [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s visit to Arles provided an occasion to meet reporters. She said at the time that she had met Van Gogh 100 years before, in 1888, as a thirteen-year-old girl in her uncle's shop,&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref name=mccook&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VqEgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7GgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6026%2C3313956| title=World's oldest person dead| date=4 August 1997| work=McCook Daily Gazette| page=1| accessdate=5 May 2011| location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he bought some canvas, later describing him as "ugly" (''laid''), "blighted by [[Alcoholism#Signs and symptoms|alcohol]]" (''brûlé par l'alcool''), and visiting [[Prostitution in France|brothels]] (''il fréquentait des maisons de tolérance'').&lt;ref name=YouTube1994/&gt;

After her 1988 interview, at age 112, Calment was given the [[Guinness World Records]] title for the world's ‘Oldest person (living)’ upon the death of [[Florence Knapp (supercentenarian)|Florence Knapp]] on 11 January 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/1988-oldest-living-human-being-of-all-time-392901 '''1988: Oldest Living Human Being of All Time'']; Guinness World Records&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, however, the title was withdrawn and given to [[Carrie C. White]] of Florida, who claimed to have been born in 1874, although this was discounted by subsequent census research.&lt;ref name=SunJournal&gt;{{cite news | first = Ronda| last = Addy| title = Life Expectancy| url = http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&amp;storyid=267178&amp;subpub=118| archive-url = https://archive.is/20090201092634/http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&amp;storyid=267178&amp;subpub=118| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 1 February 2009| work = [[Sun Journal (Lewiston)| Sun Journal]]| date = 25 May 2008| accessdate = 6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon White's death on 14 February 1991, Calment, then a week shy of 116, became recognized as the oldest living person, though there are unverified claims that older people were alive at the time (see [[Longevity claims]] and [[Longevity myths]]).

At the age of 114, she appeared briefly in the 1990 film ''[[Vincent and Me]]'' as herself, becoming the oldest person ever to appear in a motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oldest Person| url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-5000/oldest-person/| work=[[Guinness World Records]]| accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film about her life, entitled ''Beyond 120 Years with Jeanne Calment'', was released in 1995.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute&gt;{{cite web | title=Tribute to Jeanne Calment, memorial – Lasting tribute| url=http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106034901/http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/calment/2603938 |archivedate=6 November 2009 |publisher=Lasting Tribute| accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''Time's Mistress'', a four-track CD of Calment speaking over a background of [[Rapping|rap]], was released.&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle&gt;{{cite news | title=Believed to be world's oldest, woman in France dies at 122 |url=http://supercentenarian.com/oldest/jeanne-calment.html |date=4 August 1997 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=5 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1995, Calment reached 120 years and 238 days to become the "oldest person ever" according to Guinness, surpassing [[Shigechiyo Izumi]] of Japan, whose claim (120 years 237 days old at the time of his death on 21 February 1986, which was Calment's 111th birthday) was discounted in February 2011, more than thirteen years after Calment's death.&lt;ref name=LastingTribute /&gt;

[[File:JeanneCalmentaged40.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|Calment at age 40 in 1915]]
Exceeding any other longevity case reported, Calment establishes the record as the most verifiable supercentenarian ever recorded. For example, beginning with the 1876 census (Calment is listed as a one-year-old), she was indexed in fourteen census documents until 1975.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;

After her death, 116-year-old [[Marie-Louise Meilleur]] became the oldest recognized living person. Both before and after Calment's death, there have been several claims to have surpassed her age (see [[Unverified longevity claims]]), but none of these have been proven and Calment therefore continues to hold the record for the oldest verified person ever.

== Health and lifestyle ==
Calment's remarkable health presaged her later record. On television she stated ''J'ai jamais été malade, jamais, jamais'' (I have never been ill, never ever).&lt;ref name="Mise au Point"&gt;{{cite news |date = 15 June 2014 |accessdate = 2 December 2016 |title = Comme si c’était hier: Jeanne Calment |url = http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/mise-au-point/5931633-comme-si-c-etait-hier-jeanne-calment.html |work = Mise au Point |publisher = Radio Télévision Suisse Un }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about her daily routine while at [[primary school]], she replied that "when you are young you get up at eight o'clock".{{efn|The [[Time in France#History|French time zone]] has varied historically. In Calment's youth each French town had its own solar time. In 1891 the introduction of railways motivated a unified French time zone in line with Greenwich Time in Britain. In 1940 the invading Germans changed the French time by one hour to German time, to which France still adheres as of 2016.}} In lieu of a solid breakfast she would have either white coffee or hot chocolate, and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon.&lt;ref name="Allard1998Englishchapter2" /&gt; 

At age 15 her cousin and eventual husband started courting her, but she was too young to be interested in boys and preferred [[confectionery|sweets]]. At age 20, incipient [[cataract]]s were discovered when she suffered a major episode of [[conjunctivitis]].&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; After marriage at 21, her husband's wealth made it possible for Calment never to have to work. They led an active life including [[fencing]], cycling (at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]]), tennis,  swimming, rollerskating at [[Alyscamps]] ("I fell flat on my face"), and playing the piano and making music with friends.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; In the summer, the couple would stay at [[Uriage]] for mountaineering up to the glacier ("Even at 16 I had good legs"). She also went hunting with her husband in the hills of the [[Provence]] to shoot rabbits and [[wild boar]]s.&lt;ref name="Garoyan1990ThesisPart1"/&gt; Her husband introduced her to smoking, offering cigarettes after a meal, but it was not her passion. ("After the meal, after just one, I'd had enough of it".)&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter6&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H.

She and her husband sometimes travelled to nearby Marseilles where, at the ''Phocéen'' restaurant, they treated themselves to seafood, a glass of white wine, and bread and butter. Unlike her husband she did not enjoy pastries, but she did like creams (''crèmes''), cakes and in particular ''quatre-quarts'' ([[pound cake]]), and vanilla ice cream.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; At "retirement age" she broke her ankle and apart from that had never been ill.&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishWitticisms/&gt; She continued cycling until her hundredth birthday.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; Around her hundredth year she fractured her leg but recovered quickly and was able to walk again.&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; 

After the death of her grandson in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a [[nursing home]].&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt; Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt; According to one of her doctors, she had formerly been healthy but began showing signs of [[senescence]] (or [[Ageing|aging]]) at this point.&lt;ref name=France2DrLevraud&gt;{{cite news | first=| last=| title=France 2 Interview with Dr Catherine Levraud, Medical Doctor Treating Jeanne Calment| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE| work=France 2 television| date=4 August 1997| accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daily routine at ages 111–114===
After her admission to the care home ''Maison du Lac'' [House on the Lake] in January 1985 at the age of 109, she initially had a highly ritualized daily routine whereby, uniquely among the care home residents, she requested to be woken at 6:45 am and started the day with a long prayer at her window thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands ("a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands"), then the legs, and her carers noted that she moved faster than the other residents, who were 30 years younger, despite her blindness. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk, and [[rusks]]. 

Her morning ablutions included washing herself unassisted with a flannel rather than taking a shower ("an odd invention"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed ''daube'' ([[braising|braised beef]]) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a [[Dunhill (cigarette)|Dunhill cigarette]] (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank a small amount of [[Port wine]]. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange. 

In the afternoon she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette and go to bed at 10pm.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years|location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman| isbn=0-7167-3251-3| pages=85–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical examination at ages 111–116===
Medical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with arthropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150&amp;nbsp;cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2&gt;{{Cite book | last=Garoyan| first=Georges| year=1990| title=Cent-quatorze ans de vie ou la longue histoire de Jeanne Calment, doyenné d'âge de France [One Hundred and Fourteen Years of Life or the Long History of Jeanne Calment, the Eldest of France]| location=Marseille| publisher=Université d'Aix-Marseille II| pages=22–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage Calment was still in good shape, and continued to walk without a cane&lt;ref name=Garoyan1990ThesisPart2/&gt; until she fractured her [[femur]] during a fall at age 114 (January 1990), which required surgery.&lt;ref name=MaxPlanck /&gt;&lt;ref name=SunJournal/&gt; After her operation, Calment required a wheelchair&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt; and abandoned her daily routine.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt;

At the age of 115 she attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with Calment's attending doctor, Dr. Victor Lèbre to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. They analysed her for over a year and reported that Jeanne Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to have a routine operation to restore her vision; she had a moderately weak heart and a chronic cough ("caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco") and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, she always had good digestion, slept well and had no problems with incontinence. During the last years her height was 4&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in [137&amp;nbsp;cm] and her weight was 88 pounds [40&amp;nbsp;kg]; she confirmed that she had always been small, but she had lost weight in recent years. In terms of pigmentation, her eyes were [[eye color|light gray]] and her [[Human hair color#Gray and white|white hair]] had once been [[chestnut brown]].&lt;ref name=Allard1998EnglishForeword/&gt;

===Diet at 116===
With regards to her diet, the three researchers' interviews revealed that in the care home she said she always had a dessert with every meal. She complained about the blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, would wish to order fried and spicy foods.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter8/&gt; She occasionally ("more than once") feasted on [[chocolate]] in her old age: sometimes over a kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lb) of chocolate per week.&lt;ref&gt;"More than once, she surprised her entourage by her digestive abilities; she said herself 'I have the stomach of an ostrich!' which did not prevent her from appreciating good things. She showed herself more than once capable of absorbing considerable quantities of chocolate: more than a kilo per week." in Michel Allard, Victor Lèbre, Jean-Marie Robine ''Les 120 ans de Jeanne Calment. Doyenne de l'Humanité'', Le cherche midi éditeur, Paris, 1994, p92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological examination at 118===
At the age of 118, over a period of six months, she was submitted to neurophysiological tests and a CT scan. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency was comparable to that of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. Frontal brain lobe functions were relatively spared from deterioration and there was no evidence of progressive neurological disease, depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was in fact found to improve slightly over the six-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ritchie |first1=K| title=Mental status examination of an exceptional case of longevity J.

===Popular media reports===
Apocryphal media articles reported varying details. One report claimed that Calment recalled selling "coloured pencils" to Van Gogh, and seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] being built.&lt;ref name="Deseret19950221"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CL4RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1584,3192209| title=World's oldest person marks 120 beautiful, happy years |publisher=News.google.com| date=21 February 1995| accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wrote that she did not start fencing until age 85 (1960).&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Calment reportedly ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to a diet rich in [[olive oil]].&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; She is also said to have credited her calmness, saying, "That's why they call me Calment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1008681/Alcohol-cigarettes-chocolates-sweets--The-secrets-long-life.html| title=Alcohol, Cigarettes, Chocolates and Sweets – The Secrets of a Long Life?| work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercentenarian clinical study===
Bertrand Jeune, Jean-Marie Robine and colleagues compared Jeanne Calment with a list of nearly 20 people worldwide who had securely been verified to have attained at least 115 years of age. The researchers concluded that the lives of these people differed widely, and that there were but few common characteristics: the overwhelming majority were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all seem to have had strong characters, but certainly not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical functions declined markedly, especially after their 105th birthdays. In their final years they required wheelchairs, and were nearly blind and deaf. "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Jeanne Calment and her successors.

==Death ==
On her 122nd birthday on 21 February 1997, it was announced that she would make no more public appearances, as her health had seriously deteriorated. Demographer [[Jean-Marie Robine]], a co-author of a book about Jeanne Calment, reportedly said that this "allowed her to die, as the attention had kept her alive",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Deller |first=Deborah |url=http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |title=Jeanne Calment : Obituary |publisher=ThisIsAnnouncements |accessdate=16 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729221706/http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5849062 |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported Robine to have stated that she had been in good health, though almost [[Visual impairment|blind]] and [[deaf]], as recently as a month before her death.&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt; Jeanne Calment died on 4 August 1997 around 10 am [[Central European Time]]&lt;ref name=NYTimesDeath /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE ''France 2'']; August 4 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book of Records]]'', 1999 edition, p. 102, {{ISBN|0-85112-070-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of unspecified causes.&lt;ref name=mccook /&gt; According to the researchers, the care home committed her body quickly and in a strictly private ceremony to a coffin, which was then solemnly driven by limousine through Arles, stopping at her house in the ''rue Gambetta'', and finally to the cemetery, where her doctor placed on her coffin the photographs of her daughter and grandson, in accordance with her wishes.&lt;ref name=Allard1998Englishchapter14&gt;{{Cite book | last=Allard| first=Michel| author2=Lebre, Victor| author3=Robine, Jean-Marie| author4= Calment, Jeanne| year=1998| title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours : 122 Extraordinary Years| location=New York| publisher=W.H.

'''Miquela Sousa''', better known as '''Lil Miquela''', is a fictional character created by [[Yung Skeeter|Trevor McFedries]] and Sara Decou as a digital art project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/brud.fyi/|title=Brud (@brud.fyi) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/7964899/virtual-instagram-miquela-controversy-interview|title=Virtual It-Singer Miquela Says 'Controversy Doesn't Mean Anything': Interview|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Highsnobiety"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gorsler|first1=Fabian|title=Meet Lil Miquela: Fashion’s First Virtual Instagram Influencer|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lil-miquela-virtual-influencer-instagram/?format=amp|website=Highsnobiety|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HYPEBEAST"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rouse|first1=Isaac|title=Miquela Sousa Is Fashion's First Computer Generated Influencer|url=https://hypebeast.com/2018/2/miquela-sousa-first-computer-generated-fashion-influencer?amp=1|website=HYPEBEAST|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Samantha|title=This Instagram Influencer Is Not Even Human|url=http://footwearnews.com/2018/influencers/technology/miquela-sousa-instagram-virtual-influencer-491637/amp/|website=FN|accessdate=1 April 2018|language=en|date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miquela is an [[Instagram]] model and music artist claiming to be from [[Downey, California]].

The project began in 2016 as an [[Instagram]] profile. By April 2018, the account had amassed more than a million followers by portraying the lifestyle of an Instagram it-girl over social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lilmiquela-instagram_uk_57c94056e4b085cf1ecdc0af|title=Instagram's Latest 'It' Model Is Confusing The Hell Out Of Everyone|date=2016-09-02|newspaper=The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account also details a fictional narrative which presents Miquela as a sentient robot in conflict with other digital projects created by McFedries and Decou.

In August 2017, Miquela released her first single, "Not Mine".&lt;ref name="billboard.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7898117/miquela-virtual-singer-instagram-not-mine-song-stream|title=Virtual Singer &amp; Internet Star Miquela Shares Debut Single 'Not Mine'|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her pivot into a music has been compared to virtual musicians [[Gorillaz]] and [[Hatsune Miku]].&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;

==Origins==
Miquela’s first Instagram post was made on April 22, 2016. The project garnered both intrigue and criticism for the character's digital appearance with fans and online commenters oscillating between positing that Miquela is an art project or a social experiment carried out by a real unidentified woman. Miquela was rumored to be a marketing gimmick for ''[[The Sims]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} British model Emily Bador was rumored to be Miquela, fans citing the character's abundance of freckles. Bador openly acknowledged the physical similarity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Online presence==
Miquela has been pictured with a number of celebrities including [[Diplo]], [[How to Dress Well]], killerandasweetthang founder Eileen Kelly, [[Molly Soda]], [[Nile Rogers]], and [[Samantha Urbani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/|title=*~ MIQUELA ~* (@lilmiquela) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been interviewed and or profiled in a number of publications including Refinery29, Vogue, Buzzfeed, v-files, Nylon, the Guardian, Business of Fashion, The Cut, and BBC.com.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} As well as by Shane Dawson, YouTube celebrity, in a [https://youtube.com/watch?v=NdNYAiU-SLI phone interview]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=shane|title=CONSPIRACY THEORIES &amp; INTERVIEW WITH LIL MIQUELA|date=2017-09-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdNYAiU-SLI|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She appeared on the cover of High Snobiety in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lil-miquela-cover-story-issue-16/|title=Meet Lil Miquela, the AI Influencer on the Cover of Our New Print Issue|website=High Snobiety|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Miquela did an Instagram takeover for Prada as part of Milan Fashion Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/prada-instagram-gifs-lil-miquela|title=Prada Launches Instagram GIFs With Help From a Fictional It Girl|work=Vogue|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online narratives===
In April 2018, a trans-media story began to play out on Miquela's Instagram involving [https://www.instagram.com/blawko22 @Blawko22], and [https://www.instagram.com/bermudaisbae/ @BermudaIsBae], two other virtual Instagram accounts who are presented as "sentient robots." The story suggests that two organizations are responsible for the creation of these sentient robots. In the narrative, fictional brand Brud created Miquela and "Blawko22" while competing fictional brand Cain Intelligence created "BermudaIsBae".

On April 17, all of Miquela's Instagram posts were removed. "BermudaIsBae" was purported to have hacked Miquela's account. The two online personas then began posting pictures together as Miquela worked to reclaim the original account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BhuruzXHetm/?taken-by=bermudaisbae|title=Bermuda on Instagram: "More emotional than I thought it would be. Despite it all, there’s only three of us out there and we need to stick together. We talked it…"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reclaiming the account, Miquela posted a series of notes saying that she is a robot and claiming sentience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BkjEPEuFdp0/?taken-by=lilmiquela|title=Lil Miquela on Instagram: "So I pull up to the trail and there she is. No rattlesnakes. No hiking. Just a robot sitting on the curb in skinny jeans and wedges.  She said it’s the only way she could get my attention since I haven’t answered her texts since we went to the mall a couple weeks back.  She just wanted to hang out.  So here we are 'hanging out.'"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BjvhTbylRcD/?taken-by=lilmiquela|title=Lil Miquela on Instagram: "So, Brud programmed my memories, claiming I’m from a place called Downey.  It’s right in-between Los Angeles and Disneyland.  Even though that sounds like a dream to me, I had to come check it out for myself..."|website=Instagram|accessdate=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
Miquela has released several singles since her debut with "Not Mine," including "You Should be Alone," "Over You," and a collaboration with [[Baauer]] titled "Hate Me." Her musical style is characterized by the use of [[auto-tune]] and [[trap music|trap]]-influenced production. Her music has been released on [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]]. Miquela's sound is purportedly based off of the soundtrack to Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic, [[Evil Dead]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15524">The entries in this tabulation cover some 150 years in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the private residents of [[Covent Garden]] included many people of rank and note. They ranged from [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|marquesses to barons]], foreign ambassadors and members of parliament to physicians, surgeons, antiquaries, artists, authors and dramatists. Some of the later arrivals were auctioneers, such as Christopher Cock and [[Abraham Langford]], who found rich sources for future sales amongst their neighbours.

The '''mermahuataur''' is a mythological creature created by graphic designer Jim Unwin and writer Dylan Carline.

It first appeared in their [[Euler diagram]] of [https://www.flickr.com/photos/preshaa/3847027500/ mythical creatures] that achieved significant popularity as an [[internet meme]] and in 2009 [http://theridiculant.metro.co.uk/2009/08/enter-the-mermahuataur.html appeared in print] in London's [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro newspaper]].

The mermahuataur, based on the combinations given in the mythical creature diagram, is farcically described as being 'half [[human]], half [[bull]], half [[narwhal]]'.

Since the publishing of the Euler diagram, the Mermahuataur has been imagined and drawn by various artists and designers. Notably, it is now part of the web-site for the [[PlayStation 3]] game, [[LittleBigPlanet (PlayStation 3)|LittleBigPlanet]]. It shows a mermahuataur drawn by [[Rex Crowle]] on its [https://web.archive.org/web/20110301080611/http://www.littlebigplanet.com/en/404/ HTTP 404 Error page].

A '''mononymous person''' is an individual who is known and addressed by a single name, or mononym.{{efn|From the [[Greek language|Greek]] μόνος, ''mónos'' ("single"), and ὄνομα, ''ónoma'' ("name"). [[Noun]]: "mononym"; [[adverb]]: "mononymously"; [[verb]]: "mononymize"; [[abstract noun]]: "mononymity".&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://wordsmith.org/awad/archives/0503|title=mononym|date=2003-05-06|publisher=A Word a Day|accessdate=2008-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|"[[Mononym]]" is defined in ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1989, volume IX, p. 1023) as "A term consisting of one word only […] Hence ''mononymic'' […] a[djective], consisting of a mononym or mononyms; ''mononymy'' […], a mononymic system; ''mononymize'' v[erb], to convert into a mononym; whence ''mononymization''."  The term is attested in the English language as early as 1872.}} In some cases, that name has been selected by the individual, who may have originally been given a [[:Wiktionary:polynym|polynym]] ("multiple name"). In other cases, it has been determined by the custom of the country{{efn|For example, [[Javanese name]]s traditionally are mononymic.}} or by some interested segment. In the case of historical figures, it may be the only one of the individual's names that has survived and is still known today.

== Antiquity ==
[[File:King Narmer.jpg|thumb|Narmer]]

The structure of persons' names has varied across time and geography. In some societies, individuals have been mononymous, receiving only a single name. [[Alulim]], first king of [[Sumer]], is one of the earliest names known; [[Narmer]], an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]], is another. In addition, Biblical names were typically mononymous, as were names in the surrounding cultures of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. 

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] names also follow the pattern, with [[epithet]]s (similar to second names) only used subsequently by historians to avoid confusion, as in the case of [[Zeno the Stoic]] and [[Zeno of Elea]]; likewise, [[patronymic]]s or other biographic details (such as [[Polis|city]] of origin, or another city the individual was associated with, borough, occupation) were used to specify whom one was talking about, but these details were not considered part of the name.

A departure from this custom occurred, for example, among the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], who by the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] period and throughout the [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] period [[Tria nomina|used multiple names]]: a male citizen's name comprised three parts (this was mostly typical of the upper class, while others would usually have only two names): ''[[praenomen]]'' (given name), ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' (clan name) and ''[[cognomen]]'' (family line within the clan)&amp;nbsp;— the ''nomen'' and ''cognomen'' were almost always hereditary.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], ''Dictionary of the Bible'', p. 2060.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mononyms in other ancient cultures include the [[Celts|Celtic]] queen [[Boudica]] and the [[Numidia]]n king [[Jugurtha]]. However, the historical records of some of these figures are scanty or rely completely on the documentation of those outside the person's culture, so it is possible such figures may have had other names within their own cultures that have since been lost to history.

==Medieval uses==

===Europe===
During the [[early Middle Ages]], mononymity slowly declined, with northern and eastern Europe keeping the tradition longer than the south; an example is [[Edeko]], the [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic]] chieftain whose son ruled Italy as [[Flavius Odoacer]]. By the end of the period, surnames had become commonplace: [[Edmund Ironside]], for example, ruled England (although Ironside was an epithet added later in life), [[Brian Boru]] was [[High King of Ireland]], [[Kenneth MacAlpin]] had united Scotland, and even in [[Scandinavia]] surnames were taking hold. The [[Dutch Renaissance]] scholar and theologian [[Erasmus]] is a late example of mononymity; though sometimes referred to as "Desiderius Erasmus" or "Erasmus of Rotterdam", he was christened only as "Erasmus", after the [[martyr]] [[Erasmus of Formiae]].

===The Americas===
[[File:Pocahontas by Simon van de Passe 1616.jpg|thumb|Pocahontas]]

Between Columbus' arrival in the New World and the late 19th century, most{{cn|date=January 2017}} [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were mononymous. Examples include [[Moctezuma I|Moctezuma]] (Mexico, 1398–1469), [[Anacaona]] (Haiti, 1464–1504), [[Agüeybaná I|Agüeybaná]] (Puerto Rico, died 1510), [[Diriangen]] (Nicaragua, fl. 1520), [[Urracá]] (Panama, died 1531), [[Guamá]] (Cuba, died 1532), [[Atahualpa]] (Peru, 1497–1533), [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (Honduras, died 1537), [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]] (Chile, 1534–1557), [[Tamanaco]] (Venezuela, died 1573), [[Pocahontas]] (United States, 1595–1617), [[Auoindaon]] (Canada, fl. 1623), [[Cangapol]] (Argentina, fl. 1735), and [[Tecumseh]] (United States, 1768–1813). 

Uniquely, the Dutch-Seneca diplomat [[Cornplanter]] received both a [[Seneca language|Seneca-language]] mononym (Kaintwakon, roughly "corn-planter") from his mother and a given name and surname (John Abeel) from his father, and he used both throughout his life.  His later descendants, such as [[Jesse Cornplanter]], used "Cornplanter" as the family name instead of "Abeel". 

In the 19th century, most chiefs involved in the [[Apache Wars]] had mononym birth names, and some replaced those with mononymous nicknames: [[Geronimo]] (born Goyaałé), [[Victorio]] (born Beduiat), [[Cochise]], and so on.

==Post-medieval uses==
Since the medieval period, mononyms in the West have almost exclusively been used to identify people who already had surnames. These [[nickname]]s were either adopted by the persons themselves or conferred by contemporaries.

===France===
[[File:Pierre Mignard - Portrait de Jean-Baptiste Poquelin dit Molière (1622-1673) - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|Molière]]

Some French authors have shown a preference for mononyms. In the 17th century, the dramatist and actor Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622–73) took the mononym [[stage name]] [[Molière]].

In the 18th century, François-Marie Arouet adopted the mononym [[Voltaire]], for both literary and personal use, in 1718 after his imprisonment in Paris' [[Bastille]], to mark a break with his past. The new name combined several features. It was an [[anagram]] for a [[Latin]]ized version of his family [[surname]], "Arouet, l[e] j[eune]"; it reversed the syllables of the name of a family ''[[château]]'', Airvault; and it has implications of speed and daring through similarity to French expressions such as "voltige", "volte-face" and "volatile". "Arouet" would not have served the purpose, given that name's associations with "[[Breaking wheel#Metaphorical uses|roué]]" and with an expression that meant "for thrashing".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]], ''Sidetracks'', pp. 345–66; and "Voltaire's Grin", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', November 30, 1955, pp. 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century French author [[Marie-Henri Beyle]] used many [[pen name]]s, most famously the mononym Stendhal, adapted from the name of the little [[Prussia]]n town of [[Stendal]], birthplace of the German art historian [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], whom Stendhal admired.&lt;ref&gt;F.W.J. Hemmings, "Stendhal", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 25, p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 20th century, a fourth French writer, [[Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette]] (author of ''[[Gigi]]'', 1945), used her actual surname as her mononym pen name, Colette.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Marks, "Colette", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 7, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Some French actors and singers have used their given name or surname as a stage mononym.

===Other Europe===
[[File:Franz Gareis - Novalis.jpg|thumb|Novalis]]

In the 17th and 18th centuries, most Italian [[castrato]] singers used mononyms as stage names (e.g. [[Caffarelli (castrato)|Caffarelli]], [[Farinelli]]). The German writer, mining engineer and philosopher, Georg Friedrich Philipp Freiherr von Hardenberg (1772–1801), became famous as [[Novalis]]. 

The 19th-century Dutch writer Eduard Douwes Dekker (1820–87), better known by his mononymous pen name [[Multatuli]] (from the [[Latin]] ''multa tuli'', "I have suffered [or ''borne''] many things"), became famous for the satirical novel, ''Max Havelaar'' (1860), in which he denounced the abuses of [[colonialism]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]). In 2002 Multatuli was proclaimed by the Society for Dutch Literature to have been the most important Dutch writer of all time. 

The Dutch writer Jan Hendrik Frederik Grönloh (1882–1961) wrote under the pseudonym [[Nescio]] (Latin for "I don't know").

The 20th-century British author [[Hector Hugh Munro]] became known by his [[pen name]], Saki. In 20th-century Poland, the [[theater of the absurd|theater-of-the-absurd]] [[playwright]], novelist, [[Painting|painter]], photographer and [[History of philosophy in Poland#Twentieth century|philosopher]] [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]] after 1925 often used the mononymous pseudonym Witkacy, a [[conflation#Language|conflation]] of his surname (''Witkiewicz'') and [[middle name]] (''Ignacy'').&lt;ref&gt;"[[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz|Witkiewicz, Stanisław Ignacy]]", ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', pp. 747–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of visual artists, such as [[Michelangelo]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Rembrandt]], are commonly known by mononyms. The modern Russian artist [[Erté]] formed his mononymous [[pseudonym]] from the initials of his actual name, as did the Belgian comics writers [[Hergé]] and [[Jijé]].

Italian painter [[Bernardo Bellotto]], who is now ranked as an important and original painter in his own right, traded on the mononymous pseudonym of his uncle and teacher, Antonio Canal ([[Canaletto]]), in those countries—Poland and Germany—where his famous uncle was not active, calling himself likewise "Canaletto". Bellotto remains commonly known as "Canaletto" in those countries to this day.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Bernardo Bellotto|Bellotto, Bernardo]]", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 3, p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mononymity was represented in [[photography]], from that art's infancy, by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] (Gaspard-Félix Tournachon).

===North America===
The American writer of non-fiction and fiction, [[Rodney William Whitaker]] (1931–2005), is best known for some novels that he wrote under the mononym [[pen name]], Trevanian. The Armenian-Canadian [[portrait photographer]] [[Yousuf Karsh]] was commonly known as "Karsh of [[Ottawa]]".

==Royalty==
[[File:Emperor Akihito cropped Akihito 090710-1600b.jpg|thumb|[[Akihito]], [[Emperor of Japan]]]]

[[Monarch]]s and other [[Royal family|royalty]], for example [[Napoleon]], have traditionally availed themselves of the [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] of using a mononym, modified when necessary by an [[regnal number|ordinal]] or [[epithet]] (e.g., Queen [[Elizabeth II]] or [[Charles the Great]]). This is not always the case: King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] of Sweden has two names. While many European royals have formally sported [[Personal names#Feudal names|long chains]] of names, in practice they have tended to use only one or two and not to use [[surname]]s.{{efn|The names of a few European kings ''have'' included surname&amp;nbsp;— for example, those of most of Poland's [[Monarchs of Poland|elected kings]], such as [[Stefan Batory|Stefan ''Batory'']].&lt;ref&gt;"Stephen Báthory", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', vol. 3, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In Japan, the emperor and his family have no surname, only a given name, such as [[Hirohito]], which in practice in Japanese is rarely used: out of respect and as a measure of politeness, Japanese prefer to say "the Emperor" or "the Crown Prince".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wetzler, ''Hirohito and War: Imperial Tradition and Military Decision-Making in Prewar Japan'', preface, University of Hawaii Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8248-1166-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following an Emperor's death or retirement, he is renamed according to the era of his reign. In India, the first six [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors were known by just one name, adopted by each emperor upon his accession.

[[Roman Catholic]] [[pope]]s have traditionally adopted a single, [[regnal name]] upon their [[List of papal elections|election]] (except for [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]] and [[Pope John Paul II|II]]). The mononymous tradition reverted to form with the election and succession of Pope [[Benedict XVI]] in 2005 and [[Pope Francis]] in 2013.

==Modern times==

===Mononym-normal===
The Western practice of combining a given name (Christian name or [[given name|forename]]) with a family name ([[surname]]) is not universal.

Surnames were introduced in [[Turkey]] only after [[World War I]], by that country's first president, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], as part of his westernizing and modernizing program.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Siwmir, "''Nieziemska ziemia''" ("An Unearthly Land"), ''[[Gwiazda Polarna]]'' [The Pole Star]: ''America's oldest independent Polish-language newspaper'', Stevens Point, Wisconsin, vol. 100, no 18, August 29, 2009, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  His own surname, Atatürk, which was bestowed by the Turkish parliament, means "Father Turk". Common people can be addressed semi-formally by their given name plus the title [[Bey]] or [[Khanum|Hanım]] (without surname), whereas politicians are often known by surname only ([[Bülent Ecevit|Ecevit]], [[Süleyman Demirel|Demirel]]). Many Turkish sportspeople, especially football players, wear jerseys with only their first name.

Mononyms are also common in Indonesia for [[Javanese name|Javanese individual]]s, both prominent government figures such as former presidents [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]] and commoners such as [[Triyatno]].

Most Icelanders do not have surnames, only [[patronymics]] (sometimes [[matronymic]]s), and they address each other by given name, even in formal situations.

===Asia===
In modern times, in countries that have long been part of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] (Japan, [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]] and China itself), mononyms are rare. An exception pertains to the [[Emperor of Japan]] (a common opinion being that there is no state{{huh|date=September 2018}} to give the [[Japanese name|family name]] ({{lang|ja|苗字}}) to the Emperor). 

Mononyms are common as [[stage name]]s in the [[entertainment industry]], usually when the performer's legal name is not publicly known; e.g., [[Ayaka]], [[Becky (television personality)|Becky]], [[Gackt]], [[Hide (musician)|hide]], [[Hyde (musician)|Hyde]], [[Mana (Japanese musician)|Mana]], [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]], [[Miyavi]], [[Tsunku]], and [[Yui (singer)|Yui]]. Also, Japanese baseball star [[Ichiro Suzuki]] is widely known in both Japan and North America as "Ichiro". In [[Hong Kong]], a few musicians are also known by mononyms, e.g., [[Janice Vidal|Janice]],&lt;ref name="CDbook"&gt;All Janice Vidal albums are credited mononymously as "Janice".{{Cite book

Mononyms continue to be used in parts of India, especially the South. [[Mayawati]], former [[Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh|Chief Minister]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], chooses to use only a single name. Several Indian film personalities, such as [[Asin]], [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]], [[Rekha]], [[Kajol]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Rajnikanth]], and [[Pran (actor)|Pran]],  are also mononymous. [[Govindjee]], Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Plant Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an Indian-American and an authority on photosynthesis, publishes his research under his singular name. In the northeastern India state of Mizoram, most people have a single name, mostly of three syllables (e.g., Lalthansanga, Thangrikhuma, Zorinmawia).  Everyone also has a tribal or clan name inherited from their father, but they do not include it in their official name.

Mononyms are also common in [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Javanese name]]s. In some cases, such as those of former Presidents [[Sukarno]] and [[Suharto]], the mononym is the full legal name. Other mononyms, such as [[Rossa (singer)|Rossa]], [[Chrisye]] and [[Tohpati]], are stage names taken from a nickname or are part of the full name.

Single names still also occur in [[Tibet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4607454.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Tibets most famous woman blogger Woeser detained by police | first=Jane | last=MacArtney | date=August 26, 2008 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mongolia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Most [[Afghanistan|Afghans]] have no [[surname]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Public Radio]] report of 18 May 2009 about civilian Afghan victims of U.S. [[Drone aircraft|drone-aircraft]] bombings in the U.S.-[[Taliban]] war.

In [[Thailand]], people usually address each other in informal situations by nicknames ({{lang-th|ชึ่อเล่น|translit=chue-len}}). Given by parents or relatives in early childhood, these nicknames are typically one syllable (or worn down from two syllables to one). They may often be nonsense words or humorous, and usually have no relation to the person's actual name, although in some cases may be diminutive forms of their first name, like "Nok" for "Noknoi" which means respectively bird and little bird, the first used as nickname and the second being the first name. All Thais have such a name, even the [[Thai royal family|royal family]], and they are freely used in everyday life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Mononyms are common in [[Myanmar]]. [[U Thant]], a Myanmar diplomat, was the third [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] (1961–71).  "U" is an honorific in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], roughly equal to "Mr". "''Thant''" was his only name, per local convention. In Myanmar, he was known as ''Pantanaw U Thant'', in reference to his hometown, [[Pantanaw]].

In the [[Near East]]'s [[Arab]] world, the Syrian poet Ali Ahmad Said Esber (born 1930) at age 17 adopted the mononym pseudonym, [[Adunis]], sometimes also spelled "Adonis".  A perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in literature, he has been described as the greatest living poet of the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jan/27/adonis-syrian-poet-life-in-writing|title=Adonis: a life in writing|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=27 January 2012|accessdate=27 January 2012|quote=each autumn is credibly tipped for the Nobel in literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The West===
In the West, mononymity, as well as its use by royals in conjunction with titles, has been primarily a privilege of [[celebrity|famous]] persons such as prominent writers, [[artist]]s, [[entertainer]]s, musicians and [[athlete]]s.{{efn|"A mononym is a name consisting of a single word. They are generally favored by celebrities of sufficient stature to be identified in this way, such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Pelé]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/mononym] "Mononym", on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|A [[Paris Hilton]] [[lookalike]], [[Chantelle Houghton]], nicknamed "[[Paris Travelodge]]", became famous "for not being famous" after winning an extraordinary ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. Lucy Rock writes: "It is a select band. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]], [[Pelé]], [[Thalía]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]... even, possibly, [[Katie Price|Jordan]].&lt;!--She now uses her real name.--&gt; People who wear their fame with such confidence that they have dispensed with the... concerns of having more than one name. They are the '''mononym brigade'''. Now there is one more.... Chantelle is... the apotheosis of that celebrity narrative that first gave us people who were famous for being good at something. Then came the people who were famous for simply... being famous. Now there is Chantelle, who is famous for not being famous at all."&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Rock, "From Nobody Much to Someone Special", ''[[The Observer]]'', January 29, 2006 [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/29/broadcasting.bigbrother]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some persons, such as the artists [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent]] and [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]], the sculptor [[Chryssa]], and the singer-songwriter [[Basia]], have had polynymous names that were unwieldy, or unfamiliar and difficult to remember or to pronounce in the community in which they were currently active, but have not wanted to entirely change their names to something more familiar to the broad public at the cost of abandoning their sense of [[self-identification]], and so have used only a single part of their full names.

The case of the Icelandic musician [[Björk]] is similar, but her use of a single name also has roots in her native culture. Like most Icelanders, she [[Icelandic name|has no family name]]; the second part of her full name is a patronymic.  In her case, ''Björk Guðmundsdóttir'' literally translates to "''Björk, Guðmund's daughter''". Icelanders generally address one another solely by given names even in formal settings.

Some mononym stage names are the performer's [[given name]] (e.g., [[Cheryl (singer)|Cheryl]], [[Zendaya]], [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], [[Selena]], [[Cher]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Beyoncé]]) while others may be the performer's [[middle name]] (e.g., [[Rihanna]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]), or [[surname]] (e.g. [[Liberace]], [[Mantovani]], [[Morrissey]]). Some mononym stage names are invented (e.g.  [[Eminem]], [[P!nk]], [[Lorde]]), adopted words (e.g. [[Capucine]], French for "[[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]]") or nicknames (e.g., [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Bono]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]).

In [[Lusophone]] countries such as [[Portugal]], [[Cape Verde]] and especially [[Brazil]], football players often adopt a mononym (e.g. [[Pelé]], [[Nani]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Eusébio]], [[Marta (footballer)|Marta]]&lt;!-- four examples (2 x nicknames + 2 x given names) is plenty - please discuss on the talk page before changing the examples used - thanks --&gt;). In Spain, mononyms for football players are also very common; they include the player's first name ([[Xavi]], [[Sergi Barjuán|Sergi]], [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]]), derivations of the player's surname ([[Ferran Corominas|Coro]], [[Guti (footballer)|Guti]]), derivations of the player's first name ([[Juanfran (footballer, born 1985)|Juanfran]], [[Kiko (Spanish footballer)|Kiko]]), diminutives ([[Juanito (footballer, born 1976)|Juanito]], [[Mista (footballer)|Mista]]), and nicknames ([[Míchel (footballer)|Michel]], [[Arteaga (footballer)|Arteaga]], [[Arzu (footballer)|Arzu]]). Because there are a few very common surnames in Spain (García, Pérez, López, Hernández), the use of mononyms makes it easier to distinguish between the many Garcías and Pérezes on each team. Mononyms are occasionally used by players from other countries, for example the [[Venezuela]]n [[Miku (footballer)|Miku]], the [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] [[Gervinho]] and the [[Serbia]]n-born [[United States|American]] [[Preki]]. Mononyms can be seen in other sports in these countries, with examples including Brazilian basketball players [[Hortência Marcari|Hortência]] and [[Nenê]].

Also in Brazil, former president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] is known as "Lula", a nickname he officially added to his full name. Such mononyms, which take their origin in [[given name]]s, [[surname]]s or [[nickname]]s, are used because [[Portuguese names]] tend to be rather long.

The [[comedian]] and [[illusionist]] [[Teller (entertainer)|Teller]], the silent half of the duo [[Penn &amp; Teller]], has legally changed his original polynym, Raymond Joseph Teller, to the mononym "Teller" and possesses a [[United States passport]] issued in that single name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/home/2007-11-15-teller-at-home_N.htm|title=At home: Teller's magical Vegas retreat speaks volumes|work=[[USA Today]]|author=della Cava, Marco R.|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2012/04/12/penn-and-teller-gerard-bakardy-rose-shadows-trick/|title=Penn &amp; Teller: Rogue Magician Is EXPOSING Our Secrets!!!|publisher=[[TMZ.com]]|date=2012-04-12|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional wrestler [[The Ultimate Warrior|Warrior]] (born James Hellwig) legally changed his name to the mononym "Warrior" in an effort to boost his standing in a trademark dispute with his employer, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]]. His children now use the Warrior name (as opposed to Hellwig) as their surname. [[Chyna]] did likewise when the [[World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.|now-WWE]] attempted to restrict her use of the name in pornographic titles; reports conflict as to whether she changed it back to her birth name, Joan Laurer, before she died.

Some have selected their mononym themselves, when they have been able to do so, because of its distinctiveness.  Others have come to be known by a mononym that has been applied to them by some segment of the public. [[Oprah Winfrey]], famed American talk show host, is usually referred to by only her first name, Oprah. The public has referred to President [[George W. Bush]] by the mononym "Dubya" ([[eye dialect]] of "W"), to distinguish from his father, President [[George H.W. Bush|George (H.W.) Bush]].

Both mechanisms contributed in the case of [[Hillary Clinton]], who has been called, and has publicly called herself, "Hillary". [[Peter Funt]], of ''[[Candid Camera]]'', wrote in a February 21, 2007 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[op-ed]] piece, "The Mononym Platform": "Someone has apparently decided that Mrs. Clinton will be the first major single-name candidate since 1952, when [[Dwight Eisenhower|Ike's]] P.R. gurus realized that 'Eisenhower' was tough to fit on a bumper sticker. ... In an apparent attempt to model her marketing on the likes of Madonna, Beyoncé and Cher, Mrs. Clinton's site proclaimed: 'Today, Hillary took the first step...'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/opinion/21funt.html The Mononym Platform] ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Hillary Clinton published in [[Salon.com]], the interviewer acknowledged receiving reader accusations of sexism whenever he referred to Clinton in print as "Hillary" (in contrast with male candidates who were almost always referred to by their last names), although he stated it was primarily to avoid confusion with her husband, President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/06/18/hillary_interview|title=Hillary's hard-won experience

Examples of mononyms also exist in modern popular culture. For instance, some characters on the [[NBC]] television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' are referred to only by their last names as a mononym, most prominently: [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]], played by [[Michael Richards]], and [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]], played by [[Wayne Knight]]. Newman's name is clearly a true mononym, in that his first name (or possibly last name) is never used or even revealed. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, is revealed to the other characters and the audience, and so his name could be seen as less of a mononym. However, this does not occur until the show's sixth season, and after the revelation he is still referred to as Kramer.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Switch (Seinfeld)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} Additionally, on the [[ABC Studios|ABC]] television sitcom [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Home Improvement'']], the character Wilson, played by [[Earl Hindman]], a next-door neighbor of the central characters, is only referred to as Wilson. His full name, Wilson Wilson, is not revealed until the fourth season.

'''Name change''' generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.

A [[pseudonym]] is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one's name==
* Marriage or civil partnership. 
* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment|harassing]] person.
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g. old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)
* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])
* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g. changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).
* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).
* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],&lt;ref name="BBCBrown1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm "Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), "Sport: Fun and Games" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])
* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g. old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])
* To make their name more attractive or "catchy" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])
* To change legal name to one used in everyday life, (e.g. where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])

==United States==
In the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.

Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324–9}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.

Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.
* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.

Under the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.

To maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The "open and notorious" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,&lt;ref&gt;''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.&lt;/ref&gt; unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]] the "usage method" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).&lt;/ref&gt; Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, "Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name." Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a "preferred name" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student [[ID card]]s.  It provides a "transitional"
name change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? — University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official registration===
A legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for passports), the [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Selective Service System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Although state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; [[Arizona]] is one of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/faqs/scripts/faqs.asp?section=dl#1|title=Motor Vehicle Services|work=azdot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information#NameorAddressChanges {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228092155/http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202553/http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a name change be registered with their office within ten days. [[Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/rules_of_the_road/rr_chap01.html#changing_name_address] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427004533/http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/rules_of_the_road/rr_chap01.html#changing_name_address|date=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/administration/driver_licensing_control/faq/answers_dl_id.htm#q18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012023946/http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/administration/driver_licensing_control/faq/answers_dl_id.htm#q18|date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmv.vermont.gov/licenses/change-name-address|title=Change Address or Name on Your License – Department of Motor Vehicles|website=dmv.vermont.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; require it be registered within 30&amp;nbsp;days, while [[North Carolina]] allows up to 60&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.org/dmv/driver_services/drivershandbook/chapter1/renewalLicense.html#RDNameChanges|title=NCDOT: License and ID|work=[[North Carolina Department of Transportation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] requires visiting a local motor vehicle office to change the name on all records and documents, but without a definite deadline to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmv.ny.gov/dmvfaqs.htm#name|title=New York State DMV|work=New York State DMV|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626065446/http://www.dmv.ny.gov/dmvfaqs.htm#name|archivedate=2012-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fees for registering a new name vary from state to state. The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that "documentary evidence" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are "matters of fact", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

People whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; See also [[College of Arms#Change of names]].

====Historical usage====
{{See also|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}
From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a Royal Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the "[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]", even the "triple-barrelled" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy "[[squirearchy]]" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

Well known examples are:
*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.
*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715–1786) (c.1714–1786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].

===Scotland===
People whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.

==Other common law countries==

=== Australia ===
Individuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries – australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name – Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as banks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Passports Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.

If a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or "Change of Name Certificate".  These certificates are recognised secure [[Identity documents of Australia|identity documents]] and can be verified electronically through the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|title=Document Verification Service|first=Attorney-General's|last=Department|website=www.ag.gov.au|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their [[Marriage Certificate]] as verification of the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programs.alberta.ca/Living/5962.aspx?Ns=364+6228&amp;N=770|title=Government of Alberta – Programs and Services – Getting Married|author=Government of Alberta|work=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[New Brunswick]], [[Canadians]] must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In [[British Columbia]], Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] 16.) People younger than the province's [[age of majority]] can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a [[common law marriage]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124142/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html|date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] need [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprints]] to be submitted before one changes their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023224732/http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx|date=October 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcvc.ca/docs/How%20do%20I%20change%20my%20name.pdf|title=How do I change my name?|format=PDF|work=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a person earns their name by "use and repute". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or [[Legal aspects of transgenderism#Republic of Ireland|legally changing gender]], a [[deed of change of name]] must be registered with the [[Four Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html|title=Changing to your preferred gender|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, [[New Zealanders]] can change their name by making a [[statutory declaration]] and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
In general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Belgium===
In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arrêté royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren ("born naked"), and Clooten ("sods of earth" in Middle Dutch, but "testicles" in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
According to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: 
* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  
* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&amp;nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  
* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  
* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  
* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.

===India===
In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.&lt;ref&gt;http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Although it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621060551/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183553/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archivedate=February 12, 2012|website=census.gov.ph|title= Civil Registration – Primer for RA 9048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9048.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, [[Philippines]] [[jurisprudence]] requires full-blown court [[lawsuit]], that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rulesofcourtspecialproceedings.htm#RULE%20108|title=SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], to change his [[birth certificate]] name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=August 8, 2014|title=Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041937/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|title=Woman's body 'naturally' became male|work=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
Although as in other jurisdictions residents of [[Quebec]] may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.

Only a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] such as [[adoption]].

This has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative [[transgender]] woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne Hélène Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a "good and sufficient reason" for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997). South African Department of Home Affairs. Retrieved May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] government, if there are important reasons (''wichtige Gründe'' / ''justes motifs'') for the change, according to article 30 of the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}
In [[Taiwan]], the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the [[s:Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act|Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act]] (姓名條例施行細則).

Legally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of the Name Act (1953) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國42年)|姓名條例 (民國42年)]]), amended into Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國90年)|姓名條例 (民國90年)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name when serving in an institution or studying in the same school.
#Since 1983, having the same name as one's parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 2 of Article 6 of the Name Act (1983) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國72年)|姓名條例 (民國72年)]]), amended into Clause 2 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change on religious conversion==
{{further|Religious name}}
Adherents of various religions change their name upon [[Religious conversion|conversion]] or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Emmelhainz, [http://works.bepress.com/emmelhainz/4/ ''Naming a New Self: Identity Elasticity and Self-Definition in Voluntary Name Changes.''] (c. 2012). Names, Vol. 60, Iss. 3. Retrieved April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new "[[Dharma name]]", which marks their "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]]".

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on [[baptism]] or (in some countries) [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082432/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm|date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a [[religious institute]] take on a [[name in religion]] is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].
*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].
:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means "son of Abdullah", or ''bint Abdullah'' means "daughter of Abdullah". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.

===Judaism===
* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name – Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym "ben/bat Avraham Avinu" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some wiccans have a [[Craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16144">[[Image:Neun gute helden rathaus koeln.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The thirteenth century carving "Nine Good Heroes" (known as "''Neun Gute Helden''" in the original German) at [[Cologne City Hall|City Hall]] in [[Cologne, Germany]], is the earliest known representation of the Nine Worthies. From left to right are the three Christians: Charlemagne bearing an eagle upon his shield, King Arthur displaying three crowns, and Godfrey of Bouillon with a dog lying before him; then the three pagans: Julius Caesar, Hector, and Alexander the Great bearing a griffon upon his shield; and lastly the three Jews: David holding a sceptre, Joshua, and Judas Maccabeus.]]

The '''Nine Worthies''' are nine historical, scriptural, and legendary personages who personify the ideals of [[chivalry]] established in [[the Middle Ages]], whose lives were deemed a valuable study for aspirants to chivalric status. All were commonly referred to as '[[Prince]]s', regardless of their historical titles. In French they are called ''Les Neuf Preux'' or "Nine Valiants",&lt;ref&gt;''Larousse Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise'' Lexis, 1993: ''Brave, Vaillant''&lt;/ref&gt; giving a more specific idea of the moral virtues they exemplified: those of soldierly courage and generalship.  In Italy they are ''i Nove Prodi''.

The Nine Worthies include three pagans ([[Hector]], [[Alexander the Great]], and [[Julius Caesar]]), three Jews ([[Joshua]], [[David]], and [[Judas Maccabeus]]) and three Christians ([[King Arthur]], [[Charlemagne]], and [[Godfrey of Bouillon]]).

==Origin==
[[File:Nurembergworthies.jpg|thumb|right|Statues of the Nine Worthies on the [[Schöner Brunnen|Schöne Brunnen]] (beautiful fountain) in [[Nuremberg]] (1385-1396). Visible on the fountain, l to r are: Judas Maccabeus, David (with harp), Julius Caesar, Alexander. The figure in the left foreground, [[Mark the Evangelist|St Mark]], with his lion, is part of another group]]

[[File:Hans Burgkmair d. Ä. Drei heidnische Helden.jpg|thumb|right|''The Three Good Pagans'': [[Hector]], Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, from the woodcut series by [[Hans Burgkmair]], 1519.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Alexander—Attributed coat of arms of Gaius Julius Caesar—2011.png|thumb|right|The Nine Worthies were each attributed a coat of arms during the European mediaeval period. Julius Caesar was attributed a black two-headed eagle on a gold shield.]] --&gt;

They were first described in the early fourteenth century, by [[Jacques de Longuyon]] in his ''Voeux du Paon'' (1312).&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]], ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', (1919) 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; Their selection, as [[Johan Huizinga]] pointed out, betrays a close connection with the [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance genre of chivalry]]. Neatly divided into a triad of triads, these men were considered to be paragons of chivalry within their particular traditions, whether [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], or [[Christianity|Christian]]. Longuyon's choices soon became a common theme in the literature and art of the Middle Ages and earned a permanent place in the popular consciousness. The medieval "craving for symmetry"&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; engendered female equivalents, the ''neuf preuses'', who were sometimes added, though the women chosen varied. [[Eustache Deschamps]] selected "a group of rather bizarre heroines"&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; selected from fiction and history, among them [[Penthesilea]], [[Tomyris]], [[Semiramis]]. Literature and suites of [[tapestry]] featured the full complement of eighteen, whose allegorical figures preceded [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI of England]] in his triumphal [[royal entry]] to Paris, 1431.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt; A "tenth worthy"&lt;ref&gt;Compare the concept of the "[[Muse#The "tenth Muse"|Tenth Muse]]".&lt;/ref&gt; was added by Deschamps, in the figure of [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], the Breton knight to whom France owed recovery from the battles of [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy (1346)]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers (1356)]]. [[Francis I of France]] still occasionally paraded himself at court dressed in the "antique mode" to identify himself also as one of the ''Neuf Preux''.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1924:61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1459 [[Ingeram Codex]] presents the coat of arms of the Nine Worthies among a larger list of [[attributed arms]] of exemplary individuals, as the three "better Jews", "best pagans" and "best Christians"&lt;!--sic, pp. 28-30 File:Ingeram Codex 028.jpg --&gt; alongside the arms attributed to three heroes of [[King David]] (glossed as "the first coats of arms"), the [[Three Magi]],  the "three mildest princes", the "three worst tyrants" ([[Nebuchadnezzar]], [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochos Epiphanes]] and [[Nero]]),  "three patient ones" ([[Alfonso X of Castile|Alphonse the Wise]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] and [[Saint Eustachius]]), "three anointed kings"  (France, Denmark and Hungary) and "three noble dynasties" ([[Louis XI of France]], called "Louis the Prudent" as [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], and [[Otto III, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] of the [[House of Welf]]).

==Symbolism==
As a group, the nine worthies represent all facets of the perfect chivalrous warrior. All, with the exception of Hector, are conquering heroes. (Despite Arthur's later downfall, historical and literary texts record his early conquests in Britain and on the Continent). Those not royal were presumed to come from knightly families. All lived in the pre-[[Heraldry|heraldic]] era, and [[attributed arms]] were invented for them, as in [[Lucas van Leyden]]'s engraving. All brought glory and honor to their nations and were noted for their personal prowess in arms. As individuals, each displayed some outstanding quality of chivalry which made them exemplars of knighthood. That the nine individual figures were generally not distinguished, iconographically, with respect to relative antiquity or ethnicity, would suggest that the virtues that they manifest are to be understood as timeless and universal.

==Classification==
The Nine Worthies comprise a triad of triads as follows:

===Pagans===
*[[Hector]]
*[[Alexander the Great]]
*[[Julius Caesar]]

===Jews===
*[[Joshua]]
*[[David]]
*[[Judas Maccabeus]]

===Christians===
*[[King Arthur]]
*[[Charlemagne]]
*[[Godfrey of Bouillon]]

==Cultural references==

===Literature===
The Nine Worthies were also a popular subject for [[masque]]s in [[Renaissance]] Europe. In [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' the comic characters attempt to stage such a masque, but it descends into chaos. The list of Worthies actually named in the play include two not on the original list, [[Hercules]] and [[Pompey the Great]]. Alexander, Judas Maccabaeus, and Hector also appear on stage before the show collapses into complete disorder. The worthies are also mentioned in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' in which [[Doll Tearsheet]] is so impressed by [[Falstaff]]'s bravery in fighting [[Ancient Pistol]] that she says he is "as valorous as Hector of Troy, worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than the Nine Worthies".&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William, ''Henry IV, Part 2'', Act 2, Scene 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Quixote]] evokes the Nine Worthies in Volume I, Chapter 5, telling a peasant (who is trying to get him to admit who he is) "I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done all together and each of them on his own account".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Don Quixote/Volume 1/Chapter V|Chapter V - In which the narrative of our knight's mishap is continued]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
The Nine Worthies had not devolved to folk culture even in the seventeenth century, for a frieze of the Nine Worthies, contemporary with Shakespeare's comedy, was painted at the outset of the seventeenth century at [[North Mymms|North Mymms Place, Hertfordshire]], an up-to-date house built by the Coningsby family, 1599.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brookmans.com/history/house/ch3.shtml North Mymms Park - A short history - Chapter 3 - Wall Paintings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Cloisters]], in New York City, has important portions of an early 15th-century tapestry series illustrating the surviving five of the Nine Worthies: King Arthur, Joshua, David, Hector, and Julius Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/the_cloisters/Tapestry_Fragment_from_the_Series_Five_Worthies_and/ViewObject.aspx?depNm=the_cloisters&amp;Title=Tapestry_Fragment_from_the_Series_Five_Worthies_and_&amp;pID=0&amp;kWd=hector&amp;OID=70008204&amp;vW=0&amp;Pg=1&amp;St=5&amp;StOd=1&amp;vT=2 King Arthur: Tapestry Fragment from the Series, Five Worthies and Attendant Figures (with 32.130.3a, b) | All | The Cloisters | Collection Database | Works of Art | The Metrop...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''I Nove Prodi'', a fresco by the ''Maestro del Castello della Manta'', an [[anonymous master]], painted c. 1420 in the ''sala baronale'' of the [[Castello della Manta]], Saluzzo, Italy. The series also includes depictions of their female counterparts.

[[Montacute House]] has sculptures of the Nine Worthies spaced along the upper eastern façade on the exterior of the long gallery [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. These figures are dressed in Roman armour.

==Nine Worthy Women==
In the late fourteenth century, Lady Worthies began to accompany the Nine Worthies, though usually not individualized and shown as anonymous [[Amazons|Amazon-styled warriors]]. In later years, nine of the "Most Illustrious Ladies of All Ages and Nations" were chosen from scripture, history and legend to be placed alongside their male counterparts, though the choices for the Lady Worthies were not usually standardized and often varied by region, author and artist.

[[File:Penthesilea as one of the Nine Female Worthie.jpg|thumb|left|[[Penthesilea]] as one of the Lady Worthies]]

[[Eustache Deschamps]] to the ''neuf preux'' adds ''neuf preuses'' (women), including [[Penthesilea]], [[Tomyris]], and [[Semiramis]]. Together with their male counterparts, they precede [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] as he enters Paris in 1431, and figure in ''[[Le Jouvencel]]''  (1466). The list of ''preuses'' was however less fixed, and not always structured in pagan, Jewish and Christian triads. [[Thomas III of Saluzzo]]&lt;ref&gt;''le chevalier errant'', Bibliothèque nationale, Paris, mss. Fr. 12559, fol. 125v; manuscript dated to 1403-04&lt;/ref&gt; has: ''[[Deipyle|Deiphille]], [[Sinope (mythology)|Synoppe]],  [[Hippolyte]], [[Melanippe|Menalyppe]], [[Semiramis]], [[Lampetho]], [[Tomyris|Thamarys]], [[Teuta]], [[Penthesilea|Penthésilée]]''.

A very fine set of [[Siena|Siennese]] fifteenth century panel paintings, attributed to the [[Master of the Griselda Legend]] and others, now incomplete and widely dispersed, showed male and female worthies - the remaining paintings were reunited in a 2007 exhibition at the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museopoldipezzoli.it/node/461 Artemesia in Milan], [http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=41612 David in NGA Washington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925142600/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=41612 |date=2008-09-25 }}, [http://www.aworldtowin.net/images/images255/RenaissanceW056.pr.jpg Alexander in Birmingham]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[German Renaissance]], [[Hans Burgkmair]] made a set of six [[woodcut]]s, each showing three of the "Eighteen Worthies". In addition to the usual males, his prints showed the Pagan [[Lucretia]], [[Veturia]] and [[Verginia|Virginia]], the Jewish [[Esther]], [[Judith]] and [[Yael]], and the Christian Saints [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], [[Bridget of Sweden]] and [[Elizabeth of Hungary]]. Burgkmair was in touch with [[Augsburg]] [[Renaissance Humanist]] circles, who may have helped choose the group. Apart from Veturia, mother of [[Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus|Coriolanus]], who tried to save Rome from defeat by her son, the other pagan two were examples of chastity, responsible for no heroic acts except their defence of their own virtue. In contrast, two of the Jewish women, Judith and Jael, are known for their personal assassination of leaders opposed to Israel. Judith carries a sword in one hand and [[Holofernes]]'s severed head in the other, and Jael carries the mallet with which she hammered a peg in the head of [[Sisera]]. The "[[Power of Women]]" and female violence was an interest of German artists at the time, and [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and others made prints of Jael in the act.&lt;ref&gt;H Diane Russell (ed), ''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints'', pp. 36-39, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990, {{ISBN|1-558-61039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian trio of saints, all very popular in Germany at the time, are all women who had been married - Bridget became an [[abbess]] as a widow. In addition, like three of the male worthies, Elizabeth of Hungary was an ancestor of Burgkmair's patron [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], and Helena was a Roman Empress. Unlike the other two groups, who all face each other, apparently in conversation, these three all look down, and may illustrate the female virtue of silence.&lt;ref&gt;(covers all Burgmair section)H Diane Russell;''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints''; Nos. 1, &amp; for Jael: 91, 92 National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990; {{ISBN|1-55861-039-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burgkmair's conception was not very widely followed.

==''Nine Worthies of London''==
{{further|Nine Worthies of London}}

''Nine Worthies of London'' is a book by Richard Johnson, written in 1592, that borrows the theme from the Nine Worthies. The book is subtitled ''Explaining the Honourable Excise of Armes, the Vertues of the Valiant, and the Memorable Attempts of Magnanimous Minds; Pleasaunt for Gentlemen, not unseemely for Magistrates, and most profitable for Prentises'', celebrated the rise of nine famous Londoners through society from the ranks of apprentices or commoners.

The nine were Sir [[William Walworth]], Sir [[Henry Picard (Lord Mayor of London)|Henry Pritchard]], Sir [[Thomas White (merchant)|Thomas White]], Sir [[William Sevenoke]], Sir [[John Hawkwood]], Sir John Bonham, Christopher Croker, Sir Henry Maleverer of Cornhill, and Sir Hugh Calverley.

The term "Nine Worthies" was later used to refer to nine of the privy councillors of [[William III of England|William III]]: [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|Devonshire]], [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset|Dorset]], [[Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough|Monmouth]], [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Edward Russell]], [[Peregrine Osborne, 2nd Duke of Leeds|Carmarthen]], [[Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Nottingham]], [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]], and [[John Lowther, 1st Viscount Lonsdale|Lowther]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2861">The '''Ogoni Nine''' were a group of nine activists from the [[Ogoni]] region of [[Nigeria]] who opposed the operating practices of the Royal Dutch Shell oil corporation. Their members included outspoken author and playwright [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel, and John Kpuine (Tripathi, p.189), who were executed by [[hanging]] in 1995 by the military dictatorship of General [[Sani Abacha]] and buried in [[Port Harcourt Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="cemetery1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/450161/NIGERIAS-MILITARY-LEADERS-HANG-PLAYWRIGHT-AND-8-OTHER-ACTIVISTS.html?pg=all|title=Nigeria's Military Leaders Hang Playwright And 8 Other Activists|work=Deseretnews.com|publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company|date=1995-11-11 |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The executions provoked international condemnation and led to the increasing treatment of Nigeria as a [[pariah state]] until General Abacha's mysterious death in 1998. Saro-Wiwa had previously been a critic of the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] oil corporation, and had been imprisoned for a year prior to the executions in November 1995.

At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony – in the presence of Shell’s lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiwavshell.org/the-case-against-shell/ The Case Against Shell] &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] sued Shell for its complicity in human rights abuses against the Ogoni people, such as colluding with the Nigerian government to bring about the arrest and execution of the Ogoni Nine. In June 2009, on the eve of trial, the parties agreed to a settlement providing a total of $15.5 million to compensate the plaintiffs, establish a trust for the benefit of the Ogoni people, and cover some of the legal costs and fees associated with the case.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/today-we-remember-the-ogoni-nine-executed-for-struggling-against-shell-in-nigeria/ "Today We Remember the Ogoni Nine, Executed for Struggling Against Shell in Nigeria"], Activist Defense, November 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oriflamme''' (from Latin ''aurea flamma'', "golden flame") was the [[battle standard]] of the [[King of France]] in the Middle Ages. It was originally the sacred banner of the [[Abbey of St. Denis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenophongroup.com/montjoie/orifl-fa.htm Oriflamme Society]&lt;/ref&gt; a monastery near Paris. When the oriflamme was raised in battle by the French royalty during the Middle Ages, most notably during the [[Hundred Years War]], no prisoners were to be taken until it was lowered. Through this tactic they hoped to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy, especially the nobles, who could usually expect to be taken alive for ransom during such military encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Southey (1841) '' Joan of Arc: a poem'', Longman et autres. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TPRAhDvWDrwC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=oriflamme+no+quarter+given&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k7Nfv2vzz-&amp;sig=v2VEcfsGqIA6hlWsT62p_Jgrodg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAmoVChMIo6Du2dmMxwIVBL1yCh38WwSD#v=onepage&amp;q=oriflamme%20no%20quarter%20given&amp;f=false p. 280]&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the term "''oriflamme''" has come to mean any banner with pointed ends; by association with the form of the original.

The  Oriflamme was mentioned in the eleventh-century ballad the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'' (vv. 3093-5) as a royal banner, first called ''Romaine'' and then ''Montjoie''.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt; According to legend, [[Charlemagne]] carried it to the Holy Land in response to a prophecy regarding a knight possessing a golden lance, from which flames would burn and drive out the [[Saracens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Distant Mirror |last=Tuchman |first=Barbara |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1978|publisher=Penguin |location= |isbn=0140054073 |page=148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the ''lance'' was originally the important object, with the banner simply a decoration, but this changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/oriflamm.htm Heraldica.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Oriflamme was first used by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] in 1124 and was last flown in battle at Agincourt in 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Barber (1984) ''The Penguin guide to medieval Europe'', Penguin Books. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9MYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;dq=Oriflamme+Agincourt+no+quarter&amp;pgis=1 p. 224]&lt;/ref&gt; though a version of it remained in the Abbey of St. Denis until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Book of Heraldry|last=Slater |first=Stephen |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Hermes House |location= |isbn=1846819601 |page= 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis VI replaced the earlier banner of Saint Martin with the oriflamme of the Abbey of St. Denis, which floated about the tomb of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the abbey by king Dagobert.
Until the 12th century the standard-bearer was the [[Comte de Vexin]], who, as vowed to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the abbey. Louis VI, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as war began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the tomb of the saint to carry it to the combat.

It is recorded as having been carried at the following battles/campaigns:{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Appearance ==
The banner was red or orange-red silk and flown from a gilded lance.&lt;ref&gt;Slater (2002), p.33&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, its colour stems from it being dipped in the blood of the recently beheaded [[Denis|St. Denis]].

The surviving descriptions of the Oriflamme are in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the "Chronicle of Flanders" (fourteenth century), in the "Registra Delphinalia" (1456) and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536). They show that the primitive Oriflamme was succeeded in the course of the centuries by newer Oriflammes which bore little resemblance to one another except for their colour.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Oriflamme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance on the battlefield ==
When the Oriflamme was displayed on the battlefield it indicated that [[no quarter]]
was to be given, its red colour being symbolic of cruelty and ferocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The laws of War in the late Middle Ages |last=Keen |first=Maurice |authorlink=Maurice Keen |coauthors= |year=1965 |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |location= London|isbn= |page= |pages= 105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the azure ground (from the blue cope of [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]]) strewn with gold [[fleur-de-lis]] remained the symbol of royalty until the 15th century, the Oriflamme became the royal battle standard of the King of France, and it was carried at the head of the king's forces when they met another army in battle. In the fifteenth century, the fleur-de-lis on the white flag of [[Joan of Arc]] became the new royal standard replacing both the symbol of royalty and the Oriflamme on the battle field.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;&lt;!--cited for last sentence--&gt;

==Porte oriflamme==
The bearer of the standard, the ''porte-oriflamme'', became an [[Great Officers of the Crown of France|office]] (like that of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] or [[Constable of France|Constable]]) and a great honour, as it was an important and very dangerous job to take charge of such a visible symbol in battle.  If things went badly, the bearer was expected to die rather than relinquish his charge.

Froissart vividly describes ''porte-oriflamme'' Geoffroi de Charny's fall at the side of his king at the Battle of Poitiers in this passage:  &lt;blockquote&gt;“There Sir Geoffroi de Charny fought gallantly near the king (note: and his fourteen-year-old son). The whole press and cry of battle were upon him because he was carrying the king’s sovereign banner [the Oriflamme]. He also had before him his own banner, gules, three escutcheons argent. So many English and Gascons came around him from all sides that they cracked open the king’s battle formation and smashed it; there were so many English and Gascons that at least five of these men at arms attacked one [French] gentleman. Sir Geoffroi de Charny was killed with the banner of France in his hand, as other French banners fell to earth.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jean Froissart; trans Geoffrey Brereton, ''Chronicles'' ( Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, 1978), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Notable Bearers of the ''Oriflamme'' ===

{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}

*[[Geoffroi de Charny]] - 14th-century [[knight]] and author of several works on [[chivalry]].  He first bore the Oriflamme during the failed attempt to relieve Calais in 1347&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jonathon | last = Sumption |title=Trial by Fire |publisher=faber &amp; faber | year=2001 | isbn=0-571-20737-5 | page=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and died at [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] defending it.&lt;ref&gt;Green (2004), p.56&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Arnoul d'Audrehem]] - 14th-century former [[Marshal of France]].  He held the office from 1368 to his death in 1370 but never carried the banner in action.
*[[Guillaume de Martel]] - Seigneur de [[Bacqueville]]. He carried the Oriflamme at Agincourt and died there.&lt;ref&gt;Barker (2005), p.323&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sir Pierre de Villiers carried the Oriflamme at the [[Battle of Roosebeke]] against the Flemish rebels of Ghent led by [[Philip van Artevelde|Philip van Artvelde]] in 1382.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The Oriflamme in literature ==
The 19th-century poet [[Robert Southey]] refers to the Oriflamme and its reputation in his poem ''Joan of Arc''{{cquote|
:::::"Dark-minded man!"
:The Maid of Orleans answered, "to act well
:Brings with itself an ample recompense.
:I have not reared the oriflamme of death —
:Now God forbid! The banner of the Lord
:Is this; and, come what will, me it behooves,
:Mindful of Him whose minister I am,
:To spare the fallen foe: that gracious God
:Sends me a messenger of mercy forth,
:Sends me to save this ravaged realm of France,
:To England friendly as to all the world;
:Only to those an enemy, whose lust
:Of sway makes them the enemies of man."

'''Petiese''' (alt. '''Peteese''', '''Pediese''') was the name of a number of high ancient Egyptian officials who served the pharaohs during the seventh and sixth centuries BCE. Their family history is known from a petition (pRylands 9) which the priest Petiese (referred to below as Petiese III) wrote during the reign of [[Darius I of Persia]], although some have claimed that, rather than a real petition, this is a [[Ancient Egyptian literature|work of literature]] or at best a draft for a petition.

==The Petition of Petiese==
Petiese I, son of Ireturu, administered [[Upper Egypt]] jointly with his cousin Petiese, son of Ankhshesheq, who held the position of Ships Master. In 651 BCE he had his priestly offices confirmed by [[Psamtik I]], above all that of prophet of [[Amun]] of [[Al-Hibah|Teudjoi]]. After he had resigned from his powerful office of administrator of Upper Egypt, the priests of Teudjoi decided in 621 to wrest his priestly offices, which were well paid, from him and killed two of his grandsons. Pediese received police protection. He restored the fortunes of the temple at Teudjoi. Pediese's rights were inscribed on a stela. He signed over his prophet's portion to his son Wedjasematawi I.

In 591, Petiese II, son of Wedjasematawi I, accompanied [[Psamtik II]] on a campaign to Syria. While he was away, the priests of Teudjoi bribed an official and Petiese on his return lost his case against the priests in court.

After his death, his son Wedjasematawi II had to flee from Teudjoi as the priests tried to force him to sign over his rights to them. They destroyed his house in his absence, but had to pay a small compensation when Petiese III, the son of Wedjasematawi II, brought an action against them.

If the petition of Petiese III is to be believed there was little justice in the Egypt of his time and only bribery brought results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3722">'''Philip Bellino''' and '''Edward Gertson''' (both died May 9, 1947) were the last persons [[capital punishment|executed]] by [[Massachusetts]].

==The murder==

Bellino and Gertson were two gangsters convicted of [[murder]]ing nineteen-year-old Robert "Tex" Williams, a former [[U.S. Marine]]. On August 3, 1945, Williams led Bellino, Gertson and Charles Mantia to a [[New Hampshire]] [[summer camp]]. He had learned there would be an illegal dice game taking place in the camp. The four men would rob the players at gunpoint. Williams had lured his accomplices with a promise of easily stealing up to $10,000. Instead they escaped with "a few hundred dollars".&lt;ref name = rogers&gt;Alan Rogers, [http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bctwj/22_2/02_TXT.htm "Success—At Long Last: The Abolition of the Death Penalty in Massachusetts, 1928–1984"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trio was enraged at Williams. They also feared the younger man could squeal on them to the police. On August 7, 1945, the four of them shared a taxi ride in the vicinity of [[Boston]]. The taxi stopped at an isolated location, not far from the shore. Williams, Bellino and Gertson stepped out for a walk. Mantia waited in the taxi with the cab driver. Bellino and Gertson returned without Williams, claiming the young man would spend his night with a girlfriend.&lt;ref name = rogers/&gt;

Williams' corpse was soon after discovered. He had been shot in the back of the head. Mantia was the one to lead the police to Bellino and Gertson. James Salah, the cab driver, also became a witness for the prosecution. On June 18, 1946, the duo were found guilty of first-degree murder in a trial by jury. There were originally 14 jurors. Two of them had been dismissed prior to the final verdict. A legal argument that this violated the rights of the defendants was eventually rejected by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]]. A "mercy bill" discussed at the time in the [[Massachusetts General Court]] could have proven beneficial to the duo, but was vetoed by [[Robert F. Bradford]], [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|Governor of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name = rogers/&gt;

==Execution and abolition of death penalty in Massachusetts==
Both Bellino and Gertson were executed in the [[electric chair]] at the [[Massachusetts State Prison at Charlestown]] shortly after midnight on the night of May 8–9, 1947.

On April 3, 1951, Massachusetts enacted a "mercy bill" which removed the mandatory death sentence for murder in all cases except for murder committed in the course of rape or attempted rape. No further executions were carried out and in 1984 the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] ruled that capital punishment violated the [[constitution of Massachusetts|state constitution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4943">'''Production babies''' are children born to anyone involved in the making of a film during its [[filmmaking|production]]. The phrase generally refers to a section of the [[closing credits]] of films, listing the babies' [[given name]]s. The custom of publishing lists of production babies began with [[animated film]]s, and is still chiefly found in that genre, reflecting the influence of family experiences on storytelling in such films.&lt;ref name=sfgate2010/&gt;

The first list of production babies was included by [[Pixar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Jonathan|title=Cars|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tasmania/stories/s1664829.htm|work=Review|publisher=[[ABC Tasmania]]|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=June 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the credits of their first full-length movie ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0114709|Toy Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Unkrich]], a film director with Pixar, explains that the production team and [[film crew]] indelibly associate the birth of each of their children with the film they were working on at the time. The listing in the end credits becomes a way for them to share these essential memories more widely. "It's like our family lives are permanently woven into the movies."&lt;ref name=sfgate2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartlaub|first=Peter|title=Pixar delivers, babies get credit|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-06-13/entertainment/21907955_1_toy-story-john-lasseter-pixar|publisher=[[SFGate]]|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twists added in film credits include a list of "Chameleon Babies" at the end of the 2010 animated film ''[[Tangled]]'', born to the real-life model for the pet in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liu|first=Ed|title=A Virtual Roundtable with "Tangled" Co-Directors Byron Howard &amp; Nathan Greno|url=http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/36987/a-virtual-roundtable-with-tangled-co-directors-byron-howard-amp-nathan-greno|publisher=ToonZone.net|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=April 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822013323/http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/36987/a-virtual-roundtable-with-tangled-co-directors-byron-howard-amp-nathan-greno|archivedate=August 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 animated film ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' lists the names under "Pooh Babies," with the credit knitted on a piece of fabric by the character [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]].

[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film director [[Byron Howard]] cites the listing of production babies as a pointer to the depth of personal relationships established during collaboration on an animated movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hucks|first=Dustin|title=Interviews: The Cast of'' 'Tangled' ''Gets Unraveled|url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/interviews-the-cast-of-tangled-gets-unraveled.php|publisher=FilmSchoolRejects.com|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star next to a baby's name honors a baby who passed away before production was complete.

In 2009, [[Ari Folman]] dedicated his [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Award]] to the eight production babies born during the making of ''[[Waltz with Bashir]]'', an animated anti-war documentary, and expressed hope that their lives would have no contact with the realities of conflict depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's 'Waltz with Bashir,' on 1982 Lebanon War, wins Golden Globe for best foreign film|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-s-waltz-with-bashir-on-1982-lebanon-war-wins-golden-globe-for-best-foreign-film-1.267916|accessdate=January 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have noted that "production babies" credits indicate the creativity of film people in giving some unusual names to their children.&lt;ref name=sfgate2010/&gt;

An early, isolated instance in video games occurred with an [[Easter egg (media)#Software|easter egg]] message embedded in the ROM for the 1988 game ''Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball'' for Mattel [[Intellivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Production Baby|url=http://daddytypes.com/2013/01/15/the_first_production_baby.php |date=January 15, 2013 |publisher=DaddyTypes |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern custom spread to [[video game]] credits in the 2005 game ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'', and the 2009 game ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'', which also listed the other parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/credits|work=Credits|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=January 8, 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the list was changed to "Development Babies" in ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''. A number of other games have since done the same.

'''Qutalmish''' ({{lang-1ca|قُتَلمِش}}, {{lang-fa|قتلمش}}) (alternative spellings: '''Qutulmush''', '''Kutalmish''', {{lang|tr|'''Kutalmış'''}}) was a Turkic prince who was a member of Seljukid house in the 11th century. His son [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Kutalmışoglu Suleiman]], founded the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in what is now Turkey.

==Sultanate of Rûm==
Kutalmish was the son of [[Arslan Yabgu]] and a cousin of [[Tughril]] and played a vital role in the conquests of the [[Seljuq Turks]]. In 1046, he was sent with an army by Tughril to force back the Byzantine army at Ganja and was victorious.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker, ''The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna'', (Greenwood Publishing, 2000), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He supported a rebellion against Tughril and contested the succession to the throne with [[Alp Arslan]]. (''see'' [[Battle of Damghan (1063)]]) According to the historian [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], Kutalmish knew the sciences of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Institutionalisation of Science in the Medreses of pre-Ottoman and Ottoman Turkey'', Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, '''Turkish Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science''', Ed.

A '''regnal name''', or '''reign name''', is the name used by [[monarch]]s and [[pope]]s during their [[reign]]s and, subsequently, historically. Since ancient times, some monarchs have chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. 
 
The regnal name is usually followed by a [[regnal number]], written as a [[Roman numeral]], to differentiate that monarch from others who have used the same name while ruling the same realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]], [[George Tupou V]] of [[Tonga]]. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name. For example, the same person was both [[James VI and I|King James I of England and King James VI of Scotland]].

The ordinal is not normally used for the first ruler of the name, but is used in historical references once the name is used again. Thus, [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] of England was called simply "Elizabeth of England" until the accession of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] almost four centuries later in 1952; subsequent historical references to the earlier queen retroactively refer to her as Elizabeth I. However, [[Paul I of Russia|Tsar Paul I of Russia]], [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I of Italy]], [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]], and [[Pope John Paul I]] all used the ordinal I (first) during their reigns, while [[Pope Francis]] does not. In spoken English, such names are pronounced as "Elizabeth the First", "George the Sixth" etc.

In some countries in Asia, monarchs took or take [[Chinese era name|era names]]. While era names as such are not used in many monarchies, sometimes eras are named after a monarch (usually long-lived), or a succession of monarchs of the same name. This is customary; there is no formal or general rule. The whole period during which a succession of four Georges ([[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|II]], [[George III of Great Britain|III]], and [[George IV of Great Britain|IV]]) of the Hanoverian dynasty reigned in Great Britain became known as the [[Georgian era]]; although there were many Edwards, the [[Edwardian era]] always refers to the reign of [[Edward VII]] at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Monarchies==

===Ancient rulers===
{{Further|Throne name (Ancient Egypt)}}
Ancient rulers in many parts of the world took regnal names or throne names which were different from their personal name.  This is known to be true, for instance, of several kings of [[Assyria]], and appears to be the case for several Kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].  In [[Ancient Egypt]], Pharaohs took a number of names - the ''[[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary#(Throne name (praenomen)|praenomen]]'' being the most commonly used, on occasion in conjunction with their personal name.

=== Africa ===
==== Ethiopia ====
In the [[Ethiopian Empire]], especially during the [[Solomonic dynasty]], many [[List of Emperors of Ethiopia|Emperors]] would take a throne name, though this was not a general practice; a great number of rulers would remain known during their reign by their birth names. [[Yekuno Amlak of Ethiopia|Yekuno Amlak]], the founder of the Solomonic dynasty, took his father's name, Tasfa Iyasus, as his throne name. [[Yagbe'u Seyon of Ethiopia|Yagbe'u Seyon]], his son and heir, took the throne name [[Solomon|Salomon]] after the biblical figure. [[Amda Seyon I of Ethiopia|Amda Seyon]] took the throne name Gebre Mesqel, "slave of the [[Christian cross|cross]]"; [[Tewodros I of Ethiopia|Tewodros I]] was Walda Ambasa, "son of the lion"; [[Sarwe Iyasus]] was Mehreka Nañ "distributor of your [the [[Names of God|Lord]]'s] mercy"; etc. Tafari Makonnen, the last sovereign Emperor of Ethiopia, took as his throne name [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]], meaning "Power of the [[Trinity]]".

==== Nigeria ====
In the various extant [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of [[Nigeria]], the regnal names of the titled monarchs, who are known locally as the [[Nigerian traditional rulers|traditional rulers]], serve two very important functions within the monarchical system. Firstly, seeing as how most states are organised in such a way as to mean that ''all'' of the legitimate descendants of the first man or woman to arrive at the site of any given community are considered its dynastic [[heir]]s, their thrones are usually rotated amongst almost endless pools of contending cousins who all share the names of the founders of their houses as primary surnames. In order to tell them all apart from one another, secondary surnames are also used for the [[sept]]s of each of the royal families that are eligible for the aforementioned rotations, names that often come from the names of state of the first members of their immediate lineages to rule in their lands. Whenever any of their direct heirs ascend the thrones, they often use their septs' names as reign names as well, using the appropriate ordinals to differentiate themselves from  the founders of the said septs. An example of this is found in the kingdom of [[Lagos]], where the Adeniji-Adele family is distinguished from their numerous Adele cousins by the word ''Adeniji'', which was actually the first name of the reigning founder of their branch of the dynasty, the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] [[Adeniji Adele|Adeniji Adele II]]. This distinction notwithstanding, both groups of [[dynast]]s (as well as a number of other ones that don't have the name Adele as an official surname, such as that of the Oloye Adekunle Ojora, a prominent nobleman of royal descent) are part of what is known as the Adele Ajosun Ruling House of Lagos.

Beyond that which is described above, regnal names also serve in Nigeria and indeed in much of Africa as chronological markers in much the same way that those of Europe do (e.g. the ''Victorian'' era). Whenever one hears of a person describing what happened at the time when so and so ruled over any particular place or people, what he or she is actually saying is that an event happened within a finite period of time, one that is equal to the duration of the reign of the monarch in question. Now seeing as how it is possible (and in fact common, particularly among the southern tribes) for one individual to have several different names and aliases in a single life, a certain degree of uniformity in usage is required if the history of an entire state is to be tied to his or her name. It is for this reason that when new monarchs are enthroned, the uniqueness of their names is usually considered to be a matter of considerable importance (even when it is caused by nothing more than the adding of ordinals to them or the allowing of more than a generation to pass before their  subsequent usage). An example of this can be found in the [[kingdom of Benin]], where the throne name of [[Erediauwa I]] became the surname of all of his immediate family in the Eweka royal house of the state, thus nominally tying them and their descendants to the era of his reign. This is especially obvious when their branch's name is compared to the last names of the said king's brothers and their heirs, named the Akenzuas after his father [[Akenzua II]], and his uncles and their heirs, named the Ewekas after his grandfather [[Eweka II]].

In the case of the comparatively small number of Nigerian monarchs, such as Obi [[Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe|Nnaemeka Achebe]] of [[Onitsha]], who do not make use of regnal names as a result of a variety of reasons, pre-coronation names are maintained during their reigns.

===Asia===
In parts of east Asia, it is more a rule than an exception that monarchs take additional names when ascending, and quite often discard the name they were known by as princes. Often the assumed name is different from the childhood name, and a new [[temple name]] could be assumed. A [[posthumous name]] is sometimes accorded to a deceased monarch. Rebel leaders may also take regnal names. The regnal names of some monarchs were long, for example [[Lý Thái Tổ]], [[Jiajing Emperor|Emperor Shizong of Ming]] and [[Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire]]. While many rulers in east Asia (including in China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan) took regnal names based on [[Chinese characters]], some monarchs of [[Xu (state)|Xu]], [[Xiongnu]], [[Tuyuhun Kingdom]], [[Rouran Khaganate]], [[Göktürks]], [[Uyghur Khaganate]] and [[List of Mongol Khans|Mongol]] took Chinese transliterated non-Chinese regnal names. For details on the multiple names assumed by individual East Asian monarchs, see:
* [[Chinese era name]]
* [[Japanese era name]]

* [[List of Monarchs of Korea]]
* [[List of Mongolian monarchs]]
* [[List of Vietnamese monarchs]]
* [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)]]
* [[List of sovereign state leaders in the Philippines|List of Rulers in the Philippines]]
Some [[royal family]] members may receive honorary names such as [[:zh:徽号|Huihao]] and [[:ja:宮号|Miyagō]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc.matsuyama-u.ac.jp/~tamura/itijikinn.pdf 紀宮は、宮号（みやごう＝皇族に天皇がおくる称号）]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Hungary====
During the Medieval Age, when the [[House of Árpád]] disappeared in 1301, two of the monarchs that claimed the throne and were crowned chose a different name. [[Otto III, Duke of Bavaria]] became Bela V of Hungary, taking the name of his maternal grandfather, [[Béla IV of Hungary]]. In the other hand, [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia]] signed his royal documents in Hungary as Ladislas, this being a very traditional name in the Kingdom.

Later during the first half of the 14th century, [[Charles I of Hungary]] signed as "''Carolus rex''", but in fact his birth name was the Italian ''Caroberto''. This is why he is often referred to by the Hungarian historians as "Charles Robert of Hungary".

====Netherlands====
All ruling male members of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] bore the name [[Willem]] (William). The current king of the Netherlands was christened [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]]. During an interview in 1997 he said he intended to rule under the name of Willem IV, but he had a change of mind. In a televised interview just before his inauguration, he announced he would continue to use the name Willem-Alexander, saying "I spent 46 years of my life under the name Willem-Alexander, and specifically under the nickname of Alexander. I think it would be weird to discard that because I become king of the country." Furthermore, he said he did not consider himself "a mere number", adding that regnal numbers reminded him of Dutch cattle naming conventions.&lt;ref&gt;http://nos.nl/koningshuis/video/496848-willem-4-staat-bij-bertha-38-in-de-wei.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
When the [[House of Piast]] disappeared and the [[Lithuania]]n [[House of Jagiellon]] was elected in the figure of the High Duke [[Jogaila]], this monarch took the name of Władysław II, in honour of the previous Polish king ([[Władysław I the Elbow-high]]) with this traditional name. Similarly, when the Elector of Saxony, Frederick Augustus I, was elected king in 1697, he took the name of Augustus II. His son Frederick Augustus II crowned in 1734, also took the name of Augustus, becoming Augustus III.

====Portugal====
The [[List of Portuguese monarchs|monarchs of Portugal]] have traditionally used their first baptismal name as their regnal name upon their accession. The only notable exception was [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], who was born Martin of Burgundy (''Martinho de Borgonha'', in Portuguese). As he was not the heir to the throne, Martin was expected to join the clergy, and was named after [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin of Tours]], on whose feast day he had been born. When the [[heir apparent]], Henry, died, the prince's name was changed to Sancho, one with a more established royal tradition in the other Iberian monarchies (Navarre, Castile and Aragon).

====United Kingdom====
Though most [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchs of the United Kingdom]] have used their first baptismal name as their regnal name, on three occasions monarchs have chosen a different name.

First, [[Queen Victoria]] had been christened Alexandrina Victoria, but took the throne under the name Victoria.

When Victoria's son, Prince Albert Edward, became king in 1901, he took the regnal name [[Edward VII]], against the wish of his late mother.&lt;ref name="Regnal Names"&gt;{{cite book |last=Panton |first=Kenneth |date= |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BiyyueBTpaMC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA392&amp;dq=Prince+Albert+Edward,+became+king+in+1901,+he+took+the+regnal+name+%5B%5BEdward+VII%5D%5D,+against+the+wish+of+his+late+mother&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bjK3UziERz&amp;sig=q8hJv92WqVVppR4SZvLTfleoHQY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUwdPAoe_OAhXEoJQKHb9RA1wQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Prince%20Albert%20Edward%2C%20became%20king%20in%201901%2C%20he%20took%20the%20regnal%20name%20%5B%5BEdward%20VII%5D%5D%2C%20against%20the%20wish%20of%20his%20late%20mother&amp;f=false |location=US |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=392 |isbn=978-0810857797}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new king declared that he chose the name Edward alone as an honoured name borne by six of his predecessors, and that he did not wish to diminish the status of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|his father]], with whom alone among royalty the name Albert should be associated.

In 1936, after the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]], Prince Albert, Duke of York, assumed the throne as [[George VI|King George VI]] rather than "King Albert". His full name was Albert Frederick Arthur George; like Edward VII and Victoria he used another of his names.

There has been speculation that the current [[heir apparent]] to the British throne, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], may elect not to be known as "Charles III" out of concern about comparisons with [[Charles II of England]] (who was known for his Catholic sympathies), [[Charles I of England]] (who was executed after the [[English Civil War]]) and the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] memory of the "Young Pretender" [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (who claimed the title "Charles III").&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article782407.ece|work=The Times |location=UK | title=Call me George, suggests Charles | date=24 December 2005| accessdate=13 July 2009 | first=Andrew | last=Pierce}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may instead choose to be known as George VII in honour of his grandfather.&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge" /&gt; However, the Prince has not as yet announced any decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/27/monarchy.michaelwhite|work=The Guardian |location=UK | title=Charles denies planning to reign as King George | date=27 December 2005| accessdate=2 October 2012 | first=Michael | last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt; His full name is Charles Philip Arthur George.

====Scotland====
When [[Robert III of Scotland|John, Earl of Carrick]] ascended the Scottish throne in 1390, it was deemed imprudent for him to take the regnal name of "John II", as recent kings named John had turned out badly: [[John of England|in England]] as well as [[John Balliol|in Scotland]]. Furthermore, royal propaganda of the time held that John Balliol had not been a legitimate king of Scotland, making the new king's [[regnal number]] also a tricky issue. To avoid these problems, John took the regnal name of ''Robert III'', honouring [[Robert II of Scotland|his father]] and [[Robert I of Scotland|great-grandfather]].&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Magnus, ''Scotland: The Story of a Nation'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the accession, in 1952, of [[Elizabeth II]] the title ''Elizabeth II'' caused controversy in Scotland as there had never been a Scottish ''Elizabeth I''. The Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] informed the [[British House of Commons]] that the practice since the Union was to use the higher numeral. New [[Royal Mail]] post boxes in Scotland, bearing the [[Royal Cypher|cypher]] ''E&lt;small&gt;II&lt;/small&gt;R'', were vandalised, after which, to avoid further problems, post boxes and Royal Mail vehicles in Scotland bore only the [[Crown of Scotland]]. A legal case, ''[[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]]'' (1953 SC 396), contested the right of the Queen to title herself ''Elizabeth II'' in Scotland, arguing that to do so would be a breach of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]]. The case, however, was lost on the grounds that the pursuers had no title to sue the Crown, and also that the numbering of monarchs was part of the [[royal prerogative]], and thus not governed by the Act of Union.

====The Roman Empire====
The Roman Emperors usually had the titles of Imperator Caesar Augustus in their names. (which made their regnal names) Caesar came from the cognomen of Gaius Julius Caesar, Imperator meant Commander and Augustus meant venerable or majestic. The name usually went in two ways, Imperator (Praenomen, Nomen and Cognomen) Caesar Augustus or Imperator Caesar (Praenomen, Nomen and Cognomen) Augustus. Also Imperator became a Praenomen of Roman Emperors, Augustus and Caesar became a cognomen of theirs.

==Religious offices==

===Catholic Church===
{{Main|Papal name}}
Immediately after a new pope is elected, and accepts the election, he is asked by the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], "By what name shall you be called?" The new pope chooses the name by which he will be known. The senior Cardinal Deacon, or [[Cardinal Protodeacon]], then appears on the balcony of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] to proclaim the new Pope, informing the world of the man elected Pope, and under which name he would be known during his reign.

&lt;blockquote lang="la" style="font-style:italic; width:42%; margin:1em 4%; float:left;"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum:
[[Habemus Papam]],
Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum,
Dominum [forename],
Sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ Cardinalem [surname],
qui sibi nomen imposuit [papal name].
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="width:42%; margin:1em 4%; float:left;"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I announce to you a great joy:
We have a Pope,
The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord,
Lord [forename],
Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church [surname],
who conferred upon himself the name [papal name].
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the first centuries of the church, priests elected [[bishop of Rome]] continued to use their baptismal names after their elections. The custom of choosing a new name began in AD 533 with the election of [[Pope John II|Mercurius]]. Mercurius had been named after the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], and decided that it would not be appropriate for a pope to be named after a Roman god. Mercurius subsequently decreed that he would be known as John II. Since the end of the tenth century the pope has customarily chosen a new name for himself during his Pontificate; however, until the 16th century some pontiffs used their [[Given name|baptismal names]].

The last pope to use his baptismal name was [[Pope Marcellus II]] in 1555, a choice that was even then quite exceptional. The names chosen by popes are not based on any system other than general honorifics. They have been based on immediate predecessors, mentors, political similarity, or even after family members—as was the case with [[Pope John XXIII]]. The practice of using the baptismal name as papal name has not been ruled out and future popes could elect to continue using their original names after being elected pope.

Often the new pontiff's choice of name upon being elected to the papacy is seen as a signal to the world of whom the new pope will emulate or what policies he will seek to enact. Such is the case with [[Benedict XVI]] who, in fact, explained the [[Pope Benedict XVI#Choice of name|reasons for his choice of name]] during his first General Audience in St. Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005. On that occasion, he said that he wanted to remember "[[Pope Benedict XV]], that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war," and also "[[Saint Benedict of Nursia]], co-patron of Europe, whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe."

There has never been a [[Pope Peter II]]. Even though there is no specific prohibition against choosing the name Peter, bishops elected to the Papacy have refrained from doing so even if their own given name was Peter. This is because of a tradition that only [[Saint Peter]] should have that honor. In the 10th century [[Pope John XIV|John XIV]] used the regnal name ''John'' because his given name was Peter. While some [[antipope]]s did take the name Peter II, their claims are not recognized by the mainstream Roman Catholic Church, and each of these men only either has or had a minuscule following that recognized their claims.

Probably because of the controversial [[Antipope John XXIII]], new popes avoided taking the regnal name John for over 600 years until the election of [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Cardinal Roncalli]] in 1958. Immediately after his election, there was some confusion as to whether he would be known as John XXIII or John XXIV. Cardinal Roncalli thus moved to immediately resolve by declaring that he would be known as John XXIII.

In 1978, [[Albino Luciani]] became the first pope to use two names for his regnal name when he took the name [[Pope John Paul I|John Paul I]], including the "I". He took the "John Paul" name to honor both John XXIII and [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]]. With the unexpected death of John Paul I a little over a month later, [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] took the name John Paul II to honor his immediate predecessor.

[[Antipope]]s also have regnal names, and also use the ordinal to show their position in the line of previous pontiffs with their names. For example, [[David Bawden]] took the name Michael I when declared pope in 1990.

===Coptic Church===
[[Coptic Pope]]s also choose regnal names distinct from their given names.

=== Islamic caliphates ===

{{see also|List of caliphs}}
The use of regnal names (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], ''{{transl|ar|laḳab}}'' (sing.) ''{{transl|ar|alḳāb}}'' (pl.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/lakab-COM_0563 |title=Laḳab |last=Bosworth |first=C.E. |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam |edition=Second |editors=P.

'''Salome Sellers''' (''née'' '''Sylvester'''; January 1{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, 1800 &amp;ndash; January 9, 1909) was an American centenarian who was the last known survivor from the [[18th century]].

==Biography==
Salome Sylvester was born in [[Deer Isle, Maine]] (then part of [[Massachusetts]]), the daughter of Edward and Deborah (''née'' Cushman) Sylvester. She grew up on Deer Isle and married Joseph Sellers on 23 December 1830. The couple had six children together, Salome outliving all but her oldest son, William. She was widowed in 1865.

Due to her unusually long life, Salome was often featured in local newspapers and visited by people interested in her long life, something Salome once expressed as, "I've lived too long. I'm only a curiosity now for people to come and stare at".

Salome Sellers died in the same house she and her husband had built in 1830 in Deer Isle, Maine on 9 January 1909, aged 109 years, 8 days. Her house is now known as the [[Salome Sellers House]] and home to the Deer Isle-Stonington Historical Society. There has also been a book written about her life: "An Island Woman: Salome Sylvester Sellers, 1800-1909".

'''Share a Coke''' is a multi-national [[marketing campaign]] in for [[Coca-Cola]]. It [[debranding|debrands]] the traditional Coke logo, replacing "Coca-Cola" from one side of a bottle with the phrase "Share a Coke with" followed by a person's name.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; {{primary-inline|date=November 2018}} The campaign, which uses a list containing 250 of the country's most popular names (generic nicknames and titles are also used in some cases), aims to have people go out and find a bottle with their name on it, then share it with their friends.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Share a Coke FAQs|url=http://www.coca-cola.co.uk/faq/products/share-a-coke.html|publisher=[[Coca-Cola]] Great Britain|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Lucy|title=Debranding: why Coca-Cola's decision to drop its name worked|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/aug/06/coke-debranding-name-dropping|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=November 2018}} The campaign began in Australia in 2011.{{Citation needed|reason=Not mentioned in body of article; see talk page |date=November 2018}}

The campaign received multiple awards at the Creative Effectiveness Lion Awards at Cannes.&lt;ref&gt;''B &amp; T Weekly,'' "Cannes: Share a Coke 'most successful in decades'", ''B &amp; T Weekly'' [Australia], 18 June, 2014, http://www.bandt.com.au/advertising/Cannes-Share-a-Coke-most-successful-in-decades&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spary, S., "From Share a Coke to Mad Men: the campaigns that defined Coke under Wendy Clark," ''Campaign Live,'' 17 November, 2015, http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/1372962/share-coke-mad-men-campaigns-defined-coke-wendy-clark&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, where the campaign is credited with increasing sales by more than 2%&lt;ref&gt;Esterl, M., "Marketing Campaign That Put First Names on Bottles Reversed Downward Slide," ''Wall Street Journal,'' 25 September, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and according to a piece by ''[[The Atlantic]]'' writer [[Kalle Oskari Mattila]], said to have reversed more than 10 years of decline in Coke consumption&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/the-age-of-the-wordless-logo/499166/|title=Why Are So Many of Today’s Logos Wordless?|last=Mattila|first=Kalle Oskari|date=2016-09-08|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the company and its agency has sought ways to extend the campaign while maintaining its relevance. In 2015, the company extended the campaign by increasing the number of names to 1,000. Nicknames such as "bro", "better half" and "sidekick"  were also added to the inventory of names.&lt;ref&gt;Rooney, B., 'Share a Coke' is back with more of your names on bottles,' ''CNN Money'' 14 April, 2014,  http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/14/news/companies/name-share-a-coke-bottle&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the company replaced people's names with lyrics from 70 popular songs including ''Lean on Me'' and ''We are the Champions''.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhlin, W., "Coke Swaps in Song Lyrics for Names in New 'Share a Coke' Campaign," ''AOL Business,'' 31 March, 2016,  https://www.aol.com/article/2016/03/31/coke-swaps-in-song-lyrics-for-names-in-new-share-a-coke-campai/21336287&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, the campaign returned to the US with a new variant; holiday destinations. Bottles of coke are labelled with favourite summer holiday spots such as Hawaii, Ibiza, Barbados etc.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, N., "Share a Coke Campaign Returns with Holiday Destinations instead of Names", ''The Drum,'' 19 April, 2017,  http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/04/19/share-coke-campaign-returns-with-holiday-destinations-instead-names&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Coca-Cola collaborated with [[McCann_(company)|Fitzco//Mccann]] and [[Score a Score]] to create over 1000 unique songs based on names found on bottles of Coke. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7865894/coke-share-name-songs-campaign|title=Coke Creates 1,000-Plus Songs for Its 'Share a Coke' Campaign|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior? Tomb Study Yields Clues|date=14 September 2017|first=Christina|last=Anderson|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

'''Stefano Colonna''' was the name of several members of the Italian family of [[Colonna family|Colonna]]. The most important include:

*'''Stefano Colonna the Elder''' (1265 &amp;ndash; c. 1348) was son of [[Giovanni Colonna (died 1293)|Giovanni Colonna]] and one of the most important political figures in Rome in the first half of the 14th century. He was heir of the [[Papal States|Papal]] fief of [[Palestrina]]. In 1290 he was named count of [[Romagna]], and he was several times Senator of [[History of Rome#Medieval Rome|Rome]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] vicar in [[Italy]]. A staunch [[Ghibelline]], he struggled for large part of his life against the Guelph [[Orsini]] family. He was a protector of [[Petrarch]], who dedicated two sonnets and other works to him. He was also a fierce opponent of [[Cola di Rienzo]], leader of the popular rebellion of Rome in 1347. He was brother to [[Sciarra Colonna]].
*'''Stefano Colonna the Younger''' (died 1347), son of the former, was Senator of Rome in 1306 and 1330. He was killed (together with his sons Giovanni and Camillo) at the [[battle of Porta San Lorenzo]] (1347) against the troops of Cola di Rienzo.
*'''Stefanello''' (died c. 1368), son of the former, was the first of the Palestrina branch of the family.
*'''Stefano Colonna di [[Palestrina]]''' (16th century). Commander of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] militia during the siege of Florence.&lt;ref name=af&gt;{{cite web|title=L'assedio di Firenze:cronologia|url=http://cronologia.leonardo.it/storia/aa1528a.htm|website=cronologia.leonardo.it|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">The '''Syndicate of Seven''' is the name given to the original members of the Broken Hill Mining Company formed in 1883, who lodged applications for mining leases along the Line of Lode at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

The members, who all worked at the remote [[Mount Gipps Station|Mount Gipps]] [[Sheep station]], were:-

#[[George McCulloch (mine owner)|George McCulloch]] (1848 – 1907) – station manager.
#[[Charles Rasp]] (1846 – 1907) – a [[boundary rider]], who was interested in [[prospecting]], recognised the importance of the site and pegged out the first mining lease.
#Philip Charley (1863 – 1937) – a young man learning to be a sheep farmer, employed as a [[boundary rider]].
#David James (1854 – 1926) – a contractor employed to sink water tanks and mend fences.
#James Poole (1848 – 1924) – an employee of David James.
#George Urquhart (1845 – 1915) – a bookkeeper and overseer
#George Lind (1861 – 1941) – a storekeeper.

[[Image:Philip Charley thumb.jpg|right|Philip Charley in 1887]]

"Each of the above seven contributing the sum of £70 each".

(Curtis 1908, and Camilleri 2006).

In September 1883 they pegged seven {{convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on}} blocks (blocks No 10–16) along the exposed lode at Broken Hill, thus securing almost the whole of the easily worked ore (Curtis, 1908).

The Syndicate of Seven was masterminded by [[George McCulloch (mine owner)|George McCulloch]] (Camilleri, p17, 2006).

The initial assay results were not encouraging and Poole, Urquhart and Lind sold their share before the boom days and flotation of Broken Hill Proprietary in 1885 (Curtis, 1908 and Camilleri, 2006). James Poole sold half his share to [[Sidney Kidman]] who went on to become a wealthy cattle baron and landowner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">The '''Texas Aces''' is a name colloquially given to five [[Miss Texas USA]] titleholders who went on to win the [[Miss USA]] beauty pageant in succession from 1985-1989.

Prior to the 1980s, no other state had won more than two [[Miss USA]] pageants in succession (the only two states to win twice in succession were [[Miss Virginia USA|Virginia]] in 1969-1970 and [[Miss Illinois USA|Illinois]] from 1973-1974).  The five Texan Miss USA winners were all coached by "GuyRex", Richard Guy and Rex Holt, who held the Texas franchise from 1975.  The term was first used in 1988 after Gibbs became their fourth consecutive titleholder, with Guy referring to the four queens as "four aces in a deck of cards", with their fifth titleholder, Kim Tomes (1977) as the "wildcard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss USA Contest Rewards Winners, Gurus|publisher=Associated Press|date=1988-03-02|first=Holden|last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year Gretchen Polhemus became the fifth and final "ace".  The term is still in use.

As well as directing the Texas pageant, GuyRex also acquired the [[Miss California USA]] franchise in 1986.  In 1988, Diana Magaña of California placed first runner-up to Gibbs, the fourth ace.  The two had both undergone extensive preparation by GuyRex, and even lived together prior to the pageant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Miss California |publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=1987-08-31|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bringing Up Beauty / In the months before the Miss USA Pageant, advisers work on Miss California |publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=1987-10-01|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The five Aces were:
*1985 - [[Laura Harring|Laura Martinez-Herring]] ('''Miss USA''', Semi-finalist at Miss Universe 1985)
*1986 - [[Christy Fichtner]] ('''Miss USA''', 1st runner-up at Miss Universe 1986)
*1987 - [[Michelle Royer]] ('''Miss USA''', 2nd runner-up at Miss Universe 1987)
*1988 - [[Courtney Gibbs]] ('''Miss USA''', Semi-finalist at Miss Universe 1988)
*1989 - [[Gretchen Polhemus]] ('''Miss USA''', 2nd runner-up at Miss Universe 1989)

'''The Famous Five''', or '''The Valiant Five''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kome|first=Penney|title=Women of Influence: Canadian Women and Politics|year=1985|publisher=Doubleday Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-385-23140-4|pages=31–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=CBF8UvjlN8KiyAGu3IHwDg&amp;id=hBQqAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22valiant+five%22+emily+murphy&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22valiant+five%22|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-fr|Célèbres cinq}}) were five Alberta women who asked the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to answer the question, "Does the word 'Persons' in Section 24 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]], include female persons?" in the case ''[[Edwards v Canada (AG)|Edwards v Canada]].''&lt;ref name=Brennan&gt;{{cite book | first=Brian| last=Brennan| title=Alberta Originals: Stories of Albertans Who Made a Difference| year=2001| publisher= Fifth House| page= 14| isbn= 1-894004-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five women, [[Emily Murphy]], [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]], [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]], [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] and [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]], created a petition to ask this question. They fought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927,&lt;ref name="Alberta1999"&gt;{{cite book| title=Alberta History| volume=47–49| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jL06AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=famous+five+persons+case+august+27&amp;dq=famous+five+persons+case+august+27| accessdate=May 10, 2013| year=1999| publisher=Historical Society of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 24, 1928, Canada's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such "persons".&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt;

The last line of the judgement reads, "Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the [[Senate of Canada]],' the question is answered in the negative." This judgement was overturned by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the "[[Persons Case]]". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a continent-wide drive for political equality, coming seven years after discrimination against women's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and thus had important ramifications.

Some saw this as "radical change"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the [[1689 Bill of Rights]], which uses only the term "person", not the term "man" (or "woman" for that matter).

Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], an approach that has come to be known as the "[[living tree doctrine]]".

==The Five==
The famous five women were:

* [[Emily Murphy]] (1868–1933), the [[British Empire]]'s first female judge;
* [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]] (1868–1965), farm women's leader, political activist and first female [[Cabinet minister]] in Alberta, still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case;
* [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]] (1873–1951), a [[suffragist]] and author, member of the Alberta Legislature 1921–1926;
* [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] (1868–1931), the first woman elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], or any legislature in Canada or the rest of the British Empire, but no longer MLA at the time of the court case;
* [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]] (1849–1931), an advocate for working women, author and a founding member of the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]].

===Emily Murphy===
{{Main|Emily Murphy}}
Emily Murphy stood out in the famous five, bringing them to a victory in 1929. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected.&lt;ref name=MacEwan&gt;{{cite book |first=Grant| last=MacEwan| title=...and Mighty Women too: Stories of Notable Western Canadian Women| year=1975| publisher= Western Producer Prairie Books| isbn=978-0919306653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name "Janey Canuck". In 1922, she wrote ''The Black Candle'' which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. Murphy came from a privileged background in which white women were protected from many topics.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Millar |title=The Famous Five: Five Canadian Women and Their Fight to Become Persons |year=1999 |publisher=Western Heritage Centre| isbn=978-0920109168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irene Parlby===
{{Main|Irene Parlby}}
In 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta and in 1921, was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She served as cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during [[World War I]] and later served on the Board of Governors of the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Nellie McClung===
{{Main|Nellie McClung}}
Nellie McClung's jobs in her lifetime included teacher, author, public speaker, temperance activist, internationally known women's rights activist, and politician {Warne, Literature as Pulpit]. In 1918, she was a member of the Dominion War Council and the only woman representative at the League of Nations.  She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Board of the Governors.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;  In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt; She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Louise McKinney===
{{Main|Louise McKinney}}
Louise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in Alberta and the West – she served as the organization's vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 – and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union. McKinney was also named to be Commissioner for the first General Council of the [[United Church of Canada]], and was the only woman to sign the Basis of Union.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Henrietta Muir Edwards===
{{Main|Henrietta Muir Edwards}}
Henrietta Muir Edwards, author and researcher on women's topics, held an influence within the National Council of Women&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt; and held chairmanship of the Committee in Law in the National Council of Women for more than 35 years. She was also a Red Cross leader during the war years. Edwards was the secretary of the National Subcommittee which focused on thrift and economy in Canadian homes.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Honorary senators===
None of the five became [[Senate of Canada#Senators|senators]]; the first female senator was Quebecer [[Cairine Reay Wilson]], appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first "honorary senators".&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/10/calgary-famous-five-honourary-senators.html |title='Famous 5' named honorary senators |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=CBC.ca |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/..%5C40%5C2%5Cparlbus%5Cchambus%5Csenate/deb-E/059db_2009-10-08-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=2#53|title=Senate of Canada – Debates|first=Senate of|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.

Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful [[House of Commons of Canada]] had elected its first female member ([[Agnes Macphail]]) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}} The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.

===Opinions on the Famous Five===
Opinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have [[eugenics]] legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed "mentally deficient" or "insane" in Alberta and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/eugenics-keeping-canada-sane-feature/&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;  Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as "tenacious" with her work with prohibition.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights.&lt;ref name = Sharpe&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert J.| last=Sharpe| title=The Persons Case: The Origins and Legacy of the Fight for Legal Personhood| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOwC1vcGgcEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4| isbn=978-0802096289| year=2007| publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the "evils of alcohol" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War&amp;nbsp;I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the [[Dower Act]]. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;

===Commemorations===
The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the [[Centre Block#Senate foyer|foyer]] and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist [[Barbara Paterson]], one on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]], the other at the [[Olympic Plaza (Calgary)|Olympic Plaza]] in [[Calgary]]. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included [[French language in Canada|French]] and [[Canadian English|English]] singers, [[Inuit]] dancers, and speeches by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.

The City of [[Edmonton]] has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the "Famous Five".&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web| title=Alphabetical Park Listing| url=http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| publisher=City of Edmonton| date=May 14, 2012| accessdate=May 14, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115516/http://edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| archivedate=November 27, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of [[National Council of Women]] of Canada, president of [[Canadian Women's Press Club]], director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King [[George V]] to be a Lady of Grace of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of St. John of Jerusalem]].

Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the [[University of Alberta]] with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, "who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women" should not be forgotten.&lt;ref name="MacEwan" /&gt;

Along with [[Thérèse Casgrain]], the Five were commemorated in the 2001 [[Journey Series (banknotes)|Journey Series]] of Canada's [[Canadian fifty-dollar bill|fifty-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt;  In December 2011, the [[Bank of Canada]] announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 [[Frontier Series]] banknote that it issued in 2012.&lt;ref name="50dollars"&gt;{{cite news| title=Should the new $50 bill show an Arctic research boat instead of the Famous Five?| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/should-the-new-50-bill-show-an-arctic-research-boat-instead-of-the-famous-five.html| work=CBC News| date=December 7, 2011| publisher=cbc.ca| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.&lt;ref name="5foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225022456/http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| dead-url=yes| archive-date=December 25, 2012| title=About Us| publisher=Famous 5 Foundation| date=| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Five''', also known as the '''Mighty Handful''' and the '''New Russian School''', were five prominent 19th-century Russian [[composers]] who worked together to create distinct [[Russian classical music]]. [[Mily Balakirev]] (the leader), [[César Cui]], [[Modest Mussorgsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Borodin]] all lived in [[Saint Petersburg]], and collaborated from 1856 to 1870.

==History==

===Name===
[[Image:Vladimir Stasov.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Stasov]] &lt;br&gt; (1824&amp;ndash;1906)]]
In May 1867 the critic [[Vladimir Stasov]] wrote an article, titled ''Mr. Balakirev's Slavic Concert'', covering a concert that had been performed for visiting Slav delegations at the "All-Russian Ethnographical Exhibition" in Moscow. The four Russian composers whose works were played at the concert were [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]], [[Mily Balakirev]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''Essays on Russian and East European Music: Vladimir Stasov, Man and Critic'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985, pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The article ended with the following statement:

{{quote|God grant that our Slav guests may never forget today's concert; God grant that they may forever preserve the memory of how much poetry, feeling, talent, and intelligence are possessed by the small but already mighty handful of Russian musicians.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi, M.D. 1946, pg. 178"&gt;Calvocoressi, M.D., Abraham, G., ''Master Musicians Series: Mussorgsky'', London: J.M.Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1946, pg. 178&lt;/ref&gt;|Vladimir Stasov|''[[Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti]], 1867''}}

The expression "mighty handful" ({{lang-ru|Могучая кучка}}, ''Moguchaya kuchka'', "Mighty Bunch") was mocked by enemies of Balakirev and Stasov: [[Alexander Serov|Aleksandr Serov]], academic circles of the conservatory, the Russian Musical Society, and their press supporters. The group ignored critics and continued operating under the moniker.&lt;ref name="Calvocoressi, M.D. 1946, pg. 178"/&gt; This loose collection of composers gathered around Balakirev now included Cui, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Borodin &amp;mdash; the five who have come to be associated with the name "Mighty Handful", or sometimes "The Five". [[Gerald Abraham]] stated flatly in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' that "they never called themselves, nor were they ever called in Russia, 'The Five'"&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Gerald, ''The New Grove: Russian Masters 1: Balakirev'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1986, pg. 86&lt;/ref&gt; (although today the Russian equivalent "Пятёрка" ("Pyatyorka") is occasionally used to refer to this group).&lt;ref&gt;''Krugosvet'', "[http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/muzyka/BALAKIREV_MILI_ALEKSEEVICH.html Balakirev Mily Alekseevich]".&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Rimsky-Korsakov routinely refers to the group as "Balakirev's circle", and occasionally uses "The Mighty Handful", usually with an ironic tone. He also makes the following reference to "The Five":

{{quote|If we leave out of account [[Nikolai Lodyzhensky|Lodyzhensky]], who accomplished nothing, and [[Anatoly Lyadov|Lyadov]], who appeared later, Balakirev's circle consisted of Balakirev, Cui, Mussorgsky, Borodin, and me (the French have retained the denomination of "''Les Cinq''" for us to this day).&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, N., ''Chronicle of My Musical Life'', New York: Knopf, 1923, pg. 286&lt;/ref&gt;|Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov|''Chronicle of My Musical Life'', 1909}}

The Russian word ''kuchka'' also spawned the terms "kuchkism" and "kuchkist", which may be applied to artistic aims or works in tune with the sensibilities of the Mighty Handful.

The name of [[Les Six]], an even looser collection of French-speaking composers, emulates that of "The Five".

===Formation===
The formation of the group began in 1856, with the first meeting of Balakirev and [[César Cui]]. [[Modest Mussorgsky]] joined them in 1857, [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] in 1861, and [[Alexander Borodin]] in 1862. All the composers in The Five were young men in 1862. Balakirev was 25, Cui 27, Mussorgsky 23, Borodin the eldest at 28, and Rimsky-Korsakov just 18. They were all self-trained amateurs. Borodin combined composing with a career in [[chemistry]]. Rimsky-Korsakov was a [[Imperial Russian Navy|naval officer]] (he wrote his First Symphony on a three-year naval voyage circumnavigating the globe). Mussorgsky had been in the prestigious [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] of the Imperial Guard, and then in the civil service before taking up music; even at the height of his career in the 1870s he was forced by the expense of his drinking habit to hold down a full-time job in the State Forestry Department.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, Orlando, ''Natasha's Dance: A Cultural History of Russia'' (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2002), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the élite status and court connections of Conservatory composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], The Five were mainly from the minor gentry of the provinces. To some degree their ''[[esprit de corps]]'' depended on the myth, which they themselves created, of a movement that was more "authentically Russian," in the sense that it was closer to the native soil, than the classic academy.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 179. Also see R. Tarushkin, ''Defining Russia Musically'', xiii ff, per Figes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before them, [[Mikhail Glinka]] and [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky]] had gone some way towards producing a distinctly Russian kind of music, writing operas on Russian subjects, but the Mighty Handful represented the first concentrated attempt to develop such a music, with Stasov as their artistic adviser and Dargomyzhsky as an elder statesman to the group, so to speak. The circle began to fall apart during the 1870s, no doubt partially due to the fact that Balakirev withdrew from musical life early in the decade for a period of time. All of "The Five" are buried in [[Tikhvin Cemetery]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

==Musical language==

===Stylization===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
The musical language The Five developed set them far apart from the Conservatoire. This self-conscious Russian styling was based on two elements:

*They tried to incorporate in their music what they heard in village songs, in [[Cossack]] and [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] dances, in church chants and the tolling of church bells (to the point where the bell tolling became a cliché). The Five's music became filled with imitative sounds of Russian life. They also tried to reproduce the long-drawn, lyrical and [[melisma]]tic peasant song, what Glinka had once called "the soul of Russian music."  Balakirev made this possible by his study of songs from the Volga in the 1860s. More than any previous anthology, his transcriptions artfully preserved the distinctive aspects of Russian folk music:
**Tonal mutability
*:A tune seems to shift naturally from one [[tonal center]] to another, often ending up in a different key than the one in which the song began. This can produce a feeling of elusiveness, a lack of definition or of logical progression in the harmony. Even when stylized by The Five, this quality can make Russian music sound very different from the tonal structures of the West.
**[[Heterophony]]
*:A melody is simultaneously rendered by two or more performers in different variations. This is improvised by the singers until the end, when the song reverts to a single melodic line.
**[[consecutive fifth|Parallel fifth]]s, fourths and thirds
*:The effect lends Russian music a raw sonority missing entirely from the comparatively polished harmonies of Western music.
*The Five also adopted a series of harmonic devices to create a distinct "Russian" style and color different from Western music. This "exotic" styling of "Russia" was not just self-conscious but entirely invented. None of these devices was actually used in Russian folk or church music:
**[[Whole tone scale]]
*:Although Glinka did not invent this scale, his application of it in the opera ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' (1842) &amp;mdash; most recognizable at the end of the festive overture &amp;mdash; provided a characteristic harmonic and melodic device. This scale in "Russian" works often suggests evil or ominous personages or situations. It was used by all the major composers from Tchaikovsky (the appearance of the Countess's ghost in ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'') to Rimsky-Korsakov (in all his magic-story operas—''[[Sadko (opera)|Sadko]]'', ''[[Kashchey the Deathless]]'' and ''[[The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya|The Invisible City of Kitezh]]''). [[Claude Debussy]] also uses this scale in his music, taking this, among many things, from the Russians. Later it became a standard device in horror-movie scores.
**The [[Russian submediant]]&lt;ref&gt;DeVoto, Mark. "The Russian Submediant in the Nineteenth Century," Current Musicology, no. 59 (October 1995), pp. 48&amp;ndash;76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*:Also linked to Glinka's  ''Ruslan'', this is a harmonic pattern (in  major mode) in which one upper part proceeds from the dominant pitch chromatically to the submediant while the other harmony parts remain constant. The most basic form of this pattern can be shown as follows (beginning with typical tonic):  root-position tonic triad → root-position augmented tonic triad → 1st inversion submediant minor triad. A famous example of the Russian submediant occurs in the very opening bars of the third movement of Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherezade]]''.
**[[Octatonic scale|Diminished or octatonic scale]]
*:Rimsky-Korsakov first used this in his symphonic poem ''Sadko'' in 1867. This scale became a sort of Russian calling-card &amp;mdash; a ''[[leitmotif]]'' of magic and menace used not just by Rimsky-Korsakov but all of his followers, above all [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] (mode 2).
**Modular rotation in sequences of thirds
*:The Five made this device of [[Franz Liszt]] their own to base a loose [[symphonic poem|symphonic-poem]] type of structure. This way, they could avoid the rigid Western laws of modulation in [[sonata form]], allowing the form of a musical composition to be shaped entirely by the "content" of the music (its programmatic statements and visual descriptions) rather than by formal laws of symmetry. This loose structure became especially important for Mussorgsky's ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', a work that may have done more than any other to define the Russian style.&lt;ref&gt;Figes, 180&amp;ndash;181.&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Pentatonic scale]]
*:This stylistic aspect became used by every Russian nationalist composer.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinctive feature is to have only five notes in the octave, rather than the seven of the [[heptatonic scale]]s (e.g., [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]]). The pentatonic scale is one of the ways of suggesting a "primitive" folk-melodic style as well as the "Eastern" element (Middle East, Asia). A melodic example of the "major-mode" pentatonic scale (C-D-E-G-A) can be heard at the entrance of the chorus at the beginning of Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]''.

===Orientalism===
One hallmark of "The Five" was its reliance on [[orientalism]].&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Many quintessentially "Russian" works were composed in orientalist style, such as Balakirev's ''[[Islamey]]'', Borodin's ''[[Prince Igor]]'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]''.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Orientalism, in fact, became widely considered in the West both one of the best-known aspects of Russian music and a trait of Russian national character.&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; As leader of "The Five," Balakirev encouraged the use of eastern themes and harmonies to set their "Russian" music apart from the German symphonism of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and other Western-oriented composers.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Rimsky-Korsakov used Russian folk and oriental melodies in his [[Symphony No. 1 (Rimsky-Korsakov)|First Symphony]], Stasov and the other nationalists dubbed it the "First Russian Symphony," even though Rubinstein had written his ''Ocean'' Symphony a dozen years before it.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; These were themes Balakirev had transcribed in the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="figes391"&gt;Figes, 391.&lt;/ref&gt; "The symphony is good," Cui wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov in 1863, while the latter was out on naval deployment. "We played it a few days ago at Balakirev's—to the great pleasure of Stassov. It is really Russian. Only a Russian could have composed it, because it lacks the slightest trace of any stagnant Germanness."&lt;ref&gt;Rimsky-Korsakov, A.N., ''N.A. Rimskii-Korsakov: zhizn' i tvorchestvo'', vyp. 2 (Moscow, 1935), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Orientalism was not confined to using authentic Eastern melodies.&lt;ref name="maes82"&gt;Maes, Francis, tr. Pomerans, Arnold J. and Erica Pomerans, ''A History of Russian Music: From ''Kamarinskaya ''to'' Babi Yar (Berkeley, Los Angeles and London: University of California Press, 2002), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; What became more important than the melodies themselves were the musical conventions added to them.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; These conventions allowed orientalism to become an avenue for writing music on subjects considered unmentionable otherwise, such as political themes and erotic fantasies.&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; It also became a means of expressing Russian supremacy as the empire expanded under [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].&lt;ref name="maes80"&gt;Maes, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; This was often reinforced through [[Misogyny|misogynist]] symbolism—the rational, active and moral Western man versus the irrational, passive and immoral Eastern woman.&lt;ref name="maes80"/&gt;

Two major works entirely dominated by orientalism are Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite ''[[Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Antar]]'' and Balakirev's symphonic poem ''Tamara''.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; ''Antar'', set in Arabia, uses two different styles of music, Western (Russian) and Eastern (Arabian).&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The first theme, Antar's, is masculine and Russian in character.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The second theme, feminine and oriental in melodic contour, belongs to the queen, Gul Nazar.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; Rimsky-Korsakov was able to soften the implicit misogyny to some extent.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; However, female sensuality does exert a paralyzing, ultimately destructive influence.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; With Gul Nazar extinguishing Antar's life in a final embrace, the woman overcomes the man.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt;

Balakirev gives a more overtly misogynistic view of oriental women in ''Tamara''.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; He had originally planned to write a Caucasan dance called a ''lezginka'', modeled on Glinka, for this work.&lt;ref name="maes83"/&gt; However, he discovered a poem by [[Mikhail Lermontov]] about the beautiful Tamara, who lived in a tower alongside the gorge of Daryal.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; She lured travelers and allowed them to enjoy a night of sensual delights, only to kill them and throw their bodies into the River Terek.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Balakirev uses two specific codes endemic to orientalism in writing ''Tamara''. The first code, based on obsessive rhythms, note repetitions, climactic effects and accelerated tempi, represents Dionysian intoxication.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; The second code, consisting of unpredictable rhythms, irregular phrasing and based on long passages with many repeat notes, augmented and diminished [[interval (music)|intervals]] and extended [[melisma]]s, depict sensual longing.&lt;ref name="maes82"/&gt; Not only did Balakirev use these codes extensively, but he also attempted to supercharge them further when he revised the orchestration of ''Tamara'' in 1898.&lt;ref name="maes83"&gt;Maes, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct result of such orientalism was the big influence that this circle left on the formation of classical traditions in other nations of the east and south of Russia. For instance, one of Rimsky-Korsakov's famous students, [[Alexander Spendiaryan]] went on to become the founder of Armenian classical music, carrying on the traditions and aesthetics of the Mighty Handful to the Caucasus.

==Quotations==
[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] provides the following picture of "The Mighty Handful" in his memoirs, ''Chronicle of My Musical Life'' (translated by J. A. Joffe):

===Tastes===
{{quote|"The tastes of the circle leaned towards Glinka, Schumann, and Beethoven's last quartets ... they had little respect for Mendelssohn ... Mozart and Haydn were considered out of date and naive ... J. S. Bach was held to be petrified ... Chopin was likened by Balakirev to a nervous society lady ... Berlioz was highly esteemed ...Liszt was comparatively unknown ... Little was said of Wagner ... They respected Dargomyzhsky for the recitative portions of ''Rusalka'' ... [but] he was not credited with any considerable talent and was treated with a shade of derision. ...Rubinstein had a reputation as a pianist, but was thought to have neither talent nor taste as a composer."}}

===Balakirev===
{{quote|"Balakirev, who had never had any systematic course in harmony and counterpoint and had not even superficially applied himself to them, evidently thought such studies quite unnecessary ... An excellent pianist, a superior sight reader of music, a splendid improviser, endowed by nature with the sense of correct harmony and part-writing, he possessed a technique partly native and partly acquired through a vast musical erudition, with the help of an extraordinary memory, keen and retentive, which means so much in steering a critical course in musical literature ... He instantly felt every technical imperfection or error, he grasped a defect in form at once. Whenever I or other young men, later on, played him our essays at composition, he instantly caught all the defects of form, modulation, and so on, and forthwith seating himself at the piano, he would improvise and show how the composition in question should be changed exactly as he indicated, and frequently entire passages in other people's compositions became his and not their putative authors' at all. He was obeyed absolutely, for the spell of his personality was tremendous. ... His influence over those around him was boundless, and resembled some magnetic or mesmeric force. ... he despotically demanded that the tastes of his pupils should exactly coincide with his own. The slightest deviation from his taste was severely censured by him. By means of raillery, a parody or caricature played by him, whatever did not suit him at the moment was belittled — and the pupil blushed with shame for his expressed opinion and recanted...."}}

===Abilities===
{{quote|"Balakirev considered me a symphony specialist ... in the sixties, Balakirev and Cui, though very intimate with Mussorgsky and sincerely fond of him, treated him like a lesser light, and of little promise at that, in spite of his undoubted talent. It seemed to them that there was something missing in him and, in their eyes, he was in need of advice and criticism. Balakirev often said that Mussorgsky had 'no head' or that his 'brains were weak.' ... Balakirev thought that Cui understood little in symphony and musical forms and nothing in orchestration, but was a past master in vocal and operatic music; Cui, in turn, thought Balakirev a master in symphony, form, and orchestration, but with little liking for operatic composition and vocal music in general. Thus they complemented each other, but each, in his own way, felt mature and grown up. Borodin, Mussorgsky, and I, however &amp;mdash; we were immature and juvenile. Obviously, towards Balakirev and Cui we were in somewhat subordinate relations; their opinions were listened to unconditionally...."}}

==Influence==
Except perhaps for Cui, the members of this group influenced or taught many of the great Russian composers who were to follow, including [[Alexander Glazunov]], [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. They also influenced the two French symbolist composers [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]] through their radical tonal language.

The {{nihongo|'''Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry'''|三十六歌仙|Sanjūrokkasen}} are a group of Japanese poets of the [[Asuka period|Asuka]], [[Nara period|Nara]], and [[Heian period]]s selected by [[Fujiwara no Kintō]] as exemplars of [[waka (poetry)|Japanese poetic ability]]. The eldest surviving collection of the 36 poets' works is ''[[Nishi Honganji Sanjū-rokunin Kashu]]'' ("Nishi Honganji 36 poets collection") of 1113. Similar groups of Japanese poets include the [[Kamakura period]] ''Nyōbō Sanjūrokkasen'' (女房三十六歌仙), composed by court ladies exclusively, and the {{nihongo|''Chūko Sanjūrokkasen''|中古三十六歌仙}}, or Thirty-Six Heian-era Immortals of Poetry, selected by [[Fujiwara no Norikane]] 藤原範兼 (1107–1165). This list superseded an older group called the [[Six Immortals of Poetry]].

Sets of portraits (essentially imaginary) of the group were popular in [[Japanese painting]] and later [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]], and often hung in temples.

'''Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker''' (abbreviated to '''ZAZ''') were an American comedy filmmaking trio consisting of [[Jim Abrahams]] and brothers [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] who specialized in writing [[slapstick comedy]] films during the 1980s. The trio knew each other during their childhood years, growing up in [[Shorewood, Wisconsin]] and attending [[Shorewood High School (Wisconsin)|Shorewood High School]] which is sometimes referenced in their work. While attending the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], the trio founded a small theater known as The Kentucky Fried Theater in 1971 which led to their [[sketch comedy]] film ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]''.

This was followed in 1980 by the trio's breakout hit ''[[Airplane!]]'', which remains a revered comedic milestone. Subsequent collaborations include the TV series ''[[Police Squad!]]'', its subsequent ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' trilogy and the films ''[[Top Secret!]]'' and ''[[Ruthless People]]''. All of their projects relied heavily on [[Parody|parodies]], [[visual gag]]s and [[Fourth wall|breaking of the fourth wall]], and established a strong cult following. The notable stylistic exception is ''Ruthless People'', a more traditional farce that was directed by the trio but unlike their other productions, not written by them.

Prominent ZAZ actors and actresses include [[Leslie Nielsen]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Charlie Sheen]]. The trio's status as a three-person team of co-directors is highly unusual, although some of their later projects were directed by David Zucker working solo and with Jerry Zucker and Abrahams credited only as producers and/or writers. Each member of the group also had individual solo careers:

* David Zucker directed ''[[BASEketball]]'', ''[[My Boss's Daughter]]'', ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie 4|4]]''.
* Abrahams directed ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[Mafia!|Jane Austen's Mafia!]]''.
* Jerry Zucker directed ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[First Knight]]'' and ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]''. Of the three, Jerry Zucker has found the most mainstream non-comedic success including ''Ghost'' and ''First Knight'', which grossed $505 million and $127 million worldwide respectively.

==Filmography==
&lt;!--Do NOT add Police Squad! It's a TV show, not an actual film. Also do NOT add the Naked Gun movies. They were not directed by ZAZ, only written. Thank you.!--&gt;
Below is a filmography chart on which films the trio have directed together and solo:
