The '''Alpine Club Museum''' ({{lang-de|Alpenverein-Museum}}) in [[Innsbruck]], Austria is a museum dedicated to the history of [[alpinism]]. Located in the [[Hofburg, Innsbruck|Hofburg]] in the Altstadt section of the city, the museum is owned by the [[Austrian Alpine Club]] (ÖAV). In 2009, the museum was assessed as "excellent" for the Tyrolean and Austrian Museum Prizes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tt.com/csp/cms/sites/tt/%C3%9Cberblick/Kultur/KulturTirol/KulturTirolContainer/1753327-8/%C3%B6sterreichischer-museumspreis-f%C3%BCr-das-alpenverein-museum-innsbruck.csp Tiroler Nachrichten: ''Österreichischer Museumspreis für das Alpenverein-Museum Innsbruck'']; accessed on 30 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and was also nominated for the European Museum Prize in 2010.

== History ==
The Alpine Club Museum was opened in 1911 in a former villa on the [[River Isar]] in [[Munich]] as the "Alpine Museum", following a key resolution by the [[German and Austrian Alpine Club]] in 1907. In 1944 it was destroyed by shelling, but fortunately the majority of the collection had already been moved to [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] in Austria. It was not until 1973, however, that the ÖAV had a part of the collection displayed in the Palace of Thurn and Taxis in Maria Theresia Straße. From 1977 the museum was located on the third floor of the newly built Alpine Club house in Wilhelm Greil Straße. In 1993 the exhibition floor was changed structurally and in 1996 they began to produce their own exhibitions. In 2002, the "Year of the Mountains", an exhibition was displayed for the first time in the public arena ("Vertical - The Innsbruck Northern Mountain Chain. An Exhibition in the City"). After the Alpine Club had moved to a new building in 2008 the old exhibition area was no longer available and a cooperative agreement was reached with the Hofburg whereby the permanent exhibition, "Mountains - an Incomprehensible Passion" (''"Berge, eine unverständliche Leidenschaft"''), would be displayed on an area of 700 m² on the first floor until 2012.

Domestic violence is one of the most common crimes among male athletes.There is an ongoing struggle among sporting leagues, governments, and viewers to address the increasing number of domestic violence incidents committed by athletes. The [[NFL]], [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]](NCAA), [[National Basketball Association]](NBA), and the sport of [[Boxing]] employ and promote athletes who have committed domestic violence. Most prominent are instances of domestic violence that occur by members of the [[NFL]], due largely to its immense popularity in the [[United States]].

==Background==
[[Domestic violence]] among athletes specifically occurs off the field and is most often perpetrated by collegiate and professional athletes. Women are most often the victims during these perpetrations of violence. [[American football|football]], a high contact sport, is played and watched by millions of Americans, and is at the center of the discussion surrounding domestic violence and major athletes. Scholars have worked on this phenomenon considering many variables when attempting to correlate the nature of athletes to domestic violence. Scholars (discussed below) have suggested that the violent behavior inherent in the football environment can be a potential accelerator or stimulator of domestic violence. Major sports franchises are increasingly criticized for their lack of action in regard to domestic violence.

==Football==

Domestic abuse among professional athletes is not a new problem, but it became a nationally recognized issue when [[Baltimore Ravens]] football player [[Ray Rice]] assaulted his then-fiancee, now wife, in 2014 and was only suspended from two [[NFL]] games.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter /&gt; The incident took place in elevator in a hotel, in which Rice knocks out his wife- the video was released by [[TMZ]]. Prior to the incident, the NFL’s conduct policy stated that players would be disciplined for domestic abuse offense, but gave no specifics, so the league was left scrambling to come up with an appropriate punishment for Rice.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter /&gt; After receiving a great deal of criticism for the light suspension, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell created new rules for players who abuse a partner, saying the first offense would lead to a six-game suspension without pay and a second offense would lead to being kicked out of the league for at least a year.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter /&gt;

The criminal behavior of football players has been studied more than that of other players in other sports. Because of the sport's intrinsically violent nature, one might suppose that football players are particularly prone to off-the-field violence. One of the NFL's biggest problems off the field is Domestic violence, according to Jon Shuppe from NBC News over the last 14 years there have been 87 arrests involving 80 football players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuppe|first1=Jon|title=Still Playing: 12 NFL Players Have Domestic Violence Arrests|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/nfl-controversy/still-playing-12-nfl-players-have-domestic-violence-arrests-n204831|accessdate=22 April 2015|publisher=NBC News|date=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of 252 nationally-reported criminal cases in one year that involved athletes found that about 14% (49) of the athletes involved were professional football players. This compared to about 7% (25) professional [[baseball]] players and about 6%  (twenty-one) of professional [[basketball]] and [[hockey]] players.&lt;ref name="1-BlueCollar Crimes/WhiteCollar Criminals" /&gt; While this does not draw any specific causation of the violence, the survey is at least suggestive that professional athletes who play other sports besides football also break the law in significant numbers, amounting to perhaps dozens of high-profile incidents each year.&lt;ref name="1-BlueCollar Crimes/WhiteCollar Criminals"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Hear|first1=Michael|title=Blue-Collar Crimes/White-Collar Criminals: Sentencing Elite Athletes Who Commit Violent Crimes|journal=Marquette Sports LawReview|date=2001|volume=12|issue=1|page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing factor to domestic violence among football players may be that they are [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitized]] to physical conduct because it is a part of what they do all the time.&lt;ref name="2 - Abrams"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Mitch|title=Anger Management in Sports|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley Teitelbaum, a Ph.D Clinical Psychologist and author of Sports Heroes, Fallen Idols and Illusions and Disillusions agrees with the previous statement by Mitch Abrams, saying, "They're (elite football players) trained to be very aggressive and somewhat violent on the field, that's the nature of the game and that’s how they become important players. And sometimes it's difficult for athletes to turn that off when they go back to their regular lives."&lt;ref name="3 - Teitelbaum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teitelbaum|first1=Stanley|title=Athletes Who Indulge Their Dark Side|date=2009|publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some players are raised  in an environment where violence is used to resolve conflict. As one is raised in an environment that welcomes violence, their propensity to repeat what they've seen, or what has been done to them may increase.&lt;ref name="3 - Teitelbaum" /&gt; [[Adrian Peterson]] has said that he disciplined his son the way he was disciplined as a child, then went on to say that he will, "Never use a switch again" (in reference to accusations of disciplining his 4-year old with a whip.)&lt;ref name="4 - usatodayonswitch"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pelissero|first1=Tom|title=A Dad First|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/vikings/2014/11/20/adrian-peterson-roger-goodell-child-abuse-switch-minnesota-vikings/70025476/|accessdate=31 March 2015|agency=USAToday}}&lt;/ref&gt; In almost every case, the domestic violence involves male athletes who play violent sports physically abusing wives or girlfriends.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; In 2010, starting running back [[Steve Jackson (running back)|Steve Jackson]] of the St. Louis Rams was accused of beating up his girlfriend while she was nine months pregnant with his child.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; His former girlfriend, Supriya Harris, said that Jackson “forcibly grabbed my arm, flung me against the door and repeatedly pushed me to the ground.”&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; Jackson took Harris to the hospital and told her to tell the doctors she had fallen in the shower. Ten days later, she delivered their child, but the couple separated four months later after he threatened her again.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt;

Yet it is not clear that athletes are any more involved in serious crime than the general population is. In a follow-up study, Blumstein and Benedict (1999) showed that 23% of the males in cities with a population of 250,000 or more are arrested for a serious crime at some point in their life. That compares with the 21.4% of NFL football players who had been arrested for something more serious than a minor crime as reported in Benedict’s earlier study (Benedict and Yaeger 1998). In fact, when Blumstein and Benedict compared NFL players with young men from similar racial backgrounds, they discovered that the arrest rates for NFL players were less than half that of the other group for crimes of domestic violence and nondomestic assaults.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt;

Woods brings attention to issue of [[male entitlement|Male Entitlement]], a topic that Benedict and Yaeger also shed light on. Some athletes develop a sense of entitlement as their fame grows. Whatever city they’re in, male athletes are surrounded by female groupies. The athletes often treat these women with disdain and yet are still tempted by their offers of sex. [[Wilt Chamberlain]], a former great NBA player, boasted in his autobiography that he had slept with over 20,000 women, which, if true, shows a definite degree of deviance.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt;

==NCAA==
A sensitive topic for many athletes is the apparent rise in violence against women among male athletes. Most men would be quick to say that they respect women and certainly don’t intend women harm. Here are some statistics from the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes on its website at ncava.org: A three-year study showed that while male student-athletes make up 3% of the population on college campuses, they account for 20% of sexual assaults and 35% of domestic assaults on college campuses.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woods|first1=Ronald|title=Social Issues in Sport|date=2011|isbn=9780736089821|pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletes commit one in three college sexual assaults. The general population has a conviction rate of 80% for sexual assaults, while the rate for athletes is only 38%.&lt;ref name="5 - Rwoods" /&gt; These statistics were gathered from 107 cases of sexual assault reported at 30 Division I schools between 1991 and 1993.&lt;ref name="6 - BenedictMcDonald"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crosset|first1=T. W.|last2=Benedict|first2=J. R.|last3=McDonald|first3=M. A.|title=Male student-athletes reported for sexual assault: A survey of campus police departments and judicial affairs offices.|journal=ournal of Sport &amp; Social Issues|date=1995|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of this study say the sample size was relatively small and was not controlled for the use of alcohol, the use of tobacco, and the man’s attitude toward women.&lt;ref name="7 - simmons"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simmons|first1=K|title=Sex Crimes on Campus|journal=Atlanta Journal Constitution|date=February 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those three factors are the main predictors of a male’s inclination toward gender violence. More recent studies have corroborated the study by Crosset and colleagues, and one researcher concluded that “a disproportionate number of campus gang rapes involve fraternities or athlete groups.”&lt;ref name="7 - simmons" /&gt;

Due to the rising accounts of sexual assault on college campuses, the “It’s On Us” campaign was launched in 2014 by President Barack Obama. The campaigns goal is to raise awareness of sexual assault by inspiring people to realize that it is everyone’s responsibility to do something, no matter how big or small. Over 200 universities have partnered with the “It’s On Us” campaign along with sports organizations such as the N.C.A.A. According to an article from the New York Times &lt;ref&gt;[Tracy, M. (2015, April 4). College Teams Add Assault Prevention to the Basic Drills. New York Times, p. D1(L). Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA408139956&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=uiuc_uc&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=995314d1760c4f8469e83b5843a303ab]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Big East Conference, which like the N.C.A.A. was a charter partner of ''It's on Us,'' had its lawyers brief the presidents of its 10 universities on developments in law and policy over the summer. At several universities, athletes produced public service announcements; DePaul enlisted the Chicago Police Department's Sexual Assault Task Force for athlete training, according to the conference."

==National Basketball Association==
In wake of the September media craze regarding the NFL's domestic violence issue, NBA commissioner [[Adam Silver]] said that his league will "take a fresh look" at its domestic violence procedures in the wake of the NFL's rash of incidents. Underscoring to the NBA Players Association ways to further educate players and provide programs to them and their families. "We learn from other leagues' experiences," Silver said.&lt;ref name="15 nba"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brian|first1=Mahoney|title=Silver: NBA will review domestic violence policies|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/sport/nfl-arrest-rates/|website=Nba|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We're studying everything that's been happening in the NFL. We're working with our players' association. We've been talking for several weeks and we're going to take a fresh look at everything we do." The NFL and Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] has been criticized for punishments that were too slow or lenient for [[Ray Rice]], [[Adrian Peterson]] and other players involved in issues of domestic violence brought to light in September 2014. Goodell aimed to implement new personal conduct policies by the Super Bowl. The NBA's [[collective bargaining agreement]] calls for a minimum 10-game suspension for a first offense of a player convicted of a violent felony, however nothing regarding misdemeanor domestic violence charges. Silver says that the NBA has in place, the appropriate mechanisms for discipline, but also acknowledged that it is his wish to continually revise and revisit the policy if need be.&lt;ref name="15 nba" /&gt; Silver also mentioned that "most importantly, it's education, and it's not just the players, but it's the players' families. That's what we're learning, too. We have to take these programs directly to the players' spouses, directly to their partners so that they're aware of places they can go to express concerns, whether they're anonymous hotlines, team executives, league executives. And we're consulting experts. There's a lot to be learned here. It's a societal problem; it's not one that's unique to sports."&lt;ref name="15 nba" /&gt; This proactive approach by Silver is surely helping the issue, but it does not diminish the fact that from 2010 to present, the NFL had an average arrest rate (for a population of 100,000) of approximately 2,466, followed by the NBA’s 2,157. Comparatively, professional baseball and hockey players clocked average arrest rates of 553 and 175, respectively, over the same period.&lt;ref name="14 - vocative"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tracy|first1=Abigail|title=NFL, NBA Lead Arrest Rates Across Pro Sports|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/sport/nfl-arrest-rates/|website=Vocative|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boxing/Floyd Mayweather==
Neither the World Boxing Federation or the Nevada Athletics Commission have rules forbidding boxers to commit domestic violence or sexual assault.&lt;ref name=BoxingHolter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holter|first1=Lauren|title=Boxing's Disturbing History With Domestic Violence Is Thrust Into The Spotlight By Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s Fight|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/80408-boxings-disturbing-history-with-domestic-violence-is-thrust-into-the-spotlight-by-floyd-mayweather-jrs-fight|website=Bustle|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Floyd Mayweather, Jr]], the world's highest-paid athlete&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Louisa|title=The Boxer and the Batterer|url=http://grantland.com/features/floyd-mayweather-pacquiao-domestic-violence-allegations/|website=Grantland|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is arguably the face of the sport. Floyd had been charged with domestic violence on more than one occasion, but rarely are they spoken of. Recently during the [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao]] fight [[ESPN]] and HBO’s [[Michelle Beadle]] and [[CNN]] reporter [[Rachel Nichols (journalist)|Rachel Nichols]], both of whom have covered Mayweather’s history of domestic violence, tweeted that Mayweather’s camp had “banned” them from the [[MGM Grand Arena]], preventing them from covering there for the respective media outlets.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; The first documented claim of domestic violence occurred in 2001. After Mayweather and Melissa Brim, the mother of his daughter Ayanna, got into an argument over child support, according to court documents, Mayweather swung open a car door that slammed her in the head, then he punched her three times in the face, leaving bruises. 
&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; In 2003, Mayweather was at a nightclub at the Luxor in Las Vegas when he spotted two friends of Josie Harris, who was the mother of three of his children. According to the testimony , Mayweather hit them both announced after following them outside the club, then. Outside, he allegedly picked up and shook a female security guard; police issued him a citation.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; A month after beating [[Arturo Gatti]] Mayweather went to trial on a felony battery charge. The previous year, Josie Harris had angrily confronted Mayweather about another woman. In response, Harris told police, he repeatedly punched her, kicked her, and dragged her by her hair, cutting her face. “My babies’ father just beat me up,” she said when she called 911.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; According to Lauren Holters article, Mayweather then, in 2010 got into another argument with mother of his children, Josie Harris, in which: punched her on the top of and in the back of the head. He allegedly kicked her, pulled her hair, and tried to break her left arm. “I’m going to get someone to pour acid on you,” he also said, according to the police report. Zion, their 9-year-old son, gave police a voluntary statement about what he saw: “He was punching her and kicking her. He was punching her in the head and he was stomping on her sholder [sic].” When Harris yelled for the children to call the police, Mayweather threatened them with violence if they did, and a friend who had come with him blocked the way, according to police. But Zion’s brother Koraun escaped, “jumped the fence,” and made his way to the main security gate, where he told the guard to call the police and an ambulance. A doctor’s examination of Harris afterward showed bruises and a concussion.&lt;ref name="12 - Grantland" /&gt; Floyd Mayweather, who just made roughly 180 million dollars from the [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao]], his domestic abuse charges however, remain a quieter issue in comparison to his money or his 48-0, undefeated record.&lt;ref name="13 abc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dahlberg|first1=Tim|title=Mayweather Wins Decision in Richest Fight Ever|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/mayweather-wins-decision-richest-fight-30765218|website=Abc|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-Economics==
The statistics do show that the NFL’s arrest rate for domestic violence is only half of the national average arrest rate. However, the socio-economic factor needs to be considered. While no arrest data broken down by income, BJS survey provided breakdowns for victimization rates. Benjamin Morris, the researcher and writer of FiveThirtyEight, found that the domestic violence victimization rate for people from households making $75,000 or more was 39% of the overall domestic violence victimization rate, and for women ages 20 to 34 it was less than 20%. Although it is impossible to compare directly to the relative NFL arrest rate with precision, at least it gives some benchmark to show that people with higher income levels generally tend to have lower rates of arrest for domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morris|first1=Benjamin|title=More On The Rate Of Domestic Violence Arrests Among NFL Players|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/more-on-the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/|website=FiveThirtyEight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of domestic violence among NFL players is higher than expected for their income level, which could suggest that these athletes are indeed more prone to domestic violence.&lt;ref name="8 - Live Science"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rachel|first1=Rettner|title=Are Athletes Prone to Violence|url=http://www.livescience.com/47949-pro-athletes-domestic-violence.html|website=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Game 3 of the 2006 NBA Finals.jpg|thumb|right|The home court of the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]]] In [[basketball]], the '''basketball court''' is the playing surface, consisting of a rectangular floor with baskets at either end. In professional or organized basketball, especially when played indoors, it is usually made out of a [[wood]], often [[maple]], and highly polished and completed with a 10 foot rim. Outdoor surfaces are generally made from standard paving materials such as [[concrete]] or [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]].

== Dimensions ==
Basketball courts come in different sizes. In the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the court is {{convert|94|by|50|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. Under [[FIBA|International Basketball Federation]] (FIBA) rules,&lt;ref name="FIBA2006Rules"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.fiba.com/asp_includes/download.asp?file_id=328 | title = Official Basketball Rules 2006 | format = pdf | work =  | publisher = [[FIBA|International Basketball Federation]] | accessdate = 2007-04-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406072645/http://www.fiba.com/asp_includes/download.asp?file_id=328| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the court is minutely smaller, measuring exactly {{convert|28|by|15|meters|ft|sigfig=3}}. In amateur basketball, court sizes vary widely. The baskets are always {{convert|10|ft|m|sigfig=3}} above the floor (except possibly in youth competition). Basketball courts have a three-point arc at both baskets. A basket made from behind this arc is worth three points; a basket made from within this line, or with a player's foot touching the line, is worth 2 points. The free-throw line, where one stands while taking a foul shot, is located within the three-point arc at 15 feet from the basket. A foul shot is worth 1 point, but if a shot is made from the foul line while in play it is still worth 2 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wissel|first=Hal|title=Basketball: steps to success|year=1994|publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.|location=United States|isbn=0-7360-5500-2|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center circle===
The only two players permitted to enter this area prior to the tipoff are the players contesting the jump ball (usually but not always centers). Both players jump when the referee throws the ball in the air, each attempting to tap the ball into the hands of a player of their own team.

===Three-point line===
The three-point line is the line that separates the two-point area from the [[three-point field goal|three-point area]]; any shot converted beyond this line counts as three points. If the shooting player steps on the line, it is counted as two points. Any foul made in the act of shooting beyond the three-point line would give the player three [[free throws]] if the shot does not go in, and one if it does.

The distance to the [[three-point field goal|three-point]] line from the center of the basket varies depending on the level or league, and has changed several times. These are the current distances, with the league or level using each distance:

* 19.75&amp;nbsp;ft (6.02 m): High School
* 20.75&amp;nbsp;ft (6.32 m): NCAA
* 21.65&amp;nbsp;ft (6.60 m) to 22.15&amp;nbsp;ft (6.75 m): WNBA and FIBA
* 22&amp;nbsp;ft (6.71 m) to 23.75&amp;nbsp;ft (7.24 m): NBA

The NBA adopted the three-point line at the start of the [[1979–80 NBA season|1979–80 season]]. This is of variable distance, ranging from {{convert|22|ft|m}} in the corners to {{convert|23.75|ft|m}} behind the top of the key. During the 1994–95, 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons, the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the overall distance of the line to a uniform {{convert|22|ft|m}} around the basket. It was moved back to its original distance after the 1996–97 season. FIBA and the NCAA both adopted the three-point line in 1985.

In most high school associations in the United States, the distance is 19.75 feet. This was formerly the distance for [[college basketball]] as well. On May 26, 2007, the NCAA playing rules committee agreed to move the three-point line back one foot to 20.75 feet for the men. This rule went into effect for the 2008–2009 season. The three-point line for women (NCAA) moved back one foot to 20.75 feet at the start of the 2011–2012 season.

The international distance, used in most countries outside the United States and in [[FIBA]] and [[WNBA]] competition, is currently 6.6&amp;nbsp;m (21.65&amp;nbsp;ft) to 6.75&amp;nbsp;m (22.15&amp;nbsp;ft).

===Perimeter===
The perimeter is defined as the areas outside the free throw lane and inside the three-point line. Shots converted (successfully made) from this area are called "perimeter shots" or "medium-range shots."
If a player's foot is on the three-point line, the shot is considered a perimeter shot.

===Low post area===
The low post is defined as the areas that are closest to the basket but outside of the free throw lane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbaballers.org/BasketballGlossary/Basketball-Glossary-L.html Basketball Glossary Terms, Definition, Lane violation, Low post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430102709/http://nbaballers.org/BasketballGlossary/Basketball-Glossary-L.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is fundamental to strategy in basketball. Skilled low post players can score many points per game without ever taking a [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]].

=== Key ===
The [[key (basketball)|key]], free throw lane or shaded lane refers to the usually painted area beneath the basket; for the NBA it is {{convert|16|ft|m}} wide, for the NCAA it is {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide; for both instances it extends {{convert|15|ft|m}} from the backboard. At the top of the rectangle is the [[free throw]] line, behind which players shoot uncontested shots when they're fouled. A circle is drawn around the free-throw line with a {{convert|6|ft|m}} [[radius]]; this is used for jump ball instances, as is done at the [[#Center circle|center circle]].  Two 6-inch hash lines, 3&amp;nbsp;ft from the free throw lane line and 5&amp;nbsp;ft 8 in from the free throw line, show the lower defensive box linked to the restricted area.

For FIBA tournaments, since October 2010 the key has been a rectangle 4.9 m wide and 5.8 m long. Previously it was a trapezoid 3.7 meters (12&amp;nbsp;ft) wide at the free-throw line and 6 meters (19 feet and 6.25&amp;nbsp;inches) at the end line.

The key is primarily used to prevent players from staying beneath the basket of the opponents' team for long periods (maximum three seconds).

The restricted area arc is a semi-circular arc drawn around the area directly underneath the basket. With some exceptions, members of the defending team cannot draw charging fouls in this area.
The restricted arc in all North American rule sets above high school level ([[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] men's and women's, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]) has a radius 4 feet (1.22 m) from below the center of the basket. The restricted area arc rule first appeared at any level of basketball in the NBA in the 1997-98 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factuation.com/shaq-and-the-no-charge-zone-rule/ |title=Shaq and the No Charge Zone Rule |publisher=Factuation |date=July 1, 2015 |website=Factuation |access-date=February 27, 2018 |quote=In the 1997-1998 season, NBA added the “no charge zone” or the “restricted area”. This is the portion of the key, denoted by an arc in the painted area that is positioned four feet from the basket. The arc is important because a defending player can not force a charging foul within this area. It was designed to provide benefit offensive post-up player like [Shaquille] O’Neal, players who drive to the basket and limit collisions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAA restricted area arc was originally established for the 2011–12 men's and women's seasons at a {{conv|3|ft|adj=on}} radius from below the center of the basket, and was extended to match the (W)NBA radius for the 2015–16 season and beyond.

===Other lines===
On NBA floors, two hash marks are drawn at the end lines near the key to mark the area known as the lower defensive box. A defensive player is allowed to draw a charging foul within the restricted arc if the offensive player receives the ball and/or starts his drive within this area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/nba101/misunderstood_0708.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, two lines are drawn on each of the sidelines, 28 feet from each of the endlines, which designates the extent of the coaching box and bench. This line marks the farthest extent a coach (aside from the sidelines) can stand. Directly behind this area is the team bench.

On the half-court line of NBA floors two lines extend outside the playing court, designating the place where substitutes wait before they can enter the playing court; directly behind this area are the various off-court officials such as the timekeeper and reserve referee.

===FIBA changes===

On April 26, 2008, FIBA announced several major rules changes involving the court markings. These changes took effect for major international competitions on October 1, 2010, after that year's World Championships [[2010 FIBA World Championship|for men]] and [[2010 FIBA World Championship for Women|women]], and became mandatory for other competitions on October 1, 2012 (although national federations could adopt the new markings before 2012). The changes were as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/lateNews/p/newsid/24352/arti.html |title=The FIBA Central Board approves historic rule changes |publisher=FIBA |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2008-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080430210952/http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/lateNews/p/newsid/24352/arti.html| archivedate= 30 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The shape of the key changed from a trapezoid to a rectangle as it is in the NBA, with NBA dimensions.
* The three-point line moved back to 6.75 meters (22&amp;nbsp;ft 1.7 in) from 6.25 meters (20&amp;nbsp;ft 6.1 in), compared to {{convert|23|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}} for the NBA at the top of the arc.
* The FIBA adopted the NBA's restricted area arc with a marginally wider radius of 1.25 meters (4&amp;nbsp;ft 1.2 in).

The '''black armband protest''' was made by [[Zimbabwe]]an cricketers [[Andy Flower]] and [[Henry Olonga]] during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. The pair decided to wear [[black armband]]s to "mourn the death of democracy in Zimbabwe". The protest received condemnation from senior Zimbabwean political figures, and also some senior Zimbabwean cricket figures, but was praised by the international media. The [[International Cricket Council]] deemed that Flower and Olonga had taken a political action, but refused to charge the pair with an offence. Their initial protest was during Zimbabwe's first match of the tournament in [[Harare]], and the pair wore armbands to protest at all of the matches. As a result of the protest, Flower and Olonga were forced to leave Zimbabwe, and both men later settled in the United Kingdom.

The [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] was awarded to [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], however they decided to award six of the group stage matches to Zimbabwe, and two to [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]].&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sQncAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=south+africa+2003+cricket+world+cup+hosts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QRSORauM8W&amp;sig=6DN2WXgZpU6TCjvmyWyMZqHjRBk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xet1VYa8LeXZ7gbl0oGACA&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20africa%202003%20cricket%20world%20cup%20hosts&amp;f=false| title= Forty Years of Sport and Social Change, 1968–2008: "To Remember is to Resist"| last1= Field |first1= Russell|last2= Kidd| first2= Bruce| pages= 47–53| date=2010| accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://topendsports.com/events/cricket-world-cup/hosts/2003-southern-africa/index.htm| title= South Africa, Zimbabwe &amp; Kenya, 2003|publisher= Top End Sports|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to security concerns in Zimbabwe, the British and Australian governments both advised their players against travelling to Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.island.lk/2003/02/06/sports01.html| title= England, Australia want Zimbabwe switch|publisher=Reuters|date= 4 February 2003|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, England forfeited their match, whilst Australia played and won their match.&lt;ref name="Cricinfo World Cup No. 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2760000/newsid_2765300/2765355.stm| title= England forfeit Zimbabwe points| publisher=BBC Sport|date= 15 February 2003|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65259.html|title= ICC World Cup, 27th Match: Zimbabwe v Australia at Bulawayo, Feb 24, 2003| publisher= ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planning ===

After Flower had decided to protest, he decided that he wanted Olonga to partner him in the protest, as "one white Zimbabwean and one black one operating together gave the message the most eloquent balance."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Olonga was the first black, and the youngest ever, cricketer to play for Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/08/31/henry.olonga.zimbabwe/| title= Henry Olonga, Zimbabwe's cricketing rebel |publisher=CNN|date= 7 September 2010|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/henry-olonga-he-has-a-love-for-zimbabwe-even-now-but-while-mugabe-is-alive-he-knows-he-cant-return-2034849.html|title= Henry Olonga: He has a love for Zimbabwe even now. But while Mugabe is alive, he knows he can't return|publisher= The Independent| date=25 July 2010|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met up in a news café in [[Harare]] to plan the protest, originally considering withdrawing from the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]], but later deciding to protest instead.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/292618.html| title= Standing up for their principles| publisher= ESPN Cricinfo|date=27 April 2007|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair spoke with lawyer [[David Coltart]], a founding member of the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]].

In the match, Zimbabwe batted first, and the public at the ground were not aware of the protest until the 22nd over, when Flower came out to bat wearing a black armband.&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt; Olonga was also seen wearing a black armband on the Zimbabwe team balcony.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; The crowd of 4,000 at the ground were supportive of the protest, and a number of them made their own black armbands during the match.&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC"/&gt; In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs ([[Duckworth-Lewis method|D/L method]]).&lt;ref name="Wisden" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/65236.html|title=ICC World Cup, 2nd Match: Zimbabwe v Namibia at Harare, Feb 10, 2003|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

Inside Zimbabwe, the reaction was hostile to the players. Zimbabwe's [[Minister of Information]], [[Jonathan Moyo]], called Olonga an "Uncle Tom" who had "a black skin and a white mask".&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cricinfo World Cup No. 8"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wctimeline/content/current/story/825253.html | title=Olonga and Flower make a stand | work=Cricinfo | date=2 February 2015 | accessdate=28 February 2016 | author=Brickhill, Liam}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zanu PF]] information secretary [[Nathan Shamuyarira]] claimed they were forced into it by the British media, and "No true Zimbabwean would have joined in," but "Olonga is not a Zimbabwean, he is a Zambian".&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian events" /&gt; Olonga was charged with treason, an offence punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iol.co.za/sport/cricket/olonga-sought-for-treason-1.103157#.VY6CM_lViko| title= Olonga 'sought for treason'| publisher=IOL Sport|date=17 March 2003|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MDC leader [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] released a statement in support of the protest. He was charged with treason, although the charge was later dropped.&lt;ref name=BBC2003/&gt; Givemore Makoni, the President of [[Takashinga Cricket Club]] where Olonga played said "It is disgraceful what Henry Olonga and Andy Flower have done. Taking politics on to the playing field is a thing the International Cricket Council and all sports organisations have been trying to avoid," and that "by taking politics on to the field and bringing the game into disrepute Henry appears to have breached Takashinga's code of conduct".&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Olonga was immediately suspended and later sacked by Takashinga Cricket Club.&lt;ref name=BBC2003&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2748899.stm| title= Brave cricketers risk Mugabe's wrath| last=Winter| first=Joseph| work=[[BBC News]]| date=11 March 2003| accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian events"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/mar/17/cricketworldcup2003.cricketworldcup|title= 'I was a cricketer.

They have jeopardised our reputation when given this once in a lifetime chance to host the World Cup ... It would be wrong if they wore black armbands again."&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt; They referred the matter to the [[International Cricket Council]], who deemed that they had taken a political action, but refused to charge them with a formal offence. Instead, they released a statement reiterating the apolitical nature of the organisation, and asked the players not to wear black armbands for the rest of the tournament, with the threat of more serious punishment if they continued to wear them.&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian events" /&gt;

The international reaction to the protest was favourable. [[The Times]] sports correspondent called it a "powerful blow for sanity, decency and democracy", whilst [[The Daily Telegraph]]'s [[Donald Trelford]] praised the players and criticised the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] and [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]], saying the players "shine out like diamonds in a pile of mud".&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt; Cricket writer [[Tim de Lisle]] praised the pair, saying that "Together they were responsible for a shining moment in the game's history ... Two strips of black tape, more potent than any logo, breathed life back into the game's battered spirit."&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt; [[England national cricket team|England]] captain [[Nasser Hussain]] said that Flower and Olonga "have proved to be great men by what they have done."&lt;ref name="Guardian events" /&gt; As a result of the protest, Olonga's girlfriend broke up with him, and he received numerous threatening emails and death threats.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Electrical-tape black.jpg|thumb|200px|Insulating tape was used instead of black armbands in the protest.]]

Zimbabwe won their next match against [[England national cricket team|England]] on a walkover, and also beat the [[Netherlands cricket team|Netherlands]], and had a no-result in their final group match against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], which allowed them to qualify for the Super 6 stage of the competition.&lt;ref name="Wisden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WC 2003 Results"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/series/61124.html?template=fixtures| title= Fixtures: Zimbabwe| publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were eliminated in this stage,&lt;ref name="Wisden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WC 2003 Results" /&gt; however this allowed both players to leave Zimbabwe for South Africa.&lt;ref name="Guardian Olonga" /&gt;

Olonga was dropped for 6 matches,{{efn|Including the walkover against England}} with no reason given – some have speculated that he was dropped as a result of the protest, whilst other suggest it was due to poor form.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; Flower on the other hand was considered "undroppable".&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt; To comply with the ICC warning not to wear black armbands, during their next{{efn|name=Ex|Excluding the walkover against England}} group match, Flower and [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|twelfth-man]] Olonga both wore black wristbands, and in subsequent matches, Flower wore white armbands.&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; Olonga's only subsequent appearance for Zimbabwe was in their match against Kenya.&lt;ref name="WC 2003 Results" /&gt;

After their final Super Six match, Olonga immediately announced his retirement from international cricket, after 30 Test matches and 50 ODIs.&lt;ref name="Principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard" /&gt; Flower had already previously announced his retirement from international cricket, and had signed for [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]], and [[South Australia cricket team|South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Social 2003 WC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/low/newsid_2860000/newsid_2863100/2863151.stm| title= Flower to play in Australia|publisher=BBC Sport|date= 19 March 2003|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olonga, had not planned what to do after the protest, as he "had in my own naivety thought that I could carry on in Zimbabwe – maybe my career would come to an end but I could still live there."&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In the end, he was kicked off the team bus,&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cricinfo Great Moments" /&gt; and travelled to [[Johannesburg]], where he stayed for a month, before being granted a work permit to play for Lashings Cricket Club in England.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent2004/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Olonga" /&gt; He was subsequently granted asylum in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-10-09/olonga-granted-extended-refuge-in-britain/1490854| title= Olonga granted extended refuge in Britain|publisher=ABC|date=9 October 2003|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither player has since returned to Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Olonga" /&gt;

== Legacy ==

Both players were awarded an Honorary Life Membership of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], an honour usually only given to players who have retired from [[first-class cricket]].&lt;ref name="Cricket County" /&gt; In 2013, the [[BBC]] recorded a special radio programme commemorating 10 years of the protest.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

A '''bodystocking''' is a one-piece [[skin-tight garment]] that covers the torso, legs and sometimes the arms of the wearer. It is a [[foundation garment]] or an article of [[lingerie]] usually made from a [[sheer fabric]] similar to that used for [[stockings]] or [[pantyhose]], or from [[fishnet]], [[lace]] or an opaque material, or a variation of these materials.&lt;ref name=voices&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/bodystockings-sexy-lingerie-many-occasions-695889.html|title=Bodystockings: Sexy Lingerie for Many Occasions|accessdate=26 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619123326/http://voices.yahoo.com/bodystockings-sexy-lingerie-many-occasions-695889.html|archivedate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bodystocking differs from a [[unitard]], which is worn as an outfit or article of clothing, and a [[leotard]], which is used as a practice garment or performance costume for [[acrobatics|acrobats]], [[gymnasts]] and other similar performers. Designed to be revealed, but not to be too revealing, bodystockings may be worn as undergarments by performers such as [[belly dancer]]s and [[exotic dancer]]s.

==Description==
Oftentimes body stockings are made of sheer fabric and are worn with or without undergarments such as a [[Brassiere|bra]].&lt;ref name=voices /&gt; Bodystockings normally come in only two sizes, especially when they use stretch material. A body stocking may be worn for the smooth line it gives or because it cannot become untucked from trousers or a skirt. When worn as underwear, it is usually not worn with other underwear. It may be worn with [[panties]] for extra coverage or a bra for extra support. [[Sheer fabric|Sheer]] body stockings are too revealing to be worn alone.

[[File:CSD 2006 Cologne sexy 2.jpg|thumb|A woman wearing a fencenet bodystocking]]

Opaque bodystockings can be worn in place of [[tights]] and a blouse. Bodystockings also come in fishnet, lace and [[satin]], the latter which may just consist of the top portion of the bodystocking, allowing it to be worn underneath a suit jacket to serve as a blouse. These types of bodystockings are also made sheer, enabling the wearer to wear a more revealing outfit coupled with sheer coverage for line smoothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/26/magazine/this-spring-s-under-statements.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=February 26, 1989, New York Times article |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-02-26 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodystockings are put on through the neck, in a similar technique to putting on a pair of tights: the body and arm sections are rolled down and then the legs are scrunched up like stockings; one would put one foot in and pull the stocking part up, and then the same on the other leg; from the waist, the bodystocking is pulled up over the torso to the chest, and then the arms are scrunched up and put on in same way as the legs; and the garment is then adjusted as required, and any ribbons and fasteners tied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funkybodystockings.co.uk/How-to-Wear-a-Bodystocking_ep_44-1.html How to Wear a Bodystocking]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its design, and its close-fitting and one-piece aspect, the wearer may have to remove the bodystocking in order to urinate or defecate, but crotchless bodystockings are also available. If a bodystocking is a foundation garment, all the over clothing will also need to be removed.

==History==
It is unclear when the first bodystocking was made or when it was first worn.

The first notable occasion, was when American actress [[Adah Isaacs Menken]] wore one in 1861 in the play ''Mazeppa'', based on [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s "[[Mazeppa (Byron)|Mazeppa]]", in which she played a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] man who was tied nude to the back of a wild horse by his enemies. In the scene Menken wore a flesh coloured bodystocking to preserve her [[modesty]] while giving the illusion of nudity. The practice created controversy.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks, Daphne A. “Lady Menken’s Secret: Adah Isaacs Menken, Actress Biographies and the Race for Sensation.” ''Legacy'', Volume 15. Number 1. (1998): pages 68-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funkybodystockings.co.uk/History-of-Bodystockings_ep_49-1.html#first |title=History of Bodystockings |publisher=Funky Bodystockings |date= |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A body stocking was used in a [[tableau vivant]] style short film ''The Birth of the Pearl'' (1901)&lt;ref&gt;Produced by [[Frederick S. Armitage]] for the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]].&lt;/ref&gt; which featured an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-coloured body stocking in a direct frontal pose&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms1.html Sex in Cinema: Pre-1920s]&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a provocative view of the female body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmi10/d21.html American Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}

A '''bye''' in sports (and certain other competitions) refers to organizers scheduling a competitor to not participate in a given round of competition, due to one of several circumstances. 

In [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out (single-elimination) tournaments]] this can be granting a special privilege to reward the best ranked participant(s), or to make a working [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]] if the number of participants is not a power of two (e.g. 16 or 32) - or both. 

In [[round-robin tournament]]s, usually one competitor gets a bye in each round when there are an odd number of competitors, as it is impossible for all competitors to play in the same round. However, over the whole tournament, each plays the same number of games as well as sitting out for the same number of rounds.

Similar to the round-robin context, in league sports with weekly regular-season play such as [[gridiron football]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]], a team not scheduled to play on a given week or fixture (competition period) can be said to be on its "bye week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fantasy Football Terms You Need to Know|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/fantasy-football-terms-you-need-to-know.html|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byes are needed if there is an odd number of teams, but can be used even with an even number of teams, as has been done in the NFL.

==Elimination tournaments==

In a standard [[single-elimination tournament]], each round has half the number of teams as the preceding round. Thus the finals will have two, the semi-finals will have four, the quarter finals will have eight, etc. Thus tournaments with competitors numbering a [[Power of two#The first 96 powers of two|power of two]] can have a standard bracket in which all teams are paired up with the loser of each match eliminated and the winner moving on to the next round until only one champion remains.

Therefore, if the number of teams is not a power of two, a simple elimination tournament would eventually produce a round with an odd number of teams (if the number is not odd to start with). For example, a tournament of nine teams could only have four matches in the first round, while a simple tournament of ten teams would produce a second round with five teams, meaning only two matches could occur.
Thus, if the number of participants is not a power of two (e.g. 16 or 32), to make a working [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]] byes are provided to automatically move certain participants into a later round without requiring them to compete in an earlier one. 

When participants are ranked, participants with the highest ranking going into the tournament are given a bye to the second round, as it is generally seen as an advantage to be assured entry into a later round. In the [[National Football League playoffs|NFL playoffs]], for example, the top two division-leaders in each conference are given byes to the second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ob1gui/nflrules.htm |title=NFL PLayoff Seeding &amp; Tie Breaker Rules |publisher=Home.earthlink.net |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) also grants a bye to its two division winners, directly to the division finals as four other teams compete in a semi-final week. In other tournaments where teams are unranked, random draw may be used to determine the byes.

The number of teams offered a bye is generally designed to ensure that the next round consists of a power-of-two number of teams so the tournament can proceed as a simple single-elimination tournament from that round onward. 

If the byes are all single first-round byes into the second round of a tournament, the number of byes required is the difference between the number of teams and the next-highest power of two. For example, a 12-team tournament will require four byes (16−12) to ensure that instead of six teams in the second round, eight advance (as the four byes avoid two of the four teams being eliminated).

===Examples from Gaelic football===
In the Provincial Championships of Gaelic football, some teams receive a bye due to the irregular number of teams competing in each province. The different numbers resulted in different byes alignments in each Provincial Championship.

For example, below is an assessment of the 2012 Provincial Championships, and their use of the "bye".

Seven teams contested the [[Connacht Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Connacht Senior Football Championship]], so a quarter-final was not played by [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]]. Mayo therefore advanced directly to the semi-final to await the winner of the game between [[Leitrim GAA|Leitrim]] and [[London GAA|London]].

Eleven teams contested the [[Leinster Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Leinster Senior Football Championship]], so five teams were given first round byes. Three teams ([[Carlow GAA|Carlow]], [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] and [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]]) played winners of the three preliminary matches, while the other two played each other in the quarter-finals without playing a game in the preliminary round.

Six teams contested the [[Munster Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Munster Senior Football Championship]], so two teams ([[Clare GAA|Clare]] and [[Cork GAA|Cork]]) were permitted to advance to the semi-finals without playing a game in the quarter-finals.

Nine teams contested the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship#2012 Championship|2012 Ulster Senior Football Championship]], so only [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]] played in the preliminary round, while the other seven advanced via bye to the quarter-finals without playing a game in the preliminary round.

==="Double Byes"===

While less common, byes can be offered for multiple rounds (e.g. a "double bye" directly into the third round), or starting in a later round (e.g. the top-ranked team in the first round is given a bye straight to the third round). A bye granted in a later round of the tournament eliminates the need for two byes in the previous round. 
 
In the English [[FA Cup]], the football clubs in the top two [[English football league system#The system|league divisions]] receive two-round byes and enter in the third round "proper" (of eight); the two next-highest divisions' teams will have entered in the first round. Another example is the [[UEFA Europa League]].

The [[WNBA]] also grants double byes to the league's top two seeds, while the next two seeds get first-round byes for their [[WNBA Playoffs|playoffs]].

In [[NCAA Division I]] basketball, the [[2009 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament]] introduced "double byes", as the conference invited all 16 members to participate for the first time (previously only the top twelve were invited). To limit the number of games each round to four, the four highest seeded teams were advanced to the third round of competition, the 5th-8th seeded teams given byes to the second round, and the bottom eight competed the first day. 

Due to the [[2010–2014 NCAA conference realignment|realignment of major conferences]], "double byes" were no longer needed by the Big East after 2013, but were added by the [[2013_SEC_Men's_Basketball_Tournament|SEC in 2013]], the [[2014_ACC_Men's_Basketball_Tournament|ACC in 2014]], and the [[2015_Big_Ten_Conference_Men's_Basketball_Tournament|Big Ten in 2015]].

===Hidden Byes (Play-in Games)===

In certain tournaments, the byes are somewhat disguised. When more teams are given first-round byes than actually compete in the first round, these first games may be referred to as "play-in" games and might not be a formally labelled as a tournament round.

Since 2012, the [[Major League Baseball postseason|Major League Baseball playoffs]] has included ten teams consisting of six division winners and four wildcard teams (the top-ranked non-division-winners). The first round of the playoffs consists two [[Major League Baseball wild-card game|wild-card games]]: single-game matches in which the four wild-card teams are reduced to two. The winners move on to the Divisional series with the six division winners for an eight-team, three-round tournament. Although this is billed as adding two extra "one-game showdowns" to the post-season, it could also be viewed as adding a fourth round to the ten-team tournament with six byes for the division winners. 

The [[FA Cup]] also has certain teams compete in up to 6 preliminary rounds to qualify for the first round "proper". 

Another example is the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Basketball Tournament]], which since 2011 has had 68 teams, effectively granting 60 byes, while eight teams compete in the "First Four" games for remaining four spots in the round of 64. From 2011 to 2015, the "First Four" was considered the first round, the round of 64 played on Thursday and Friday, was called the "second round"; the round of 32 was then called the "third round", consisting of games played on Saturday and Sunday. In 2016, the naming reverted to the round of 64 being the "first round" once again, and the round of 32 being the "second round".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leger |first=Justin |title=NCAA To Rename 'Rounds of 64 and 32' To 'First And Second Rounds' In 2016 |url=http://nesn.com/2014/11/ncaa-to-rename-rounds-of-64-and-32-to-first-and-second-rounds-in-2016/ |publisher=[[New England Sports Network|NESN]] |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though the play-in round and all eight of those teams are officially part of the tournament.

==American and Canadian Football/Rugby Bye weeks==

Certain professional [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[gridiron football|gridiron]] football leagues use the term "bye week" for any week during the regular season in which a team does not play a game. (School teams may also have non-competing weeks, but these are scheduled by individual schools and more commonly termed "open dates".)

===United States===

Each [[National Football League | NFL]] team has one "bye week" during a normal season; this is placed on the team's schedule, usually falling between Week 5 and Week 11 inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating the NFL Schedule|url=https://operations.nfl.com/the-game/creating-the-nfl-schedule/|website=NFL Operations|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The NFL added the bye week in [[1990 NFL season | 1990]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/28/sports/nfl-lengthens-its-season-to-fit-new-tv-arrangement.html|title=N.F.L. Lengthens Its Season To Fit New TV Arrangement|author=Eskenazi, Gerald|date=February 28, 1990|publisher=''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to extend the 16-game regular season schedule to span 17 weeks to increase the number of viewable games for TV contracts. The [[1993 NFL season]] spanned 18 weeks with each team having 2 bye weeks.

During the [[1960 NFL season | 1960]] and [[1966 NFL season | 1966]] NFL seasons, the league had an odd number of teams due to expansion. Each week during those seasons, one team had a bye, including one team each in the first and last week of the season. (Thus, because they had to play all their games with no break in the middle, those two teams effectively had ''no'' byes.) The [[American Football League]] (at the time a completely separate league, but later became the [[American Football Conference]]) also had an odd number of teams in 1966 and 1967 following the addition of the Miami Dolphins, leaving each team with two bye weeks.

Between the [[1999 NFL season| 1999]] through [[2001 NFL season | 2001]] seasons, the NFL had an odd number of teams, 31, as a result of the [[Cleveland Browns]] re-entering the league. Each week during these three seasons featured at least one team with its bye week (the 2001 season also added an additional impromptu league-wide bye the weekend after the [[September 11 attacks]]). The league returned to having an even number of teams (32) in the 2002 season with the addition of the [[Houston Texans]], and implemented the current bye week system.

Sarcastically, the media may refer to a team having a "bye week" if that team is playing an especially bad team and is all but assured of a win.

===Canada===

Traditionally, the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] has had nine teams and required bye weeks. Beginning 2018, each team has three bye weeks and 18 games over a 21-week regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/cfl-to-announce-immediate-end-to-full-contact-practices-1.855515|title=CFL immediately ends full-contact practices|author=Naylor, Dave|date=September 17, 2017|publisher=TSN}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In most seasons, (from 2014 to 2017 and prior to 2007), each team has two bye weeks during the 20 week 18-game regular season.  When the league had only 8 teams, the league usually had no bye weeks.  However between 2007 and 2013, the league had one bye per team over in two weeks in August (4 teams would have a bye during week 6 and the other 4 teams would have a bye on week 7).

===Australia===

In Australia's [[National Rugby League]] (NRL), each team has two byes each season. During the representative period of the season (such as the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]]), byes are generally scheduled to the clubs that are expected to have the most players involved in the representative match, in the round preceding (or following) the representative fixture, to allow those clubs to sufficiently rest those players and prevent them from fielding a weakened side. On the competition ladder, teams are awarded two points (equivalent to a win) during their bye week except for the [[Melbourne Storm]] in 2010, who were barred from receiving premiership points for the remainder of the season as a punishment for [[Melbourne Storm salary cap scandal|gross long-term breaches of the salary cap]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrl.com/melbourne-storm-breach-nrl-salary-cap/tabid/10874/newsid/58359/default.aspx Melbourne Storm breach NRL salary cap], ''NRL.com official website'', 22 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Australian Football League]], which comprises an even number of clubs, gives each club a bye week in mid-season. In  [[1915 VFL season|1915]], [[1919 VFL season|1919]] [[1924 VFL season|to 1924]], [[1942 VFL season|1942]] [[1943 VFL season|and 1943]], [[1991 AFL season|1991]] [[1994 AFL season|to 1994]] and [[2011 AFL season|2011]], when there were an odd number of clubs competing, each club was given two byes.

In both leagues, and under many other professional and amateur sports leagues in Australia, higher placed teams don't earn byes during [[playoffs|finals]], but instead the opportunity not to be eliminated by losing their first-round match (also called a double chance).  This practice is common in Australia, but it is not used in most other countries, to earn an easier passage to the Grand Final as reward for finishing higher on the ladder.  This is different from a double elimination format, in which a team has to lose both in the tournament and the repechage to be eliminated.

== Gymnastics ==

In a variation of the round-robin case, at certain high-level competitions in [[artistic gymnastics]], teams cycle through the apparatuses in an "Olympic Order" with scheduled byes in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grassie |first1=Julia |title=Gymnastics 101: Competition format |url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/gymnastics-101-competition-format |website=NBCOlympics.com |publisher=NBC Universal |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the [[NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championships]] has 36 teams with six teams apiece at six  regional sites, with 12 advancing to two semifinal rounds of six that decide participants for the final "Super Six".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/2018-womens-gymnastics-bracket.pdf|title=Womens Gymnastics Bracket|publisher=NCAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=September 2018}} In each of these nine sextets, each team  competes during four of six "rotations" with the other two as byes - scheduled before the parallel bars and the floor exercise. For example, Semifinal II of the 2018 championships operated as follows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/2018-womens-gymnastics-2018.pdf|title=Womens Gymnastics 2018|publisher=NCAA}} &lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}

==Swiss system tournaments==
In a [[Swiss-system tournament]] with an odd number of players, one player gets a bye in each round, but not all players will get a bye (as there are fewer rounds than there are players). However, as with the case of NFL "bye weeks", these "byes" do not confer any advantage, or in the case of a seeded tournament, that any player/team receiving one is perceived as any better than one that does not, as all of the participants receive one, whereas the awarding of a bye in a single-elimination tournament most definitely does, in both cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">'''Closed kinetic chain exercises''' or '''closed chain exercises''' (CKC) are [[physical exercise]]s performed where the [[hand]] (for arm movement) or [[foot]] (for leg movement) is fixed in space and cannot move. The extremity remains in constant contact with the immobile surface, usually the ground or the base of a machine.

The opposite of CKC exercises are [[open kinetic chain exercises]] (OKC).

Closed chain exercises are often compound movements, that generally incur compressive forces, while open-chain exercises are often isolation movements that promote more shearing forces.&lt;ref&gt;Electromyographic evaluation of closed and open kinetic chain knee rehabilitation exercises. Graham VL, Gehlsen GM, Edwards JA. J Athl Train. 1993 Spring;28(1):23-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

CKC exercises involve more than one muscle group and joint simultaneously rather than concentrating solely on one, as many OKC exercises do (single-joint movements), lending the former to more utilitarian and athletic activities.&lt;ref&gt;The relationship between open and closed kinetic chain strength of the lower limb and jumping performance.

'''Club-level seating''' is a special section of seating in modern sports [[stadium]]s and [[arena]]s.

The club level is usually located towards the middle of the stage of seating sections, above the lower deck but below the upper deck. They are usually situated near the [[luxury box]]es, whether right above, right below, or sandwiched between two levels of luxury boxes. Club-level seating is typically considered a more exclusive class of seating than elsewhere in the venue, other than the luxury boxes.

Unlike some luxury box levels, most club levels do not wrap entirely around the venue. Some club levels stop at a certain point, giving way to an expansion of the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]], while others give way to lower-class luxury boxes (such as "party suites"). A notable exception to this is [[Emirates Stadium]] in [[London]], which has a complete tier of club seating.

Club levels normally provide fans several additional amenities than standard seating. Club-level seating is open to the elements, as opposed to the entirely enclosed luxury boxes, which gives more of an outdoor impression at roofless and open-roof stadiums and arenas. Club-level seating is normally bought on a contract basis to allow for maximum profit on the part of the venue.

The club level provides fans with special access to an indoor part of the venue exclusive to fans with special tickets. These areas are climate-controlled year-round and allow access to special restaurants, bars, merchandise stands, and lounge areas of the venue. Concession stands and vendors on the club level also often offer different menus than in other stands to give more of a special feel to the club. These areas are closed off to the rest of the venue, and they usually can only be accessed through the exclusive, private club entrances.

'''Collegiate wrestling''', is practiced at the college and university level in the United States. This style, with some slight modifications, is also practiced at the high school and [[middle school]] levels, and also among younger participants, where it is known as [[scholastic wrestling]]. These names help distinguish collegiate wrestling from other styles of wrestling that are practiced around the world such as those in the [[Olympic Games]]: [[freestyle wrestling]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling]].

Collegiate and freestyle wrestling, unlike Greco-Roman, also both allow the use of the wrestler's or his opponent's legs in offense and defense. However, collegiate wrestling has had so many influences from the wide variety of folk wrestling styles brought into the country that it has become distinctly [[American culture|American]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Contrast with the international styles==
[[File:Students wrestling 10.jpg|thumb|325px|In collegiate wrestling, great emphasis is placed on one wrestler's control of the opponent on the mat, usually by controlling the opponent's legs or torso. When a wrestler gains control and maintains restraining power over an opponent, as seen here, he is said to be in the position of advantage.]]
[[File:Throw.jpg|thumb|165px|Throws can be performed in collegiate wrestling, but there is not as much emphasis placed on them as in the international styles.]]

Collegiate wrestling differs in a number of ways from [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]].

There are some scoring differences. For example, in collegiate wrestling, "exposure" points are not given to a wrestler for simply forcing the opponent's shoulders to quickly rotate and be exposed to the mat. Instead, for example, a wrestler must control one of the opponent's shoulders on the mat and have the opponent's other shoulder forced to the mat at an angle of 45 degrees or less for two to five seconds to score. The points generated in this situation are called "near fall" points. This shows a difference in focus: while the international styles encourage explosive action and risk, collegiate wrestling encourages and rewards control over the opponent.

This emphasis on control was present in collegiate wrestling from its earliest days. Since 1915, collegiate wrestling officials have recorded the time that each participant had in controlling his opponent on the mat (known as "time advantage" or "riding time"). Early on, this was the major way to determine the winner in the absence of a fall. Over time, the significance of such timekeeping has declined, and now such "time advantage" only counts for one point in college competition at the most.&lt;ref&gt;"Wrestling, Freestyle" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1192, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; As in both of the international styles, a wrestler can win the match by [[Pin (amateur wrestling)|pinning]] both of his opponent's [[shoulder]]s or both of his opponent's [[scapula]]e (shoulder blades) to the mat.

In collegiate wrestling, there is an additional position to commence wrestling after the first period, and also to resume wrestling after various other situations. All three styles begin a match with both wrestlers facing each other on their feet with the opportunity given to both to score a [[takedown (grappling)|takedown]] and thus gain control over the opponent. In collegiate wrestling, once a takedown is scored, the wrestler under control in the inferior (defensive or bottom) position remains there until he escapes the move, until he reverses the position, until the period ends, or until various penalty situations occur. The inferior position is similar to a choice for a starting position in the second and third periods, known as the ''referee's position''. The referee's position is roughly analogous to the "par terre" starting position in the international wrestling styles. In the international styles, the "par terre" starting position is not utilized as often as the referee's position is in collegiate wrestling. In the two international styles, the inferior position in the "par terre" starting position is now used to penalize a wrestler who has committed an illegal act.

In collegiate wrestling, there is a de-emphasis on "[[Throw (grappling)|throws]]", or maneuvers where the other wrestler is taken off his feet, taken through the air, and lands on his back or shoulders. This lack of emphasis on throws is another example of how collegiate wrestling emphasizes dominance or control, as opposed to the element of risk and explosive action. A legal throw in collegiate wrestling is awarded the same number of points as any other takedown. In freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, points awarded for a wrestler's takedowns increase with the level of explosiveness seen in the throws. Well-executed throws can even win a period in the international styles, especially when a throw is of grand amplitude (a throw in which a wrestler takes an opponent off of the mat and controls his opponent so that his feet go directly above his head). In collegiate wrestling, some of the throws seen in the international styles may even be illegal, such as a [[German suplex|full-back suplex from a rear standing position]]. However, many collegiate wrestlers still incorporate some throws into their repertoire of moves because a thrown opponent often lands on his back or shoulders and thus in a position more conducive to producing near fall points or securing a fall.

Generally, rather than lifting the opponent or throwing him for grand amplitude in order to win the period as in the international styles, the collegiate wrestler most often seeks to take his opponent down to the mat and perform a "breakdown" (that is, to get his opponent in the defensive position flat on his stomach or side). With the opponent off of his base of support (that is, off of his hands and knees), the collegiate wrestler in the offensive position would then seek to run pinning combinations, or combinations of techniques designed to secure a fall. Failing to gain a fall could still result in an advantage in riding time and potential nearfall points.

The defensive wrestler could counter such attempts for a takedown, or when once taken down try to escape his opponent's control or reverse control altogether. In a last-ditch attempt to foil a fall, the defensive wrestler could also "bridge" out of his opponent's control (that is, pry his head, his back, and both of his feet up from the mat and then turn toward his stomach). Overall, a collegiate wrestler in his techniques would most likely emphasize physical control and dominance over the opponent on the mat.

==History==
{{Main article|History of collegiate wrestling}}

===American wrestling in the early colonial era===
There were already wrestling styles among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] varying from tribe and nation by the 15th and 16th centuries, when the first Europeans settled. The English and French who settled on the North American continent sought out wrestling as a popular pastime. Soon, there were local champions in every settlement, with contests between them on a regional level. The colonists in what would become the United States started out with something more akin to Greco-Roman wrestling, but soon found that style too restrictive in favor of a style which a greater allowance of holds.&lt;ref name=DellingerBobWrestling&gt;{{cite web

The Irish were known for their "[[collar-and-elbow]]" style, in which wrestlers at the start of the match would grasp each other by the collar with one hand and by the elbow with the other. From this position, wrestlers sought to achieve a fall. If no fall occurred, the wrestlers would continue grappling both standing on their feet and on the ground until a fall was made. Irish immigrants later brought this style to the United States where it soon became widespread. There was also what became known as "catch-as-catch-can" wrestling, which had a particular following in Great Britain and the variant developed in [[Lancashire]] had a particular effect on future [[freestyle wrestling]] in particular.&lt;ref name=PoliakoffFreestyle1190&gt;"Wrestling, Freestyle" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1190, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th and 19th century United States===
By the 18th century, wrestling soon became recognized as a legitimate spectator sport, despite its roughness.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; Among those who were well known for their wrestling techniques were several U.S. Presidents. Since "catch-as-catch-can" wrestling was very similar, it gained great popularity in fairs and festivals in the United States during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt; The collar-and-elbow style was also refined by later Irish immigrants, and gained great ground because of the success of George William Flagg from [[Vermont]], the wrestling champion of the [[Army of the Potomac]]. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[freestyle wrestling]] began to emerge as a distinct sport, and soon spread rapidly in the United States. Professional wrestling also emerged in the late 19th century (not like the "sports-entertainment" seen today).&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt; By the 1880s, American wrestling became organized, with matches often being conducted alongside [[gymnastic]] meets and [[boxing]] tournaments in athletic clubs.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; The growth of cities, industrialization, and the closing of the frontier provided the necessary avenue for sports such as wrestling to increase in popularity.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt;

===20th century===

In 1903, the first intercollegiate dual meet took place between [[Yale University]] and [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;"1903–1927" by Jairus K. Hammond from ''The History of Collegiate Wrestling'', p 1., (Stillwater OK, National Wrestling Hall of Fame, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Yale News'' February 27, 1903 p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association]] held its first tournament in 1905, which soon sparked many more wrestling tournaments for both college and university students and high school students.&lt;ref name=PoliakoffFreestyle1191&gt;"Wrestling, Freestyle" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1191, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Clark Gallagher]], a [[College football|football]] and [[track and field]] athlete at Oklahoma A&amp;M College (now [[Oklahoma State University]]), launched wrestling as an official varsity sport just before [[World War I]] and with his team launched a dynasty, with undefeated matches from 1921 to 1931.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; In 1927, Raymond G. Clapp published the rules for collegiate wrestling, and the next year, the first [[NCAA Wrestling Team Championship]] took place on March 30 to 31 on the campus of [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]]. The rules of collegiate wrestling marked a sharp contrast to the freestyle wrestling rules of the [[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|International Amateur Wrestling Federation]] (IAWF) and the [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]].&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1191" /&gt; From then on, collegiate wrestling emerged as a distinctly American sport. College and high school wrestling grew especially after the standardization of the NCAA wrestling rules, which applied early on to both collegiate and scholastic wrestling (with high school modifications). More colleges, universities, and junior colleges began offering dual meets and tournaments, including championships and having organized wrestling seasons. There were breaks in wrestling seasons because of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], but in the high schools especially, state association wrestling championships sprung up in different regions throughout the 1930s and 1940s. As amateur wrestling grew after World War II, various collegiate athletic conferences also increased the number and quality of their wrestling competition, with more wrestlers making the progression of wrestling in high school, being recruited by college coaches, and then entering collegiate competition.

For most of the 20th century, collegiate wrestling was the most popular form of [[amateur wrestling]] in the country, especially in the [[Midwest]] and the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]].&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; The 1960s and 1970s saw major developments in collegiate wrestling, with the emergence of the United States Wrestling Federation (USWF) (now known as [[USA Wrestling]] (USAW)). The USWF, with its membership of coaches, educators, and officials, became recognized eventually as the official governing body of American wrestling and as the official representative to the [[United States Olympic Committee]], in place of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Collegiate wrestling teams compete for the [[NCAA Wrestling Team Championship]] each year in each of the three divisions. The NCAA awards individual championships in the 10 weight classes, as well as a team title.

==Weight classes==
{{further information|Wrestling weight classes}}

The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) is the organization that regulates collegiate wrestling. The wrestling rules developed by the NCAA are followed by each of the NCAA's three divisions. In addition, the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA), and the [[National Collegiate Wrestling Association]] (NCWA) have also adopted them, with some modifications. The NCAA generally sets the standard for weight classes for college-level dual meets, multiple duals, and tournaments. There are 10 main weight classes currently open to college-level competition, ranging from 125&amp;nbsp;lb to the Heavyweight division that ranges from 183&amp;nbsp;lb to 285&amp;nbsp;lb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=p.

&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is a 235&amp;nbsp;lb weight class, which only the National Collegiate Wrestling Association, the organization that governs college wrestling for institutions outside the NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA, currently allows that ranges from 174&amp;nbsp;lb to 235&amp;nbsp;lb. The NCWA also allows eight weight classes for women ranging from 105&amp;nbsp;lb to 200&amp;nbsp;lb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; A wrestler must normally have his weight assessed by a member of the institution's athletics medical staff (e.g. a physician, certified athletic trainer, or registered dietician) before the first official team practice.  The weight assessed is then his minimum weight class. The athletics medical staff member and the head coach then review all of the assessed weights of the wrestling team members and certify them online at the website of the National Wrestling Coaches Association (NWCA). After the certification, the wrestler may not compete below that weight class and may only compete at one weight class higher than his minimum weight. If a wrestler does gain weight over his certified weight class and wrestles at two weight classes above it, he forfeits his previous lowest weight class for the one weight class below where he wrestled. If a contestant wishes to weigh-in and wrestle at only one weight class above his certified weight class and later return to his lowest certified weight class, he may do so. However, the wrestler may only return to that certified weight class according to the weight-loss plan of the National Wrestling Coaches Association. This weight loss plan takes into account potential dehydration during the wrestling season and minimum amounts of [[body fat]]. All of this has been done in order to protect the wrestler's health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-81-WR-87 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season structure==
The collegiate wrestling season customarily runs from October or November to March. Regular season competition begins in late October or early November and continues until February. Post-season competition usually continues from February to March (depending on, if individual wrestlers or teams qualify for a conference, regional, or national championship). Normally, wrestling teams from two different colleges or universities would compete in what is known as a '''dual meet'''. It is possible for there also to be a '''multiple dual''', where more than two wrestling teams compete against each other at the same event on the same day. For example, one college wrestling team may face another wrestling team for the first dual, and then a third wrestling team for the second dual. Also, those two wrestling teams may compete against each other in a dual meet as well. Colleges and universities often compete within their particular athletic conference; though competition outside a team's conference or even outside its division within the NCAA is not uncommon.

===Dual meets===
Dual meets usually take place on evenings during the [[school week]] (Monday through Friday); on Saturday mornings, afternoons, or evenings; or even on Sunday mornings or afternoons during the wrestling season and begin with weigh-ins at a maximum of one hour before the meet begins. No weight allowances are made for dual meets and multiple-day dual meets. Wrestlers are also examined by a physician or a certified athletic trainer for any communicable skin diseases. If a student-wrestler does not make weight, he is ineligible for that weight class and a forfeit is scored. If there are any communicable skin diseases, it is a ground for disqualification. The wrestler's coach or athletic trainer can provide written documentation from a physician that a skin infection of a wrestler would not be communicable. The final judgement for whether a wrestler would be allowed to compete lies with the meet physician or athletic trainer on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-88, WR-90, WR-92-WR-94 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, after determining the sequence of weight classes for the dual meet, the referee will call the wrestlers from each team who have been designated as captains. One of the visiting captains will call a disk toss. The colored disk will then fall to the floor and determine: 1) which team has the choice of position at the start of the second period and 2) which one of the team's members is to appear first on the mat when called by the referee for each weight class. The wrestler-captain who won the disk toss may choose the even or odd weight classes. That is, he may choose the weight classes, from lowest to highest, that are numbered evenly or oddly. For example, the 125&amp;nbsp;lb, 141&amp;nbsp;lb, 157&amp;nbsp;lb, etc. weight classes would be odd, and the 133&amp;nbsp;lb, 149&amp;nbsp;lb, 165&amp;nbsp;lb, etc. weight classes would be even. This order would work in the traditional sequence until the last even weight class of 285&amp;nbsp;lb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-11-WR-12 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

During a dual meet, the top [[varsity team|varsity]] wrestlers usually compete against each other. There can also be [[junior varsity team|junior varsity]] matches, such as in [[Iowa]], which are rare, that would take place immediately before the varsity matches. Also, before both varsity (and junior varsity) competition, there can also be an '''exhibition match''' in one or more weight classes. The exhibition matches do not count towards the varsity (or junior varsity) team score, but such matches allow wrestlers, especially at the freshmen level, to gain more competitive experience. Wrestling matches usually proceed in each of the 10 weight classes. The order the matches occur in is determined after the weigh-ins either by a mutual decision of the coaches or by a random draw choosing a particular weight class to be featured first. In either case, the succeeding wrestling matches will follow in sequence. For example, if the 157&amp;nbsp;lb weight class competes first, the succeeding wrestling matches will follow until the heavyweight class. Then, beginning at 125&amp;nbsp;lb, the rest of the matches will follow until the 149&amp;nbsp;lb match.&lt;ref name=NCAAWR11&gt;{{cite web

===Tournaments===
[[File:Wrestling redux004.jpg|thumb|250px|Rather than seeking to execute high-amplitude throws, the collegiate wrestler will try most of all to break down his opponent in order to turn him over and secure a near fall or a pin.]]

Often, many colleges and universities in the United States will compete with their teams in what is known as a tournament. In the tournament, from eight, 16, 32, 64, 75, or more individual wrestlers/teams can compete in each bracket. This allows many schools to establish their rankings, not only for individual student-wrestlers, but also for college and university wrestling teams as a whole (e.g. a conference or regional championship, or the [[NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships]]). A tournament committee usually administers the event and after individual and team entries have been verified, the officials then determine the order of the matches (called "drawing") by certain brackets (e.g. brackets of eight, 16, etc.). The tournament officials when doing this drawing take into account each wrestler's win-loss record, previous tournament placements, and other factors that indicate the wrestler's ability. With that in mind, wrestlers who are noticed as having the most superior records are bracketed so that two top-ranked superior wrestlers in each weight class do not compete against each other in an early round. This is called seeding. Tournaments are often sponsored by a college or university and are usually held on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or over any of two days within the [[Workweek|weekend]]. Admission is often charged to cover costs and make a small profit for the host. A tournament begins with weigh-ins starting two hours or less before competition begins on the first day or one hour or less before competitions begins on any subsequent day. An allowance of one pound is granted for each subsequent day of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-35-WR-36, WR-89-WR-90 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
With the drawing and weigh-ins completed, wrestlers then compete in two brackets in each of the 10 weight classes. If there are not enough wrestlers to fill up the bracket in a weight class, a bye will be awarded to a wrestler who does not have to compete against another wrestler in his pairing. After taking account the number of byes, the first round in each weight class then begins. Most college wrestling tournaments are in [[double elimination]] format. The last two wrestlers in the upper (championship) bracket wrestle for first place in the finals, with the loser winning second place. In other words, a wrestler cannot place higher than third if he is knocked down to the lower (wrestle-back) bracket by losing in the championship semi-finals. This is largely the result of time constraints: one-day tournaments often last into the evening. If the winner of the wrestle-back bracket were allowed to challenge the winner of the championship bracket in the championship, the tournament could continue well past midnight before finishing.&lt;ref name=NCAAWR3640&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-36-WR-40 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first match of the round of 16 in a championship bracket in each weight class, the wrestle-back rounds would then commence, beginning among all of the wrestlers who lost to the winners of the round of 16. The winner of the wrestle-back finals would then win third place, with the loser winning fourth place. In tournaments where six places are awarded, the losers of the wrestle-back semi-finals would wrestle for fifth place, with the loser winning sixth place. If eight places are awarded, the losers of the wrestle-back quarterfinals would wrestle for seventh place, with the loser winning eighth place, and so on. After the championships finals, the awards ceremony usually takes place with plaques, medals, trophies, or other awards given to the individual and team winners with the highest placements. Precise rules for tournaments may vary from one event to the next.&lt;ref name="NCAAWR3640" /&gt;

Each intercollegiate athletic conference or geographic area features two or three "elite" tournaments every year. These events are by invitation only. Hence, the commonly used name for them, Invitationals. Tournament sponsors (which are usually colleges and universities, but sometimes other organizations) invite the best varsity wrestlers from their area to compete against each other. Many elite tournaments last two or even three days. For this reason, elite tournaments are often scheduled during the college's or university's winter break.

Between one season and the next, postseason tournaments and preseason tournaments are often held in collegiate wrestling and also in [[freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and Greco-Roman. The most active wrestlers often take part in those to sharpen their skills and techniques. Also, clinics and camps are often held for both wrestlers and their coaches to help refresh old techniques and gain new strategies. College wrestlers often serve as referees, volunteer coaches, assistants, or as counselors during many of the camps, clinics, and tournaments held during the off-season.

==Layout of the mat==
[[File:Kicking Out.jpg|thumb|175px|The college wrestler in light blue is attempting a takedown to the mat, but not without a counter by the defensive wrestler in white.]]

The match takes place on a thick rubber mat that is shock-absorbing to ensure safety.  A large outer circle between 32 and 42 feet in diameter that designates the wrestling area is marked on the mat. The circumference line of that circle is called the boundary line. The wrestling area is surrounded by a mat area or apron (or protection area) that is at least five inches in width that helps prevent serious injury. The mat area is designated by the use of contrasting colors or a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} line, which is part of the wrestling area and included in bounds. The wrestlers are within bounds when any part of either wrestler is on or inside this boundary line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-12-WR-13, WR-20 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The mat can be no thicker than four inches nor thinner than a mat with the shock-absorbing qualities of a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} hair-felt mat. Inside the outer circle is usually an inner circle about 10 feet in diameter, designated by the use of contrasting colors or a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} line, although this is no longer specified by the ''NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations''. Wrestlers are encouraged to stay near the center of the mat within the inner circle, or else they risk being penalized for stalling (that is, deliberately attempting to slow down the action of the match). Each wrestler begins action at one of two one-inch starting lines inside the inner circle that is three feet long. Two one-inch lines close the ends of the starting lines and are marked &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; for the wrestler from the visiting team and &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; for the wrestler from the home team.&lt;ref name="NCAAWR11" /&gt; The two starting lines are 10&amp;nbsp;inches apart from each other and form a rectangle in the middle of the wrestling area. This rectangle designates the starting positions for the three periods. Additional padding may be added under the mat to protect the wrestlers, especially if the wrestlers are competing on a concrete floor. All mats that are in sections are secured together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-12-WR-13 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}

==Equipment==
* A [[Wrestling singlet|singlet]] is a one-piece wrestling garment made of [[spandex]] that should provide a tight and comfortable fit for the wrestler. It is made from nylon or [[lycra]] and prevents an opponent from using anything on the wrestler as leverage. The singlets are usually light or dark depending on whether the wrestlers are competing at home or abroad, and they are usually designed according to the institution's or club's team colors. Wrestlers also have the option of wearing [[leggings]] with their singlets.&lt;ref name=NCAAWR1314&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-13-WR-14 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}

== Injuries and infections ==
Injuries and infections are not uncommon in the sport of wrestling since there is so much contact. Also, infections occur frequently due to body secretions ( sweat, saliva, and blood).

'''[[Concussion]]s'''

Common ways of getting concussions are any head to head hits or any hits that involve a hard blow to the skull. Every year nearly 135,000 children ranging from age 5 to 18 are treated for concussions and other head injures from sports or other recreational activities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Wrestling/features/2013/november/14/heads-up-best-practices-for-dealing-with-concussions|title=Archived Feature: Heads Up Best Practices for Dealing with Concussions|website=Team USA|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many concussions come from sports such as wrestling, football, boxing and any other sport that risks getting hit in the head. Wearing head gear can help prevent concussions. Also wearing a frontal paid that protects the forehead and top of the head is very effective in protecting the head from a hit that may cause a concussion. Wearing a mouth piece can help prevent concussions as well.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopsportsinjuries.org/STOP/Prevent_Injuries/Wrestling_Injury_Prevention.aspx|title=Wrestling Injury Prevention|website=www.stopsportsinjuries.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Cauliflower ear]]'''

Cauliflower ear is a blood clot that forms under the skin in the ear, causing there to be a large bump in the ear; the bump tends to be extremely hard. To develop cauliflower ear one must be hit in the ear many times or hit hard for it to form into a blood clot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/en/kids/cauliflower-ear.html|title=What's Cauliflower Ear?|website=kidshealth.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When having cauliflower ear it is important to get the ear drained of liquid that has built up. Otherwise the ear will require surgery to return to normal shape and size. The best way to prevent cauliflower is to wear headgear. This will protect the ears from taking hard hits.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

'''Ligament injuries'''

Knee ligament injuries are a common injury in wrestling. One being an injury to the [[Medial collateral ligament]] which is also known as the MCL and is located on the inside. Another common injury to the knee is on the outside [[Fibular collateral ligament|Lateral Collateral Ligament]] which is known as the LCL. Leg or knee injuries are commonly caused by over twisting the leg outward from the middle of the body.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

'''Sprains and strains'''

[[Sprained ankle|Ankle sprains]] and wrist sprains are common in wrestling. Ankle sprains typically occur from twisting the ankle and injuring the ligaments within the ankle. Wrist sprains occur from falling hard on the wrist and damaging the ligaments in the wrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.verywell.com/common-wrestling-injuries-3120257|title=Common Wrestling Injuries|website=Verywell|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Prepatellar bursitis]]'''

Is caused from the inflammation of a sac in the front of the knee cap which swells up and can be painful. Preventing this can be done by wearing a knee pad to help reduce impact on the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopsportsinjuries.org/STOP/Prevent_Injuries/Wrestling_Injury_Prevention.aspx|title=Wrestling Injury Prevention|website=www.stopsportsinjuries.org|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Overtraining|Overtraining syndrome]]'''

Is caused by overexerting. The body symptoms are fatigue, lack of motivation, losing body weight, decreased performance, depression, [[insomnia]] and immune system weakening. This can affect the athlete mentally as well as physically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exercisemed.org/research-blog/overtraining-its-effects-on.html|title=Overtraining: its effects on performance and psychological state {{!}} Exercise Medicine|website=www.exercisemed.org|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skin disease'''

Taking showers regularly, wearing clean clothes for practice, mopping the mats with an antiseptic solution will also prevent spread and growth of diseases&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

'''[[Impetigo]]'''

Impetigo is a highly contagious skin infection. They appear as red or yellowish bumps and sores that are clustered together they may increase in size. The sores can burst which then crust over with a yellowish or brownish scab.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/impetigo/basics/definition/con-20024185|title=Impetigo – Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This infection can be spread by coming into contact with a person who has the infection. Another way to contract impetigo is by touching or using equipment or from the mats that are infected by the bacteria. If impetigo is left untreated other infections could occur which can cause serious health issues. The bumps cause no pain although, they may be itchy. Once the blisters pop they crust over with a yellow brownish scab but, they can still be red and itchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wrestling.isport.com/wrestling-guides/common-wrestling-skin-diseases|title=Common Wrestling Skin Diseases {{!}} iSport.com|website=wrestling.isport.com|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayo clinic states that "Classic signs and symptoms of impetigo involve red sores that quickly rupture, ooze for a few days and then form a yellowish-brown crust. The sores usually occur around the nose and mouth but can be spread to other areas of the body by fingers, clothing and towels".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Impetigo comes from a bacterium known as staphylococcus aureus.
* '''Certain sports.''' Participating in sports like wrestling and football where skin to skin contact is always happening you may increase your risk of developing a skin infection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
'''[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]'''

MRSA is an infection that has a resistance to certain antibiotics this is why MRSA is so dangerous and hard to treat. MRSA stands for Methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus, which is a form of a staph infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mrsa/basics/definition/con-20024479|title=MRSA infection – Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any athlete who develops a skin infection should be checked by doctor immediately. Also, one should resist from trying to give themselves self care. When getting MRSA treated for they tend to make an incision and drain the infected area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/health-and-safety/medical-conditions/methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-and-athletics|title=Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) and Athletics|last=nslabaugh|website=NCAA.org – The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; MRSA can become life-threatening if it reaches the blood stream it also can cause infections on surgical sites that can cause major implications, and can even cause an pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/|title=Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Infections {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Dermatophytosis|Ringworm]]'''

Is a fungal or yeast infection on the skin in the shape of a circle. It appears to be red and the outer ring may be slightly raised. The infection grows while in warm moist places and tends to be itchy. One can contract the infection by touching the area that is infected or items that are contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001439.htm|title=Ringworm: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herpetic lesions'''

These lesions are all Type one infections also known specifically as [[Herpes simplex]], Herpes Zoster, and [[Herpes gladiatorum|Herpes Gladiatorial]] are all types of herpes that are common in skin to skin contact sports. [[Genital herpes|Type two herpes]] is known as herpes on the genitals which is spread through sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.herpes.org.nz/patient-info/all-facts/|title=Get the facts about herpes and Genital Herpes|website=www.herpes.org.nz|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lesions come from skin to skin contact or body secretions. The skin starts to develop blisters which can happen anywhere on the body. To return to any activity one must be cleared by a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/wrestling-and-skin-conditions-what-is-that|title=Wrestling and Skin Conditions – What Is THAT? :: Nationwide Children's Hospital|website=www.nationwidechildrens.org|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herpes Simplex is the virus that causes [[Herpes labialis|cold sores]] this virus can be spread by oral seceretions and can also cause Herpes Gladiatorial. Once a person becomes infected the virus stays in the body forever and can reactivate itself anytime causing cold sores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/herpessimplex.html|title=Herpes Simplex: MedlinePlus|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herpes Gladiatorial is a skin infection. it comes from the Herpes Simplex virus which is causes the same lesion one has when they have a cold sore. This form of herpes is on the skin and can be spread through contact with others or sharing beverages with someone who is infected or using anything that they may have contaminated. This virus remains in your system and can reactivate itself at any time causing lesions to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/athletic_skin_infections/herpes.htm|title=Viral Skin Infection: Herpes gladiatorum ("Mat Herpes")|website=www.health.ny.gov|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herpes Zoster is the virus which causes [[shingles]] and [[Chickenpox|chicken pox]]. Once one has had the chicken pox they carry the virus forever. Once one has chicken pox the virus is inactive but, if it becomes active again they get the shingles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/about/transmission.html|title=Shingles {{!}} Transmission – How Spreads {{!}} Herpes Zoster {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The match==
[[File:Wrestling assignment.jpg|thumb|200px|At the start of the first period, the two wrestlers are in the neutral position, as shown.]]
[[File:Wrestling falconfrenzy158.jpg|thumb|200px|Usually at the start of the second and third periods, both wrestlers start in the referee's position, with one wrestler on the bottom with hands spread out and feet held together, and one wrestler on the top with one hand around the opponent's waist for control and the other on the opponent's elbow.]]

A match is a competition between two individual wrestlers of the same weight class. The match consists of three periods totaling seven minutes in college matches&lt;ref name="NCAAWR10,28"/&gt; (with an [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] round if necessary if the score is tied at the end of regulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-29–31 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The main official at the wrestling match is the [[Referee#Wrestling .28amateur.29|referee]], who is in full control in matters of judgement at the competition and is responsible for starting and stopping the match; observing all holds; signaling points; calling penalties such as illegal holds, unnecessary roughness, fleeing the mat, or flagrant misconduct; and finally observing a full view of and determining the fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-72–75 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be one assistant referee (especially at tournaments) that helps the referee with making any difficult decisions and in preventing error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-75–77 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Also, scorers are there to record the points of the two individual wrestlers. Finally, a match or meet timekeeper with assistant timekeepers are present to note the match time, timeouts, and time advantage and work with the scorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-77–79 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Period format===
*'''Pre-match'''
Each wrestler is called by the referee, steps onto the mat, and may put on a &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; (for the home team) or &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; (for the visiting team) anklet about three inches wide which the referee will use to indicate scoring. The [[referee]] then prepares the wrestlers to begin the first period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |page=WR-11, WR-15, WR-27 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''First period'''
The referee prepares both wrestlers for the first period by making sure each wrestler is correctly in the '''neutral position'''. The neutral position has the two wrestlers standing opposite each other on their feet. Each wrestler starts with his lead foot on the green or red area of the starting lines, and his other foot even with or behind the lead foot. Both wrestlers then usually slightly crouch with their arms in front of them at or above waist level. In this position, neither wrestler is in control.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Sports Dictionary'', p. 282, (Springfield, MA: G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. (now Merriam-Webster), 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; When the referee is certain that both wrestlers are correctly in the neutral position, he blows the whistle to begin the first period (as well as whenever wrestling is resumed, such as at the beginning of the second and third periods, when contestants resume wrestling after going out of bounds, etc.). The match commences with each wrestler attempting to ''take down'' his opponent. The first period in college and university matches is three minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-10, WR-18, WR-28 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Second period'''
If the match is not ended by a fall, technical fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers to begin the second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this is determined by the colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;-colored side and a &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in a place called the '''referee's position''' on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action at the center of the mat with one wrestler (in the '''defensive starting position''') on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the '''offensive starting position''') then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (with the palm of his hand against the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control.&lt;ref name=WSD348&gt;''Webster's Sports Dictionary'', p. 348, (Springfield, MA: G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. (now Merriam-Webster), 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-18–19, WR-28-WR-29 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, another starting position choice has been allowed, known as the '''optional offensive starting position''' or '''optional start'''. After the wrestler with the choice (the offensive wrestler) indicates his intention to the referee, the referee lets the defensive wrestler adjust and begin in the defensive starting position. Next, the offensive wrestler goes to either side of the defensive wrestler or behind him, with all his weight supported by both his feet or by one or both knees. The offensive wrestler would then place both his hands on the opponent's back between the neck and the waist. When the referee starts the match by blowing the whistle, the defensive wrestler then has the opportunity to get back to his feet in a neutral position.&lt;ref name="National Collegiate Athletic Association"&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |page=WR-19 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any of the starting positions may be used to resume action during a period when the wrestlers go off the mat, depending on the referee's judgment as to whether any or which wrestler had the position of advantage.&lt;ref name="WSD348" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |page=WR-20 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The second period is two minutes long.&lt;ref name=NCAAWR10,28&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-10, WR-28 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Third period'''
If the match is not ended by a fall, technical fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers to begin the third period. The wrestler who did not choose the starting position for the second period now chooses the starting position. The third period is also two minutes long.&lt;ref name="NCAAWR10,28" /&gt;

*'''First overtime round'''
::*'''Sudden victory period'''
If the third period ends in a tie, a one-minute, sudden victory period occurs.  Both wrestlers start in the neutral position. The first wrestler to score a takedown wins. Time advantage is not used in any sudden victory period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-29 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

::*'''Tiebreaker periods'''
If no points are scored in the sudden victory period, or if the first points were scored simultaneously, two 30-second tiebreaker periods occur.  Both wrestlers start in the referee's position. The wrestler who scored the first points (besides escapes and penalty points) in regulation has the choice of top or bottom position. If the only points scored in regulation were for escapes or penalties, the choice of position will be given to the winner of a colored disk toss. After the wrestler makes his choice, the two contestants then wrestle. Either of the two wrestlers must try to score as many points as he can.  Once one 30-second period is over, the wrestler who was in the bottom position then wrestles on the top in another 30-second period. Whoever scores the most points (or is awarded a fall, default, or disqualification) wins the match. Time advantage is kept, and points are awarded accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-29–30 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Second overtime round'''
If no wrestler has won by the end of the two tiebreaker periods, a second overtime round starts with a one-minute, sudden victory period, and then two 30-second tiebreaker periods for each wrestler. The wrestler who did not have the choice of position in the previous overtime round's first tiebreaker period now has the choice of position in this overtime round's first tiebreaker period. If the score remains tied after the end of the second overtime round, the wrestler who has one second or more of net time advantage from the two rounds of tiebreaker periods will be declared the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-30–31 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}

*'''Subsequent overtime round(s)'''
If a winner still cannot be determined, overtime rounds that are structured like the second round of overtime take place until one wrestler scores enough points for the victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |page=WR-31 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Post-match'''
After the match is completed, regardless of the victory condition, the wrestlers will return to the center of the mat (on the 10-foot inner circle) while the referee checks with the scorer's table. Upon the referee's return to the mat, the two wrestlers shake hands, and the referee proclaims the winner by raising the winner's hand. Both contestants then return to their team benches from the mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-28, WR-121 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Match scoring===
In collegiate wrestling, points are awarded mostly on the basis of control. Control occurs when a wrestler has gained restraining power over an opponent, usually, by controlling the opponent's legs and torso. When a wrestler gains control and maintains restraining power over an opponent, he is said to be in the '''position of advantage'''.&lt;ref name="National Collegiate Athletic Association"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | publisher = [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]]
  | date = August 1, 2008
  | pages = 22, 26, 30
  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scoring can be accomplished in the following ways:
* '''Takedown''' ('''2 points'''): A wrestler is awarded two points for a takedown when, from the neutral position, he gains control by taking the other wrestler down to the mat in bounds and beyond reaction time. This is most often accomplished by attacking the legs of the opponent, although various throws can also be used to bring a wrestler down to the mat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-20–21, WR-48 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Escape''' ('''1 point'''): A defensive wrestler who is being controlled on the bottom is awarded one point for an escape when the offensive wrestler loses control of the opponent while any part of either wrestler remains in bounds. An escape may be awarded when the wrestlers are still in contact.&lt;ref name=NCAAWR21,48&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-21, WR-48 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Reversal''' ('''2 points'''): A defensive wrestler who is being controlled on the bottom is awarded two points for a reversal when he comes from the bottom/defensive position and gains control of the opponent either on the mat or in a rear standing position. Reversal points are awarded on the edge of the wrestling area if control is established while any part of either wrestler remains in bounds.&lt;ref name="NCAAWR21,48" /&gt;
[[File:Going in for the pin!.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A near fall can also be scored when the defensive wrestler is held with one shoulder on the mat and one shoulder at an angle of 45 degrees or less toward the mat, as shown.]]

* '''Near fall''': Near fall points are similar to the points awarded for '''exposure''' or the '''danger position''' in the international styles of wrestling, but the emphasis for near falls is on control, not risk. Near fall criteria are met when: (1) the offensive wrestler holds the defensive wrestler in a high bridge or on both elbows; (2) the offensive wrestler holds any part of both his opponent's shoulders or scapulae (shoulder blades) within four inches of the mat; or (3) the offensive wrestler controls the defensive wrestler in such a way that one of the bottom wrestler's shoulders or scapulae, or the head, is touching the mat, and the other shoulder or scapula is held at an angle of 45 degrees or less to the mat. The referee counts the seconds off. Only one near fall is scored for a wrestler using the same pinning combination, regardless of the number of times the offensive wrestler places the defensive wrestler in a near fall position during the situation.&lt;ref name=NCAAWR2122,48&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-21–22, WR-48 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Near fall points are also known as "back points." Much of the criteria for the near fall were used in a former scoring opportunity known as ''predicament'' in collegiate wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Sports Dictionary'', pp. 279–280, (Springfield, MA: G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. (now Merriam-Webster), 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; When near fall points are given after the opponent is injured, signals an injury, or bleeds excessively, it is a consequence of what is sometimes referred to as the ''scream rule''.

::('''2 points'''): Two points are given when near fall criteria are met for two to four seconds. Two points can also be granted in cases where a pinning combination is executed legally and a near fall is imminent, but the defensive wrestler is injured, signals an injury, or bleeds excessively before the near fall criterion is met.&lt;ref name="NCAAWR2122,48" /&gt;
[[File:Wrestling falconfrenzy026.jpg|thumb|195px|A near fall situation can also occur if both shoulders are within four inches of touching the mat, as shown.]]
::('''4 points'''): Four points are given when near fall criteria are met for four seconds or more.  After four seconds, the referee awards four points and stops counting. When a near fall criterion is met that is between two and four seconds, and the defensive wrestler is injured, indicates an injury, or bleeds excessively, three points are also awarded.&lt;ref name="NCAAWR2122,48" /&gt;
::('''4 points'''): Four points are given when the criteria for a near fall are met for four seconds, and the defensive wrestler later is injured, indicates an injury, or bleeds excessively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-22, WR-48 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Penalty''' ('''1 or 2 points'''): One or two points can be awarded by the referee to the opponent for various penalty situations. "Unsportsmanlike conduct" by the wrestler includes swearing, teasing the opponent, etc. "Unnecessary roughness" involves physical acts during the match that exceed normal aggressiveness. "Flagrant misconduct" includes actions (physical or nonphysical) that intentionally attack the opponent, the opponent's team, or others in a severe way. Illegal holds are also penalized accordingly, and potentially dangerous holds are not penalized, but the match will be stopped by the referee. Also, "technical violations" such as stalling, interlocking hands, and other minor infractions are penalized. With some situations, such as stalling, a warning is given after the first occurrence, and if there is another occurrence the penalty point is given. In other situations, there is no warning and penalty points are automatically given. In general, after a certain number of occurrences where penalty points are given, the penalized wrestler is disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-53–67 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; A fuller treatment of the situations in which penalty points are awarded in college wrestling matches is found in the Penalty Table on pages WR-64 to WR-67 of the ''2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations''.

* '''Imminent scoring''': When a match is stopped for an injury during a scoring situation (e.g. a takedown, reversal, or escape), and the referee determines that scoring would have been successful if the wrestling had continued, an injury timeout is charged to the injured wrestler and the applicable points are given to his non-injured opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-22–23, WR-48 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This is also a consequence of the scream rule.

* '''Time advantage''' or '''riding time''' ('''1 point'''): Whenever a wrestler is controlling an opponent on the mat in such a way that prevents an escape or a reversal, he is gaining time advantage (or riding time). An assistant timekeeper then records the time advantage of each wrestler throughout the match. At the end of the third period, one point is awarded to the wrestler with the greater time advantage, provided that the difference of time advantage between the two wrestlers is one minute or more. Points for time advantage are awarded only in college competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |pages=WR-23, WR-48 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}

== Victory conditions ==
[[File:Wrestling falconfrenzy065.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[Pin (amateur wrestling)|fall]], also known as a [[Pin (amateur wrestling)|pin]], occurs when any part of both [[shoulder]]s or both [[scapula|scapulae (shoulder blades)]] of the defensive wrestler is held in continuous contact with the mat for a specified amount of time (in collegiate wrestling for one second).]][[File:Wrestling redux005.jpg|thumb|250px|Falls (or pins) can be attained in many different technique combinations.

A match can be won in the following ways:
* '''Win by [[Pin (amateur wrestling)|fall]]''': The object of the entire wrestling match is to attain victory by what is known as the '''[[Pin (amateur wrestling)|fall]]'''. A '''fall''', also known as a '''[[Pin (amateur wrestling)|pin]]''', occurs when one wrestler holds any part of both of his opponent's [[shoulder]]s or both of his opponent's [[scapula|scapulae (shoulder blades)]] in continuous contact with the mat for one second at the college level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-23-WR-24 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The fall ends the match immediately, and the offensive wrestler who secured the fall is declared the winner. Falls (or pins) can be attained in many different ways. The most common way of securing the fall is through the various [[nelson hold]]s, in particular, the [[Nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]]. Other techniques used to secure falls are ''[[Cradle (wrestling)|cradles]]'', the [[Grappling hold|''headlock'' (''head and arm'')]], single or double ''armbars'' (''bar arms''), the ''"back bow"'' and the ''leg Turk'', the ''reverse body lock'', the ''guillotine'', the ''leg split'' (also known as the ''banana split'' or ''spread eagle''), the ''spladle'', the ''[[Figure-four (grappling hold)|figure-4]] to the head'', the ''[[Compressive asphyxia|straight body scissors]]'', and the [[Grappling hold|''double grapevine'']] (also called the ''Saturday night ride'').

* '''Win by [[technical fall]]''': If a fall is not secured to end the match, a wrestler can win a match simply by points. If a wrestler can secure an advantage of 15 points over an opponent, then the wrestler can win the match by '''[[technical fall]]'''.&lt;ref name=NCAAWR24&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=p. WR-24 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; A technical fall is very likely when one wrestler has great control over the other wrestler and is able to score near fall points repeatedly. If the 15-point advantage is gained while the offensive wrestler has his opponent in a pinning situation, the match would continue to allow the offensive wrestler to secure the fall. If the offensive wrestler is unable to secure a fall, the match ends once a near fall situation is no longer seen by the referee or when the wrestlers return to the neutral position.

* '''Win by [[major decision]]''': If no fall or technical fall occurs, a wrestler can also win simply by points. If the match concludes, and a wrestler has a margin of victory of eight or more points over an opponent, but under the 15 points needed for a technical fall, the win is known as a '''major decision'''.&lt;ref name="NCAAWR24" /&gt;
* '''Win by decision''': If the match concludes, and a wrestler has a margin of victory of less than eight points over an opponent, or wins the first point in a sudden victory period in overtime without gaining a fall, default, or a win by an opponent's disqualification, the wrestler then wins by '''decision'''.&lt;ref name="NCAAWR24" /&gt;
* '''Win by default''': If for any reason, a wrestler is unable to continue competing during the match (e.g. because of injury, illness, etc.), his opponent is awarded victory by '''default'''. A wrestler can concede a win by default to his opponent by informing the referee himself of his inability to continue wrestling. The decision to concede the win by default can also be made by the wrestler's coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-24, WR-69-WR-70 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Win by disqualification''': If a wrestler is banned from participating further in a match by virtue of acquiring penalties or for flagrant misconduct, his opponent wins by '''disqualification'''.&lt;ref name=NCAAWR25&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=p. WR-25 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Win by forfeit''': A wrestler also may gain a victory by '''forfeit''' when the other wrestler for some reason fails to appear for the match.&lt;ref name="NCAAWR25" /&gt; In a tournament, the wrestler could also win by a '''medical forfeit''' if for some reason his opponent becomes ill or injured during the course of the tournament and decides not to continue wrestling. For a wrestler to win by forfeit or medical forfeit however, he must appear on the mat in a wrestling uniform.&lt;ref name=NCAA25,3738&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-25, WR-37-WR-38 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the forfeit condition encourages teams to have at least one varsity (and one junior varsity) competitor at every weight class. The wrestler who declared the medical forfeit is excused from further weigh-ins but is eliminated from further competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-37-WR-38 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }} In order for the ill or injured wrestler who declared a medical forfeit to keep his advancement and placement points for that tournament, he would have to declare the medical forfeit to the official scorer before he is called to the mat. A medical forfeit is scored as a win, but not as a loss on the individual wrestler's season record. {{cite web

In a dual meet, when all team points are totaled, the team with the most points wins the competition. In all victory cases, if there are junior varsity matches, the junior varsity and varsity competitions are scored separately. If this is the case, it is entirely possible for one participating institution to win the junior varsity dual meet and another participating institution to win the varsity dual meet. On the college level, it is possible for a dual meet to end in a tie, except in dual meet advancement tournaments, where then the tie is broken by one team point awarded to the winning team based on certain criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-31-WR-32 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team scoring in tournaments===
In a '''tournament''', most of the team points are scored for advancement. For example, a team winning a match in the championship bracket would be awarded one team advancement point; one-half of an advancement point would be awarded if a team won a match in the wrestle-back bracket. The corresponding team points also apply if a wrestler from the team gained a bye and then won his next match in that bracket. Two additional advancement points are for victories by fall, default, disqualification, and forfeit (including victories by medical forfeit). One and one-half additional advancement points are awarded for victories by technical fall with near fall points scored in the course of the match. One additional advancement point is awarded for victories by technical fall victories with no near fall points scored during the course of the match and also for victories by major decision. A team could then win a certain number of placement points if its wrestlers have placed individually in the championship and wrestle-back brackets. Thus, whole teams are awarded placements (first, second, etc.) based on their total number of victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-50-WR-51 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual placement points are also awarded. For example, in a tournament scoring eight places, the winner of a quarterfinal or a semi-final in the championship bracket (where first and second places are awarded) would win six place points. The winners of first and second place would then win four additional place points. In the wrestle-back bracket (where third and fifth places are awarded), the winner of a semi-final match, for example, would receive three place points. The winners of third, fifth, and seventh place would receive one additional place point, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |first= |authorlink= |title=2009 NCAA Wrestling Rules and Interpretations |work=pp. WR-49-WR-50 |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] |date=August 1, 2008 |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015341/http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/Wrestling_9_9_2008bf011438-719d-4418-ba9b-975c7b60f84c.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}

==High school level==
[[File:Wrestling glenninvite005.jpg|thumb|250px|This [[scholastic wrestling]] match (featuring high school students) resumes in the referee's position.]]
{{Main article|Scholastic wrestling}}
Also known as '''scholastic wrestling''' when practiced at the high school and [[middle school|middle (junior high) school]] level, collegiate wrestling differs from wrestling at the high school level in multiple aspects. Scholastic wrestling is regulated by the [[National Federation of State High School Associations|National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS)]]. This association mandates that high school matches are to have periods of shorter length, three periods consisting of two minutes each, than collegiate matches which begin with a three-minute first period. Additionally, college wrestling uses the concept of "time advantage" or "riding time" in the referee's position, while high school wrestling does not.

According to an Athletics Participation Survey taken by the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]], boys' wrestling ranked eighth in terms of the number of schools sponsoring teams, with 9,445 schools participating in the 2006–07 school year. Also, 257,246 boys participated in the sport during that school year, making scholastic wrestling the sixth most popular sport among high school boys. In addition, 5,048 girls participated in wrestling in 1,227 schools during the 2006–07 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic wrestling is currently practised in 49 of the 50 states; only [[Mississippi]] does not officially sanction scholastic wrestling for high schools and middle schools. Arkansas, the 49th state to sanction high school wrestling, began scholastic wrestling competition in the 2008–09 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Folkstyle - age-group level==
{{Main article|Scholastic wrestling}}
At young ages, independent tournaments are often run in the [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] styles. There are also tournaments where wrestlers compete in a style very similar to collegiate or high school (scholastic) wrestling. To differentiate this style from freestyle and Greco-Roman, the term '''folkstyle wrestling''' is a more commonly used phrase than collegiate wrestling.

The '''Countryside Alliance''' (CA) is a British organisation promoting issues relating to the [[countryside]] such as [[British farming|farming]], rural services, small businesses and country sports, aiming to "Give Rural Britain a voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/ca/article/about-the-countryside-alliance|title=About the Countryside Alliance|publisher=Countryside Alliance |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With over 100,000 members, the group was named the 'most inspiring political personality' of the last ten years by ''Channel 4 News'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2008/01/25/109149/Countryside-Alliance-wins-Channel-4-award-for-political.htm |title=Countryside Alliance wins Channel 4 award for political campaigning |first=Andrew |last=Watts |newspaper=Farmers Weekly |date=25 January 2008 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Countryside Alliance was formed on 10 July 1997 from three organisations: the [[British Field Sports Society]], the '''Countryside Business Group''', and the '''Countryside Movement'''. The Alliance was formed to help promote and defend the British countryside and rural life, both in the media and in Parliament. Since then, the Alliance has campaigned on a number of issues which they believe are important to rural Britain, some of the most prominent of which are listed below:

* Against the passing of the 2004 [[Hunting Act 2004|Hunting Ban]], and lobbying for its repeal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/ca/campaigns-hunting|title=Hunting|publisher=Countryside Alliance |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Against the closure of rural post offices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/ca/communities/post-offices-could-close-by-stealth|title=Post Offices "could close by stealth"|publisher=Countryside Alliance |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Supporting shooting and [[deer stalking]] across the British Isles, by campaigning against additional regulations and negative press coverage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/ca/campaigns-shooting|title=Shooting &amp; conservation|publisher=Countryside Alliance |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encouraging customers and supermarkets to stock food from British farms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/ca/campaigns-food-farming|title=Food &amp; farming|publisher=Countryside Alliance |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Calling for better broadband connections for homes and small businesses in the countryside&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/ca/4g-broadband|title=Connecting the countryside |publisher=Countryside Alliance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326031935/http://www.countryside-alliance.org/ca/4g-broadband |archivedate=26 March 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hunting with hounds ==
The alliance states that "the countryside is enriched by country pursuits, whose participants should be free from prejudice and discrimination."{{cn|date=April 2016}}

The alliance has long defended hunting and shooting, especially hunting with hounds, opposing the legislation (the [[Hunting Act 2004]]) which came into effect in England and Wales in February 2005. Amongst other causes, the Scottish Countryside Alliance campaigns against the [[Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002]], which prohibited hunting north of the border. In 2002, the alliance organised the Liberty &amp; Livelihood March, one of the largest demonstrations in British history, with almost half a million people marching through London to demonstrate against the proposed ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo021016/debtext/21016-32.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 16 Oct 2002 (pt 32)|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Countryside Alliance mounted a series of legal challenges to the Hunting Act 2004 which were not met with success.

Following the first conviction under the act, on 4 August 2006, the alliance reaffirmed its belief that legislation was "illogical and unclear"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/our_news_and_comment/hunting_news/Huntsman_will_appeal_court_decision|title=Huntsman will appeal court decision |date=3 August 2006|publisher=Countryside Alliance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113134024/http://www.countryside-alliance.org/our_news_and_comment/hunting_news/Huntsman_will_appeal_court_decision/ |archivedate=13 November 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vowed to support the appeal against the conviction, which was later successful.

Critics of the alliance claim that this is the sole focus of the organisation, a claim it denies, saying that this campaigning is a response to the (previous) government's "preoccupation with the issue". On BBC ''Newsnight'' on 18 November 2014, Anne Mallalieu stated "What's actually happened to the foxes...because of the growth of commercial shooting...foxes are being shot at night by lampers...people with bright lights shooting them with guns..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b04pvjw9/newsnight-18112014|title=BBC Two - Newsnight, 18/11/2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countryside March==
In September 2002, the Countryside Alliance organised a march in central London to promote the interests of rural Britain.&lt;ref name="bbcmarch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2274129.stm |title=Huge turnout for countryside march |date=22 September 2002 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British National Party]] had called for its members to join the march and support the countryside; however, the Countryside Alliance issued the following statement: "Everything we stand for is the opposite of what they believe in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jane |last=Perrone |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/20/ruralaffairs.thefarright |title=BNP urges members to attend countryside march |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 September 2002 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 300,000 people were in attendance, including [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Vinnie Jones]], [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]], [[Clarissa Dickson-Wright]], [[Richard Foulds]], [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]], and [[Michael Marsham, 7th Earl of Romney]].&lt;ref name="dailytelegraphmarch"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1407980/Thousands-march-for-countryside.html |title=Thousands march for countryside |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=22 September 2002 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailytelegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1464065/The-Earl-of-Romney.html |title=The Earl of Romney |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=10 June 2004 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countryside Rocks==
The organisation has held fundraising rock concerts under the banner "Countryside Rocks" which have attracted support from stars including [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[Roger Waters]], [[The Who]]'s [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Procol Harum]]'s [[Keith Reid]], [[Roxy Music]]'s [[Bryan Ferry]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' [[Mike Rutherford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sundaysun.co.uk/news/north-east-news/2006/05/07/rock-legends-fight-hunt-ban-79310-17043799/ | title= Rock legends fight hunt ban |first=Sarah |last=Robinson |newspaper=Sunday Sun |date=7 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171916/http://www.sundaysun.co.uk/news/north-east-news/2006/05/07/rock-legends-fight-hunt-ban-79310-17043799/ |archivedate=20 November 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict with conservationists==
In a 2013 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the alliance's executive chairman, Lieutenant General Sir [[Barney White-Spunner]], called the [[RSPCA]] a "sinister and nasty" organisation and urged alliance members to stop donating to it. The RSPCA responded by saying: "Sir Barney White-Spunner's interview shows once again how far out of touch he and his colleagues at the pro bloodsports Countryside Alliance are with the reality of public opinion in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/countryside/10540076/RSPCA-has-become-sinister-and-nasty-warns-head-of-the-Countryside-Alliance.html|title=RSPCA has become 'sinister and nasty', warns head of the Countryside Alliance |first=Matthew |last=Holehouse |date=27 December 2013|newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance has also criticised the [[RSPB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/10119155/RSPB-accused-of-hypocrisy.html |title=RSPB accused of hypocrisy |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |first=Louise |last=Gray |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for the sacking of TV presenter [[Chris Packham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/chris-packham-thanks-fans-after-70000-people-sign-petition-urging-bbc-not-to-sack-him-following-10501470.html |title=Chris Packham thanks fans after 70,000 people sign petition asking BBC not to sack him following calls from The Countryside Alliance |newspaper=The Independent |first=Daisy |last=Wyatt |date=15 September 2015 |accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5270">[[File:Hattipolo.jpg|thumb|200px|Elephant Polo World Cup 2012, [[Meghauli]], [[Nepal]]]]

'''Elephant polo''' is a variant of [[polo]] played while riding [[elephant]]s. It is played in [[Nepal]], [[Rajasthan]] ([[India]]), and [[Thailand]]. England and Scotland regularly field teams. Equipment consists of a standard polo ball and six to ten foot cane (similar to bamboo) sticks with a polo mallet head on the end. The pitch is three-quarters of the length of a standard polo pitch, due to the lower speed of the elephants. Two people ride each elephant; the elephants are steered by [[mahout]]s, while the player tells the [[mahout]] which way to go and hits the ball.

Elephant polo originated in Meghauli, Nepal. Tiger Tops in Nepal remains the headquarters of elephant polo and the site of the World Elephant Polo Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bushell at elephant polo World Cup |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7768225.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=5 December 2008 |quote=A team from England have become the new world champions of elephant polo. Air Tuskers beat Scotland's Chivas, on Friday in Southern Nepal.|accessdate=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elephant Polo in Nepal and Thailand is played under the auspices of the [[World Elephant Polo Association]]. WEPA enforces strict rules regarding elephant welfare and game play. Other tournaments, such as those played in India and Sri Lanka, are managed independently of each other and the World Elephant Polo Association.  Sri Lanka held an annual tournament in Galle under the auspices of the Ceylon Elephant Polo Association. In 2007 an elephant went on a rampage during a game, injuring two players and destroying the Spanish team's minibus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Why you should never make an elephant angry |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/why-you-should-never-make-an-elephant-angry/story-e6freo8c-1111113010144 |quote=The four-tonne, 2.8m pachyderm threw off his mahout and U.S. rider as the island's sixth annual elephant polo tournament got under way, rampaging off the pitch and attacking the Spanish team's minibus. |newspaper=[[Adelaide Now]] via [[Daily Mail]] |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=2011-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European College of Sport Science''' (ECSS) is a [[sports science|sport scientific]] [[society]] founded in 1995 in [[Nice]], [[France]], dedicated to the collection, generation and dissemination of scientific knowledge. The spirit of this non-profit organisation is to ''Share your knowledge''.

==Objective &amp; Purpose==
The ECSS is the leading{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} association of sport scientists at the European level and practices extensive co operations with corresponding non-European associations.
The purpose of the College is the promotion of [[science]] and [[research]], with special attention to [[sport science]] across Europe and beyond. 
Its topics include the [[motivation]], attitudes, values and responses, adaptation, performance and [[health]] aspects of people engaged in [[physical activity]] and the relation of physical activity and lifestyle to health, [[Preventive medicine|prevention]] and [[aging]]. These topics are dealt with on an interdisciplinary basis.

==Function==
The ECSS is a non-profit organization. It supports European institutions, such as the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[Council of Europe]], by offering scientific advice and assistance for coordinated European and worldwide research projects defined by these bodies. 
Additionally it serves as the most important European network of sport scientists from all relevant sub disciplines.

==Membership==
The ECSS offers individual membership to sport and related scientists. The objective is to create a scientific European and worldwide network for scientific exchange and interaction. This is strengthened by the annual Congresses and other membership benefits such as the European Journal of Sport Science (EJSS), the ECSS News Bulletin, Email Newsletters, etc.
The qualification for the ECSS membership students is a university level degree (master’s or doctor’s degree, university examination) in the field of sport science, or an equivalent university degree in other related areas.
Members comprise scientists from all areas of sport science such as [[Physiology]], [[Sports Medicine]], [[Psychology]], Molecular Biology, [[Sociology]], [[Biochemistry]], [[Motor Control]], [[Biomechanics]], Training Science and many more. 
The ECSS experiences a constant growth membership.

'''Exercise intolerance''' is a condition of inability or decreased ability to perform [[physical exercise]] at what would be considered to be the normally expected level or duration. It also includes experiences of unusually severe post-exercise [[pain]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] or other negative effects. Exercise intolerance is not a [[disease]] or [[syndrome]] in and of itself, but can result from various disorders.

In most cases, the specific reason that exercise is not tolerated is of considerable significance when trying to isolate the cause down to a specific disease. Dysfunctions involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular or neuromuscular systems have been frequently found to be associated with exercise intolerance, with behavioural causes also playing a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/content/21/1/6.extract|title = Exercise Intolerance|date = 2000|accessdate = 2015-04-17|journal = Pediatrics in Review|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 6–9|last = Scott Owens|first = Bernard Gutin|doi = 10.1542/pir.21-1-6|pmid = 10617757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Respiratory disorders===
*[[Cystic fibrosis]]: CF can cause skeletal muscle atrophy, however more commonly it can cause exercise intolerance. The exercise intolerance is associated with reduced pulmonary function that is the origin of CF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infection, inflammation and exercise in cystic fibrosis|last = Van de Weert-van Leeuwen|first = Pauline|date = 2013|journal =Respiratory Research|doi = 10.1186/1465-9921-14-32|pmid = 23497303|pmc=3599254|volume=14|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bronchiectasis]]

===Chronic fatigue syndrome===
* [[Orthostatic intolerance]] (OI) occurs in CFS. OI includes exercise intolerance as one of the main symptoms. It also includes fatigue, nausea, headaches, cognitive problems and visual disturbances as other less major symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Predictors of post-infectious chronic fatigue syndrome in adolescents|last = Leonard|first = Jason|date = 2014-01-01|journal = Health Psychology and Behavioural Medicine|doi = 10.1080/21642850.2013.869176|pmid = 24660116|pmc=3956649|volume=2|issue = 1|pages=41–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-concussion syndrome===
* Exercise intolerance is present in those with PCS however their intolerance to exercise may reduce over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exercise Intolerance in Individuals With Postconcussion Syndrome|last = Kozlowski|first = Karl F.|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Athletic Training|doi = 10.4085/1062-6050-48.5.02|pmid = 23952041|pmc=3784364|volume=48|issue = 5|pages=627–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Individuals with [[postconcussion syndrome]] may also experience a level of exercise intolerance, however there is little known comparatively about exercise intolerance in PCS patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Exercise Intolerance in Individuals With Postconcussion Syndrome|last = Kozlowski|first = Karl F|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Athletic Training|doi = 10.4085/1062-6050-48.5.02|pmid = 23952041|first2 = James|last2 = Graham|issue = 5|volume = 48|pages = 627–635|pmc=3784364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heart conditions===
*[[Heart failure]]: Exercise intolerance is a primary symptom of chronic [[diastolic]] heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exercise Intolerance|date = 2011|journal = Cardiology Clinics|last = Dalane W. Kitzman|first = Leanne Groban|pmc=3694583|pmid=21803233|doi=10.1016/j.ccl.2011.06.002|volume=29|issue = 3|pages=461–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cardiac arrhythmia]]
*[[Aortic valve insufficiency]]
*[[Pulmonary artery hypertension]]: PAH has the following symptoms; dyspnea and fatigue, these systems consequently contribute to exercise intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exercise Intolerance in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension|last = Fowler|first = Robin|date = 2012|journal = Pulmonary Medicine|doi = 10.1155/2012/359204|pmid = 22737582|pmc=3377355|volume=June|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Asymptomatic [[atrial septal defect]]s; In the heart the right ventricular (RV) can have a volume overload which ultimately produces a pressure overload in the RV resulting in exercise intolerance as the RV is no longer able to control high pressure associated with exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Atrial septal defects|last = Geva|first = Professor Tal|date = 2014|journal = The Lancet|doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62145-5|pmid = 24725467|volume=383|issue = 9932|pages=1921–1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chronic heart failure]]

===Musculoskeletal disorders===
*[[Spinal muscular atrophy]]: symptoms include exercise intolerance, cognitive impairment and fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Motor Neuron Syndrome as a New Phenotypic Manifestation of Mutation 9185T&gt;C in Gene MTATP6|last = Brum|first = Marisa|date = 2014|journal = Case Rep Neurol Med|doi = 10.1155/2014/701761|pmid = 25548692|pmc = 4274829|volume=2014|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rhabdomyolysis]]: a condition in which muscle degrades, releasing intracellular muscle content into the blood as reflected by elevated blood levels of [[creatine kinase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4908773|year=2016|author1=Chavez|first1=L. O.|title=Beyond muscle destruction: A systematic review of rhabdomyolysis for clinical practice|journal=Critical Care|volume=20|issue=1|pages=135|last2=Leon|first2=M|last3=Einav|first3=S|last4=Varon|first4=J|doi=10.1186/s13054-016-1314-5|pmid=27301374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise tolerance is significantly compromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22616958|year=2012|author1=Quinlivan|first1=R|title=Myopathic causes of exercise intolerance with rhabdomyolysis|journal=Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology|volume=54|issue=10|pages=886–91|last2=Jungbluth|first2=H|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2012.04320.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutations===
*[[Mitochondrial complex 111]]: Currently it is suggested that there are 27 different mutations identified in cytochrome ''b ''(mitochondrial complex III is one of those mutations). This mutation can often lead to skeletal muscle weakness and as a result exercise intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mitochondrial Complex III Deficiency Associated with a Homozygous Mutation in UQCRQ|last = Barel|first = Ortal|date = 2008|journal = The American Journal of Human Genetics|doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.03.020|pmid = 18439546|pmc=2427202|volume=82|issue = 5|pages=1211–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[a complex of Coenzyme Q10]]:
*[[Skeletal muscle respiratory chain defect]]: This can result in severe  exercise intolerance which is manifested by the following symptoms of Skeletal muscle respiratory chain defect; muscle fatigue and lactic acidosis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exercise intolerance, lactic acidosis, and abnormal cardiopulmonary regulation in exercise associated with adult skeletal muscle cytochrome c oxidase deficiency|last = Haller|first = R.G|date = 1989|journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation|doi = 10.1172/JCI114135|pmid = 2544623|pmc=303965|volume=84|issue = 1|pages=155–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exercise tolerance reflects the combined capacity of components in the oxygen cascade to supply adequate oxygen for ATP resynthesis. In individuals with diseases such as cancer, certain therapies can affect one or more components of this cascade and therefore reduce the body's ability to utilise or deliver oxygen, leading to exercise intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70031-2|pmid=19482248|title=Exercise intolerance in cancer and the role of exercise therapy to reverse dysfunction|journal=The Lancet Oncology|volume=10|issue=6|pages=598–605|year=2009|last1=Jones|first1=Lee W.|last2=Eves|first2=Neil D.|last3=Haykowsky|first3=Mark|last4=Freedland|first4=Stephen J.|last5=MacKey|first5=John R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cytochrome b mutations ===
[[Cytochrome b]] mutations can frequently cause isolated exercise intolerance and myopathy and in some cases multisystem disorders. The mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III catalyses electron transfer to cytochrome c. Complex III is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria and consists of 11 subunits. Cytochrome b is encoded by the mitochondrial DNA which differs from all other subunits which are encoded in the nucleus. Cytochrome b plays a major part in the correct fabricating and function of complex III.

This mutation occurred in an 18-year-old man who had experienced exercise intolerance for most of his adolescence. Symptoms included extreme fatigue, nausea, a decline in physical activity ability and myalgia.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Intracranial hypertension===
Individuals with elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid can experience increased head pain, throbbing, pulsatile tinnitus, nausea and vomiting, faintness and weakness and even loss of consciousness after exercise or exertion.

== Treatment ==
Exercise is key for many heart and back patients, and a variety of specific exercise techniques are available for both groups. Some exercise specialists are trained in modifications specific to these patients{{Who|date=August 2009}}.

In individuals with [[heart failure]] and normal [[Ejection fraction|EF (ejection fraction)]], including aortic distensibility, blood pressure, LV diastolic compliance and skeletal muscle function, aerobic exercise has the potential to improve exercise tolerance. A variety of pharmacological interventions such as [[verapamil]], [[enalapril]], angiotensin receptor antagonism, and aldosterone antagonism could potentially improve exercise tolerance in these individuals as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Exercise Intolerance|last = Kitzman|first = Delane W|date = 2005|journal = Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases|doi = 10.1016/j.pcad.2005.02.002|pmid = 16115516|issue = 6|volume = 47|pages = 367–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on individuals suffering from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)]], has found a number of effective therapies in relation to exercise intolerance. These include:
# [[Oxygen supplementation|Oxygen Supplementation]]
#* Reduces carotid body drive and slows respiration at a given level of exercise.
# Treatment with [[bronchodilators]]
#* Clinically useful improvements in expiratory airflow, allows fuller exhalation in a given period of time, reduces dynamic hyperinflation, and prolongs exercise tolerance.
# [[Heliox]] (79% Helium, 21% oxygen)
#* Heliox has a lower density than air.
#* Breathing heliox lowers expiratory airflow resistance, decreases dynamic hyperinflation, and prolongs exercise tolerance.
# High intensity rehabilitative exercise training
#* Increasing the fitness of muscles decreases the amount of lactic acid released at any given level of exercise.
#* Since lactic acid stimulates respiration, after rehabilitative training exercising, ventilation is lower, respiration is slowed, and dynamic hyperinflation is reduced.
A combination of these therapies (Combined therapies), have shown the potential to improve exercise tolerance as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Combination therapy for exercise intolerance in COPD|last = Casaburi|first = R|date = 2006|journal = Thorax|doi = 10.1136/thx.2006.058511|pmid = 16807386|issue = 7|volume = 61|pages = 551–552|pmc = 2104677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hazards===
Certain conditions exist where exercise may be [[contraindicated]] or should be performed under the direction of an experienced and licensed medical professional acting within his or her scope of practice. These conditions include:

*Decompensated [[heart failure]]
*Recent [[myocardial infarction]]
*[[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] or [[cardiomyopathy]] from recent [[myocarditis]]
*Active or suspected myocarditis or [[pericarditis]]
*Low left ventricular [[ejection fraction]]
*Severe [[aortic stenosis]]
*Unstable [[ischemia]]
*Unstable [[arrythmia]]
*Irregular or [[resting pulse]] greater than 100 bpm
*Resting [[systolic blood pressure]] &gt;200&amp;nbsp;mm Hg or resting [[diastolic blood pressure]] &gt;110&amp;nbsp;mm Hg
*Severe [[pulmonary hypertension]]
*Severe [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]
*Suspected or known [[dissecting aortic aneurysm]]
*Recent systemic or [[pulmonary embolus]]
*[[Pneumothorax]] and [[haemoptysis]]
*[[thrombophlebitis]]

The above list does not include all potential contraindications or precautions to exercise.
Although it has not been shown to promote improved muscle strength, passive range-of-motion exercise is sometimes used to prevent skin breakdown and prevent contractures in patients unable to safely self-power.

'''Footbag net''' is a [[sport]] in which players kick a [[footbag]] over a five-foot-high net. Players may use only the feet. Any contact knee or above is a foul. The game is played individually and as doubles.

Footbag net combines elements of [[tennis]], [[badminton]], and [[volleyball]]. Specifically, the court dimensions and layout are similar to those of doubles badminton; the scoring is sideout scoring (you must be serving to score); and serves must be diagonal, as in tennis. Footbag net games can be played to eleven or fifteen points, although the winners must win by at least two points.

Footbag net is governed by the International Footbag Players Association (IFPA).  Competitions take place all over the world, but primarily in North America and Europe.  The World Footbag Championships is an annual, week-long event held in a different city each year.  The 2013 IFPA Championships will be held in Montréal, Québec, Canada. Recent championships were held in Warsaw (2012), Helsinki (2011), Oakland, California, USA (2010), Berlin (2009), and Prague(2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4311">'''High performance sport''' or '''elite sport''' is sport at the highest level of competition. 
In [[sports administration]] "high performance sport", where the emphasis is on winning prestigious competitions, is distinguished from "mass sport" or "[[recreation]]al sport", where the emphasis is on attracting the maximum number of participants.

High performance sport overlaps with [[professional sport]] but is not the same; for example, the [[English football league system]] and [[Minor League Baseball]] include lower divisions whose teams' members are full-time professionals. On the other hand, elite competitors at the [[Olympic Games]] or [[World Games]] in some minority sports may be part-time or rely on government grants. Likewise, [[student athlete]]s, especially in [[college sports]], are often high performance despite being amateurs.

Much research in [[sports psychology]] and [[sports medicine]] is motivated by the needs of elite rather than mass athletes. [[Doping in sport]] is more common at elite levels, and research into [[performance-enhancing substance]]s has been fuelled by the drive for success.

Separate state agencies may be responsible for high performance sport and for mass sport; [[Sports governing body|national governing bodies]] for a particular sport often have separate administrative units for supporting élite athletes and for administering mass competitions. [[National Olympic Committee]]s are often concerned with high performance sport, including the funding of athletes likely to win [[Olympic medal]]s. In [[public policy]], funding for high performance sport may be justified for reasons of national prestige or as a marketing tool for encouraging mass sport. [[Eastern bloc]] countries invested in elite sport during the [[Cold War]]; Western countries began establishing '''Institutes of Sport''' for a similar purpose from the 1980s, with '''sports academies''' for nurturing promising young athletes. Such institutes may set goals in terms of national ranking on the [[Olympic medal table]].

'''Indoor cycling''', often also called '''spinning''', as an organized activity, is a form of exercise with classes focusing on endurance, strength, intervals, high intensity (race days) and recovery, and involves using a special stationary [[exercise bicycle]] with a weighted flywheel in a classroom setting.

== Class content and goals ==
[[File:Home cycling trainer 1897.jpg|thumbnail|"All the delight of outdoor cycling enjoyed at home" - article from 1897 describing indoor spin.]]
Classes generally use specialized [[exercise bicycle|stationary bicycle]]s. Features include a mechanical device to modify the difficulty of pedalling, specially shaped handlebars, and multiple adjustment points to fit the bicycle to a range of riders. Many have a weighted [[flywheel]], which simulates the effects of inertia and momentum when riding a real bicycle. The pedals are equipped with toe clips as on sports bicycles to allow one foot to pull up when the other is pushing down. They may alternatively have [[bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless]] receptacles for use with cleated [[cycling shoe]]s. Padded shorts aid comfort and avoid the chafing caused by the sewn seams in underwear.

If the exercise is not done correctly or the rider's position is bad, injuries can occur; problems with the lower back and knees are most common. To avoid injury and aid comfort it is important to make sure the bio-mechanical position of the rider is correct. Group cycling bikes have a wide range of adjustment, and it is essential to obtain the correct setup prior to riding. The seat position must be right for the participant's height. The height of the seat should be in level with the hip when the participant is standing next to the cycle. Horizontally, the seat should be set in order for the front of the knee to be directly in vertical line with the [[Ball (anatomy)|ball of the foot]] when the pedal is pointing forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bodybike.dk/inspiration/good-advice|title=Good advice {{!}} BODY BIKE indoor cycles|website=www.bodybike.dk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://caloriesburnedhq.com/img/Spinner-Bike-Setup.pdf|title=Spin Shoes - Guide to Indoor Cycling Shoes|last=Chapman|first=Gareth|date=2017-02-12|work=Calories Burned HQ - Zumba Calories Burned, Calories Burned Walking|access-date=2017-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a position where the knee is slightly bent at an angle between 25% and 35% when the leg is extended with the foot resting flat at the bottom of the pedal stroke. Handlebar height can be adjusted for comfort; less experienced riders may want to set them higher to ease lower back discomfort. A reasonable reference point is to set it in level with the seat.

A typical class involves a single instructor at the front of the class who leads the participants through routines that are designed to simulate terrain and situations similar to riding a bike outdoors. Some of the movements and positions include hill climbs, sprints and [[interval training]]. A well-trained instructor uses [[music]], [[motivation]], visualization and enthusiastic coaching to lead students through a ride that best suits their fitness level and goals. Most instructors will lead what is called an interval ride, where students will sprint, run, climb, and jump all in the same ride, but there will not be definable pattern to the exercises. In the early 2000s, "terrain-based" classes that simulate outdoor conditions (e.g., wind resistance) were introduced. Terrain-based classes are designed to improve a rider's outdoor skill set and increase endurance while providing an intense cardio-based workout.

Participants set goals based on their [[heart rate]], which can be measured by hand or using a [[heart rate monitor]] and ride simulated variations in terrain by altering resistance and cadence. Some participants choose to maintain a moderate, [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] intensity level, with a heart rate of between 50 and 85% of max while others drive their heart rates higher in intervals of [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] activity to levels of between 85 and 92%.

One of the major advantages of indoor cycling is that each participant can exactly control his/her level of intensity to suit ability or fitness level but still remain as a group together. The classes can therefore be heterogeneous. As an alternative, participants can judge their level of exertion relative to a perceived exertion scale. The instructor should advise a recommended exertion scale from 1 (no exertion at all) to 10 (maximum exertion). Each rider is permitted to dictate how hard he/she chooses to work with the instructor providing active and dynamic encouragement together with technical and practical advice throughout the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Besides burning (on average) between 300-500 kcal in 60 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;Darling, A. "Be Fit: The Science of Health: Part 2: Exercise: Feel the burn: Which workout is best for you? Andy Darling is your guide." Guardian, The. 2005, January 15: 28.&lt;/ref&gt; indoor cycling also strengthens the muscles of the lower body. It tones the [[quadriceps]] and [[hamstring]]s, along with working the back and hips. It can be difficult to stay at the moderate level in a class that is geared towards more intensity. The difficulty of the workout is modulated in two ways:

#By varying the resistance on a [[flywheel]] attached to the pedals. The resistance is controlled by a knob, wheel or lever that the rider operates, causing the flywheel brake (a common bicycle brake, a friction wheel, a magnetic eddy-current brake, a viscoelastic fluid brake, or a strap running around the flywheel) to tighten. On most bikes the brake can be adjusted from completely loose, providing no resistance to pedaling beyond the inertia of the flywheel, to so tight that the rider can not move the pedals. Usually riders who can't pedal at the resistance called out by the instructor are encouraged to ride at a level at which they feel comfortable yet challenged.
#By changing the cadence (the speed at which the pedals turn). Pedaling at a higher rate expends more energy than pedaling at a lower rate with the same resistance. Correct cadence is between the range of 80 to 110 RPM for seated flat, standing flat (running) and jumping and 60 to 80 RPM for seated climb, standing climb, running with resistance and jumps on a hill. Sprints are taken under hill resistance building cadence up to no more than 110 RPM. Seated sprints are most suitable as the rider maintains full control of posture at all times and will avoid falling due to exhaustion. A correct sprint should last from 10 to 25 seconds, leaving the rider exhausted in the 85 to 92% max heart rate range.
[[File:Foundation-20F9-0353.jpg|thumb|Typical fixed wheel ergonomically adjustable variable resistance bike]]
There are five core movements in the Spinning programme.
*'''Seated flat''', with hands at the center part of the handlebars. This is hand position one. This position should be used only when seated, for flat road simulations and during the warm-up and cool down. Cadence between 80 and 110 RPM.
*'''Standing flat''' (also known as '''running'''), with hands wide on the back 12-14" part of the handlebars that crosses the rider's body. This is hand position two. Proper form for standing while running requires the body to be more upright and the back of the legs touching or enveloping the point of the saddle, with the center of gravity directly over the crank. The pressure of body weight should never rest excessively on the handlebars. Cadence is between 80 and 110 RPM
*'''Jumps''', (also known as '''lifts'''), a combination of seated and standing with riders hands at position two for durations of between two and eight seconds. Cadence between 80 and 110 RPM.
*'''Seated climb''' with hands at position two, increased resistance and lower cadence of 60-80 RPM.
*'''Standing climb''' with hands wide and forward so the thumb tips are touching the far end of the handlebars (hand position three). The rider is canted slightly forward so that maximum force can be exerted onto the pedals with heavy resistance and a cadence of 60-80 RPM.

These five movements each work a different part of the body and focus on different leg muscle groups. The rider should always maintain control of the flywheel by having resistance applied and remaining below a cadence of 110 RPM. Not all bikes have a freewheel, or 'smart release', and it is possible that the flywheel will 'run away' with the rider with the potential for causing injury. The rider should be able to maintain perfectly even pedal rotations at high resistance. This becomes difficult below 60 RPM cadence and failing to make 'perfect circles' increases the risk of knee and hip injury. A road cyclist will normally have a natural pedal cadence, of about 85 RPM and will control changes in terrain by changing gear to maintain this rate. The goal of the spinning programme is not to exceed this natural rate by more than 25 RPM higher (110 RPM) or lower (60 RPM)
There are five further advanced movements based on those listed above.
*'''Running with resistance'''
*'''Jumps on a hill'''
*'''Seated flat sprint'''
*'''Seated hill sprint'''
*'''Standing hill sprint'''

Most indoor cycling classes are coached with [[music]]. Riders may synchronize their pedalling to be in time with the rhythm of the music, thus providing an external stimulus to encourage a certain tempo. Often, the music chosen by the instructor is [[dance music]] or [[rock music]] set to a dance beat (i.e. 4/4 time), but not necessarily. This tends to help motivate participants to work harder than they might otherwise. The instructor also may choose specific songs for sprints, climbs, and jumps. While the music provides a tempo cue, the cadence does not need to be a multiple of the beat in order for the rider to feel in rhythm; the music therefore helps a rider maintain any constant cadence, not just a cadence that matches the beat. It may depend on the level of exertion whether or not someone changes position or the instructor can tell the class to change.

A variation known as "aqua cycling" or "hydrospinning" also exists. In this, the stationary bicycles are underwater in a pool.&lt;ref name="Landreth"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-swimming-blog/2014/jan/21/hydrospinning-fitness-spin-class-cycling-underwater|title=Hydrospinning: the fitness craze that makes your spin class look easy|last=Landreth|first=Jenny|date=21 January 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/08/29/aqua-cycling-new-underwater-workout/|title=Aqua cycling: A new underwater workout|date=29 August 2013|work=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Life-Be_In_It.gif|right|Life. Be In it.]]

'''Life. Be in it.''' started as an [[Australian]] government program and [[advertising]] campaign encouraging people to be more active and participate in recreational sports or other physical activities.

The program began in 1975 with the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian state government]], the brainchild of [[Brian Dixon]], former [[Australian rules football]]er and then Minister for Youth, Sport and Recreation.  One of their early programs was to bring over [[Pat Farrington]], a co-founder of the [[New Games]], supplying her with five vans and 25 volunteers to drive around rural townships in Victoria, teaching people how to play games ([[New Games Book]]: p22)

In 1977 the federal government expanded the program nationally. The campaign also aired in the United States on local television stations during the 1970s and 1980s.

The [[Television commercial|television advertisements]] for the program are cartoons featuring people doing a wide range of activities, with a catchy tune "Be in it today, live more of your life".  The main character is Norm, a middle aged man with a prominent [[beer belly]], meant to represent a "normal" Australian [[bloke]].  The idea for Norm and the advertising came from [[Phillip Adams]] and [[Alex Stitt]]; Stitt drew all the cartoons. In the original run of television advertisements, Norm was voiced by [[Max Gillies]]. In the 2000 revival, the voice was provided by Dr Colin Benjamin.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

The campaign was an enormous success in terms of recognition, by 1979 about 83% and by 1982 about 94%.  Recognition remains high at 85%.{{Dubious|date=January 2018}}{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

Federal funding ended in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifebeinit.org/standard.php?id%3D879 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224094218/http://www.lifebeinit.org/standard.php?id=879 |archivedate=2011-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; redirected towards elite programs. The program became an Australia company, and continued for a time working with other groups like the [[National Heart Foundation of Australia]], before going into hibernation. The  brand is now under the custodianship of Life. Be in it. International Pty Ltd and is managed in each state by associations or companies. Some are given government grants to run specific programs but none are government programs.

The program continues to be active throughout Australia and continues to involve Australians in activities in every State and Territory. Programs include Life Games, Corporate Cup, Walking activities etc. and in South Australia and Victoria, the 'Life. Be in it' Sport for All Centres provide indoor social sporting competitions for children and adults. {{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}The original concept of 'Life, be in it' was created by Dr John Cooper and Oscar Scherl and was presented to Adam's Packer (Melbourne Advertising Agency) in the early 1970's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Adams|first=Paul C.|title=Place and Extended Agency|date=2017-03-30|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190457204.003.0022|work=Distributed Agency|pages=213–220|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190457204|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original theme music for the campaign was created by [[Peter Best (composer)|Peter Best]].{{ref|http://www.dhub.org/object/12019,fame}}

The '''Maccabiah bridge collapse''' was the catastrophic failure of a pedestrian bridge over the [[Yarkon River]] in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] on July 14, 1997. The collapse of the temporary metal and wooden structure killed four and injured 60 [[Australia]]n athletes who were visiting Israel to participate in the [[Maccabiah Games]]. One athlete died in the collapse and three died afterwards due to infections caused by exposure to the polluted river water.  A subsequent investigation found that shortcuts had been taken in the bridge's construction, mandated permits and oversight had not been obtained, and the bridge, as constructed, did not meet government requirements.

Five people, including the engineer who designed the bridge and the chair of the Tel Aviv Games Organising Committee, were convicted of recklessly causing death and injury.  Four of those convicted served prison sentences with the fifth receiving community service.  Lawsuits filed on behalf of the deceased and the injured were ultimately awarded close to $20million in damages.  The disaster highlighted environmental problems in Israel, especially with regard to its rivers and waterways, prompting clean-up efforts.  A full Australian team returned to the games in 2005 and participated in a riverside ceremony unveiling a memorial to the victims of the collapse.

__TOC__

==Background==
{{further|Maccabiah Games}}
The Maccabiah Games, organized by [[Maccabi World Union]] (MWU) and first staged in 1932, is an athletic event held every four years in Tel Aviv, Israel, to celebrate the [[History of Israel#1897—1917: The Zionist Revolution|Zionist Revolution]], and to demonstrate the unity and athleticism of the [[Jewish people]].&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt; The games include competitions for adults and for junior athletes aged 15 to 18, and are open to all Israelis and Jews from around the world.&lt;ref name="Maccabiah" /&gt;

The [[1997 Maccabiah Games|15th Maccabiah Games]], held in 1997 and billed as the third largest sporting event in the world, included 5,300 participants from 56 nations competing in 38 athletic events. The opening ceremony on July 14 at 8 p.m. (local time), held at [[Ramat Gan Stadium]] and designed to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the [[First Zionist Congress]], was attended by 50,000 people and featured hundreds of dancers, dazzling sound and light displays, and was broadcast on Israeli television. As at past games, a temporary footbridge, 60 feet long and 18 feet wide, was constructed across the nearby Yarkon River to allow competitors to march into the stadium during the ceremony from an assembly area on the other side of the river.&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmemann1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slater" /&gt;

==Collapse==
As scheduled during the opening ceremony, the participating athletes, teamed with their respective national delegations, began to cross the bridge and enter the stadium in alphabetical order. The second nation to cross the bridge, following the [[Austria]]n team, consisted of the 373 members of the Australian delegation. As the Australian athletes, in parallel rows of six, crossed the river, the bridge's support beams at roughly mid-span snapped, plunging around 100 of the Australians eight metres into the river below. Several of the fallen were forcibly submerged in the 1.6-metre deep river by the weight of falling athletes above them.&lt;ref name="Slater" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deny" /&gt;

Other athletes, bystanders, event staff, and police leapt into the river to rescue the fallen. Inside the stadium, Israeli government officials, including [[President of Israel|President]] [[Ezer Weizman]], chose to continue with the opening ceremony, but canceled the remainder of the march of the national teams into the stadium. Israeli television maintained live coverage, switching back and forth between the frantic rescue efforts outside the stadium and the festive dancing and light shows inside.&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmemann2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slater" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmemann1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Netanyahu" group="n"&gt;Weizman and Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] departed immediately upon the end of the ceremony to visit the victims at the hospitals and the games were suspended for 24 hours.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 67 injured were taken to nearby [[Rabin Medical Center|Beilinson Hospital]] in [[Petah Tikva]] and [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center]]. One, Gregory Small, 37, a [[Bowling|bowler]] from [[Sydney]], was dead on arrival, apparently as a result of injuries or drowning caused by the fall. The remaining 66 victims did not appear to have suffered life-threatening injuries. Their injuries included broken bones and water inhalation.&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmemann1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Small" group="n"&gt;Gregory Small is misidentified as "Smalls" in some sources.  His wife, Suzanne, broke her ankle and dislocated her shoulder in the collapse.  Two of the injured were police who dived into the river to rescue victims.  A male member of the table tennis team broke both of his legs.  The uninjured members of the Australian team elected to remain in Israel and compete in the games.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infections==
[[File:Ichilov.jpg|thumb|right|Tel Aviv Medical Center]]Within an hour or two of admission to the hospital, a number of victims began to show signs of [[asphyxia]]. Doctors discovered that an unidentified organism was attacking their [[respiratory system]]s and [[Lung|pulmonary]] blood vessels. By the next morning, seven athletes were in critical condition.&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;

Patrick Surkin, who ran the [[intensive care unit]] at Tel Aviv Medical Centre, wondered whether a toxin might be the culprit behind the infections. He contacted David Pargament, chief of the [[Yarkon River#Yarkon River Authority|Yarkon River Authority]], who explained that 36 hours before the collapse, [[mosquito_control#Oil_drip|mosquito larvicide oil]], a mixture of [[jet fuel]] and oil, had been sprayed on the surface of the Yarkon to suppress mosquitoes. Subsequent lab tests, however, found no traces of the substance in the sick athletes.&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;

Bowler Yetty Bennett, 50, died later that day from asphyxia. Elizabeth Sawicki, 47, a member of the delegation's [[Contract bridge|bridge]] team, died July 26 from complications from infection. Bowler Warren Zines, 54, died on August 10, 1997 of severe respiratory-tract infection at [[Sheba Medical Center]]. Zines was the fourth and final fatality from the accident.&lt;ref name="Trounson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tepperman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Segal2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Death" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmemann2" /&gt;

An autopsy of Zines finally identified the source of the infections as the fungus ''[[Pseudallescheria boydii]]'', a rare but serious cause of pneumonia and disseminated infection subsequent to near-drowning.  This species is resistant to nearly all available drug therapies.&lt;ref name="Dolin" /&gt; Disseminated infection can spread to the brain, kidneys, heart, and thyroid.&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;

After Zines' death, one athlete, tennis player Sasha Elterman, 15, remained in critical condition at Schneider Children's Medical Centre in Petah Tikva. Elterman underwent 18 surgeries in the six months after the collapse, 13 of them brain surgeries.  In total, she received 28 brain surgeries and two lung operations.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;  Elterman ultimately survived her ordeal, but her lungs permanently lost 40% of their capacity and she suffered from periodic convulsions.&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentenced" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elterman" group="n"&gt;Sasha Elterman was born in [[Los Angeles]] and at the time had dual Australian-United States citizenship.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten other athletes who returned to Australia shortly after the accident were admitted to hospitals with respiratory problems, but recovered.&lt;ref name="Trounson" /&gt;

==Investigations==
Israel's deputy minister of education, [[Moshe Peled (politician)|Moshe Peled]], immediately convened a public commission, chaired by Yishai Dotan, to investigate the collapse. Israel Police also conducted its own investigation. The Dotan Commission released its findings on the 23rd of July, 1997. The commission found that the Maccabiah Games' organising committee, led by Yoram Eyal, had departed from the usual practice of paying the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) to construct the bridge. Instead, in an apparent effort to reduce costs, Eyal contracted with a company called [[Irgunit]], headed by Adam Mishori, to construct the bridge. Irgunit's traditional business was the [[Set construction|construction of props and stage sets]] for [[Theatrical scenery|theatre productions]]. The company had never designed nor built a [[bridge]].&lt;ref name="Zycher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Segal1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Segal2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;

Irgunit sub-contracted the bridge's construction to Baruch Karagula and Yehoshua Ben-Ezra (also known as "Ben-Ezra Construction"). The commission found that Karagula and Ezra were not licensed to build bridges, had never attempted to build a bridge, and used substandard materials in the bridge's construction. Photographs taken after the collapse showed that the bridge was constructed of rusty metal pipes bound together with wire.&lt;ref name="Zycher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Segal1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Segal2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;

The commission concluded that the bridge's engineer, Micha Bar-Ilan, did not submit a blueprint for the bridge, designed a bridge that was inadequate for its intended use, and did not properly supervise or coordinate the bridge's construction. The commission faulted the Maccabiah Games' organizers for poor coordination and oversight over the bridge's assembly.&lt;ref name="Segal1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Segal2" /&gt;

An investigation by Augustine Zycher for the [[AIJAC|Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council]] reported that the IDF had employed Tamir Rowner, an experienced bridge construction engineer, to build previous bridges for the games. For the 1997 games, Maccabiah officials, apparently unwilling to pay the IDF's price of $111,000, accepted a bid from Irgunit to build the bridge for $34,750.&lt;ref name="Zycher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rowner" group="n"&gt;Rowner had already begun designing the 1997 bridge. As designed, Rowner's bridge would have been able to support 650 people at a time.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zycher, Mishori kept $7,700 of the payment and gave the rest to Karagula and Ben-Ezra to erect the bridge. Karagula and Ben-Ezra hired Bar-Ilan to design and oversee the bridge's construction. Bar-Ilan claimed that his bridge as designed would support 250&amp;nbsp;kg per square metre, which did not meet Israeli government standards, which required a pedestrian bridge to support 500&amp;nbsp;kg per square metre. In any event, the Dotan investigation found that the bridge was far weaker than what Bar-Ilan claimed. Furthermore, a municipal permit was required to construct the bridge, which Karagula and Ben-Ezra did not obtain. The municipality in which the bridge was constructed was [[Ramat Gan]]. Zvi Bar, Ramat Gan's mayor and head of the city planning division which issued construction permits, was a member of the Maccabiah committee that helped select Irgunit. Bar apparently did not ensure that Irgunit, Karagula, or Ben-Ezra obtained the necessary permit and made no effort to ensure that the bridge as constructed was safe.&lt;ref name="Zycher" /&gt;

In 1998, the [[Knesset]] commissioned an independent inquiry into the collapse, led by [[Eliezer Sandberg]].&lt;ref name="JTA1" /&gt;  In 2000, in response to the commission's findings and after continued calls for their removal by the Australian Jewish community, MWU president Ron Bakalarz and chairman Uzi Netanel resigned.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" JTA2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakalarz" group="n"&gt;The Knesset report stated that if Bakalarz refused to resign, then the Israeli government should cease funding the MWU.  Several years later, Bakalarz was hired as general manager/chairman of the board (sources differ on title) of Kfar Maccabiah Village, the headquarters for MWU and accommodations for athletes.  In 1999 the MWU also issued its own investigative report into the accident.  The report was criticized by members of the Australian Jewish community, who said that it whitewashed MWU's culpability.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal trial==
[[File:Elyakim Rubinstein High court judge.JPG|thumb|right|Elyakim Rubinstein]]Based on the findings of the Dotan and police investigations, Israel's attorney general [[Elyakim Rubinstein]] brought criminal charges against Eyal, Mishori, Karagula, Ben-Ezra, and Bar-Ilan for [[Criminal negligence|causing death by negligence]] and for building without proper permits.  Citing the pending indictment, Eyal resigned from the MWU.&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;  On March 15, 1998 in Tel Aviv [[Israeli judicial system#Magistrate courts|Magistrate Court]] all five pleaded not guilty. Final arguments in the trial were presented in October 1999.&lt;ref name="Beck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Segal1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Segal2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Xinhua1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deny" /&gt;

During the trial, [[Sheba Hospital]] [[microbiology|microbiologist]] Doctor Natan Keller testified that normally the Yarkon River water would not have posed a hazard to humans.  Keller stated that it was the collapse of the bridge and the thrashing of the people in the water which had agitated the fungus from the river bottom where it normally resided, supporting the prosecution's argument that the pollution in the river would not have posed a risk to the athletes if the bridge had not collapsed.  The defense, in turn, argued that the police should have shared responsibility in the collapse, as they had approved the building permit, were charged with limiting the number of people on the bridge to 150 at one time, and had possibly driven a police vehicle across the bridge the day before the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name="Microbiologist" /&gt;

On the 17th of April 2000, the three-judge panel of the court found all five defendants guilty of causing death by negligence.  The defendants were sentenced on the 5th of June, 2000. Bar-Ilan was sentenced to one year and nine months in prison, plus a suspended sentence of 21 months. Ben-Ezra and Kargula were given 15-months in prison, plus suspended sentences of two years. Mishori served nine months in prison, plus a suspended sentence of 15 months. Eyal was sentenced to six months' community service.&lt;ref name="Xinhua2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentenced" /&gt;

==Lawsuits==
The families of the deceased athletes, plus Sashah Elterman and 50 others injured in the collapse, sued MWU for damages in 1999.&lt;ref name="JTA" /&gt;  Progress in the lawsuits was initially delayed by a dispute among the parties over who should bear liability, which was resolved by the criminal court convictions in 2000.  Due to the ongoing litigation, plus [[List of violent incidents in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, 2001|security concerns]], the Australians only sent 65 athletes to the 2001 iteration of the games.&lt;ref name="Labi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mualem" /&gt;

A district court in [[Haifa]] eventually awarded the claimants almost $US20 million in compensation, with the last judgement and payment made in 2004.  The court ruled that the games' insurance provider, Phoenix Insurance Company, was liable for about two-thirds of the amount, with the Israeli government responsible for the remainder.&lt;ref name="Labi" /&gt;

==Environmental issues==
The bridge accident highlighted Israel's environmental issues, especially pollution in the nation's rivers and waterways. Said Dror Avisar, chief hydrologist for the Israel Union for Environmental Defense, shortly after the collapse, "Almost every major river inside Israel is polluted."&lt;ref name="Trounson" /&gt;  The pollution in the waterways, including the Yarkon, was mainly due to untreated sewage and storm runoff, hazardous chemicals, industrial waste, and other pollutants."&lt;ref name="Trounson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Picow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vered" /&gt;

[[File:Hayarkon IMG 8516.JPG|thumb|right|Yarkon River in 2010]]Embarrassed by the negative publicity about the pollution, the Israeli government, in conjunction with other national environmental-improvement initiatives, cleaned-up portions of the Yarkon River via the Yarkon River Rehabilitation and Wetlands Project.  Citizens groups assisted with the endeavor, including the [[Clean Up Israel]] organization which was founded by Australian Phillip Foxman, who witnessed the 1997 disaster,&lt;ref name="Goldberg3" /&gt; and the [[Jewish National Fund]].&lt;ref name="JNF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rinat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berman" /&gt;  In 2004, the Israeli government provided $100 million for the project.&lt;ref name="JTA3" /&gt;  Among other measures, the local [[wastewater treatment plant]] was upgraded, a wetland was created to naturally treat wastewater, and small dams were constructed to help aerate the water to allow fish to live in more sections of the river.  In addition, parks and bicycle trails were constructed along sections of the river banks.&lt;ref name="May" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Picow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crisis" /&gt;

==Aftermath and memorials==
In 2002, MWU reinstated Yoram Eyal as an executive official and as general manager of the Kfar Maccabiah Village in Ramat Gan, with an annual salary of US$120,000.&lt;ref name="Benjamin" /&gt;  The village served as headquarters for MWU and the athletes' village for the games.  Eyal refused all requests to be interviewed by Australian media.  In spite of protests from the Australian Jewish community about Eyal's continued involvement with the games, the MWU declined to separate him from the organization.  When asked about Eyal's status in July 2007, MWU President Jeanne Futeran stated, "He’s a good guy; he doesn’t deserve to be further hassled over what happened. He’s never forgiven himself; he never will forgive himself."&lt;ref name="Goldberg2" /&gt;

Australia sent a full team of 543 athletes to the Maccabiah Games in July 2005, almost a quarter of whom were present at the 1997 bridge collapse.  The Australian delegation requested that Eyal not be seated in the president's box during the opening ceremony when the team entered the stadium.  Although the MWU responded that Eyal had a right to attend the ceremony in an official capacity, Eyal acceded to the Australian's request.&lt;ref name="Eyal" group="n"&gt;Eyal also resigned as MWU's representative to the Israeli Olympic committee.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australian team declined to stay at the Maccabiah athletes' village for the duration of the 2005 games.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Halle" /&gt;

[[File:Maccabia Br 035.jpg|thumb|right|Bridge of Remembrance]]At the 2005 games, a memorial for the victims was unveiled at the site of the collapse, including a permanent footbridge, dubbed "Bridge of Remembrance," and a stone marker with the names of those who died.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2" /&gt;  Family members of three of the deceased attended the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Halle1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Halle2" /&gt;

In 2007 on the tenth anniversary of the collapse, a memorial service was held at the Bridge of Remembrance.  In attendance was Australian Ambassador to Israel James Larsen and MWU Director-General Eyal Tiberger.  In Australia, prayer services were held at synagogues in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and the Gold Coast and a memorial made of [[Jerusalem stone]] was dedicated at Melbourne’s main Jewish cemetery, where four trees were planted in memory of the deceased.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2" /&gt;  Memorial ceremonies have since continued to be held periodically at the bridge site.&lt;ref name="Cashman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KKL" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">A '''moral victory''' occurs when a person, team, army or other group loses a confrontation, and yet achieves some other [[morality|moral]] gain. This gain might be unrelated to the confrontation in question, and the gain is often considerably less than what would have been accomplished if an actual victory had been achieved. 

For example, a sports team that is a heavy [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] and loses narrowly to a superior opponent might claim a moral victory, acquitting themselves well even in defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE2DF103FF930A35751C0A96E9C8B63|title= Giants Hope a Moral Victory Can Lead to a Real One|publisher=''New York Times''|date=2008-02-03|author=Lapointe, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team that plays fairly and loses to a cheating team might also claim a moral victory in spite of the loss. 

Another  moral victory can be seen in [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[The Crucible]]'', where the character  [[Giles Corey]] was pressed to death by large stones because he remained silent, neither denying nor confirming the accusations of witchcraft. Because "witches" had all their land and property taken from them, his silence allowed his children to inherit his land when they could not have otherwise.

From a sporting context, a moral victory could be seen in Peter Maxey's 3-0 loss to Alex Lowery, in Michael Page Finance's final day prior to an office move. Sure, the history books will show a 3-0 victory for Alex, but it is commonly agreed amongst fellow players, pundits and historians that Maxey's style of play, aggressive shots, entertaining play and showmanship scored the moral victory. Other examples include [[University of South Carolina Gamecocks vs Clemson University Tigers (2018 Palmetto Bowl: 56 CU - 35 Scar; 3 Touchdown Defeat)]]. This marked the fifth straight defeat in the lopsided rivalry, however the Gamecock faithful found relief in the loss compared to the previous four humiliating meetings.

Others may include scenarios in which a force loses a struggle, but inflicts great losses upon their opponents (the opposite of a [[Pyrrhic victory]]. Examples include the [[Battle of the Alamo]] and the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]).

{{Refimprove|date=November 2016}}
'''No goal''' is a call made by [[referee]]s in various [[Goal (sport)|goal]]-scoring sports ([[soccer|football]], [[hockey]], [[lacrosse]], etc.) to indicate that a goal has not been scored. It is commonly used to disallow an apparent goal, such as when the ball or puck has entered the net but should not count as a score due to some foul or infraction.

Because the decision often depends on a subjective assessment by the referee, and especially if the score might be critical, such calls can be hotly contested. For fans of one of the teams involved, it may thus refer to a goal that was actually disallowed, or one that in their opinion should have been disallowed, but was not. As a result, in recent years most professional sports leagues have implicated protocol allowing for such calls to be subject to video review or to be reviewed because of a [[coach's challenge]].

== National Hockey League (NHL) ==
In the [[NHL]] a goal may be called a no goal for the following reasons: 
# When the puck has been directed, batted or thrown into the net by an attacking player other than with a stick.
# (ii)  When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion.
# (iii)  When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official.
# (iv)  When a goal has been scored and an ineligible player is on the ice.
# (v)  When an attacking player has interfered with a goalkeeper in his goal crease.
# (vi)  When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor. See 38.4(vi).
# (vii)  When video review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed.
# (viii)  When a Linesman reports a double-minor penalty for high-sticking, a major penalty or a match penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending team, the goal must be disallowed and the appropriate penalty assessed.
# (ix)  When a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save. See also 69.6.
# (x)  When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal.
# (xi)  During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending team cannot score unless the non-offending team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending player or any physical action by an offending player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending team.
# (xii)  When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if he had not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing his whistle.
# (xiii) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2014-2015-rulebook.pdf|title=NHL Rulebook Rule 78.5|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Lacrosse League (NLL) ==
According to the [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]] rulebook (Rule 55: No Goal) a goal may be disallowed under the following conditions:

# (55.1) When the ball passes through the plane of the net after the game clock’s horn or shot clock has sounded to indicate the end of a quarter or overtime period or expiration of the shot clock.
# (55.2) A crease violation will result in a no goal. Crease violation is rule 69.
# (55.3) When the ball passes through the plane of the goal when the attacking team has too many players on the floor including those in the penalty box at the time of the play.
# (55.4) When the ball passes through the plane of the goal after one of the officials has sounded his whistle for any reason, including the sounding of an inadvertent whistle.
# (55.5) When the player makes contact with the goalie. See Contact While Shooting on Net Rule 69.
# (55.6)  When the ball passes through the plane of the goal from a stick that is found to be illegal by a stick check.
# (55.7)  When the ball is kicked in a kicking motion directly or indirectly into the opponent’s goal.
# (55.8)  When the ball is directed into the net off the free hand of an opponent.
# (55.9)  When a ball is lodged, or not, in the throat of the pocket and the ball and stick is inadvertently or deliberately tossed into the goal.
# (55.10) In the event that a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net by his teammate on his own accord and the ball crosses the goal line after making the stop, the goal will be allowed. In the event that a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net by an opponent and the ball crosses the goal line after making the stop, the goal will be disallowed. The plays are subject to any appropriate penalties.
# (55.11) If the ball is loose in the crease an opposing  player may not direct the ball into the goal. If the ball is loose in the crease, an opposing player must have possession prior to any scoring attempt. A no goal shall be called if the ball is loose in the crease, directed by an opposing player and having the ball make contact with the goalie or a defender prior to the ball going into the net.
# (55.12) If a goal is scored when an ineligible player is on the floor, the goal will be disallowed. The ineligible player will be removed from the game and the club shall not be able to substitute another player on its roster. An ineligible player is a player who had been previously ejected from the game, and subject to league discipline.
# (55.13) If a goal is scored when the attackers’ stick head is behind the goal line extended when releasing the ball during the act of shooting, the goal will be disallowed.
# (55.14) If a player takes a shot and the head of his stick comes off and the ball enters the goal, the goal would be disallowed and the ball awarded to the goalie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/nllassets/2016+NLL+Rulebook.pdf|title=NLL Rulebook Rule 55|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to exercise:

'''[[Physical exercise|Exercise]]''' &amp;ndash; any bodily activity that enhances or maintains  [[physical fitness]] and overall [[health]] and wellness. It is performed for various reasons including strengthening [[muscle]]s and the [[cardiovascular system]], honing [[sport|athletic]] skills, [[weight loss]] or maintenance, as well as for the purpose of enjoyment. Frequent and regular physical exercise boosts the [[immune system]], and helps prevent the "[[diseases of affluence]]" such as [[heart disease]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[Type 2 diabetes]] and [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 343| journal = New England Journal of Medicine| title = Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease in Women through Diet and Lifestyle| issue = 1| pages = 16–22| doi = 10.1056/NEJM200007063430103| pmid = 10882764| year = 2000| last1 = Stampfer| first1 = M.

'''Raw Run''' is recognized colloquially within the [[longboarding]] community as a recorded video showcasing the entire descent down a hill, from top to bottom. This is typically done all in one [[take]] to showcase the rider's consistency and skill.

== Notable Examples ==

[[Colorado]] native and longboarder, Zak Maytum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/09/09/watch-zak-maytum-longboards-near-70-mph-in-colorado/28161/|title = WATCH: Zak Maytum longboards near 70 mph in Colorado|date = September 9, 2015|accessdate = September 9, 2015|website = WATCH: Zak Maytum longboards near 70 mph in Colorado|publisher = The Denver Post|last = Nguyen|first = Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; made national news when a video of him descending a roadway reportedly achieving 70&amp;nbsp;mph went [[Viral video|viral]]. The [[YouTube]] video titled "Raw Run: Zak Maytum" reached one million views in under two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fOVXndyjAo|title = Raw Run: Zak Maytum|date = 2015-09-08|accessdate = 2015-09-09|website = Raw Run: Zak Maytum|publisher = Youtube|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26530">Retiring the [[Number (sports)|number]] of an athlete is an honor a team bestows upon a player, usually after the player has left the team, retires from the sport, or dies. Once a number  is retired, no future player from the team may wear that number on their uniform, unless the player so-honored permits it; however, in many cases the number cannot be used at all. Such an honor may also be bestowed on players who had highly memorable careers, died prematurely under tragic circumstances,&lt;ref name=dt-cricket&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/phillip-hughes-remembered-michael-clarke-delivers-emotional-tribute-to-batsman-and-confirms-his-odi-number-will-be-retired/story-fni2flhh-1227139087364 |title=Phillip Hughes remembered: Michael Clarke delivers emotional tribute to batsman and confirms his ODI number will be retired |author=Horne, Ben |date=29 November 2014 |accessdate=29 November 2014 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; or have had their promising careers ended by serious injury. Some sports that retire team numbers include [[baseball]], [[cricket]],&lt;ref name=dt-cricket/&gt; [[ice hockey]], [[basketball]], [[American football]], and [[association football]]. Retired jerseys are often referred to as "''hanging from the rafters''" as they are, literally, put to hang in the team's home arena.&lt;ref name="rafters"&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/retired_numbers.html Hanging from the Rafters] NBA Encyclopedia. Retrieved 16 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first number officially retired by a team in a professional sport was that of [[ice hockey]] player [[Ace Bailey]], whose number 6 was retired by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greene|first=Nick|title=Who Had the First Jersey Number to Be Retired in Sports?|publisher=[[Mental Floss]]|date=November 7, 2014|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/59830/who-had-first-jersey-number-be-retired-sports|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some teams have also retired number 12 in honor of their fans, or the "[[12th man (football)|Twelfth Man]]".&lt;ref name="Eurosport numbers game"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/22072008/58/serie-ronaldinho-plays-numbers-game.html|title=Serie A - Ronaldinho plays numbers game|publisher=Yahoo!|work=Eurosport|date=22 July 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829130338/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/22072008/58/serie-ronaldinho-plays-numbers-game.html|archivedate=29 August 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Sacramento Kings]] and [[Orlando Magic]] retired number 6 in honor of their fans, the "[[Sixth man (fans)|Sixth Man]]".

In some cases, a team may decide to retire a number in honor of tragedies involving the team's city or state. For example, in March 2018, the number 58 was retired by the [[Vegas Golden Knights#Retired numbers|Vegas Golden Knights]] hockey team in honor of the 58 victims killed in the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]].&lt;ref name=retn58&gt;{{cite web|last1=Granger|first1=Jesse|title=Golden Knights retire jersey No. 58 to honor shooting victims|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2018/mar/31/golden-knights-retire-jersey-no-58-to-honor-shooti|publisher=Greenspun Media Group|work=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=April 1, 2018|date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jackie Robinson Retired.PNG|thumb|right|A plaque honoring Jackie Robinson in Monument Park at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|old Yankee Stadium]].]]
If a jersey is retired and an active player is still wearing it, the player is usually [[Grandfather clause|permitted to wear the number for his entire career]] as a player. If in the sport, managers and coaches wear uniform numbers, and the player later becomes a coach for the same team, he is also permitted to wear it as a coach.

However, in some cases the player may elect to change their number. For instance, in 1987 the [[Boston Bruins]] of the [[National Hockey League]] decided to retire jersey number 7 in honor of [[Phil Esposito]], who had become a star while playing for the team. At the time #7 belonged to [[Ray Bourque]], who was the Bruins' captain and had become a star in his own right. On the night of the ceremony honoring Esposito, Bourque took to the ice wearing his normal jersey. He skated over to the Hall of Famer, took off the jersey, and handed it to Esposito in what was referred to as Bourque's "surrendering" of the number he had worn since breaking into the league. Underneath was a jersey numbered 77, which would become as associated with Bourque as the 7 was with Esposito in Boston.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harding |first=Thomas |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20010610/ai_n9988311 |title= Raymond Bourque timeline |work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] |location=Colorado Springs |accessdate=July 21, 2008 | date=June 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bourque's new jersey number would eventually join Esposito's in the rafters of [[TD Garden]], as the Bruins retired his #77 following his 2001 retirement.

In rare cases, a number may be retired because of the player's endeavors in other fields. For example, former college football star [[Gerald Ford]]'s number 48 was retired by the [[University of Michigan]] football squad by virtue of his future career as the 38th [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/more/12/27/ford.athletics.ap/index.html |title=Ford one of most athletic presidents |work=Associated Press |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=Sports Illustrated via CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102220130/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/more/12/27/ford.athletics.ap/index.html |archivedate=January 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams also take numbers out of circulation without formally retiring them.  For example, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] have only officially retired two numbers: [[Ernie Stautner]]'s #70 and [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]]'s #75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.steelers.com/news/article-1/Pittsburgh-Steelers-to-Retire-Joe-Greenes-Number-75/0a9e49b0-97db-4c90-9a5d-a486ed8f7889 |title=Pittsburgh Steelers to Retire Joe Greene's Number '75' |publisher=Pittsburgh Steelers |date=July 30, 2014 |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they have not reissued the numbers of several of their greatest players since they retired, and it is understood that no Steeler will ever wear them again.  Similarly, with the exception of a pair of quarterbacks in the mid-1980s, the [[Green Bay Packers]] have not re-issued [[Paul Hornung]]'s number 5 since his departure from the team following the 1966 season. The [[Dallas Cowboys]] do not officially retire numbers, but it is generally understood that [[Roger Staubach]]'s #12, [[Bob Lilly]]'s #74, [[Troy Aikman]]'s #8, and [[Emmitt Smith]]'s #22 will never be worn again in the regular season (though the Cowboys have occasionally used Lilly's 74 in the preseason). Additionally, after [[Peyton Manning]] was released by the [[Indianapolis Colts]], owner [[Jim Irsay]] stated that no Colt will ever wear Manning's #18 again, though it was not officially retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7656028/indianapolis-colts-peyton-manning-part-ways-14-seasons|title=Colts, Manning part ways after 14 seasons|website=go.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his departure from the team in 2004, the Lakers removed [[Shaquille O'Neal]]'s #34 from circulation. The Lakers had announced the intention to retire O'Neal's #34 officially, doing so on April 2, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/04/02/lakers-shaq-retire-number.ap/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpts|title=Lakers hang Shaq's No. 34 jersey in the rafters|website=nba.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some teams either formally or informally take a jersey out of circulation when a player dies or has his career ended by serious injury or disease.  For instance, between 1934-2016, the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] only retired a player's number if he experienced a career-ending incident while playing for the team.  As a result, they had only retired two jerseys in their history during that time; [[Ace Bailey]]'s #6 was retired after he suffered a career-ending head injury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=42246|title=Toronto Mapleleafs - Alumni|website=nhl.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Barilko]]'s #5 was retired after his disappearance and presumed death on a fishing trip (his death was confirmed years later with the discovery of the wreckage of the plane on which he was flying).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=42246|title=Toronto Mapleleafs - Alumni|website=nhl.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[New York Yankees]] retired [[Lou Gehrig]]'s #4 after he was forced to retire due to [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].  The [[New York Jets]] did not reissue the #90 of [[Dennis Byrd]] following a career ending neck injury, and eventually retired the number in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/8541822/former-new-york-jets-scott-mersereau-dennis-byrd-share-bond-life-changing-collision-break |title=The bond no man could break |first=Rich |last=Cimini |publisher=''[[ESPN.com|ESPNNewYork.com]]'' |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, after [[Wayne Chrebet]] was forced to retire after suffering multiple concussions, the Jets took his #80 out of circulation but have not yet retired it; Byrd and [[Curtis Martin]] were the most recent Jets to have their numbers retired as both were done on the same day. After [[Magic Johnson]] retired because of his HIV disease, the Lakers retired his jersey #32. 

In 2008, [[Princeton University]] retired the number 42 for all [[Princeton Tigers]] sports teams in honor of [[Bill Bradley]] and [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Dick Kazmaier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kazmaier '52, sports icon, dies at 82|work=[[Princeton Alumni Weekly]]|date=September 18, 2013|page=49|volume=114|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] retired the same number in 2014 for all [[UCLA Bruins|Bruins]] sports teams in honor of [[Jackie Robinson]], who had played in four sports at the school prior to his [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] baseball career. Although Robinson never wore #42 at UCLA, the school chose it because of its indelible identification with Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.uclabruins.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30500&amp;ATCLID=209775149 |title=UCLA Honors Jackie Robinson by Retiring #42 Across All Sports |publisher=UCLA Athletics |date=November 22, 2014 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2011 Michigan Wolverines football team|2011]], [[Michigan Wolverines football]] unretired all of the numbers that it had retired to create legends jerseys worn by its best players. The unretired jerseys were [[Bennie Oosterbaan]]'s No. 47, [[Gerald Ford]]'s No. 48, [[Ron Kramer]]'s No. 87, The Wistert Brothers' ([[Whitey Wistert]], [[Al Wistert]], [[Alvin Wistert]]) No. 11 and [[Tom Harmon]]'s No. 98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/061212aaa.html|title=U-M to Recognize Ford, Kramer and Oosterbaan as Football Legends|date=June 12, 2012|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=mgoblue.com|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101312aaa.html|title=Ford Named Michigan Football Legend; Morgan to Wear No. 48 Jersey|date=October 13, 2012|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=mgoblue.com|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2015 Michigan Wolverines football team|2015]], the Legends program was discontinued, and the numbers re-retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Football Retired Jerseys|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=MGoBlue.com|accessdate=November 28, 2015|date=November 28, 2015|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/retired-jerseys.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208054435/http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/retired-jerseys.html|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2017, [[Kobe Bryant]] became the only player in the world to have had two numbers (8, 24) retired by the same franchise - [[Los Angeles Lakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-kobe-jersey-20170912-story.html|title=Lakers plan to retire both numbers, 8 and 24, that Kobe Bryant wore during his career|last=Ganguli|first=Tania|date=2017-09-12|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===League-wide retirements===
[[Jackie Robinson]], the first black player in the modern era of [[Major League Baseball]], had his [[uniform number (Major League Baseball)|number]] 42 retired league-wide in 1997. However, players who were wearing the number at the time were [[Grandfather clause#Sports|permitted to retain it]] for the duration of their careers; [[Mariano Rivera]] was the last remaining player to wear the number, and he retired at the end of the {{mlby|2013|disp=seas}}. The only other exception to this retirement is on [[Jackie Robinson Day|April 15]], the anniversary of Robinson's MLB debut, when all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, umpires) wear 42. [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s number 99 was likewise retired league-wide by the [[National Hockey League]] at the [[50th National Hockey League All-Star Game|2000 NHL All-Star Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perfect setting: Gretzky's number retired before All-Star Game |publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated.

==Association football==
{{main|Retired numbers in association football}}
Some [[association football]] clubs have started doing this as squad numbers have become common. [[A.S. Roma|AS Roma]], [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]], [[Internazionale]], [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[RC Lens|Lens]], [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] and [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] have all retired shirt numbers; Milan retiring [[Franco Baresi]]'s #6 shirt and [[Paolo Maldini]]'s #3 shirt (with the caveat that one of Maldini's sons can wear the shirt if they play professionally for the club).&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/27/football-the-knowledge-retired-shirts |title=Which clubs have retired shirt numbers? |author=Scott Murray |author2=Paolo Bandini |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 May 2009 |accessdate=11 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swansea retired the shirt number of [[Besian Idrizaj]] after he died in his sleep, of a suspected heart attack, at his family home in [[Linz]], [[Austria]]. Manchester City, Lens and Lyon all retired the shirt number of [[Marc-Vivien Foé]] after his death on the field in the [[2003 Confederations Cup]]; the [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon national team]] also attempted to retire Foé's number, but [[FIFA]] prevented them from doing so.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  FIFA also rejected an attempt by [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] to retire the number #10 of [[Diego Maradona]].

==Australian rules football==
In [[Australian rules football]], some clubs may exercise the right to retire a particular [[Guernsey (Australian rules football)|guernsey]] number, either to honour a past player or to simply cease use of the number. Examples include the [[Hawthorn Football Club]], who retired their No. 1 guernsey prior to the beginning of the [[2011 AFL season]] as the tribute to the fans, according to Max Bailey, the last person to wear the #1 guernsey, had his career cut short by multiple injuries to his right knee, and thanked the fans in his comeback attempts, and the [[Collingwood Football Club]], who retired their No. 42 shirt in honour of [[Darren Millane]], a Collingwood premiership player who was killed in a car crash in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/magpie-collingwood-open-to-reviving-no42/story-e6frf9jf-1226055168553 Magpie Collingwood open to reviving No.42], ''Herald Sun'', 13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auto racing==
In [[NASCAR]], only once has a number been officially retired; that is in the [[Whelen Modified Tour]], where number 61 is retired for [[Richie Evans]] after his death in 1985. NASCAR unofficially retired the number 3 in honor of [[Dale Earnhardt|Dale Earnhardt Sr.]] after his [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|death on the track]] at the [[2001 Daytona 500]]. Following his death, Earnhardt's old team changed to the number 29, and the replacement driver ([[Kevin Harvick]]) drove the 29 car through the 2013 season.  [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] made two special appearances in a number 3 car in the [[Xfinity Series|Busch Series]] in 2002 and again in the renamed Nationwide Series on July 2, 2010 at Daytona, but otherwise the number 3 was absent from all three national touring series until 2009, when [[Austin Dillon]] drove a number 3 in the [[Camping World Truck Series]].&lt;ref name="Dillon-3"&gt;{{cite web| title= Childress grandson brings No. 3 back to national level| url= http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/truck/09/03/rcr.adillon.3/ | date=September 3, 2009 | first= David |last=Caraviello| publisher= NASCAR | accessdate= 2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon is the grandson of Earnhardt's longtime friend and car owner [[Richard Childress]], and he drives for [[Richard Childress Racing]]. After winning the Truck Series title in [[2011 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|2011]], he drove the #3 car in the [[Xfinity Series|Nationwide Series]] in 2012 and 2013, and returned the number to the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Cup Series]] in 2014 when he began competing full-time in that series for RCR. [[Ty Dillon]], Austin's brother (another grandson of Childress), ran the number 3 in the Camping World Truck Series and began driving the number 3 in the Nationwide Series, now known as the Xfinity Series, in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2013-02-06/austin-dillon-dale-earnhardt-no-3-richard-childress-racing-sprint-cup|title=Austin Dillon hopes to wait for full Cup schedule to run Dale Earnhardt’s No. 3|date=6 February 2013|website=sportingnews.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 to 2006, drivers in the [[International Race of Champions]] used their numbers from their primary racing series. However, the #3 was retired as a result of Earnhardt's death and any driver who drove the #3 in their primary racing series would drive #03 instead. As such, [[Hélio Castroneves]], who drives #3 in the [[IndyCar Series]], drove the #03.

Following the 1989 [[24 Hours of Daytona]], months after his fatal plane crash, [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] retired [[Al Holbert]]'s #14.&lt;ref name="prototypes, p14"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = J.

[[Champ Car|CART]] retired the use of #99 after the fatal accident of [[Greg Moore (racing driver)|Greg Moore]] in 1999. However, since the [[IndyCar Series]] unification took place in 2008, that recognition has since been abandoned. For a brief time during the early-mid 1990s, CART unofficially retired #14 (in honor of [[A. J. Foyt]]), allowing it only to be carried only by an entry of [[A. J. Foyt Enterprises]]. After the open wheel split in 1996, the rule in CART competition was lifted.

[[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] retired the use of #74 after the fatal accident of [[Daijiro Kato]] in 2003, #48 after the fatal accident of [[Shoya Tomizawa]] in 2010, #58 after the accident of [[Marco Simoncelli]] at the [[Sepang Circuit]] in 2011, and #39 after the death of [[Luis Salom]] at the [[Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya|Circuit de Catalunya]] in 2016.

The [[Formula One World Championship]], which has allowed drivers to choose their own number since the 2014 season, retired the use of #17 after the 2015 death of [[Jules Bianchi]] from critical injuries sustained in a crash at the [[2014 Japanese Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/latest/headlines/2015/7/number-17-to-be-retired-in-bianchis-honour.html|title=Number 17 to be retired in Bianchi’s honour|website=formula1.com|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
Australian Cricket retired [[Phillip Hughes]]' One-Day International shirt number, 64, in remembrance of him, after his death during a match in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/phillip-hughes-remembered-michael-clarke-delivers-emotional-tribute-to-batsman-and-confirms-his-odi-number-will-be-retired/story-fni2flhh-1227139087364|title=Phillip Hughes remembered: Michael Clarke delivers emotional tribute to batsman and confirms his ODI number will be retired|author=Horne, Ben|date=29 November 2014|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby league==
In other sports such as [[Rugby league|Rugby League]] and [[Rugby union|Rugby Union]], despite the long history of the games, it used to be the case that because each number represents the particular positions on the field, the retirement of jersey numbers was impossible.  However, as more leagues have gone over the use of squad numbers the retirement of numbers is now possible.  The first recorded example in Rugby League was in May 2015 when [[Keighley Cougars]] withdrew number 6 following the death of [[Danny Jones (rugby league)|Danny Jones]] during a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/04/keighley-cougars-danny-jones |title=Keighley Cougars retire No6 shirt after Danny Jones’s death |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 May 2015 |accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of former player [[Roger Millward]], [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] withdrew the number 6 shirt Millward used to wear.  [[Terry Campese]] who had been allocated that number for 2016 was allocated squad number 32 instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/rugby-league/news/12217/10270479/roger-millwards-no-6-shirt-retired-by-hull-kr |title=Roger Millward's No 6 shirt retired by Hull KR |work=[[Sky Sports]] |date=5 May 2016 |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sports==
In [[Finland|Finnish]] ice hockey, if a player's number is retired, family members (most notably his son, or son-in-law) can use the retired number if he plays for the same organization. [[Timo Nummelin]] had his number 3 retired by [[TPS (ice hockey)|TPS]], and later his son, [[Petteri Nummelin]], wore number 3 for the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/184399|title=The monarch of defence|date=22 February 2007|publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]''|first=Cathal|last=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''skull and crossbones''' was a common fraternal motif as a symbol of mortality and warning in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The symbol was adopted, for various reasons, by many sporting teams, clubs and societies in both America and Europe. 

==Adoption by societies==
The skull and crossbones motif was used by many American college fraternities, sororities and secret societies founded in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The most well-known example of this usage is the [[Skull and Bones]] society, a [[secret society]] at [[Yale University]] which derives its very name from the symbol. Other well-known college fraternal organizations which use the skull and bones in some capacity in their public symbols include, but are not limited to: [[Delta Sigma Pi]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], [[Phi Kappa Sigma]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Chi Psi]] and [[Zeta Beta Tau]] Fraternities and [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]], [[Chi Omega]], and [[Kappa Delta]] Sororities. Other fraternal groups also use the skull and crossbones in their symbolism or in their secret fraternal rituals. These groups include the [[Knights of Columbus]], the [[Royal Black Institution]], [[Apprentice Boys of Derry]] as well as the [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Knights Templar degree of Freemasonry]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} 

In fraternal usage, the skull and crossbones – along with full skeletons and the skull alone – are a very common motif due to their common association with death. The significance of these symbols varies from group to group. For some, they are a symbolic reminder of mortality. For others, the symbol has a religious reference (as with the Masonic Knights Templar, for which the skull and bones symbolize Golgotha, the place of Jesus' crucifixion). Another common fraternal use is one of warning wherein the skull and crossbones symbolize a dire warning against betraying the group's secrets and/or failing to keep one's oath.

==Adoption by sporting teams==
[[File:Barbarians FC April 1891.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Barbarians team that faced Exeter, April 1891]]
In sports, the symbol was first adopted in the 1870s and was popular across many football sports in [[Great Britain]] and is still widely used by modern sports teams. The earliest teams to adopt the skull and crossbones were [[rugby union]] teams of the time. Although some coastal teams adopted an association with pirates in their team name, most teams used the symbol simply as a form of rebellion and its connotation with danger. The first [[Cardiff RFC]] team adopted a white skull and crossbones on the teams black strip in 1876, but this was changed the next season after pressure from the players' parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=D.E. |coauthors= |title=Cardiff Rugby Club, History and Statistics 1876-1975 |year=1975 |publisher=The Starling Press |location=Risca|page=13 |isbn=0-9504421-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol was also used by the invitational touring rugby team the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]], but this was dropped for the black and white hoops by the late 1890s.

In Ireland the [[University College Cork]], has used the skull and crossbones laid over the University badge for many of its sporting teams, most notably the [[University College Cork RFC|College rugby team]]. Although there is dispute to the origin of the adoption of the badge, it is believed that the University's past connection as a medical school may have been the reason for its use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uccrugby.ie/clubhistory.aspx UCC Rugby :: Club History] uccrugby.ie&lt;/ref&gt; The University College even references the skull and crossbones in their College Victory Cry.

[[Poole Pirates]] [[Motorcycle speedway|Speedway]] Team in the [[United Kingdom]] have the Skull and Crossbones as their team badge. 

The logo of the [[Blackshirts (American football)|Blackshirts]], the starting defensive unit for the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football]] team, is a Skull and Crossbones with the skull wearing the team [[Football helmet|helmet]]. Additionally, the players and fans often celebrate by "throwing the bones", where they cross the forearms in the air, in a 'X', imitating the logo.

[[FC St. Pauli]] supporters adopted the Skull and Crossbones as an unofficial symbol of the club.

The athletic teams of [[East Carolina University]], nicknamed [[East Carolina Pirates|Pirates]], use a modified skull and crossbones flag as their symbol.  (The skull wears a purple tricornered hat.)

'''Periodization''' is the systematic planning of [[physical training|athletic or physical training]].&lt;ref name=Rowbottom&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowbottom|first=David J.|editor1-first=William E.|editor1-last=Garrett|editor2-first=Donald T.|editor2-last=Kirkendall|title=Periodization of Training|year=2000|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780683034219|page=499|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 20, 2013|chapter=Periodization of Training|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to reach the best possible performance in the most important competition of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] (1973). Periodization or Peaking at the right time, in: Track Technique 54 (1973), pp.1720- 1724&lt;/ref&gt; It involves progressive cycling of various aspects of a training program during a specific period. Conditioning programs can use periodization to break up the training program into the off-season, preseason, inseason, and the postseason. Periodization divides the year round condition program into phases of training which focus on different goals.

==History==
The roots of periodization come from [[Hans Selye]]’s model, known as the [[General adaptation syndrome]]
The GAS describes three basic stages of response to stress: (a) the Alarm stage, involving the initial shock of the stimulus on the system, (b) the Resistance stage, involving the adaptation to the stimulus by the system, and (c) the Exhaustion stage, in that repairs are inadequate, and a decrease in system function results. The foundation of periodic training is keeping one's body in the resistance stage without ever going into the exhaustion stage.  By adhering to cyclic training the body is given adequate time to recover from significant stress before additional training is undertaken. The response to a new stress is to first respond poorly and the response drops off. For example when the body is first exposed to sun a sunburn might develop. During the resistance stage adaptation improves the response to a higher level, called super compensation, than the previous equilibrium. The example would be that a suntan develops. The exhaustion stage is a continuation of the stimulus at too high a level and the increase gained from adaptation is now offset and all gains are lost. The example would be that wrinkles, spots, or even skin cancer develop. The goal in sports periodization is to reduce the stress at the point where the resistance stage ends so the body has time to recover. In this way the exhaustion stage does not reduce the gains achieved, the body can recover and remain above the original equilibrium point. The next cycle of increased stimulus now improves the response further and the equilibrium point continues to rise after each cycle.

Selye (1957) labeled beneficial stresses as "[[eustress]]" and detrimental stresses as "distress". In athletics, when physical stress is at a healthy level (eustress), an athlete experiences muscular strength and growth, while excessive physical stress (distress) can lead to tissue damage, disease, and death. Periodization is most widely used in resistance program design to avoid over-training and to systematically alternate high loads of training with decreased loading phases to improve components of muscular fitness (e.g. strength, strength-speed, and strength-endurance). The Selye-cycles are similar to the "micro cycles" used at later times.

[[Russia]]n [[physiologist]] [[Leo Matveyev]] and Romanian sport scientist [[Tudor Bompa]] expanded and further organized the periodization model. Matveyev has been regarded as the father of modern periodization. He analysed the results of the Soviet athletes of the 1952 and 1956 summer Olympics and compared successful and not so successful athletes and their training schedules. From these training plans periodized schedules were developed for the 1960 Olympics. With the success of the Soviet athletes, Matveyev's plans were spread all over the Eastern  Bloc in their annual coordination meetings. From there it also spread to Romania, where [[Tudor Bompa]] developed the system further. In the 1968 it was used for the first time in the GDR and in 1972 in West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]. Nachwort zum neusten Stand der Literatur zur Periodisierung, in: L. P. MATWEJEW: Periodisierung des sportlichen Trainings. Berlin: Bartels &amp; Wernitz 1972, 201 - 231 (2. Aufl. 1978). Also basis for the French translation: Postface.La base de l'entraînement.Paris: Vigot 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Soviet Union, periodization started to become modified. While Matveyev followed Pavlov{{which|date=May 2016}} and assumed that everybody should use the same periodization, individualised systems, using more and more biological data, were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. PLATONOV: General theory of training of athletes in Olympic sports. Kiew: Olympic Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic training systems typically divide time up into three types of cycles: microcycle, mesocycle, and macrocycle. The microcycle is generally up to 7 days. The mesocycle may be anywhere from 2 weeks to a few months, but is typically a month. A macrocycle refers to the overall training period, usually representing a year or two. There are longer cycles as well for the Olympian, being 4 or 8 years, and the career plan which is usually only considered for Olympians and professional athletes.

==Theory of planning==
Training should be organized and planned in advance of a competition or performance.
It should consider the [[sportsperson|athlete]]’s potential, his/her performance in tests or [[competition]], and calendar of competition. It has to be simple, suggestive, and above all flexible as its content can be modified to meet the athletes rate of progress.

===The macrocycle===
A [[macrocycle]] is an annual plan that works towards peaking for the goal competition of the year. There are three phases in the macrocycle: preparation, competitive, and transition.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization&gt;{{cite web|title=Periodisation in fencing|url=http://zfw-fencing.co.uk/articles/periodisation-fencing|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire preparation phase should be around 2/3 to 3/4 of the macrocycle. The preparation phase is further broken up into general and specific preparation of which general preparation takes over half. An example of general preparation would be building an [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic base]] for an [[Endurance sports|endurance athlete]] such as running on a [[treadmill]] and learning any rules or regulations that would be required such as proper [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] stroke as not to be disqualified. An example of specific preparation would be to work on the proper form to be more efficient and to work more on the final format of the sport, which is to move from the treadmill to the [[Road surface|pavement]].

The competitive phase can be several competitions, but they lead up to the main competition with specific tests. Testing might include any of the following: performance level, new shoes or gear, a new race tactic might be employed, pre-race meals, ways to reduce [[anxiety]] before a race, or the length needed for the taper. When the pre-competitions are of a higher priority there is a definite taper stage while lower priority might simply be integrated in as training. The competitive phase ends with the taper and the competition.

The transition phase is important for [[Psychology|psychological]] reasons, a year of training means a vacation is in order. A typical [[wikt:weekend warrior|weekend warrior]] might take three months while a professional athlete might take as little as two weeks.

===The mesocycle===
A mesocycle represents a phase of training with a duration of between 2 – 6 weeks or microcycles, but this can depend on the sporting discipline.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization/&gt; A mesocycle can also be defined as a number of continuous weeks where the training program emphasize the same type of physical adaptations, for example muscle mass and anaerobic capacity. During the preparatory phase, a mesocycle commonly consists of 4 – 6 micro-cycles, while during the competitive phase it will usually consist of 2 – 4 micro-cycles depending on the competition’s [[calendar]].

The goal of the plan is to fit the mesocycles into the overall plan timeline-wise to make each mesocycle end on one of the phases and then to determine the [[workload]] and type of work of each cycle based on where in the overall plan the given mesocycle falls. The goal in mind is to make sure the body peaks for the high priority competitions by improving each cycle along the way.

===The microcycle===
A microcycle is typically a week because of the difficulty in developing a training plan that does not align itself with the weekly calendar. Each microcycle is planned based on where it is in the overall macrocycle.&lt;ref name=zfw-periodization/&gt;

A micro-cycle is also defined as a number of training sessions, built around a given combination of acute program variables, which include progression as well as alternating effort (heavy vs. light days). The length of the micro-cycle should correspond to the number of workouts - empirically often 4-16 workouts - it takes for the athlete or fitness client to adapt to the training program. When the athlete or fitness client has adapted to the program and no longer makes progress, a change to one or more program variables should be made.

==The annual plan==
The annual plan is important in that it directs and guides performance training over a year. It is based on the concept of [[periodization]] and the principles of training. The objective of training is to reach a high level of performance (peak performance) and an athlete has to develop skills, biomotor abilities and psychological traits in a methodical manner.

===Preparatory phase===
This phase consists of the general preparation and specific preparation. Usually which can be subdivided into three different phases. One should always remember that this is a base creation phase with the objective to attain the previous training state, and the longest period of periodization must be devoted towards the preparatory period.
The performance depends on preparatory period, and is divided into '''three''' phases:

'''Phase  I)''' To regain previous training 
*Low volume, but maintaining high intensity is there.
*competitions.

'''Phase II)''' Low training volume &amp; High training load to develop the factors needed for performance.
*works on specific exercise. 
'''Phase III)''' Decrease in the intensity of load and increase in tactical training and aim at improving tactical under competition condition.
{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Competitive phase===
This phase may contain a few main competitions each containing a pre-competitive and a main competition. Within the main competition, an uploading phase and a special preparatory phase may be included. This also includes hypertropthy

===Transition phase===
This phase is used to facilitate psychological rest, relaxation and biological regeneration as well as to maintain an acceptable level of general physical preparation. This phase lasts 3–4 weeks (perhaps longer) but should not exceed five weeks under normal conditions and may be sports specific. It allows the body to fully regenerate so that it is prepared for the next discipline.
*there is no competition in this phase.

===Opposition to Periodization===
A review published in the journal 'sports medicine' in 2017 has questioned the validity of the use of traditional models of periodization in sport. This is largely due to the over simplified assumptions put forward in the early development of periodization theory that are not always transferable to the psyco-biological effects of various training methods used in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0823-y| pmid=29189930| pmc=5856877|title = Periodization Theory: Confronting an Inconvenient Truth| journal=Sports Medicine| volume=48| issue=4| pages=753–764|year = 2018|last1 = Kiely|first1 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactical Periodization ==

For many years, football training and its planning has been (and still is) characterised by fragmented thinking of which has perhaps been attributed to the success of such an approach in individual sports. The emphasis of planning and improvement was mainly in regards to the physical attributes of strength, speed and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalhal, C. (2014). ‘Soccer: Developing A Know-how’,  Prime Books&lt;/ref&gt; Furtheremore, whether it be the undulating model, the reverse linear model or the traditional periodization framework, one of the underpinning assumptions is that it would be best to segregate the programme into distinct training blocks in a sequential hierarchy i.e. a training block to build endurance before speed and strength before power. This is claimed to be based on the ‘science of periodization’. However, Kiely,&lt;ref&gt;Kiely, J. (2010). ‘Periodization, planning, prediction: And why the future ain’t what it used to be!’, UKA, 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the proof on which this is all based on is flawed because the studies used to build this proof have only ‘compared training interventions with no training variation to those with degrees of variation’  but did not offer any insight ‘into how that variation is best scheduled and organised’ (Kiely, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;4). So although it is commonly agreed that training variation is an important design feature which needs to be integrated into the training plan, there is ‘little or no supporting evidence’ which proves that the segregation of the program into distinct training blocks or that there should be sequential hierarchy of how this should be done is in fact advantageous.

Many authors such as Garganta, Maia, &amp; Marque,&lt;ref&gt;Garganta, J., Maia, J. &amp; Marques, A. (1996). ‘Acerca da investigação dos factores de rendimento em futebol’, Revista paulista de educação física, São Paulo, 10, (2), 146-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Oliviera,&lt;ref&gt;Oliveira, G.J. (1991). ‘Especificidade, o pós-futebol do pré-futebol. Um factor condicionante do alto rendimento desportivo. In Oliveira, R. (2014) ‘Tactical periodization: The secrets of soccer most effective training methodology’.&lt;/ref&gt; Castelo,&lt;ref&gt;Castelo, J. (2000). ‘Formação continua. O treinador de futebol. Exercícios de treino no futebol’, Escola superior de desporto de Rio Maior. IPS.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gaiteiro &lt;ref&gt;Gaiteiro, B. (2006). ‘A cienca oculta do sucesso! Mourinho aos olhos da cienca’. In Tamarit, X. (2014). ‘What is tactical periodization?’ Bennion Kearny Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued in regards to the indivisibility of the 4 components which make up a football performance...technical, tactical, physical and mental. This complexity makes football a multidimensional phenomenon which cannot be simply reduced to the sum of its parts. Is defending more important than attacking or vice versa? This question cannot be answered as football needs to be understood as a whole. As highlighted by Tamarit,&lt;ref&gt;Tamarit, X. (2014). ‘What is tactical periodization?’  Bennion Kearny Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; football is a tactical game where players are constantly required to make decisions in response to specific situations. So football needs to be viewed as a tactical game which encompasses with it the physical, technical and mental aspects required for positive performances.  This is the foundation upon which Victor Frade developed a training methodology known as tactical periodisation which emphasises the development of the tactical dimension. Therefore, any physical, technical or mental development must always have a tactical intention. In other words, although the ability to run for 90 minutes may seem vital to play the game, knowing when, where and how to run is much more important.

'''Street workout''' is a physical activity performed mostly in outdoor parks or public facilities. It originated in Ancient Greece, but became a popular movement in Russia, Eastern Europe, and the [[United States]], especially in [[New York City]], Baltimore's urban neighborhoods and Myanmar.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  It has now spread all over the world. It is a combination of [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[calisthenics]], and [[sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CALISTHENICS - Street Workout Academy|url = http://streetworkoutacademy.com/calisthenics/#|website = Street Workout Academy|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}} Street workout is a modern name for bodyweight workouts in outdoor parks. Street workout teams and organized competitions exist.

== Overview ==
A typical street workout routine often consists of [[physical exercises]] such as pull-ups, chin-ups, push-ups, dips, muscle-ups, sit-ups and squats. Street workout also involves some static (isometric) holds such as the human flag, front lever, back lever and planche.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Isometric exercises - Street Workouts|url = https://www.street-workouts.com/tag/isometric-exercises/|website = Street Workouts|access-date = 2016-01-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}}

Street workout is divided in two main branches, the first one being strength training and the second dynamics. Strength training includes the isometric holds like: planche, front lever, back lever, etc. Also, strength training includes single arm pull ups, hefestos, muscle-ups and many others. Dynamics includes movements like 360s and its variations, switchblades, and an incredible variety of tricks developed by the athletes which are connected with other moves in order to create routines or sets.

Some of the main benefits of street workout activities are: 
* It is completely free;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = On Street Workout|url = http://pccblog.dragondoor.com/on-street-workout/|website = PCC Blog|access-date = 2016-01-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Which is better – street workout or gym?|url = https://madbarz.com/newspost/63-which-is-better---street-workout-or-gym|website = Madbarz|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}}

* It promotes healthy living, and a desirable physique can be attained with it;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Effect of Calisthenics Exercises at Various Intensity on Girl Students' Figure and Cardiorespiratory Functions--《Journal of Guangzhou Physical Education Institute》2003年06期|url = http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-GZTX200306018.htm|website = en.cnki.com.cn|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is a social event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the beginning of the 21st century, [[bodyweight exercise|classic exercises]] were modified and combined with elements from other sports. The starting point of the whole was New York. Through the sports parks there, people could do their workout without fitness studios. Sport or workout parks consist mostly of different pull-up bars, bars and hammocks, so that training is mainly with one's own body weight.

Different groups developed their own style by combining classical calisthenics with exercises from gymnastics, break dance, hip hop and freerunning, or to develop new movements themselves. These groups presented videos of the novel form of calisthenics on the internet and thus triggered a regular boom, especially in Eastern Europe.

In 2011 the first World Championship for Calisthenics / Street Workout in Riga was held. The WSWCF is the World Street Workout and Calisthenics Federation. Since then, a world championship has been held every year.

Among the best-known representatives of the modern calisthenics are the groups Barentaz, Baristi, Barstarzz, Bar-Barians and Street Workout Ukraine, and individuals such as Hannibal for King and Frank Medrano.

==Basics of street workout==
A typical street workout routine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.street-workouts.com/street-workout-programs/|title = Street Workout Programs|date = |access-date = 2016-01-16|website = Street Workouts|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of:
* [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] exercising – a system of exercises with various levels of exertion provided for health strengthening, development of strength and stamina, as well as for shaping an athletic constitution. Athletics exercising is used to increase strength level, develop physical shape and for rehabilitation.
* [[Isometric exercise]]s – a type of strength training whereby you hold a static position.
* [[Calisthenics]] (Kalestenos) – is a complex of many simple exercises which are performed using purely body weight. The aim of these exercises is to train muscular strength and to evolve comprehensive fitness.
* [[Calisthenics|Urban calisthenics]] – a form of body weight exercise performed with no or little apparatus. Individuals and/or groups train and exercise in urban areas and spaces. Advanced urban calisthenics skills include muscle ups, typewriter pull-ups and both front and back levers.
Street workouts are usually performed outdoor or in specifically designed street workout parks. A typical street workout park looks like a playground with a soft underground and consists of several bars, poles and other objects used for body weight exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://imgarcade.com/1/street-workout-park/|title = IMG Arcade - Street Workout Parks|date = |access-date = 2015-01-15|website = IMG Arcade|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Street workout Slovenija 3.JPG|thumb|Street workout in [[Slovenia]]]]
In street workout, people often create teams.

[[Image:sweatpants.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Three young men wearing [[grey]] sweatpants]]
'''Sweatpants''' are a [[casual attire|casual]] variety of soft [[trousers]] intended for [[comfort]] or [[sportswear (activewear)|athletic]] purposes, although they are now worn in many different situations. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]] they are known as '''[[tracksuit]] bottoms''' or '''joggers'''. In Australia, they are also commonly known as ''' trackpants''', '''trackies''' or '''tracky daks'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In her tracky daks, a Hollywood star turns invisible|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/10/24/1035416934724.html|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=25 October 2002|author=Lisa Pryor|language=|quote=Naomi Watts: 'I look like a completely different person when I just wake up and get my tracky daks on'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first pair of sweatpants was introduced in the 1920s by [[Émile Camuset]], the founder of [[Le Coq Sportif]]. The sweatpants were simple knitted gray [[Jersey (fabric)|jersey]] pants that allowed athletes to stretch and run comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tonia |last=Kimbrough |url=http://www.asicentral.com/news/magazines/wearables/novdec-2014/sweatpants-the-comfortable-choice/ |title= Sweatpants History: The Comfortable Choice |publisher=The Advertising Specialty Institute (ASI) |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
Sweatpants are usually made from [[cotton]] or [[polyester]], often of a heavy knit. They often have elastic in the [[waistband]], drawstrings, and may or may not have pockets. Some sweatpants can also feature elasticized cuffs at the [[hem]] of the leg. Sweatpants are traditionally [[ash gray]] in color but are now available in most colors. Traditionally quite "baggy" and loose, sweatpants are now also available in more form-fitting shapes; moreover they have flexibility and comfort. In addition, this design traps less heat than most conventional, lightweight trousers, which may be a disadvantage in some conditions such as cold [[temperature]]s and an advantage in others such as [[Thermoregulation|body heat]]–increasing [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] activities. Warmer varieties can be made from [[polar fleece]].

==Culture==
Once these practical pants were only worn for sporting events and at home. Now, they are available in many fashionable styles and are worn in a variety of public situations. Because of their comfort and fashion, they have become a popular choice of clothing. The sweatpant may come from many different materials and in many forms including thick and thin. The sweatpant is sometimes associated with certain lifestyles such as gym culture or hip-hop culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw.com/en/germany-stuttgart-cafe-bans-sweatpants/a-41504760&lt;/ref&gt; This niche-specific perception of the sweatpant since the 1980s has at times resulted in extensive dress code regulations with some outlets outright banning the wearing of sweatpants on their premises; including some German cafes and a substantial amount of nightclubs worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;McLennan-Dillabough, Sarah. "Mediating Access: The Utilization of Status Evaluation Processes in the Work of Bouncing." The Arbutus Review 4.1 (2013): 45-62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
[[File:Woman fitness training.JPEG|thumb|upright|Woman wearing tearaway pants]]
There are many variations on the sweatpant design that have evolved to define their own categories of athletic pants.  These variations include '''fashion pants''', '''windpants''', '''tearaway pants''', and '''muscle pants'''.

=== Fashion pants ===
'''Fashion pants''' typically refers to [[fashion]] conscious [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]]. These pants are often made from a variety of materials, like [[velvet]] or [[satin]], and in many color combinations or patterns. One distinguishing characteristic is that fashion pants generally lack the elastic band at the ankles.

=== Windpants ===
Windpants are similar to sweatpants but are lighter and shield the wearer from cold [[wind]] rather than insulate.  Windpants are typically made of polyester or [[nylon]], with a liner made of cotton or polyester. The nylon material's natural friction against both itself and human legs makes "swooshing" sounds during walking. Windpants often have zippers on each ankle, letting athletes unzip the end of each leg, allowing the pants to be pulled over their footwear.

==={{visible anchor|Tearaway pants}}===
'''Tearaway pants''', also known as ''breakaway pants'', ''rip-off pants'', or ''popper pants'' are closely related to windpants.  Tearaway pants are windpants with [[snap fastener]]s running the length of  both legs. The snaps allow athletes to remove their tearaway pants in a timely manner to compete in some sports.  [[Basketball]] and [[track and field]] are the two sports most commonly associated with tearaway pants.

'''Swing timing''' is concerned with the inter-relationships between [[Ball game|ball sports]] hitting implements and the related anatomical parts of players, in the [[motor skill]] of striking sports balls as used in various games.

More specifically, swing timing commonly refers to the efficiency of ball hitting or kicking skills by achieving optimum power at instant of ball impact. Furthermore, swing timing also refers to the inter-relationship between optimum power as generated and the intended point of ball contact.

Perfect swing timing is therefore achieved when ball is struck with optimum power, with least energy expenditure, and at contact point that achieves the desired direction and velocity of ball after impact.

Of all the motor skill components essential for expert ball play, swing timing is the most difficult to acquire, and teach, because of the essential millisecond co-ordination of major and minor muscle groups to impart optimal progressive acceleration to the hitting implement until it has reached greatest velocity and optimum angle at moment of ball impact.

Arguably the best ball players have superior swing timing to achieve greatest ball impact velocities for greatest speed and/or distance, and a highly tuned [[muscle memory]], or ‘feel’, to more consistently repeat or adjust swing as determined by the changing success requirements which vary from one ‘shot’ to another, and the ability to fine-tune swing velocity and impact point and angle.

The answer still eluding even top teaching professionals; be it in golf, tennis, baseball, racketball, squash, cricket and even ball-kicking sports including European, American and [[Australian rules football|Australian football]], and rugby; is how to more effectively teach correct swing timing, the essence of the ‘perfect swing technique’.

Some common and fairly accurate perceptions of correct Swing Timing include a relaxed posture and muscle groups, which are only called into action in precisely timed intervals, and which relax instantly after ball contact is made; and an apparent ‘80% Only’ effort, which appears to promote the desired relaxed state during the whole swing.

But the inability to more accurately observe these split-second, highly complex correlations and co-ordination; therefore, more often than not, encourages the teaching of specific and isolated swing components only, which tends to disrupt ‘natural’ swing mechanics and timing rather than enhancing these.

For this reason, correct swing timing, still remains confined to [[trial and error]] techniques, where the naturally gifted player eliminates errors more quickly, and acquires accurate muscle memory faster.

As visual feedback of actual swing remains elusive, an increasingly popular technique is to focus on correct swing rhythm, which can be more easily internalized, thereby accelerating essential muscle memory. Therefore one of the most effective teaching and practice tools is music, where the rhythm of music and ‘perfect swing’ are identical for a given player. In this method there is a more identifiable correlation of actual swing versus ideal by the degree of synchronization achieved.

Other audio and tactile swing timing feedback devices have already been developed. These devices have proven to be highly effective in teaching ‘near perfect swing timing’ even to youngsters in a natural play learning experience.

==Swing timing versus swing rhythm==
In the existing related literature, these two terms are freely interchanged. Yet it appears that failure to recognize the key difference is another reason for the difficulty in their understanding, and thereby the difficulty in achieving correct swing mechanics, timing and rhythm.

Whereas swing timing is pertinent to the sequence of vital swing components coming into effect for optimum ball contact, Swing rhythm is the tempo of the complete swing, which traditionally includes the backswing, and a vital pause between backswing and final swing towards ball impact.

In swing timing the emphasis is therefore on the correct sequence of the various elements of the total swing. Whereas in swing rhythm the focus is on the tempo, and relative 'weight' of each component within that tempo of the ideal personal swing.

Focus on swing rhythm, either in teaching or personal practice, is considered preferable. Correct swing rhythm results in faster 'feel' of correct timing mechanics, and reduces interference with that vital process by eliminating risk of undue emphasis on individual components of the total swing. To achieve perfect swing timing in this approach, it only remains to fine-tune this rhythm to ensure that the 'down beat' coincides perfectly with ball impact.

==Progressive segmental acceleration==
It is more important to understand this rhythm aspect of swing timing, then to focus on its individual components. And regardless of which sports specific skill, this concept remains constant. First, movement occurs in the most distal of the total swing lever system and progressively moves to each component one increment closer to the final impact point. And this movement sequence is common for tennis, golf, baseball and similar hitting skills. First the knees, which initiate rotation and forward movement of hips, which in turn initiate upper trunk and shoulder rotation, before progressively bringing upper and lower arms into play, followed by wrist and fingers which impart the final control and speed to the club, racket or stick. For ultimate success it is equally important that perfect swing timing occurs in the correct Swing Plane as determined by anticipated ball contact point, intended direction of ball flight, and the desired spin effect to be imparted to ball.

[[Mathematical model]]s can easily demonstrated the effect on racket or clubhead velocity, for each swing component which is subject to exponential acceleration caused by the cumulative effect of all prior components in the total acceleration chain. In simple terminology and concept, this complex action and its effect is comparable to cracking a whip. It is therefore self-evident that if any one component is out of ideal swing synchronization, the resultant detrimental impact will be a similarly [[Exponential growth|exponential increase]] in loss of power and direction at ball impact.

While this is an appropriate model for better understanding of the biomechanics and kinesiology involved in perfect swing timing; it is not an ideal basis for teaching same. It is simply too complex for anyone to consciously synchronize all the component in this chain, especially in only the fraction of a second available to complete this final swing sequence; or indeed observe it or feel each individual component coming into play sequentially.  Thus tempo and rhythm, still remain as the key variables in the achievement of correct swing timing.

Therefore any theory of correct swing timing, in practice and teaching, must rely on correct swing rhythm emphasis, including learning, teaching and practice devices that provide instant feedback of correct swing rhythm for every swing.

==Controversy==
The importance of the pause of the hitting implement at the end of the backswing, that is, ''before'' the actual swing aimed at perfect swing timing is commenced; is generally agreed upon, regardless of sport. This Pause is the moment of final deliberation as to when to commence a hitchless and optimum swing. Many swing timing problems can thus be traced back to miscalculations during this critical split-second pause. The continuing 'traditional' emphasis on correct backswing check points, arcs and planes, therefore appears to be seriously misplaced,  and simply adds to the overall complexity of Swing Timing.

It would therefore also appear that only two things are important in any backswing instructions, First, that the racket or clubhead pauses in the correct place on the desired swing arc and plane as determined by the intended 'shot', and secondly, that the racket or club face has assumed the optimal angle relative to swing arc and plane, so as to require minimal further adjustment in the Final Swing Sequence, and thereby eliminating another adjustment variable and potential cause of error.

The achievement of correct swing timing therefore remains over-complicated by breaking down a swing that needs to be continuous and rhythmic, into its sub-components. Instead it can and should be 'discovered' much more easily through an emphasis on correct swing rhythm in ways already described.

'''Transponder timing''' (also called '''chip timing''' or '''RFID timing''') is a technique for measuring performance in [[sport]] events. A [[transponder]] working on a [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) basis is attached to the athlete and emits a unique code that is detected by [[radio receiver]]s located at the strategic points in an event.

Prior to the use of this technology, races were either timed by hand (with operators pressing a [[stopwatch]]) or using video camera systems.

== Transponder systems ==

Generically, there are two types of transponder timing systems; active and passive. An active transponder consists of a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered [[transceiver]], connected to the athlete, that emits its unique code when it is interrogated.

A passive transponder does not contain a power source inside the transponder. Instead, the transponder captures electromagnetic energy produced by a nearby [[transmitter|exciter]] and utilizes that energy to emit a unique code.

In both systems, an antenna is placed at the start, finish, and in some cases, intermediate time points and is connected to a decoder. This decoder identifies the unique transponder code and calculates the exact time when the transponder passes a timing point.  Some implementations of timing systems require the use of a mat on the ground at the timing points while other systems implement the timing points with vertically oriented portals.

== History ==
[[RFID]] was first used in the late 1980s primarily for motor racing and became more widely adopted in athletic events in the mid-1990s upon the release of low cost 134&amp;nbsp;kHz transponders and readers from [[Texas Instruments]]. This technology formed the basis of electronic sports timing for the world's largest running events as well as for cycling, triathlon and skiing. Some manufacturers made improvements to the technology to handle larger numbers of transponders in the read field or improve the tolerance of their systems to low-frequency noise. These low-frequency systems are still used a lot today. Other manufacturers developed their own proprietary RFID systems usually as an offshoot to more industrial applications. These latter systems attempted to get around the problem of reading large numbers of transponders in a read field by using the High Frequency 13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz RFID methodology that allowed transponders to use anti-collision algorithms to avoid tags interfering with each other's signal during the down-link between transponder and reader. Active transponder systems continued to mature and despite their much higher cost they retained market share in the high speed sports like motor racing, cycling and ice skating. Active systems are also used at high-profile events such as the Olympics due to their very high read rates and time-stamping precision.

By 2005 a newer RFID technology was becoming available, mostly for industrial applications. The first and second generation (UHF) transponders and readers that were being developed followed a strict protocol to ensure that multiple transponders and readers could be used between manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gs1.org/gsmp/kc/epcglobal/uhfc1g2 Class 1 Generation 2 UHF Air Interface Protocol Standard "Gen 2"]&lt;/ref&gt; Much like the HF tags, the UHF tags were much cheaper to produce in volume and formed the basis in the next revolution in sports timing. Currently, many of the largest athletic events are timed using disposable transponders either placed on the back of a race number or on the runner's shoe. The low cost meant that transponders were now fully disposable and did not need to be returned to the organizers after the event.

== Usage ==

Very large running events (more than 10,000) and triathlons were the first events to be transponder (or chip) timed because it is near impossible to manually time them. Also for large runs there are delays in participants reaching the start line, which penalize their performance.  Some races place antennas or timing mats at both the start line and the finish line, which allow the exact net time to be calculated.  Awards in a race are generally based on the "gun time" (which ignores any delay at the start) as per IAAF and USA Track and Field rules. However, some races use "net time" for presenting age group awards.

In the past the transponder was almost always worn on the athletes running shoe, or on an ankle band. This enabled the transponder to be read best on antenna mats because the distance between the transponder and readers antenna is minimized offering the best capture rate. Transponders may be threaded onto the shoe laces for running. For triathlon a soft elastic ankle band holds the transponder to the leg and care is taken to ensure the transponder is in the correct orientation or polarity for maximum read performance. Transponders have also been placed on the race bib. In the past 5 years{{when|date=April 2015}} the newer UHF systems use transponders placed on the shoe lace, or stuck to the race number bib. In both cases, care must be taken to ensure the UHF tag does not directly touch a large part of the skin as this affects read performance. Despite this, UHF Systems have read performances as good (if not better) than the conventional low and high frequency systems. Because these UHF tags are made in huge volumes for industrial applications, their price is much lower than that of conventional re-usable transponders and the race does not bother to collect them afterwards.

[[File:Back side of disposable RFID tag used for race timing.png|thumb|right|alt=Back side of disposable RFID tag used for race timing showing components.|Back side of disposable RFID tag used for race timing]]

All RFID timing systems incorporate a box housing the reader(s) with peripherals like a microprocessor, serial or ethernet communications and power source (battery). The readers are attached to one or more antennas that are designed for the particular operating frequency. In the case of low or medium frequencies these consist of wire loops incorporated into mats that cover the entire width of the timing point. For UHF systems the antennas consist of patch antennas that are protected in a matting system. The patch antennas may also be placed on stands or a finish gantry pointing towards the oncoming athlete. In most cases the distance between reader and antennas is restricted. Also more equipment is needed for events that require multiple timing points. Wider timing points require more readers and antennas. For active systems a simple wire loop is all that is needed since the transponder has its own power source and the loop serves as a trigger to turn on the transponder, then receive the relatively strong signal from the transponder. Therefore, active systems need less readers (or decoders) per timing point width.

All systems utilize specialized software to calculate results and splits.&lt;ref name='Easytime'&gt;Fister, I. Jr., Fister, I., Mernik, M., Brest, J. Design and implementation of domain-specific language Easytime. Computer Languages, Systems &amp; Structures, 37(4), 151-167, 2011.{{doi|10.1016/j.cl.2011.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This software usually resides on a separate PC computer that is connected to the readers via serial or ethernet communications. The software relates the raw transponder code and timestamp data to each entrant in a database and calculates gun and net times of runners, or the splits of a triathlete.&lt;ref name='Easytime1'&gt;Fister, I.

In [[baseball]], the '''uniform number''' is a number worn on the uniform of each player and coach. Numbers are used for the purpose of easily identifying each person on the field as no two people from the same team can wear the same number. Although designed for identification purposes only, numbers have become the source of superstition, emotional attachment, and honor (in the form of a number retirement). The number is always on the back of the jersey, often on the front, and occasionally seen on the left leg of the pants.

==History==
[[File:José Méndez 1909.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[José Méndez]] of the [[Cuban Stars (West)|Cuban Stars]], seen with a uniform number on his left sleeve (1909).]]
Rumor has it that the uniform number first appeared in the 19th century, but the earliest official record is from 1907, when the [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading Red Roses]] of the [[Atlantic League (1896–1900)|Atlantic League]] numbered its players' jerseys in an effort to help the fans identify them. While it is unknown if the team ever took the field with numbers, it did mark the beginning of the idea of uniform numbers.&lt;ref name=numbers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/numbers.htm |title=National Baseball Hall of Fame – Dressed to the Nines – Parts of the Uniform |publisher=Exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniform number appeared on the jerseys of the [[Cuban Stars (West)|Cuban Stars]], a traveling team of the early 1900s, in 1909. In an issue of the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', star pitcher [[José Méndez]] is seen wearing the number 12 on his left sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/timeline_1909b.htm |title=National Baseball Hall of Fame – Dressed to the Nines – Timeline |publisher=Exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time a Major League team wore numbers was on June 26, 1916. Inspired by football's and hockey's use of numbers, the [[Cleveland Indians]] trotted on their [[League Park|home field]] wearing large numbers on their left sleeves. This "experiment" was tried for a few weeks, again the next season, and then abandoned.&lt;ref name="numbers"/&gt;  In 1923, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] adopted uniform numbers on their sleeves. However, as then-manager [[Branch Rickey]] recalled, the Cardinals' players were "subjected to field criticism from the stands and especially from opposing players,"&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt; so the numbers were removed. At this time, the Indianapolis ABC's of the Negro National League and the San Antonio Bears of the Texas League also tried out numbers.

[[File:Jrobinson.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Jackie Robinson of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] wearing a uniform with a number on the front.]]
In 1929, the [[New York Yankees]] were planning to start the season with uniform numbers on the back of the jersey. The Indians also planned to wear numbers in this fashion. The Yankees were rained out on opening day, April 16, while the Indians played, making Cleveland the first MLB franchise to wear numbers on the back. The Yankees debuted their numbered jerseys two days after, April 18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/1005/uni-watch-who-needs-uniform-numbers Uni Watch: Who needs uniform numbers?]&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s, all MLB teams wore numbers; in 1937 the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] finally began wearing numbers on both home and away jerseys, making numbers a universal trait in the MLB. The first MLB game to feature both teams wearing numbers on their jerseys was the game between the Indians and the Yankees on May 13, 1929.

===Numbers on other spots of the uniform===
In 1951, the [[Springfield Cubs]] of the [[International League]] pioneered the look of having numbers on the front of the jersey. A year later, the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] incorporated the idea into MLB.  They had intended numbers-on-front to be first used in their 1951 World Series appearance, an event which did not occur because of Bobby Thomson's [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|walk-off home run]] in the last game of the [[1951 National League tie-breaker series|tiebreaker series]] between the [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] and the [[1951 New York Giants (MLB) season|Giants]]. Today, numbers on the front are very common at all levels of play. In 1940, the [[Memphis Red Sox]] of the [[Negro American League]] wore numbers on their pants leg; the idea didn't catch on in MLB until the 1975-78 [[Houston Astros|Astros]] wore numbers on their front left hip.

Today, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] are the only Major League team to wear a number on the sleeve of their jerseys.

==Rules about numbers==
The official rules of baseball state that uniforms must be identical for all members of a team. The only mention of uniform number is that it must be on the back and a minimum of six inches tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule1.shtml |title=Baseball Rules: 1.00 Objectives of the Game |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date=1958-06-01 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each player must have their own unique number, but there is no rule requiring coaches to have unique numbers. For example, in 2015, [[Alan Trammell]] (who wore number 3 for his lengthy career as a [[Detroit Tigers]] player and manager) returned to coach first base and wore 3 again, despite the number belonging to [[Ian Kinsler]] at the time, marking a rare instance of a coach sharing a number with a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freep.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2015/08/22/alan-trammell-detroit-tigers/32209287/ |title=Tigers' Alan Trammell back to No. 3 while coaching first |first=Anthony |last=Fenech |date=August 22, 2015 |work=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deviations from the rules===
In their first career games, [[Cincinnati Reds]] outfielder [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] and [[Chicago White Sox]] pitcher [[Joe Horlen]] did not have jersey numbers. Both of these players were just called up to the big league team while it was on the road and the only uniform available had no number.

On September 27, 1999, [[Detroit Tigers]] center fielder [[Gabe Kapler]] took the field donning a numberless uniform. That day, the Tigers played their last game at historic [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] and, in honor of great Tigers of the past, members of the starting lineup wore the uniform numbers of corresponding members of an All-Time Detroit Tigers team voted on by the fans. Since Kapler played center field, he was to wear [[Ty Cobb]]'s uniform number, but since Cobb played before numbers were used, Kapler's back was blank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-fever.com/archive/index.php/t-68985.html |title=No Number [Archive] |publisher=Baseball Fever |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 100th anniversary of [[Fenway Park]] on April 20, 2012, the [[Boston Red Sox]] and New York Yankees wore 1912-style uniforms which had no numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=320420102 |title=Yankees spoil Red Sox's 100-year celebration of Fenway Park |work=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Jackie Robinson Day]], teams across the MLB all wear uniform number 42 to honor him.&lt;ref name="jr-day"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/172342410/mlb-announces-jackie-robinson-day-details |title=MLB announces Jackie Robinson Day details |date=April 14, 2016 |publisher=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [See "Retired numbers," below.] The MLB has taken this tribute so far that, on that day only, all 30 team websites' active rosters say that every player on the team is number 42.

==Number assignments==
The original baseball numbers were based on the lineup. The starting players would be numbered 1-8, based on their spot in the order. The backup catcher would be number 9, and the pitchers would wear 10-14 (but not 13, as that is superstitious).&lt;ref name=jerseys&gt;[http://answers.yourdictionary.com/sports/why-do-baseball-players-wear-numbers-on-their-jerseys.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209110607/http://answers.yourdictionary.com/sports/why-do-baseball-players-wear-numbers-on-their-jerseys.html |date=December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of this system are teammates [[Babe Ruth]] (he was number 3 and batted third for the Yankees) and [[Lou Gehrig]] (number 4, batted fourth).

===Experiments with numbers by position===
Several teams experimented with numbering-by-position during the 1930s. In {{baseball year|1939}}, the [[Cincinnati Reds]], under [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Warren Giles]], introduced what would be the [[1939 Cincinnati Reds season#Roster|longest-lasting convention]], in which pitchers wore numbers between 30 and 49; outfielders between 20 and 29; infielders between 10 and 19; and catchers, coaches and managers in the single digits.  (An exception occurred in the early 1950s, when the Reds' coaches and managers were assigned numbers in the fifties.)&lt;ref name="fhb"&gt;[http://www.uni-watch.com/2011/01/04/numbers-game/ UniWatch.com 2011.01.04]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] adopted this system in [[1947 New York Giants (MLB) season#Roster|1947]], and when Giles became chief executive of the [[National League]] in 1952, many other NL clubs began to follow suit.  Two [[American League]] teams, the [[1961 Los Angeles Angels season#Roster|first edition]] of the [[expansion team|expansion]] [[Los Angeles Angels]] and the [[Cleveland Indians]] beginning in [[1963 Cleveland Indians season#Roster|1963]], also adopted the numbering scheme.&lt;ref name="fhb"/&gt;

In his {{baseball year|1969}} memoir, ''[[Ball Four]]'', pitcher [[Jim Bouton]] tells how he asked his new NL team, the [[Houston Astros]], for his traditional number 56, but was assigned [[1969 Houston Astros season#Roster|44]] instead because of the numbering custom. Bouton wrote: "I asked if there was any chance I could get 56. [The equipment manager] said he didn't think so, that all our pitchers have numbers in the 30s and 40s.  He said I'd have to talk to [general manager Spec] [[Spec Richardson|Richardson]] or manager [[Harry Walker]] if I wanted to change the rule. I said I was sure they wouldn't want to be bothered with something so small, and he said, 'Oh, you'd be surprised.'  Oh no I wouldn't."&lt;ref&gt;Bouton, Jim, ''Ball Four.'' New York and Cleveland, The World Publishing Company, 1970, page 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the number-by-position convention was never a formal rule, and a few National League clubs — notably the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] — resisted the idea. The custom was slowly abandoned during the 1970s and 1980s.  (In fact, in [[1970 Houston Astros season#Roster|1970]], the Astros assigned Bouton his traditional number 56.)

===Contemporary numbering conventions===
Today teams do not assign numbers based on any system; personal preference combined with retired numbers has made it impossible. However, a few trends do present themselves quite clearly:&lt;ref name=jerseys/&gt; Infielders, especially shortstops and second basemen, tend to be the players who would wear single digit numbers.  Single digit numbers, however, are not rare for outfielders or catchers.
* Numbers 1-14 are usually only worn by position players, while numbers 50 and above are more likely to be worn by pitchers. Numbers 60 and above are rarely worn in the regular season.  During [[spring training]], such high numbers are often given to players who are unlikely to make the regular-season team.  It is generally thought that the higher the number, the less chance of making the team. [[Houston Astros]] pitcher [[Dallas Keuchel]] is the only pitcher in the organization to wear 60
* The number 44 has been worn by many "power hitters" since [[Hank Aaron]]'s career as home run king (Aaron was number 44). Other notable examples include [[Willie McCovey]], [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Adam Dunn]], [[Anthony Rizzo]], and [[Paul Goldschmidt]].
* Number 49 is traditionally sought out by [[knuckleball]] throwing pitchers:&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGrath|first=Ben|title=Project Knuckleball|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 17, 2004|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact1?currentPage=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; notable examples include [[Hoyt Wilhelm]], [[Charlie Hough]], [[Tim Wakefield]], and [[Tom Candiotti]].
* In [[Nippon Professional Baseball]], the Japanese big leagues, the number 18 is often reserved for the ace pitcher.&lt;ref&gt;GRACZYK, WAYNE. [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2015/02/28/baseball/flood-retired-numbers-can-lessen-significance/#.V79Jl2W8F7Q "Flood of retired numbers can lessen significance,"] ''Japan Times'' (Feb. 28, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving in the MLB, Japanese "import" pitchers have sought the number again (notably [[Hiroki Kuroda]], [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]], and [[Hisashi Iwakuma]]).
* Numbers 0 and 00 — [[Junior Ortiz]] wore #0 for five years of his thirteen-year career because his last name starts with "O".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/ortizju01.shtml |title=Junior Ortiz Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Oliver]] wore #0 for the last 8 years of his career for the same reason,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/oliveal01.shtml |title=Al Oliver Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1985, Oliver's teammate [[Cliff Johnson (baseball)|Cliff Johnson]] wore #00 at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/johnscl01.shtml |title=Cliff Johnson Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outfielder [[Oddibe McDowell]] also wore #0 because of his first name while with the 1980s [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mcdowod01.shtml |title=Oddibe McDowell Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, [[Jack Clark (baseball)|Jack Clark]] of the [[San Diego Padres]] and [[Jeffrey Leonard]] of the [[San Francisco Giants]] both wore #00. Outfielder Terry McDaniel wore #0 during a brief stint with the [[New York Mets]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimatemets.com/profile.php?PlayerCode=0446 |title=Ultimate Mets Database – Terry McDaniel |publisher=ultimatemets.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1990s, [[Omar Olivares]] wore #00 with the Cardinals and Phillies to represent his initials of O.O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/olivaom01.shtml |title=Omar Olivares Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mets shortstop [[Rey Ordóñez]] wore #0 in 1996 and 1997 before switching to #10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimatemets.com/uninumbers.php |title=The Ultimate Mets Database – Mets Uniform Numbers |publisher=ultimatemets.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journeyman [[Tony Clark]] wore #00 with the Mets for the first two months of the 2003 season before switching to #52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimatemets.com/profile.php?PlayerCode=0703 |title=Ultimate Mets Database – Tony Clark |publisher=ultimatemets.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While with the [[Washington Nationals]] and Cincinnati Reds from 2005–2007, outfielder [[Brandon Watson]] wore #00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/watsobr01.shtml |title=Brandon Watson Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 2013 season, [[Adam Ottavino]] switched his number from #47 to #0. Also in 2013, [[Brian Wilson (baseball)|Brian Wilson]] took on #00 for the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 2014, [[Omar Quintanilla]] of the New York Mets switched his number from #3 to #0 for outfielder [[Curtis Granderson]]. Also in 2014, [[Brennan Boesch]] and [[Collin Cowgill]] took on the numbers #00 and #0, respectively, for the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]. Again in 2014, outfielder [[L. J. Hoes]] of the [[Houston Astros]] wore #0. Currently, [[Terrance Gore]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]], [[Adam Ottavino]] of the [[Colorado Rockies]], [[Mallex Smith]] of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], [[Yunel Escobar]] of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and [[Brandon Phillips]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] all wear #0. In total, 16 players have worn #0, and 20 players have worn #00 in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/friv/numbers.cgi?number=00&amp;year=0 "MLB Players Who Wore Number 00,"] Baseball-Reference.com. Accessed Aug. 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Numbers 01-09 with a leading zero are some of the rarest numbers that have been worn. [[Benito Santiago]] wore #09 for the San Diego Padres and [[Miami Marlins|Florida Marlins]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/santibe01.shtml Benito Santiago entry], Baseball-Reference.com. Accessed Aug. 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Superstitions, attachments, and gimmicks==
Often players grow emotionally attached to a number. When a player switches teams, his number is often already in use. Since the MLB allows number changes at any time, bribes may occur for numbers. Among the most outrageous are when [[Brian Jordan]] joined the [[Atlanta Braves]] and gave then-third base coach [[Fredi González]] a $40,000 motorcycle for #33, and when [[Rickey Henderson]] joined the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and paid Turner Ward $25,000 for Henderson's long-time career #24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://keepingscore.blogs.time.com/2012/03/21/peyton-manning-will-wear-number-18-in-denver-why-exactly-do-we-care/ | work=Time | date=March 21, 2012 | title=Peyton Manning Will Wear Number 18 In Denver. Why, Exactly, Do We Care?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not every player pays top dollar for his number; when [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]] joined the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], he bought #28 from [[John Kruk]] for $10 and two cases of beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/19/sports/sp-d2comment19 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Jim | last=Litke | title=It's All a Big Numbers Game for These Players | date=June 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, Williams would change his number to #99 after [[Charlie Sheen|Rick "Wild Thing" Vaughn]], the character in the 1989 film, ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'', whose erratic pitching style resembled his own.

In 1951, independent ball player Johnny Neves wore the number 7 backwards because "Neves" spelled backwards is "seven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball to Bassist|url=http://goldenrankings.com/baseballoddfacts4.htm|website=goldenrankings.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Voiselle]], who is from [[Ninety Six, South Carolina]], wore #96 from 1947–1950 to honor his hometown. [[Carlos May]], who was born on May 17, wore number 17, meaning that his jersey read both his name and number and his birthday ("May 17").&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt;

Some players who are unable to acquire the number they had on their previous team will obtain a similar number. For example, [[Roger Clemens]] wore #21 during the first 15 years of his career with the Red Sox and Blue Jays and during his college days at the [[University of Texas]]. When he joined the Yankees and the [[Houston Astros]], he switched to #22. Upon Clemens' arrival in New York, he reportedly asked long-time Yankee outfielder [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] to surrender his #21, but O'Neill refused. Though he would eventually opt for #22, Clemens initially reversed his beloved #21, and wore #12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yankeenumbers.com/playersview.asp?key=427 |title=Roger Clemens – 1999 – #12 – YankeeNumbers.com – Database of Yankee Uniform Numbers Through the Years |publisher=YankeeNumbers.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clemens continued to wear #22 upon signing with his hometown Astros in 2004 and, upon re-signing with the Yankees, [[Robinson Canó]], owner of #22 at the beginning of the 2007 season, moved to #24 in anticipation of the Yankees possibly re-signing Clemens, leaving #22 available for Clemens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070123&amp;content_id=1784336&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy |title=Cano changes number, just in case &amp;#124; yankees.com: News |publisher=Newyork.yankees.mlb.com |date=2013-05-24 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Beimel]] has worn #97 throughout his career because his first child was born in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070503&amp;content_id=1944813&amp;vkey=news_la&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=la |title=Beimel feels at home with Dodgers &amp;#124; dodgers.com: News |publisher=Mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Wells]] wore #3 while with the Red Sox because his favorite player, Babe Ruth, wore #3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2005/03/14/2003246299 |title=David Wells looks forward to opening day with Red Sox |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2013-10-18 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he played with the Yankees, Wells could not have #3 (retired for Babe Ruth), so he wore #33. In his final season, playing for the Red Sox, [[J. T. Snow]] wore #84 to honor his father [[Jack Snow (American football)|Jack]], a former [[National Football League|NFL]] [[wide receiver]].

[[Eddie Gaedel]], the dwarf who made one plate appearance for the [[St. Louis Browns]], wore the number ⅛.  The uniform belonged to the young son of Browns executive [[Bill DeWitt]]. The boy, [[William DeWitt, Jr.]], was then the team's batboy; he is now the principal owner of the St. Louis Cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/page2/tvlistings/show73transcript.html ESPN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baseball Hall of Fame]] [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]] never wore a digit on the back of his uniform with the Yankees (1931–1946) and Red Sox (1948–1950), despite managing during the era when numbers became widespread in Major League Baseball.

[[Joe Girardi]], in his managerial role with the Yankees, wore #27 to signify his desire to lead the team to their 27th championship.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3085167&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the [[2009 World Series]], he subsequently switched to #28.

==Retired numbers==
{{Main article|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}
The most legendary players, [[manager (baseball)|managers]], or [[coach (sport)|coaches]] on a team will sometimes have their uniform number [[Retired number|retired]], so that future players and coaches cannot wear those numbers with that team. Only the player with the retired number can wear that number if he returns to that team as a player or coach. Generally, such retirements are reserved for the very best, who in most cases, have impacted the entire league, and are most memorable.

The first [[Major League Baseball#MLB uniforms|Major League Baseball]] player to have his number retired was [[Lou Gehrig]] (#4). #4 and #5 have each been retired by 8 teams, more than any other number. The highest player uniform number to be retired was [[Carlton Fisk]]'s #72, but the Cardinals retired #85 in honor of their one-time owner [[August Busch, Jr.]]. Though he never wore a uniform, that is how old he was at the time of the honor. The [[Cleveland Indians]] retired the #455 in 2001 in honor of "the fans", to commemorate the then-longest home sellout streak ever (although MLB does not allow any team to issue three-digit uniform numbers).

Eight players and one manager, [[Casey Stengel]], have had their numbers retired with more than one team. [[Nolan Ryan]] had two different numbers (#30 and #34) retired among three different teams. Fisk's #27 from the Red Sox and #72 from the White Sox are both retired, as are [[Reggie Jackson]]'s #9 and #44, respectively, by the [[Oakland Athletics|A's]] and Yankees.

[[File:0G1G4040 Mariano Rivera.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Mariano Rivera was the last major league baseball player to wear #42]]
The New York Yankees have retired more numbers than any other team (19 numbers for 20 players), including all non-zero single digit numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/ |title=New York Yankees Team Page |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that many Yankees players get higher numbers because there aren't enough low numbers left.

The [[Toronto Blue Jays]] traditionally had not retired numbers, but have an alternative method of honoring their players called the 'Level of Excellence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/tor/history/level_of_excellence.jsp |title=Blue Jays Level Of Excellence &amp;#124; bluejays.com: History |publisher=Toronto.bluejays.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did retire [[Roberto Alomar]]'s number #12 in 2011, due to him being inducted into the Hall of Fame. They later retired number #32 in honor of [[Roy Halladay]], after his death. They also added him to the Level of Excellence.

On August 6, 2016 the Seattle Mariners retired #24 throughout the organization in honor of Ken Griffey Jr.'s induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He is the first Mariners player to have his number retired. 
 

===Jackie Robinson and number 42===
In 1997, Major League Baseball, for the first time ever, made a Major League-wide retirement of a number. Number 42 cannot be issued to any new players, having been retired in honor of [[Jackie Robinson]], although all players who currently wore the number upon the mass retirement of #42, such as [[Mo Vaughn]] and [[Butch Huskey]] of the Red Sox and Mets, were allowed to keep it under a [[grandfather clause]] if they were wearing the number in honor of Jackie Robinson. The clause also permitted such players who changed teams after the retirement date to retain #42 with their new team if it was available; thus, Vaughn (Red Sox, Angels, and Mets), [[Mike Jackson (right-handed pitcher)|Mike Jackson]] (Indians and Twins), and [[José Lima]] (Astros and Tigers) became the last players to wear the number #42 with two or more teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Robinsion | first = Craig | title = 42: Last Players to Wear the Number For Each Team | url=http://www.flipflopflyin.com/flipflopflyball/info-42.html |publisher = Flip Flop Fly Ball|date = April 2010 | accessdate = 2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the retirement of [[Mariano Rivera]] of the [[New York Yankees]] following the 2013 season, no MLB player currently wears #42 regularly. Art Silber, owner and coach of the Nationals' Class-A Affiliate Potomac, wears the number 42 as well. The [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], for whom Robinson played (as a Brooklyn Dodger), had already retired the number in 1972 before Robinson's death.

However, the #42 would be worn by a number of players other than Rivera in [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007]], which marked the 60th anniversary of Robinson's first appearance in Major League Baseball (the event that broke the sport's [[baseball color line|20th-century color line]]). Before the season, then-[[Cincinnati Reds]] outfielder [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] asked Robinson's widow, [[Rachel Robinson]], and MLB Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] for permission to wear #42 on April 15, the anniversary date of Robinson's historic game. Both gave their approval, and Selig later ruled that any player who wished to wear #42 on that date could do so. Three teams and several individual players on other teams wore #42 on that date; three other teams whose plans to wear #42 collectively were postponed due to rain on that date did so later in the month.  Since 2009, all players and coaches on all teams have worn #42 on April 15 in honor of Robinson.&lt;ref name="jr-day"/&gt;

Some feel that [[Roberto Clemente]] deserves a similar honor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buck|first=Ray|title=Baseball should retire Roberto Clemente's No. 21|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2010/07/17/2342561/baseball-should-retire-roberto.html|work=Star-Telegram|accessdate=22 September 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that #21 should be retired by all teams.

{{mergefrom|At-large bid|discussion=Talk:Wild_card_(sports)#Merge_"At-large_bid"|date=April 2018}}

A '''wild card''' (variously spelled '''wildcard''' or '''wild-card''', also known as '''[[at-large berth]]''') is a [[tournament]] or [[playoff berth]] awarded to an individual or team that fails to qualify in the normal way, for example by having a high ranking or winning a qualifying stage. In some events, wild cards are chosen freely by the organizers. Other events have fixed rules. Some North American professional sports leagues compare the records of teams which did not qualify directly by winning a [[Division (sport)|division]] or [[Athletic conference|conference]]. A wild card game is not a playoff game!

==International sports==
In international sports, the term is perhaps best known in reference to big international sporting events such as the [[Olympic Games]] and tennis tournaments such as [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. Countries which fail to produce athletes who meet qualification standards are granted "wild cards", which allow them to enter competitors whose proven abilities are below the standard otherwise required. In some instances, wild cards are given to the host nation in order to boost its chances.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In Olympic and World Championship competitions in track and field and swimming, however, nations are automatically allowed to enter two competitors, so these instances are technically not wild cards. In some other Olympic sports, such as judo, archery, and badminton, wild cards are in use, and they are granted by the respective sport federations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On rare occasions, a competitor who had gained entry by wild card succeeds in winning a medal or the championship.  For example, [[Kye Sun-Hui]] won gold in [[judo at the 1996 Summer Olympics]], [[Ding Junhui]] won the [[2005 China Open (snooker)|2005 China Open]] snooker championship, [[Goran Ivanišević]] won the [[2001 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|2001 Wimbledon Championships]], [[Kim Clijsters]] won the [[2009 US Open – Women's Singles|2009 US Open]], and [[Lin Dan]] won the [[2013 BWF World Championships]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==North America==
In North American professional sports leagues, "wild card" refers to a team that qualifies for the championship playoffs without winning their specific conference or division outright. The number of wild card teams varies. In most cases, the rules of the league call for the wild card team to survive an extra round or to play the majority of their postseason games away from home.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The term "wild card" does not apply to postseason formats where a set number of teams per division qualify. Former examples include: the [[American Football League]]'s 1969 playoffs (qualifying the top two finishers from each division), the [[National Basketball Association]]'s 1967-through-1970 playoffs (top four finishers from each division) and 1971–1972 playoffs (top two finishers in each division), and the [[National Hockey League]]'s 1968–1974 and 1982–1993 playoffs (top four finishers from each division) are not true wild-card formats. When a wild-card playoff format is used, the number of teams in a division that qualify is not fixed; the divisional champion automatically qualifies, but non-division winners qualify, based either on league record or conference record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

:''See also: [[Major League Baseball wild card]], [[List of AL Wildcard winners]], [[List of NL Wildcard winners]], [[Major League Baseball division winners]] (and wild-card winners) and [[Major League Baseball wild-card game]]''

In [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), wild-card [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoff]] spots are given to the two teams in each league (four teams overall) with the best records among the non-division winners. The initial wild-card format was implemented after MLB expanded to 28 teams and realigned its two leagues to each have three divisions. Since a three-team playoff would require one team to receive a bye, the wild card was created to allow a fourth team. The wild card has been in effect since [[1995 in baseball|1995]], although it was supposed to be used in [[1994 in baseball|1994]]; the postseason was canceled due to the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. In [[2012 in baseball|2012]], a second wild card was added to each league. The two wild card teams in each league face each other in a [[Major League Baseball wild-card playoff|one-game playoff]], with the winner facing the number 1 seed in the [[Division Series]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The advantages of the wild card format are that it allows a second- (or third-) place team a chance to win the [[World Series]], even if there is a dominant division winner. As the wild cards are not awarded by division, the additional teams are part of league-wide races for the fourth and fifth spots. Critics of the wild card, such as broadcaster [[Bob Costas]] in his book ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball'', have argued that, of the four major North American sports, baseball, having the most regular-season games (now 162), places the largest importance on the regular season, and the wild cards diminish the importance of the regular season by permitting a "second banana" team to make the playoffs, and that while it creates a league-wide race, it is for second place (and maybe third place) in a division, and takes away what would otherwise be a pennant race between first- and second-place teams, and can lead to teams playing for the wild card rather than to win the division. The second wild card was added in 2012 to address the issue of teams being content to rest players and win the wild card instead of trying to win the division. Also, because of the "sudden-death" round, these teams often use their best [[starting pitcher]], leaving them unavailable for much of the Division Series.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

A wild-card team must surrender [[home-field advantage]] the first two rounds of the playoffs. For the [[World Series]], however, home-field advantage is determined without reference to wild-card status. Prior to [[2003 in baseball|2003]], it was decided by alternating each year between the American and National Leagues. From [[2003 World Series|2003]] to [[2016 World Series|2016]], it was granted to the winner of the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]. Since [[2017 World Series|2017]], it has been granted to the team with the better record. In the [[2002 World Series]], both the [[Anaheim Angels]] and the [[San Francisco Giants]] were wild-card teams, as were the Giants and the [[Kansas City Royals]] in the [[2014 World Series]]. The World Series champions in [[1997 World Series|1997]], [[2003 World Series|2003]], [[2004 World Series|2004]], and [[2011 World Series|2011]] were also wild-card teams.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

{{main|NFL playoffs}}
In the [[National Football League]] (NFL), each of the two conferences sends two wild-card teams along with four division champions to its postseason. The first round of the playoffs is called the "Wild Card Round". In this round, each conference's two best (by regular-season record) division champions are exempted from play and granted automatic berths in the "Divisional Round". The four division champions are seeded from #1 through #4, while the two wild card teams are seeded #5 and #6; within these separations, seeding is by regular-season record. In the "Wild Card Round", the #6 team (a wild card team) plays against the #3 team (a division champion), and the #5 team (a wild card team) plays against the #4 team (a division champion). The division champions have automatic home-field advantage in these games. In the "Divisional Round", the worst seeded remaining team plays the #1 seeded team, while the best seeded remaining team that played in the wildcard round plays the #2 seed. Both the #1 seed and #2 seed have home-field advantage in the divisional round.

====Background====

The NFL was the first league ever to use the wild-card format. The decision to implement a Wild Card coincided with the completion of the [[AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970. Prior to the merger, the right to compete in the postseason for the NFL title was restricted to division/conference champions. Until 1967, a tiebreaker game was played to resolve a deadlock for first place in either of the two conferences. When the league expanded to 16 teams, it realigned into four divisions and expanded the playoffs to two rounds. Tiebreaker games were eliminated in favor of the use of performance-based criteria to determine division champions. The rival [[American Football League]], which reached a final size of ten teams in two divisions, also restricted its postseason to division winners until the 1969 season (the AFL's last as a separate league) when it expanded the playoffs to include division runners-up. The runners-up played the winners of the opposite divisions for the right to contest the AFL Championship Game.

Following AFL upsets in the last two Super Bowls prior to the merger, the merged league realigned into two conferences of thirteen teams each, with three "old-line" NFL teams joining the AFL teams in the newly-formed [[American Football Conference]]. The decision to make the conferences equal in size meant they could not feasibly align into anything except three divisions of four and five teams each. This led to a debate as to how the postseason of the merged league should be structured. Both the NFL and AFL playoff formats of 1969 had attracted fierce critics. The NFL format was criticized for its ability to cause a team tied for first overall in the league to miss the playoffs (this happened once, in 1967, when the [[Baltimore Colts]] missed the postseason despite a .917 winning percentage after losing a tiebreaker to the [[Los Angeles Rams]]). The AFL's 1969 playoffs were criticized by NFL purists for breaking with longstanding tradition, also, due to the fact that they allowed runners-up to qualify no matter how much disparity existed between the divisions, the AFL playoff structure could allow a mediocre team to qualify - this did occur when the [[Houston Oilers]], a .500 team, finished second in the Eastern Division - the Oilers were throttled in the playoffs 56-7 by the Western champion [[Oakland Raiders]]. The Raiders went on to lose the AFL title game to the Western runner-up (and eventual [[Super Bowl IV]] champion) [[Kansas City Chiefs]].

Despite Kansas City's win, some purists argued for the tradition of having only division champions contest the playoffs to continue. Had they prevailed, the post-merger NFL playoffs would have consisted of six teams and might have closely resembled the playoffs of the modern [[Canadian Football League]], with the regular season champion of each conference earning the right to host the championship game against the winner of a game between the champions of the other two divisions. However, the old-line NFL owners, who still expected their teams to dominate the merged league for at least the first half of the 1970's, thought a repeat of the 1967 Colts-Rams fiasco would be very likely under the new alignment combined with a six team format. In any event, most owners in both conferences wanted to keep the even four-team playoff field in each conference. This was established by having the three division champions in each conference joined by the best second-place finisher in the conference.

====History====

As with much of the NFL's nomenclature, the "wild card" was not initially referred to as such and was instead referred as the "Best Second-Place Team" (or sometimes simply as the "Fourth Qualifier").  The media, however, began referring to the qualifying teams as "wild cards". Eventually, the NFL officially adopted the term. During the 1975, 1976, and 1977 seasons, the divisional playoffs featured the #1 seed hosting the wild card team and the #2 seed hosting the #3 seed unless the #1 seed and wild card team were divisional rivals. In that case, the #1 seed hosted the #3 seed and the #2 seed hosted the wild card team. This was also the format used in Major League Baseball from 1995 through 2011.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 1978, the playoffs were expanded to 10 teams; however, the restriction against teams in the same division playing each other in the divisional round continued until the playoffs expanded to 12 teams in 1990. During this time, the #1 seed hosted the winner of the #4 vs #5 wild card game, while the #2 seed played the #3 seed. If the #1 seed and the winner of the #4 vs #5 wild card game were in the same division, then the #1 seed played the #3 seed, while the #2 seed played the #4 vs #5 winner. When Major League Baseball expanded its playoffs to 10 teams in 2012, it also used this format, although teams in the same division could play each other in the Division Series. From 1970 through 1974, the NFL used a rotation to determine which teams would host conference semifinal and final games, and which teams would play which other teams (coincidentally, baseball also used a rotation when it began to have this number of teams, for both of the aforementioned purposes, from 1995–1997 before switching to the seeding method).

The number of wild-card qualifiers was expanded to two per conference in 1978 —  the divisional winners were granted a [[bye week]] while the wild card teams played (hence the origin of the phrase "Wild Card Round"). Like wild card teams before, the wild card game winner played the #1 seed, or the #2 seed if they and the #1 seed were divisional rivals.  The playoffs were expanded again to three wild cards per conference in 1990 (or 12 teams total, which remains now) with the lowest ranked divisional winner losing its bye.  Following the addition of the [[Houston Texans]] in 2002, the league added a fourth division to each conference.  The league decided not to change the number of playoff teams, and thus the number of wild card qualifiers was reduced to two per conference, with the two lowest ranked divisional winners not receiving byes.  The term "Wild Card Round" continues to be used for the opening weekend of NFL playoffs, even though that weekend has involved both wild card and non-wild card teams since 1990.

As of the start of the [[2018 NFL season|2018 season]], there has never been a meeting of two wild card teams in either conference's championship game or in the [[Super Bowl]]. By extension, this means that two wild card teams have not met in the playoffs (and, by further extension, that a wild card team has not hosted a playoff game) since the league expanded to 32 teams in 2002.

====Wild Card Super Bowl champions====

*[[1997 NFL season|1997]] [[1997 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]&amp;ndash;[[Super Bowl XXXII]] (played in 1998)
*[[2000 NFL season|2000]] [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]]&amp;ndash;[[Super Bowl XXXV]] (played in 2001)
*[[2005 NFL season|2005]] [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]]&amp;ndash;[[Super Bowl XL]] (played in 2006)

*[[2010 NFL season|2010]] [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]&amp;ndash;[[Super Bowl XLV]] (played in 2011)

====Other Wild Card Super Bowl participants====
*[[1975 NFL season|1975]] [[1975 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]&amp;ndash;[[Super Bowl X]] (played in 1976)
*[[1985 NFL season|1985]] [[1985 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]&amp;ndash;[[Super Bowl XX]] (played in 1986)
*[[1992 NFL season|1992]] [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]]&amp;ndash;[[Super Bowl XXVII]] (played in 1993)
*[[1999 NFL season|1999]] [[1999 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]]&amp;ndash;[[Super Bowl XXXIV]] (played in 2000)

The 1980 Raiders, 2005 Steelers, and 1992 Bills tied for first in their division but lost a tiebreaker.

While not a wild card team, the [[1969 American Football League season|1969]] [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] were the first [[NFL playoffs#AFL playoffs|non-division winner]] to win the [[Super Bowl]].  They finished second in the Western Division of the [[American Football League]], and in that season, the last before the merger, the AFL went from having its two division winners meeting for the league title to adding a second round in which the second place team in each division qualified for the post-season.  These teams played cross-division in the semifinal round.  Thus the Chiefs, who finished second in the West, defeated the East Division champion [[1969 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in the AFL semifinals and then defeated the West Division champion [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] to advance to [[Super Bowl IV]], where they beat the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]. Because the term "wild card" was not instituted until the following year, the Chiefs are not included in the above list, but are recognized as the first team to win the Super Bowl without winning a division title.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== National Basketball Association===
{{main|NBA playoffs}}
Although the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) include wild-card teams in their playoff structures, the term "wild card" is seldom used; instead, each playoff team is most commonly denoted by its seeding position within the conference.

In the NBA, division champions within each conference were given the #1-3 seeds based on their regular-season records. The two fourth-placed wild-card teams are awarded the #7 and #8 seeds, respectively, also based on their regular-season records. In the NBA playoffs, home court advantage is determined strictly by regular-season record, without regard to seeding.

Before the [[2006–07 NBA season]], the NBA seeded its teams in the same manner as the NHL. Until 2015, the NBA seeds the three division winners and the wild-card team with the best record by regular-season record. This means that the wild-card with the best record got a seed as high as #2 (if that team is in the same division as the team with the best record in the conference); however, the next four wild-card teams will still be limited to the #5 through #8 seeds. This change was made to ensure that the two best teams in each conference could not meet until the conference final, and also (allegedly) to try and eliminate incentives for a playoff-bound team to [[match fixing|deliberately lose]] games at the end of the regular season in order to "choose" a higher-seeded team that has won fewer games (and, due to the unique home-court rules of the NBA, possibly gain home-court advantage for that series).

The notion of "wild cards" was essentially abolished the [[2015–16 NBA season]], as changes made prior to the season mean the top eight teams in each conference qualify regardless of divisional rank, with the seeded teams ranked by percentage. The only particular advantage to winning a division now is that a divisional title serves as the first tiebreaker for qualification seeding purposes. Unlike some other leagues, there is no tie-breaker advantage at all to finishing in any divisional rank lower than first - meaning (for example) that while a division winner ''will'' automatically win a tie-breaker over another division's runner-up, a division runner-up ''will not'' automatically win a tie-breaker over teams finishing third, fourth or fifth in other divisions. The new format means it is possible for an especially weak division to send ''no'' teams (not even its champion) to the NBA playoffs, although as of the start of the [[2018–19 NBA season|2018–19 season]] this has not yet occurred.

In the NBA, the winner of the #1 vs. #8 series goes on to face the winner of the #5 vs. #4 series, while the winner of the #2 vs. #7 series faces the winner of the #6 vs. #3 series. Notice that the winner of the #1 vs. #8 series will usually play against a wild-card team in the Conference Semifinals; this is arranged deliberately to "reward" the #1 seeded team by giving it the most winnable matchups in the first and second rounds.

===National Hockey League===
{{main|Stanley Cup playoffs}}
In the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), the first, second, and third place teams in each division qualify for the playoffs automatically, and two additional teams, regardless of divisional alignment, also qualify by having the best records among the remaining teams in the conference. These teams are referred to as the Wild Cards. The division champions play the Wild Cards, while the second and third placed teams in each division play each other; therefore the bracket is fixed, like the NBA. Home ice advantage is given to the higher seed in the divisional rounds, with the better record being used in the [[NHL Conference Finals|Conference Finals]] and [[Stanley Cup Finals]].&lt;ref name="Home-ice"&gt;{{cite web |title=NHL Hockey Standings |url=https://www.nhl.com/standings |website=NHL.com |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHL's current format is similar in some respects to the "cross-over rule" used by the [[Canadian Football League]] since 1997 in that it the format emphasizes intra-divisional ranking and brackets in the playoff structure and yet allows two teams from one division to qualify for the playoffs at the expense of the two teams finishing with worse records and in the same divisional ranks in another division. The main difference is that the CFL only allows the lowest ranked playoff qualifying team from a division to cross over into the other division's playoffs, whereas in the NHL it is possible for either Wild Card team to "cross over" to the other division, or even (in cases where four teams qualify from each division) for the Wild Card teams to swap divisional playoff brackets. Also, unlike the CFL the NHL does not require the second Wild Card qualifier to have an outright better record than a superior-ranked team in the other division - in the event of such a tie at the end of the NHL season standard tie-breaking procedures are used to determine playoff qualification.

From [[1999 Stanley Cup playoffs|1999]] until [[2013 Stanley Cup playoffs|2013]], division champions within each conference were given the #1-3 seeds based on their regular-season records. Among the remaining teams within each conference, five additional teams with the best records are awarded seeds #4 through #8. The division champions (first-third seeds) and the team with the best record that isn't a division champion (fourth seed) were given home ice advantage in the opening playoff series, in which they face the eighth-seeded through fifth-seeded teams, respectively. However, the playoff format differed slightly from that of the NBA. In the NHL, the highest winning seed of the first round played the lowest winning seed of the first round in the next round of the playoffs. For example, if the #1, #4, #6, and #7 seeds win their respective first round series then the second round of the playoffs matched the #1 seed (highest) versus the #7 seed (lowest) and the #4 seed (2nd highest) versus the #6 seed (second lowest). Home ice advantage in each NHL playoff series prior to the Stanley Cup Finals was granted by superior seed, even if the "wild card" team had a better regular season record.  For the Finals, the team with the better record will receive home ice advantage.&lt;ref name="Home-ice" /&gt;

=== Major League Soccer===
{{main|MLS Cup Playoffs}}
[[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), the top level of [[association football|soccer (football)]] in both countries, used a wild card format starting in its [[2011 MLS Cup Playoffs|2011 playoffs]]. The top three teams from each of its two conferences automatically qualified for the conference semifinals, while the four remaining teams with the highest point totals in league play, without regard to conference, earned "wild cards" into the playoffs. The wild card matches were single games, with the #7 seed hosting the #10 seed and the #8 seed hosting the #9 seed. The lowest surviving seed then played the [[Supporters' Shield]] winner (i.e., the team with the highest point total), while the other surviving wild card played the top seed in the other conference.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The "wild card" format was revamped for the 2012 season. Since 2015, the top six teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs, with the #1 &amp; #2 seeds in each conference automatically qualifying for the conference semifinals, and seeds #3-6 in each conference being wild cards. The lowest-seeded winner (played between the #4 &amp; #5, and #3 &amp; #6 seeds) in each conference plays the #1 seed, and the next-lowest playing the #2 seed in the conference semifinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/11/20/big-changes-mls-cup-playoffs-format-2012 |title=Big changes for MLS Cup Playoffs format in 2012 |first=Jonah |last=Freedman |work=MLSSoccer.com |date=November 20, 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian championship curling===
[[Curling Canada]] introduced Wild Card teams starting with the [[2018 Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] and [[2018 Tim Hortons Brier]]. The change was made as part of a wider set of changes which expanded the tournaments to 17 teams and eliminated the unpopular Pre-Qualifying Tournaments. From 2018, the round robin stage of the Tournament of Hearts and Brier will consist of two [[seed (sports)|seeded]] "pools" of eight teams as opposed to the old format consisting a single group of twelve teams. This allows the main tournament to include "Team Canada" (either the defending champions or, when the champions decline to or are unable to defend their title, the runners-up) and teams representing all fourteen constituent associations representing the ten provinces and three territories plus [[Northern Ontario]]. The remaining two participants in the tournament are the Wild Cards, which compete in an MLB-style play-in game prior to the main tournament to determine the sixteenth team in the main tournament. Just as is the case with MLB division titles, the format is designed to give teams an incentive to win their provincial championships. The Wild Cards are the top two teams in the [[CTRS standings|Canadian Team Ranking System (CTRS) standings]] that did not win either the previous year's tournament or their respective provincial or territorial championship. The top ranked of these two teams receives the [[hammer (curling)|hammer]] (last rock) to start the game. 

The CTRS standings are also used to determine the seeding of all teams in the main tournament, with one important caveat - for the purposes of seeding the round robin pools and so as to allow the main round robin schedule to be drawn up prior to the Wild Card game, the ranking of the top Wild Card team is the ranking that is used for seeding purposes regardless of who wins the game. Whereas teams in the Tournament of Hearts and Brier are traditionally referred to by their respective province or territory (other than Northern Ontario and Team Canada), the team that wins the Wild Card game is referred to as the "Wild Card" for the duration of the tournament. As is the case with Team Canada, the Wild Card retains that designation even if the team that is representing the same province or territory as the Wild Card team is eliminated prior to the Wild Card team.

With the introduction of pools, the round robin portion of the Tournament of Hearts and Brier now consists of two stages. The top four teams in each pool qualify for the second stage, formally known as the "Championship Pool." Unlike most tournaments which use a similar format, teams carry over their entire round robin records from the preliminary stage as opposed to only those results against teams that also qualify. This ensures that each Championship Pool team still plays eleven games that count for the purposes of determining playoff qualification.

The format is designed to ensure that a competitive team fills the Wild Card slot - due to the significant disparity in playing caliber between the top teams of Canada's fourteen member associations, it is widely expected that the Wild Card will consistently come from one of the provinces with the toughest fields in the playdowns, and that it will consistently be a championship contending team.

===Canadian Football League===
While the [[Canadian Football League]] does not officially use the term "wild card" to denote any playoff qualifier, its '''crossover rule''' acts similar to a wild card in many respects.

Calls to change the CFL's playoff format came about soon after the CFL finished its evolution from two regional conferences, which were originally the [[Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] in the East and the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]] in the West. Although the CFL was officially founded in 1958, its constituent sections did not fully merge until 1981. At the time, it was agreed that three teams from each division would qualify, regardless of overall league standings. This quickly proved controversial, as a wide disparity in playing caliber had emerged between the East and West divisions. Since the league had also implemented a fully balanced schedule (each of the nine teams played each opponent once at home and once on the road), this disparity (made even worse by the fact the West had one more team than the East) was fully exposed in the standings - in each of the first three seasons of the new format, the fourth place team missed the playoffs with records as good as 9-7 in the West, while in the East records as bad as 3-13 were good enough for third place and a playoff berth. In 1981, even the fifth place Western team's record of 6-10 was good enough for outright possession of sixth place overall.

In 1986, the playoff format was changed. The new format the fourth place team in one division to qualify if it finished with an outright better record than the third place team in the other division. The Eastern owners agreed in exchange for expanding the schedule to 18 games, and also with a stipulation that the qualifying fourth-place team would stay in its own division for the playoffs. As a result, the change introduced the possibility of a four team bracket in one division and a two game total point series in the other (the two game total point format was nothing new in Canadian football - it was commonly used until the early 1970's). It also introduced the possibility of the first place teams losing their traditional byes based on results elsewhere in the league. This occurred in 1986, when the 11-7 [[Calgary Stampeders]] qualified in place of the 4-14 [[Montreal Alouettes]]. The Alouettes folded before the start of the following season. Although it is highly questionable whether a 1986 playoff appearance would have saved the floundering Montreal franchise, the CFL quickly re-instated the traditional playoff format for the 1987 season. It also moved the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] (the West's easternmost team) to the Eastern Division. This balanced the divisions both in numbers as well as, to a considerable extent, in playing caliber, and the reduction in teams also caused the schedule to be changed to emphasize more divisional games. As a result, the three top finishers of the two divisions finishers always had the six best league records from 1987 up until the start of the league's [[CFL USA|U.S. expansion experiment]], which started in the 1993.

The current rule was adopted after the league re-activated the Alouettes and reverted to an all-Canadian alignment in 1996. It allows the fourth place team of one division to "cross over" and take the place of the third place team in the other divisional bracket, provided the fourth place team has more points (i.e. an outright better record) than the third place team. Since the cross over team enters as the third place team, it never receives home field advantage in the playoffs, even if its record is better than that of one or both of the qualifying teams in the other division.

As of 2018, all teams to qualify under this rule have crossed over from the Western Division to the Eastern bracket, although there have been a handful of occasions where a fourth placed Eastern team was in mathematical contention for a Western cross-over berth late in the season. Cross-over teams have advanced as far as the Eastern Final, but as of 2018 have never advanced to the [[Grey Cup]] game. There is no provision for a fifth placed team in one division to cross over in place of the other division's runner-up, even if it has a better record - a somewhat academic point until 2018, as since 1981 this scenario has yet to recur although on occasion it has been a possibility up to the final week of the regular season. In 2018 the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] finished fifth in the West with a 9-9 record and missed the playoffs while the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] finished 8-10 and qualified as Eastern runners-up.

== Professional tennis ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Championships, Wimbledon]] --&gt;In professional [[tennis]] tournaments, a '''wild card''' refers to a tournament entry awarded to a player at the discretion of the organizers. All [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] and [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tournaments have a few spots set aside for wild cards in both the main draw, and the qualifying draw, for players who otherwise would not have made either of these draws with their professional ranking. They are usually awarded to players from the home and/or sponsoring country (sometimes after a tournament where the winner is awarded the wild card), promising young players, players that are likely to draw a large crowd, have won the tournament earlier or players who were once ranked higher and are attempting a comeback (for instance, following a long-term injury). High ranked players can also ask for a wild card if they want to enter a non-mandatory tournament after the normal entry deadline, for example because they lost early in another tournament. This means a wild card player sometimes becomes the top seed.

Three of the Grand Slam tournaments swap some wild cards: the [[Australian Open]], [[French Open]], and [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/17/us-tennis-australia-open-wildcard-idUSBRE88G06020120917 Australian Open to hold wildcard playoff in China] - Reuters, 17 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A New York Times journalist has described this practice as "nothing more than mutual back scratching" and "an outdated symbol of elitism".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/sports/tennis/season-lookahead-2018.html Wishes for Tennis in 2018] - Christopher Clarey, The New York Times, 12 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motorcycle racing===
{{Original research section|date=May 2016}}
In [[motorcycle racing]] the term 'wild card' is used for competitors only involved in individual rounds of a championship, usually their local round. Local riders taking advantage of their local knowledge (often having raced that circuit on that bike before) and affording to take risks without planning for a championship, often upset established runners. [[Makoto Tamada]] and [[Shane Byrne (motorcycle racer)|Shaky Byrne]] have both taken double victories in [[Superbike World Championship]] rounds in their home countries. 
The most famous wild card entry perhaps was the late [[Daijiro Kato]] with finishing 3rd at his first appearance in 1996 and then winning the Japanese 250cc Grand Prix back to back in 1997 and 1998 on his way to become the most successful 250cc World Champion of all time in 2001.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Motorcycle Speedway'''

In [[Motorcycle Speedway]], wild cards compete in the [[Speedway Grand Prix]] events in which there is 1 wild card per competition (until 2005 there were 2 per Grand Prix). {{As of|2014}} six wild cards have won a Grand Prix: [[Mark Loram]] in [[1999 Speedway Grand Prix|1999]], [[Martin Dugard (speedway rider)|Martin Dugard]] in [[2000 Speedway Grand Prix|2000]], [[Hans N. Andersen|Hans Andersen]] in [[2006 Speedway Grand Prix|2006]] (later that year he replaced a permanent rider and went on to win another GP), [[Michael Jepsen Jensen]] in [[2012 Speedway Grand Prix|2012]], [[Adrian Miedziński]] in [[2013 Speedway Grand Prix|2013]] and [[Bartosz Zmarzlik]] in [[2014 Speedway Grand Prix|2014]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Auto racing===
Wild Card entries are not unknown in [[auto racing]] either, although the [[Concorde Agreement]] in modern-day [[Formula One]] requires all teams to participate in every event. [[John Love (racing driver)|John Love]] came close to winning the [[1967 South African Grand Prix]] in a wild card type situation, long before the term had been coined. Although the term is rarely used in [[NASCAR]], the concept of a [[road course ringer]] is similar. Before the late-1990s, [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|NEXTEL Cup]] and [[Xfinity Series|Busch Series]] races in the [[Western United States|West]] and [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] respectively would have several drivers from the [[Winston West]] and [[Busch North]] series, as the series regulations were very similar, and until the mid-2000s, [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] drivers would usually attempt Cup races in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and at restrictor-plate races.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

During the period of the mid-1980s until 2004, individual NASCAR races utilized the "Promoter's Option" (also known as Provisionals) to allow a top driver/team that did not qualify for the race, the opportunity for a "wild card" type starting position at the end of the grid. This allowed track owners to advertise and guarantee to fans that the most popular drivers would participate in the race (pleasing fans in attendance, and preventing no-shows) even if the driver had an unfortunate mishap (e.g., blown engine) or crash during time trials. Starting in 2005, only the Former Champion's Provisional remains.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

During the [[NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race]] (a non-points exhibition event) one driver who fails to qualify for the race is awarded a wild card spot via "Fans Choice" vote. In 2008, [[Kasey Kahne]], was selected as a wild card via fan vote, and went on to win the race.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

From [[2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2011]] to [[2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2013]], NASCAR's top-level Sprint Cup Series, since renamed the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, used "wild cards" in a different context, namely that of qualifying for the season-ending Chase for the Sprint Cup, now rebranded as the [[NASCAR playoffs]]. In previous seasons, the top 12 drivers in championship points after the first 26 races of the season automatically qualified for the Chase, with their points reset to a point unreachable by any other driver. Under the 2011–2013 system, only the top 10 drivers automatically qualified. The other two Chase qualifiers were the two drivers ranked from 11th through 20th after 26 races with the most race wins, with tiebreakers used as necessary to restrict the number of "wild cards" to two. Major changes to the Chase format that took effect in 2014, most notably determining the newly expanded Chase field of 16 mainly by race wins, eliminated this type of "wild card".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==College and university sports==
[[NCAA]] tournaments in all of its sports have included wild card berths, typically known as ''at-large berths'' at that level. Winners of each [[athletic conference]]'s tournament (or, in the case of basketball's [[National Invitation Tournament]], the team with the best regular season record in that conference) are granted automatic bids into the tournament, and a selection committee fills the remaining slots in the tournament bracket with who it determines to be the best teams who did not win their tournament (in practice, [[Power Five conferences|major conferences]] with stronger reputations and more revenue are invariably favored over [[mid-major]]s with similar records).

==Use outside North America==
Although the term "wild card" is not generally used in this context outside North America, a few competitions effectively employ such a system to determine one or more places in a future phase of a competition.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Olympics===
In the Olympics, several [[sport governing bodies]] award wild cards to nations in order to further promote their sport. Sports governing bodies will either make selections or hold a tournament to determine the wild cards. One such notable wild card selection was [[Equatorial Guinea]] swimmer [[Eric Moussambani]], who finished last in the 100m meter event in the 2000 Summer Olympics.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Euroleague===
The [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]], a Europe-wide competition for elite [[basketball]] clubs, once had one "wild card" advancing from its first phase, officially the Regular Season, to its second, called the Top 16. The rule was in place through the 2007–08 season.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

At that time, the competition began each year with 24 clubs, divided into three groups. (Today, the competition starts with a preliminary stage of 16 teams playing down to two survivors, who join 22 other teams in the Regular Season.) Then as now, the groups played a double round-robin for the Regular Season, with eight clubs eliminated and the remaining clubs advancing to the Top 16.

Under the rules in place through 2007–08, the top five clubs in each group automatically advanced. The final "wild card" spot in the Top 16 went to the sixth-place club with the best overall record, with three potential tiebreaking steps. A coin toss is not indicated as a possible step.

Starting in 2008–09, the "wild card" was abolished when the Regular Season was reorganized into four groups with 6 teams apiece. Now, the top four teams in each group advance to the Top 16. No change to the tiebreakers was made.

===FIBA Basketball World Cup===
The world championship for basketball, the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup]], invites four wild cards to complete its 24-team field. Teams have to participate in qualifying for the World Cup, have to apply to be one, and FIBA is not allowed more than three teams from the same continent in order to be selected. This setup began in 2006, where Italy, Puerto Rico, Serbia and Montenegro, and Turkey were selected by FIBA; Turkey made the best performance, reaching the quarterfinals. In 2010, FIBA selected Germany, Lithuania, Lebanon, and Russia as the wild cards, with Lithuania finishing third, and Russia making it to the quarterfinals. For the [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup]], FIBA selected Brazil, Finland, Greece, and Turkey; 2014 will be the last time FIBA will select wild cards, as the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup]] would no longer have wild cards when it expands to 32 teams. The perennial top two FIBA Oceania team namely Australia and New Zealand as wild card teams of FIBA Asia Cup 2017 in Lebanon. These two teams are also part of FIBA Asia in Basketball tournaments including FIBA World Qualifying Tournament for FIBA World Cup 2019 in China.

===European club rugby competitions===
[[Rugby union]]'s analogue to the Euroleague is the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]], which replaced the previous top-level club competition, the [[Heineken Cup]], starting with the 2014–15 season. The Champions Cup maintains a system originally created for the Heineken Cup in which some "wild card" teams advance to the competition's knockout stages. Also starting in 2014–15, the organiser of the Champions Cup, [[European Professional Club Rugby]], introduced this type of "wild card" to the second-level [[European Rugby Challenge Cup]].

During the last five seasons of the Heineken Cup (2009–10 to 2013–14), another "wild card" system allowed teams to parachute into the original [[European Challenge Cup]], which has now been replaced by the current Challenge Cup. This was scrapped with the creation of the current Challenge Cup.

Both the Champions Cup and current Challenge Cup involve 20 clubs (compared to 24 in the Heineken Cup and 20 in the original Challenge Cup), divided into pools of four clubs with each club playing a double round-robin within its pool. In both competitions, eight clubs advance to the knockout stages. The top club in each pool advances; the three "wild card" places are filled by the second-place clubs with the best overall records. For the Champions Cup, the number of wild cards increased by one from the Heineken Cup era; both versions of the Challenge Cup had three wild cards, but the original version filled them in an entirely different manner.

In the final years of the Heineken Cup, starting in 2009–10 and ending with the 2014 reorganisation of European club rugby, the three second-place teams with the next-best records after those that advanced to the Heineken Cup knockout stage parachuted into the Challenge Cup.

The tiebreaking procedure used to determine overall seeding, which was devised in the Heineken Cup era and carried over intact into the current era, is almost as elaborate as that of the NFL, with a total of seven steps (a coin flip is the last).

Prior to 2009–10, the original Challenge Cup also had "wild card" teams entering its knockout stages. The top club in each pool advanced to the knockout stage, along with the three second-place teams with the best records, using the same tiebreaking procedure as the Heineken Cup. Starting in 2009–10, only the winner of each pool entered the knockout stage, to be joined by the teams parachuting in from the Heineken Cup. As noted above, with the creation of the new Challenge Cup, that competition abandoned this system in favour of the system used in the Champions Cup.

===Super Rugby===
The [[Super Rugby]] competition, involving regional franchises from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, adopted a new playoff system with "wild cards" when it expanded to 15 teams in [[2011 Super Rugby season|2011]].

In its previous incarnations as Super 12 and Super 14 (each number reflecting the number of teams in the competition), it used a [[Shaughnessy playoff system]] in which the top four teams advanced to a knockout stage. The expansion to 15 teams led to major changes in the competition format.

Through the [[2015 Super Rugby season|2015 season]], the competition was divided into three conferences of five teams each, with every conference consisting solely of teams from one of the participating countries. At the end of the regular season, the winners of each conference received playoff berths. These teams were joined by three "wild cards", specifically the three non-winners with the most competition points without regard to conference. (Tiebreakers were employed as necessary.)

With the expansion of Super Rugby to 18 teams in [[2016 Super Rugby season|2016]], featuring a [[Southern Kings|permanent sixth franchise]] for South Africa and new teams based in [[Jaguares (Super Rugby)|Argentina]] and [[Sunwolves|Japan]], the competition format was changed again.

The competition is now divided into the Australasian Group, including all Australian and New Zealand teams, and the African Group, consisting of the South African teams plus the Argentine and Japanese franchises. In turn, the Australasian Group is divided into Australia and New Zealand Conferences, and the African Group is split into Africa 1 and Africa 2 Conferences. As in the 2011–15 system, the conference winners will receive playoff berths. The number of wild cards will increase to four, with the three top non-winners from the Australasian Group and the top non-winner from the African Group, again based on competition points, earning those spots.

===Philippine Basketball Association===
In the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], the playoffs are done after an elimination (in 2005-06, a classification) round where the top two teams with the best records are given semi-final byes, the next 3 are given quarterfinal byes, the next 4 are given entry to the wildcard phase, and the tenth team is eliminated.

The winner of the wild card playoffs, varying in format from a round-robin, a single-elimination or sudden death, usually meets the strongest quarterfinalist (the 3rd seed). The wild card winner's next opponent for the quarterfinals rested while the wild card phase was ongoing so the chance of advancing to the semi-finals (in which a team rested longer) is slim.

The '''only wild card champion''' are the 7th-seeded [[Barangay Ginebra Kings]] in the [[2004 PBA Fiesta Conference]] after 7 years of championship drought they made an epic run all the way to the throne, in which the top 2 teams were given semifinal byes while the bottom eight went through a knock-out wild card tournament. Since the addition of the quarterfinal bye, no wild card has entered the Finals, although the [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21 Express]] won the third-place trophy at the [[2005-06 PBA Fiesta Conference]].

The wild card set up was no longer used when the league reverted to the 3-conference format starting from the [[2010–11 PBA season]].

===ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final===
For both the junior and senior [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final]] (which starting in the 2008–2009 [[figure skating]] season will be merged into a single two-division event), the hosting federation may issue a wild card invitation to one of their own skaters should no skater from the host country qualify for the event through the [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] circuit.  Use of the wild card has not been common; however, it was used at the [[2007–2008 ISU Junior Grand Prix|2007–2008 Junior Grand Prix Final]] by the Polish federation.

===International association football (soccer)===
The same rationale exists in international association football, specifically FIFA World Cup qualifying stages. In FIFA World Cup qualifying stages in Europe, for example, 2nd placed teams are all ranked by number of points. The team with the most points is guaranteed automatic qualification to the FIFA World Cup, while the team with the least points is eliminated (points from victories against the last-placed team in each country's respective group being deducted), while teams in between generally play a 2-game playoff to determine qualification.

Other qualifying regions which use a wild card format include CONMEBOL, CONCACAF, and the AFC.

===All-Ireland Senior Football Championship===
In the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]], the premier competition in [[Gaelic football]], each of the [[Counties of Ireland|thirty-two counties]] in Ireland as well as [[London GAA|London]] and [[New York GAA|New York]] play in their respective Provincial Championships through a [[knockout tournament|knock-out cup competition]] format without [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeds]]. The winners of each of the four Provincial Championships earn one of eight places in the All-Ireland Quarter Finals.

The thirty teams that fail to win their respective Provincial Championships receive a second opportunity to reach the All-Ireland Series via the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship#Current format|All Ireland Qualifiers]] (also known as the 'back door', similar to a Wild Card).

===Road cycling===
In road cycling (teams), a wild card refers to an invitation to a race which a particular team would not normally be able to enter. Usually used for top division (currently [[UCI World Tour]]) races where the organization want more teams, lower league teams will be invited. It is very common to offer a wild card for teams from the same country to help local sport and to boost national pride. For example, for the 100th "[[Tour de France]]" in [[2013 Tour de France|2013]], the organisers (the [[Amaury Sport Organisation]]) awarded three wild cards to French teams: [[Cofidis (cycling team)|Cofidis]], [[Sojasun (cycling team)|Sojasun]] and [[Team Europcar]], all of which were [[UCI Professional Continental]] teams at the time and therefore not automatically invited, unlike the [[UCI ProTeam]]s which made up the vast majority of the entry list.
Teams can apply for a wild card.

In January 2015, Team [[MTN-Qhubeka]] from South Africa accepted an invitation to participate in the 2015 edition of "[[Tour de France]]". MTN-Qhubeka was the first African team to receive a wild card entry into the event that was held from 4 to 26 July 2015.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Rugby World Cup===
In the current format of the Rugby World Cup, a team that finishes 3rd in their group automatically gains a berth in the next Rugby World Cup (although they do not advance to the next round).

Additionally, the Rugby World Cup qualifying format uses a [[repechage]], in which teams from other regions that did not gain the automatic spot play each other for the final spots in the World Cup.

In [[sports]], a '''winning streak''' is a consecutive sequence of won games or competitions. It can be applied to teams in team sports, and individuals in individual sports. In sports where teams or individuals represent groups such as countries or regions, those groups can also be said to have 'winning streaks' if their representatives win consecutive games or competitions, even if the competitors are different. Streaks can also be applied to specific competitions: for example a competitor who wins an event in three consecutive Olympic Games has an Olympic winning streak, even if they have lost other competitions during the period.

====Overall====

=====[[Johnny Weissmuller]]=====

=====[[Tamás Darnyi]]=====

Darnyi was undefeated his entire international career in both the 200m and 400m Individual medley races, lasting from 1985 to 1993, though he did not hold the world record for the entirety of the period (another person broke it in a race that Darnyi did not compete in. He later reclaimed the record).

=====[[Roland Matthes]]=====

Matthes was undefeated in the 100 and 200 meter backstroke races from 1968-1974, though he lost the world record in races he did not compete in during that span. He later lost both records for good at the end of his career when he earned a bronze in the 100m backstroke behind [[John Naber]], who also set the world record in the 200m backstroke.

=====[[Vladimir Salnikov]]=====

Salnikov won all 61 of his 1500m freestyle races from 1977 to 1986. The streak ended when he finished fourth at the 1986 [[FINA]] World Championships.

Note:  Because of the post-1972 schedule overhaul, NASCAR will differentiate records from pre-1972 and post-1972.  The primary schedule overhaul eliminated midweek races, thus cutting the schedule from 48 to around 30 races (36 currently), and a minimum race distance (first {{convert|250|mi|km}}, later shortened to {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}}).  Since many pre-1972 races were under 100 miles (such as 62.5 mile races held in [[Islip, New York]], and the current non-championship [[Budweiser Duel]] then being a championship race at 100 miles until 1967), some NASCAR records are differentiated that way, similar to the NBA differentiating "fewest points" records with pre and post-1954 records, when the 24-second shot clock was introduced.

;Post–1972
4 wins (tie) (length of shortest race, in miles, in brackets):
* 1976 [[Cale Yarborough]] (216.8)

* 1998 [[Jeff Gordon]] (220.5)
* 2007 [[Jimmie Johnson]] (263)

Note:  In seven of the eight instances, at least one of the wins was in a 500-mile race.  Mark Martin's 1993 streak ended at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]], where the [[Southern 500 (1950–2004)|Mountain Dew Southern 500]] was stopped 16 laps early because of darkness.

July 22, 1995 was the 1995 Copa América Final&lt;ref&gt;[[1995 Copa América Final]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 27th match of their Unbeaten streak, even though Brazil lost the Final and thus the Match on Penalties, the Official record only counts it as a Draw since in normal time it finished at 1-1.

The '''World Chess Championship 1972''' was a match for the [[World Chess Championship]] between challenger [[Bobby Fischer]] of the [[United States]] and defending champion [[Boris Spassky]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. The match took place in the [[Laugardalshöll]] arena in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]], and has been dubbed the '''Match of the Century'''. Fischer became the first American born in the United States to win the world title, and the second American overall ([[Wilhelm Steinitz]], the first world champion, became a naturalized American citizen in 1888). Fischer's win also ended, for a short time, 24 years of Soviet domination of the World Championship.

The first game was played on July 11, 1972. The last game (the 21st) began on August 31, was {{chessgloss|adjournment|adjourned}} after 40 moves, and Spassky [[resign (chess)|resigned]] the next day without resuming play. Fischer won the match 12½–8½, becoming the eleventh undisputed World Champion.

In 2016, former World Chess Champion [[Garry Kasparov]] commented on the global significance of the match, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;I think the reason you look at these matches probably was not so much the chess factor but to the political element, which was inevitable because in the Soviet Union, chess was treated by the Soviet authorities as a very important and useful ideological tool to demonstrate the intellectual superiority of the Soviet communist regime over the decadent West. That’s why the Spassky defeat [...] was treated by people on both sides of the Atlantic as a crushing moment in the midst of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/garry-kasparov/ |title=Garry Kasparov on Conversations with Bill Kristol |work=Conversations with Bill Kristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
The match was played during the [[Cold War]], although during a period of increasing [[détente]]. The [[Soviet Chess School]] had long held a monopoly on the game at the highest level. Spassky was the latest in an uninterrupted chain of Soviet [[World Chess Champion|world chess champions]], stretching back to the [[World Chess Championship 1948|1948 championship]].&lt;ref name="EvansSmithp.8"&gt;Evans &amp; Smith 1973, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer, an eccentric&lt;ref&gt;"Fischer, according to some of the [[psychiatrist]]s who are regulars at the [[Manhattan Chess Club]], is a [[paranoia|paranoid]] and is 'psychotically suspicious, like most paranoids'." Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; 29-year-old American, was a vocal critic of the Soviet domination of chess, because he believed that Soviet players gained an unfair advantage by agreeing to short [[draw (chess)|draws]] among themselves in tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;"Bobby Fischer, then as now the ''enfant terrible'' of the chess world, charged that the Russians were in collusion, agreeing to draw with each other while playing no-holds-barred games with non-Russians, and to nothing to jeopardize the position of whichever one of them was leading." Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1962 ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', and then in October the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published Fischer's article "The Russians Have Fixed World Chess", in which he expounded this view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1074080/ Bobby Fischer: The Russians Have Fixed World Chess] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727110509/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1074080/ |date=July 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45123575.html Bobby Fischer: Schacher im Schach. Das abgekartete Spiel der Russen] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer himself rarely [[draw by agreement|agreed to early draws]] in unclear positions.

The pressure on Spassky was enormous because for the Soviets, chess was part of the political system.&lt;ref&gt;"Throughout all the Soviet comments on their chess successes runs the theme that more than chess is at stake. For example, when [[Mikhail Botvinnik|Botvinnik]] won the world title in 1948 ''[[Pravda]]'' commented, 'Botvinnik was not simply playing chess, he was defending the honour of his country', and in 1961 ''The Moral Code of the Builder of Communism'' stated, 'Our task is to educate chess-players towards communist consciousness, love of labour and discipline and loyalty to the good of society.{{' "}} Alexander 1972, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Botvinnik won the [[Nottingham 1936 chess tournament|Nottingham tournament of 1936]], ''Pravda'' said in an editorial that his victory was a triumph of Marxist–Leninist chess". Donner 2006, p. 138 (originally published in ''De Tijd'', June 28, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Spassky, of course, was carrying a burden that Fischer was not laden with: he was playing not only for himself, but also for the Soviet government, the Soviet system. He represented an ideology. Soviet chess players were supreme, so the theory went, because the Soviet social, political and governmental system was so much better." Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; While Fischer was often famously critical of his home country ("Americans want to plunk in front of a TV and don't want to open a book ..."), he too carried a burden of expectation because of the match's political significance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-7238823,00.html Fisher's 1972 Match Was Cold War Battle] January 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; No American had achieved the world championship since the first champion, [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], became a naturalized American citizen in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessmuseum.org/bio_steinitz_popup.htm Steinitz entry at World Chess Museum and Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704055014/http://www.chessmuseum.org/bio_steinitz_popup.htm |date=2008-07-04 }}. Chessmuseum.org. Retrieved on 2009-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The excitement surrounding the match was such that it was called the "Match of the Century",&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the best-selling book on the match was subtitled ''[[The New York Times]] Report on the Chess Match of the Century'' (Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972). Gligorić's book on the match was also subtitled ''The Chess Match of the Century'' (Gligorić 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Even before a move has been made, this breathtaking, blood-curdling and heartrending encounter is justly being labelled as 'the Match of the Century'." Donner 2006, p. 136 (originally published in ''De Tijd'', June 28, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrne &amp; Nei 1974, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; even though the same term had been applied to the [[Russia (USSR) vs Rest of the World|USSR vs. Rest of the World]] match just two years before.&lt;ref&gt;The term is used that way in Russian, and also by [[Edmar Mednis]] in his book ''How to Beat Bobby Fischer''. Mednis 1997, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Spassky, the champion, had lost the world championship match to [[Tigran Petrosian]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Kažić 1974, pp. 230–31&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he won matches against [[Efim Geller]], [[Bent Larsen]], and [[Viktor Korchnoi]] to win the right to challenge Petrosian for the title.&lt;ref&gt;Kažić 1974, pp. 194–96&lt;/ref&gt; This time Spassky triumphed, 12½–10½.&lt;ref&gt;Kažić 1974, pp. 231–32&lt;/ref&gt; He is often said to have had a "universal style", "involving an ability to play the most varied types of positions",&lt;ref name="Kasparov2004ap.182"&gt;Kasparov 2004a, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Garry Kasparov]] notes that "from childhood he clearly had a leaning toward sharp, attacking play, and possessed a splendid feel for the initiative."&lt;ref name="Kasparov2004ap.182"/&gt; Before the match, Fischer had played five games against Spassky, drawing two and losing three.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander 1972, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Candidates Tournament|Candidates]] matches en route to becoming the challenger, Fischer had demolished world-class [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmasters]] [[Mark Taimanov]] and [[Bent Larsen]], each by a [[List of world records in chess#Perfect tournament and match scores|perfect score]] of 6–0, a feat no one else had ever accomplished in any Candidates match. After that, Fischer had split the first five games of his match against Petrosian, then closed out the match by winning the last four games.&lt;ref name="EvansSmithp.8"/&gt; "No bare statement conveys the magnitude and impact of these results. ... Fischer sowed devastation."&lt;ref&gt;Steiner 1974, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; From the last seven rounds of the Interzonal until the first game against Petrosian, Fischer won 20 consecutive games, nearly all of which were against top grandmasters.

Fischer also had a much higher [[Elo rating]] than Spassky.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander 1972, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; On the July 1972 FIDE rating list, Fischer's 2785 was a [[List of world records in chess|record 125 points ahead]] of the number two player&amp;nbsp;– Spassky, whose rating was 2660.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chess.eusa.ed.ac.uk/Chess/Trivia/AlltimeList.html All Time Rankings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126000000/http://chess.eusa.ed.ac.uk/Chess/Trivia/AlltimeList.html |date=November 26, 2009 }}&amp;nbsp;– lists the top 10 from 1970 to 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer's recent results and record Elo rating made him the pre-match favorite.&lt;ref&gt;"''Despite his dismal score'' against Spassky, Fischer is the choice of nearly every expert. Indeed, London bookmakers favor him 6-to-5." Evans &amp; Smith 1973, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Of the players and expert commentators at the annual Hastings Christmas tournament in 1971–72, apart from one [[International Master]] who predicted a Spassky victory, almost everyone else predicted that Fischer would win easily. Gligorić 1972, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lay opinion is overwhelmingly in support of Fischer, expert opinion is divided in the proportion of about 2 to 1 in his favour." Alexander 1972, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Other observers, however, noted that Fischer had never won a game against Spassky.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Goichberg]], "Masters and Experts View the Match", ''[[Chess Life &amp; Review]]'', July 1972, pp. 409–10 (also available on DVD)&lt;/ref&gt;

Spassky's {{chessgloss|seconds}} for the match were [[Efim Geller]], [[Nikolai Krogius]] and [[Iivo Nei]].&lt;ref name="Roberts p. 59"/&gt; Fischer's was [[William Lombardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander 1972, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds &amp; Eidinow 2004, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady 2011, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lombardy 2011, pp. 219–20&lt;/ref&gt; His entourage also included lawyer Paul Marshall, who played a significant role in the events surrounding the match, and [[United States Chess Federation|USCF]] representative Fred Cramer.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander 1972, pp. 77, 79&lt;/ref&gt; The match referee was [[Lothar Schmid]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, it was doubtful that the match would be played at all.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the match, Fischer demanded that the players receive, in addition to the agreed-upon prize fund of $125,000 (5/8 to the winner, 3/8 to the loser) and 30% of the proceeds from television and film rights, 30% of the box-office receipts.&lt;ref name="Alexander p. 77"&gt;Alexander 1972, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to arrive in Iceland for the opening ceremony on July 1.&lt;ref name="Alexander p. 77"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds &amp; Eidinow 2004, pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer's behavior was seemingly full of contradictions, as it had been throughout his career. He finally flew to Iceland and agreed to play after a two-day postponement of the match by FIDE President [[Max Euwe]], a surprise doubling of the prize fund by British investment banker [[Jim Slater (accountant)|Jim Slater]], and much persuasion, including a phone call from [[Henry Kissinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, pp. 63–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds &amp; Eidinow 2004, pp. 143–44&lt;/ref&gt; Many commentators, particularly from the USSR, have suggested that all this (and his continuing demands and unreasonableness) was part of Fischer's plan to "psych out" Spassky. Fischer's supporters say that winning the World Championship was the mission of his life, that he simply wanted the setting to be perfect for it when he took the stage, and that his behavior was the same as it had always been.

World-class match play (i.e., a series of games between the same two opponents) often involves one or both players preparing one or two [[chess opening|openings]] very deeply, and playing them repeatedly during the match.&lt;ref&gt;An extreme example of this was seen in the 1927 World Championship match between [[José Raúl Capablanca]] and [[Alexander Alekhine]], where all but two of the 34 games featured the [[Queen's Gambit Declined]]. José Raul Capablanca, ''World's Championship Matches, 1921 and 1927'', Dover Publications, 1977, p. 46, {{ISBN|0-486-23189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation for such a match also involves analysis of lines known to be played by the opponent. Fischer had been famous for his unusually narrow opening repertoire: for example, almost invariably playing 1.[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. e4|e4]] as [[White and Black in chess|White]], and almost always playing the [[Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation|Najdorf Variation]] of the [[Sicilian Defense]] as Black against 1.e4.&lt;ref name="Mednisp.xxviii"&gt;Mednis 1997, p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Before the match there was a lot of talk that it is comparatively easy to prepare for Fischer, because he is very conservative in his choice of openings. Especially with White, Fischer plays [1.e4] almost without exception." Byrne &amp; Nei 1974, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; He surprised Spassky by repeatedly switching openings, and by playing openings that he had never, or only rarely, played before (such as 1.[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. c4|c4]] as White, and [[Alekhine's Defense]], the [[Pirc Defense]], and the [[Sicilian Defence#Paulsen Variation|Paulsen Sicilian]] as Black).&lt;ref name="Mednisp.xxviii"/&gt; Even in openings that Fischer had played before in the match, he continually deviated from the variations he had previously played, almost never repeating the same line.&lt;ref&gt;Gligorić 1972, pp. 48, 65, 87, 91, 113, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970 Interzonal tournament==
The [[Interzonal|Interzonal tournament]] was held in [[Palma de Mallorca]], Spain, in November and December 1970. The top six players of the interzonal (shown in bold in the table below) qualified for the Candidates Tournament. Bobby Fischer had not qualified to play in this event, as he had not participated in the 1969 US Championship (Zonal). However, [[Pal Benko|Benko]] (and the reserve [[William Lombardy|Lombardy]]) gave up his spot, and FIDE President [[Max Euwe]] controversially allowed Fischer to participate instead. A compensation of US$1,500 was paid to Benko for this to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Russians versus Fischer|last=Plisetsky|first=Dmitry|last2=Voronkov|first2=Sergey|date=2005|publisher=Everyman Chess|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portisch and Smyslov contested a six-game playoff in [[Portorož]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], in early 1971 for the reserve position for the Candidates Tournament. The match ended 3–3; Portisch was declared the winner because of a better tie-break score in the main tournament.

==1971 Candidates matches==
Petrosian as the loser of the last championship match and Korchnoi as runner-up of the previous Candidates final were seeded directly into the Candidates match stage, and were joined by the top six from the Interzonal. In the Petrosian&amp;ndash;Hübner quarterfinal in Seville, Hübner withdrew from the match after a loss in the 7th game due to noise complaints.&lt;ref name="ChessGames Seville Candidates Quarterfinal 1971"/&gt;

Fischer's victory earned him the right to challenge reigning champion Spassky for the title.

==1972 World Championship match==

===Schedule and results===
The match was played as the best of 24 games, with wins counting 1 point and draws counting ½ point, and would end when one of the players scored 12½ points.&lt;ref&gt;[[FIDE]] Article 7, Rule 8, reproduced in Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; If the match ended in a 12–12 tie, the defending champion (Spassky) would retain the title.&lt;ref&gt;[[FIDE]] Article 7, Rule 6, reproduced in Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[time control]] was 40 moves in 2½ hours.&lt;ref&gt;[[FIDE]] Article 7, Rule 9b, reproduced in Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Three games per week were scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;[[FIDE]] Article 7, Rule 9a, reproduced in Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Each player was entitled to three postponements for medical reasons during the match.&lt;ref&gt;[[FIDE]] Article 7, Rule 10, reproduced in Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gligorić 1972, p. 86"&gt;Gligorić 1972, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Games were scheduled to start on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday.&lt;ref name="Roberts p. 59"&gt;Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; If a game was adjourned, it was to be continued the next day.&lt;ref name="Roberts p. 59"/&gt; Saturday was a rest day.&lt;ref name="Roberts p. 59"/&gt;

Fischer insisted that a [[Staunton chess set]] from [[Jaques of London]] be used.  The [[chessboard]] had to be remade at Fischer's request.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds &amp; Eidinow 2004, pp. 163–64&lt;/ref&gt;  The match was covered throughout the world. Fischer became a worldwide celebrity, described as the [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] of chess. His hotel received dozens of calls each day from women attracted to him, and Fischer enjoyed reading the numerous letters and telegrams that arrived with compliments or criticisms.&lt;ref name="darrach19720811"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Bobby is Not a Nasty Kid | work=Life | date=1972-08-11 | accessdate=March 25, 2013 | author=Darrach, Brad | pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excitement grew as the match was postponed and people questioned whether Fischer would appear.  Previously, he had come to the airport and, surrounded by reporters, left. The combination of "Will he play?" and "American versus Russian" created excitement throughout the world.

 |Fischer played 29...Bxh2{{chesspunc|?}}
}}
Shockingly, Fischer played 29...Bxh2{{chesspunc|?}},&lt;ref&gt;[[Garry Kasparov]] (2004b), [[Max Euwe]] &amp; [[Jan Timman]] (2009), Dmitry Plisetsky &amp; Sergey Voronkov (2005), [[Svetozar Gligoric]] (1972), and [[C.H.O'D. Alexander]] (1972) all give this move one question mark (a bad move but not a [[Blunder (chess)|blunder]]). [[Larry Evans]] &amp; [[Ken Smith (chess)|Ken Smith]] (1973), and Richard Roberts, [[Harold C. Schonberg|Harold Schonberg]], [[Israel Albert Horowitz|Al Horowitz]] &amp; [[Samuel Reshevsky]] (1972) give it "{{chesspunc|?!}}" (a dubious move).&lt;/ref&gt; a move that few players would consider in light of the obvious 30.g3, trapping the [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]].&lt;ref name="Alexander p. 86"/&gt; In exchange for the lost bishop, Black is only able to obtain two [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] (see [[chess piece relative value]]). [[Svetozar Gligorić|Gligorić]], [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]] and other commentators have suggested that Fischer may have miscalculated, having planned 30...h5 31.Ke2 h4 32.Kf3 h3 33.Kg4 Bg1, but overlooking that 34.Kxh3 Bxf2 35.Bd2 keeps the bishop trapped.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparov 2004b, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gligorić 1972, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anatoly Karpov]] suggested that Spassky was afraid of Fischer and wanted to show that he could draw with the white pieces, while Fischer wanted to disprove that as the game headed for a stale draw.&lt;ref name="Karpov 1990, p. 100"&gt;Karpov 1990, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to unusual features in the position, Fischer had good drawing chances despite having only two [[Pawn (chess)|pawns]] for the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Byrne (chess player)|Robert Byrne]] wrote, "The wonder is that, even though he now loses the bishop for two pawns, he would have been able to draw had it not been for his later mistakes." Byrne &amp; Nei 1974, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; But the position became hopeless after he made at least one more bad move before the {{chessgloss|adjournment}}, which took place after move 40.&lt;ref&gt;Mednis 1997, pp. 275–76&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer could still have drawn the game with the correct 39th or 40th move.&lt;ref&gt;Gligorić 1972 (p. 34), Alexander 1972 (p. 86), and Evans &amp; Smith 1973 (p. 29) all give Fischer's 40th move as a bad move, stating that he could still have drawn with the correct 40th move. More recent books by Kasparov 2004b (p. 435) and Plisetsky &amp; Voronkov 2005 (p. 443) give Fischer's 39th move as weak, claiming that his last opportunity to draw the game was with 39...e5! Mednis 1997 (pp. 274–76) says that Fischer's 37th move was bad, and thinks he missed a draw with 37...a6. Euwe &amp; Timman 2009 (pp. 55–57), citing analysis of [[Friðrik Ólafsson]] and independently [[Jon Speelman]] say that Fischer could have forced a draw after 36.a4? with 37...a6 or with 39...e5. &lt;p&gt;Speelman analyzed the position in depth in his 1980 book, ''Analysing the Endgame'', pp. 74–80, taking into account previous analysis by others. He states that 29...Bxh2 was a bad move, giving White excellent winning chances without any compensating chances for Black. But the position was not lost after that move; only after two more errors (37...Ke4?! and 39...f5?) was Black was clearly lost.&lt;/ref&gt; He {{chessgloss|resigned}} on move 56. {{block indent |1=[[Nimzo-Indian Defense]], [[Nimzo-Indian Defence#4...0-0 Main line|Main Variation]] (''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings|ECO]]'' E56) &lt;br /&gt;1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3 Bb4 5.e3 0-0 6.Bd3 c5 7.0-0 Nc6 8.a3 Ba5 9.Ne2 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Bb6 11.dxc5 Qxd1 12.Rxd1 Bxc5 13.b4 Be7 14.Bb2 Bd7 15.Rac1 Rfd8 16.Ned4 Nxd4 17.Nxd4 Ba4 18.Bb3 Bxb3 19.Nxb3 Rxd1+ 20.Rxd1 Rc8 21.Kf1 Kf8 22.Ke2 Ne4 23.Rc1 Rxc1 24.Bxc1 f6 25.Na5 Nd6 26.Kd3 Bd8 27.Nc4 Bc7 28.Nxd6 Bxd6 29.b5 (''diagram'') Bxh2 30.g3 h5 31.Ke2 h4 32.Kf3 Ke7 33.Kg2 hxg3 34.fxg3 Bxg3 35.Kxg3 Kd6 36.a4 Kd5 37.Ba3 Ke4 38.Bc5 a6 39.b6 f5 40.Kh4 f4 41.exf4 Kxf4 42.Kh5 Kf5 43.Be3 Ke4 44.Bf2 Kf5 45.Bh4 e5 46.Bg5 e4 47.Be3 Kf6 48.Kg4 Ke5 49.Kg5 Kd5 50.Kf5 a5 51.Bf2 g5 52.Kxg5 Kc4 53.Kf5 Kb4 54.Kxe4 Kxa4 55.Kd5 Kb5 56.Kd6 {{chessAN|1–0}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1044722 |title=Spassky vs. Fischer, Reykjavik 1972, rd 1 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] |accessdate=8 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Game 2: Fischer forfeits {{anchor|Game 2}}====
After his loss Fischer made further demands on the organizers, including that all cameras be removed. When they were not, he refused to appear for game 2, giving Spassky a default win. His appeal was rejected. Karpov speculates that this forfeited game was actually a masterstroke on Fischer's part, a move designed specifically to upset Spassky's [[equanimity]].&lt;ref name="Karpov 1990, p. 100"/&gt;

With the score now 2–0 in Spassky's favor, many observers believed that the match was over and Fischer would leave Iceland, and, indeed, Fischer looked to board the next plane out, only to be dissuaded by his second, William Lombardy.&lt;ref&gt;"Fischer lodged a formal protest [over the second-game-forfeit] less than six hours after the forfeiture. It was overruled by the match committee... Everyone knew that Fischer wouldn't accept it lightly. And he didn't. His instant reaction was to make a reservation to fly home immediately. He was dissuaded by Lombardy, but it seemed likely that he'd refuse to continue the match unless the forfeit was removed." Brady 2011, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to stay in the match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a deluge of cablegrams.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Schonberg, Horowitz &amp; Reshevsky 1972, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady 2011, pp. 194–95&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer, Spassky agreed to play the third game in a small room backstage, out of sight of the spectators. According to [[Pal Benko]] and [[Burt Hochberg]], this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky.&lt;ref&gt;They write that it "had a costly psychological effect on Spassky". [[Pal Benko]] and [[Burt Hochberg]], ''Winning with Chess Psychology'', David McKay, 1991, p. 87, {{ISBN|0-8129-1866-5}}; Benko and Hochberg also quote Spassky as saying after the match, "My acceding to Fischer's groundless demand to play in a closed room was a big psychological mistake." ''Id.'', p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

 |Fischer played 11...Nh5{{chesspunc|!?}}
}}
This game proved to be the turning point of the match. After 11.Qc2 (''diagram''), Fischer demonstrated his acute intuitive feel for the position with 11...Nh5{{chesspunc|!?}}—a seemingly {{chessgloss|antipositional}} move allowing White to shatter Black's {{chessgloss|kingside}} [[pawn structure]], but Fischer's assessment that his kingside {{chessgloss|attack}} created significant {{chessgloss|counterplay}} proved correct.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Smith 1973, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Surprised by Fischer's {{chessgloss|theoretical novelty|novelty}}, Spassky did not react in the best way. Instead of 15.Bd2, 15.Ne2!? was possible ([[Igor Zaitsev|Zaitsev]]),&lt;ref&gt;Matanović 1996 (Vol A), p. 481, n. 26&lt;/ref&gt; or 15.f3 to prevent ...Ng4.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander 1972, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Spassky's 18th move, weakening the light squares, was a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Smith 1973, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; The game was {{chessgloss|adjournment|adjourned}}, and Spassky resigned the next day upon seeing that Fischer had sealed the best move, 41...Bd3+{{chesspunc|!}} The win was Fischer's first ever win against Spassky.&lt;ref&gt;Gligorić 1972, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; {{block indent |1=[[Modern Benoni|Modern Benoni Defense]], [[Modern Benoni#7.Nf3 Bg7 8.Be2 0-0 9.0-0: Classical Main Line|Classical Main Line]] (''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings|ECO]]'' A77) &lt;br /&gt;1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nc3 g6 7.Nd2 Nbd7 8.e4 Bg7 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0 Re8 11.Qc2 (''diagram'') Nh5 12.Bxh5 gxh5 13.Nc4 Ne5 14.Ne3 Qh4 15.Bd2 Ng4 16.Nxg4 hxg4 17.Bf4 Qf6 18.g3 Bd7 19.a4 b6 20.Rfe1 a6 21.Re2 b5 22.Rae1 Qg6 23.b3 Re7 24.Qd3 Rb8 25.axb5 axb5 26.b4 c4 27.Qd2 Rbe8 28.Re3 h5 29.R3e2 Kh7 30.Re3 Kg8 31.R3e2 Bxc3 32.Qxc3 Rxe4 33.Rxe4 Rxe4 34.Rxe4 Qxe4 35.Bh6 Qg6 36.Bc1 Qb1 37.Kf1 Bf5 38.Ke2 Qe4+ 39.Qe3 Qc2+ 40.Qd2 Qb3 41.Qd4 Bd3+ {{chessAN|0–1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1044727 |title=Spassky vs. Fischer, Reykjavik 1972, rd 3 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] |accessdate=8 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The match resumed with this game on the main hall stage per Spassky's request, but without TV cameras per Fischer's request. 
  
Fischer as White played the Sozin Attack against Spassky's Sicilian Defense. Spassky [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrificed]] a pawn, and after 17...Bxc5+ had a slight advantage ([[John Nunn|Nunn]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matanović 1984 (Vol B), p. 438, n. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Spassky developed a strong kingside attack, but failed to convert it into a win,&lt;ref&gt;Gligorić 1972, pp. 43–46&lt;/ref&gt; the game ending in a draw. {{block indent |1=[[Sicilian Defense]], [[Sicilian Defence#Classical Variation|Sozin Attack]] (''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings|ECO]]'' B88) &lt;br /&gt;1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bc4 e6 7.Bb3 Be7 8.Be3 0-0 9.0-0 a6 10.f4 Nxd4 11.Bxd4 b5 12.a3 Bb7 13.Qd3 a5 14.e5 dxe5 15.fxe5 Nd7 16.Nxb5 Nc5 17.Bxc5 Bxc5+ 18.Kh1 Qg5 19.Qe2 Rad8 20.Rad1 Rxd1 21.Rxd1 h5 22.Nd6 Ba8 23.Bc4 h4 24.h3 Be3 25.Qg4 Qxe5 26.Qxh4 g5 27.Qg4 Bc5 28.Nb5 Kg7 29.Nd4 (''diagram'') Rh8 30.Nf3 Bxf3 31.Qxf3 Bd6 32.Qc3 Qxc3 33.bxc3 Be5 34.Rd7 Kf6 35.Kg1 Bxc3 36.Be2 Be5 37.Kf1 Rc8 38.Bh5 Rc7 39.Rxc7 Bxc7 40.a4 Ke7 41.Ke2 f5 42.Kd3 Be5 43.c4 Kd6 44.Bf7 Bg3 45.c5+ {{chessAN|½–½}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1044365 |title=Fischer vs. Spassky, Reykjavik 1972, rd 4 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] |accessdate=8 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus Fischer had drawn level (the score was now 2½–2½), although FIDE rules stipulated that the champion retained the title if after 24 games the match ended in a tie.

After game 5, Fischer hinted to Lombardy about a surprise he had in store for game 6.&lt;ref&gt;"Despite the victory [in game 5], neither Bobby nor I was satisfied with the outcome of his king pawn sally in Game Four.

Before the match began, the Soviet team that had been training Spassky debated about whether Fischer might play an opening move different from his usual 1.e4.&lt;ref&gt;"Krogius: Of course, we ourselves tried to forecast the direction of the American grandmaster's preparations. I remember that repeated suggestions were made about possible changes in Fischer's style, and in particular his opening repertoire." Plisetsky &amp; Voronkov 2005, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; "But when the question was raised as to whether 1.d4 or 1.c4 could be expected of Fischer, Spassky replied: 'Let's not bother with such nonsense – I'll play the [Tartakower] Defence. What can he achieve?...{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Plisetsky &amp; Voronkov 2005, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer played 1.c4 (instead of 1.e4) for only the third time in a serious game.&lt;ref&gt;The two prior occasions were at the 1970 Palma de Mallorca [[Interzonal]], when Fischer played 1.c4 against [[Lev Polugaevsky]] and [[Oscar Panno]]. Gligorić 1972, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; With 3.d4 the game [[Transposition (chess)|transposed]] to the [[Queen's Gambit]], surprising many who had never seen Fischer play the White side of that opening. In fact, he had previously openly condemned it.

Spassky played Tartakower's Defense (7...b6), his favorite choice in many tournaments and a line with which he had never lost.&lt;ref&gt;Gligorić 1972, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; After 14.Bb5!? (introduced in Furman–Geller, Moscow 1970),&lt;ref name="Marovićp.130"&gt;D. Marović, ''Play the Queen's Gambit'', Maxwell Macmillan Chess, 1991, p. 130, {{ISBN|1-85744-016-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spassky responded with 14...a6?!. Geller had previously shown Spassky 14...Qb7!, the move with which Geller later beat [[Jan Timman]] at Hilversum 1973,&lt;ref name="Marovićp.130"/&gt; but Spassky apparently forgot about it.&lt;ref&gt;After Furman–Geller, [[Semyon Furman]], Geller, Spassky, and [[Eduard Gufeld]] analyzed the game, and "Geller analyzed a plan associated with material sacrifices that would begin with the move 14...Qb7!" Geller was also one of Spassky's {{chessgloss|seconds}} for the match, and "during the preparation for the match they studied this position" (after 14.Bb5). Eduard Gufeld, "Inventors and Novelty-Makers", ''[[Chess Life]]'', March 2001, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This move is discussed on page 350 of Plisetsky and Voronkov. That page says that it was known, but it does not say that Geller says that Spassky forgot it. It might be elsewhere in the book.--&gt; After 21.f4 Fischer had the upper hand ([[Vlastimil Hort|Hort]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matanović 1976 (Vol D), p. 273, n. 69&lt;/ref&gt; After 26.f5, White had a crushing attack. {{block indent |1=[[Queen's Gambit Declined]], [[Queen's Gambit Declined#QGD Main Variations|Tartakower Defense]] (''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings|ECO]]'' D59) &lt;br /&gt;1.c4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.d4 Nf6 4.Nc3 Be7 5.Bg5 0-0 6.e3 h6 7.Bh4 b6 8.cxd5 Nxd5 9.Bxe7 Qxe7 10.Nxd5 exd5 11.Rc1 Be6 12.Qa4 c5 13.Qa3 Rc8 14.Bb5 a6 15.dxc5 bxc5 16.0-0 Ra7 17.Be2 Nd7 18.Nd4 Qf8 19.Nxe6 fxe6 20.e4 (''diagram'') d4 21.f4 Qe7 22.e5 Rb8 23.Bc4 Kh8 24.Qh3 Nf8 25.b3 a5 26.f5 exf5 27.Rxf5 Nh7 28.Rcf1 Qd8 29.Qg3 Re7 30.h4 Rbb7 31.e6 Rbc7 32.Qe5 Qe8 33.a4 Qd8 34.R1f2 Qe8 35.R2f3 Qd8 36.Bd3 Qe8 37.Qe4 Nf6 38.Rxf6 gxf6 39.Rxf6 Kg8 40.Bc4 Kh8 41.Qf4 1–0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1044366 |title=Fischer vs. Spassky, Reykjavik 1972, rd 6 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] |accessdate=8 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After this game, Spassky joined the audience in applauding Fischer's win.&lt;ref name="Gligorićp.55"&gt;Gligorić 1972, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; This astounded Fischer, who called his opponent "a true sportsman".{{r|darrach19720811}}

"Lombardy was ecstatic: 'Bobby has played a steady, fluent game, and just watched Spassky make horrendous moves. Spassky has not met a player of Bobby's genius and caliber before, who fights for every piece on the board; he doesn't give in and agree to draws like the Russian grandmasters. This is a shock to Spassky.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;Brady 1973, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[C.H.O'D. Alexander]]:&lt;ref&gt;Alexander 1972, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; "This game was notable for two things. First, Fischer played the Queen's Gambit for the first time in his life in a serious game; second, he played it to perfection, the game indeed casting doubt on Black's whole opening system."

The win gave Fischer the lead (3½–2½) for the first time in the match.&lt;ref&gt;Gligorić 1972, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

====Game 13: Spassky–Fischer, 0–1 (Alekhine's Defense) {{anchor|Game 13}}====
Fischer avoided the Sicilian Defense, with which he had lost game 11, opting for Alekhine's Defense. After 8...a5! 9.a4? (9.c3!? and Black is only slightly better; Gligorić) dxe5 10.dxe5 Na6! 11.0-0 Nc5, Fischer had the upper hand ([[Vladimir Bagirov|Bagirov]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matanović 1984 (Vol B), p. 41, n. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The game swung one way, then another, and was finally adjourned at move 42 with Fischer having an edge in a sharp position but no clear win. The Soviet team's analysis convinced them that the position was drawn. Fischer stayed up until 8 a.m. analyzing it (the resumption being at 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.). He had not found a win either, but amazingly, he managed to set traps for Spassky, who fell into them and lost. Spassky's seconds were stunned, and Spassky himself refused to leave the board for a long time after the game was over, unable to believe the result. He remarked, "It is very strange. How can one lose with the opponent's only rook locked in completely at g8?"&lt;ref name="Gligorić 1972, p. 86"/&gt;

Lombardy noted the shock that Spassky was in after he resigned:&lt;ref&gt;[http://bobbyfischer.net/bobby07.html "A Mystery Wrapped in an Enigma"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902042455/http://bobbyfischer.net/bobby07.html |date=2015-09-02 }} [[William Lombardy]], January 21, 1974, Bobby-Fischer.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While Fischer dashed for his car, Spassky remained glued to his seat. A sympathetic Lothar Schmid came over, and the two shifted the pieces about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes. The two were left wondering how Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Former [[World Chess Champion|World Champion]] [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] said this game made a particularly strong impression on him. He called it "the highest creative achievement of Fischer".  He resolved a {{chessgloss|drawish}} [[opposite-colored bishops endgame]] by sacrificing his bishop and trapping his own rook. "Then five [[passed pawn]]s struggled with the white rook. Nothing similar had been seen before in chess".&lt;ref&gt;Soltis 2003, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Bronstein]] said, "Of all the games from the match, the 13th appeals to me most of all. When I play through the game I still cannot grasp the innermost motive behind this or that plan or even individual move.  Like an enigma, it still teases my imagination."&lt;ref&gt;Plisetsky &amp; Voronkov 2005, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; {{block indent |1=[[Alekhine's Defense]], [[Alekhine's Defence#Modern Variation|Modern Variation]] (''[[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings|ECO]]'' B04) &lt;br /&gt;1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.Nf3 g6 5.Bc4 Nb6 6.Bb3 Bg7 7.Nbd2 0-0 8.h3 a5 9.a4 dxe5 10.dxe5 Na6 11.0-0 Nc5 12.Qe2 Qe8 13.Ne4 Nbxa4 14.Bxa4 Nxa4 15.Re1 Nb6 16.Bd2 a4 17.Bg5 h6 18.Bh4 Bf5 19.g4 Be6 20.Nd4 Bc4 21.Qd2 Qd7 22.Rad1 Rfe8 23.f4 Bd5 24.Nc5 Qc8 25.Qc3 e6 26.Kh2 Nd7 27.Nd3 c5 28.Nb5 Qc6 29.Nd6 Qxd6 30.exd6 Bxc3 31.bxc3 f6 32.g5 hxg5 33.fxg5 f5 34.Bg3 Kf7 35.Ne5+ Nxe5 36.Bxe5 b5 37.Rf1 Rh8 38.Bf6 a3 39.Rf4 a2 40.c4 Bxc4 41.d7 Bd5 42.Kg3 Ra3+ 43.c3 Rha8 44.Rh4 e5 45.Rh7+ Ke6 46.Re7+ Kd6 47.Rxe5 Rxc3+ 48.Kf2 Rc2+ 49.Ke1 Kxd7 50.Rexd5+ Kc6 51.Rd6+ Kb7 52.Rd7+ Ka6 53.R7d2 Rxd2 54.Kxd2 b4 55.h4 Kb5 56.h5 c4 57.Ra1 gxh5 58.g6 h4 59.g7 h3 60.Be7 Rg8 61.Bf8 (''diagram'') h2 62.Kc2 Kc6 63.Rd1 b3+ 64.Kc3 h1=Q 65.Rxh1 Kd5 66.Kb2 f4 67.Rd1+ Ke4 68.Rc1 Kd3 69.Rd1+ Ke2 70.Rc1 f3 71.Bc5 Rxg7 72.Rxc4 Rd7 73.Re4+ Kf1 74.Bd4 f2 0–1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1128889 |title=Spassky vs. Fischer, Reykjavik 1972, rd 13 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] |accessdate=8 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Spassky and Fischer shook hands, many in the audience thought they had agreed to a draw, thinking that 75.Rf4 draws. But 75...Rxd4! 76.Rxd4 Ke2 wins; 75.Be5 Rd1 76.Kxb3 Re1 also wins for Black.&lt;ref&gt;Soltis 2003, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

The next seven games (games 14 through 20) were drawn. Fischer was unable to get the [[initiative (chess)|initiative]]. Spassky chose lines that Fischer was unable to break.&lt;ref name="Gligorić 1972, p. 116"&gt;Gligorić 1972, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; With a three-point lead, Fischer was content to inch towards the title, and Spassky seemed resigned to his fate.

The off-the-board antics continued, including a lawsuit against Fischer for damages by Chester Fox, who had filming rights to the match (Fischer had objected to what he said were noticeable camera noises, and the Icelandic hosts had reluctantly&amp;nbsp;– they were to share in film revenues along with the two contestants&amp;nbsp;– removed the television cameras), a Fischer demand to remove the first seven rows of spectators (eventually, three rows were cleared), and Soviet claims that Fischer was using electronic and chemical devices to 'control' Spassky, resulting in an Icelandic police sweep of the hall.

Fischer returned to the Najdorf Sicilian, but played the main line rather than the Poisoned Pawn Variation with which he had lost game 11. At move 13, Fischer sacrificed a pawn for {{chessgloss|counterplay}}, which Spassky accepted. After 19.c3, Spassky had the upper hand ([[Aivars Gipslis|Gipslis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matanović 1997 (Vol B), p. 539, n. 48&lt;/ref&gt; After 28...Rd7 the game was even, but when Spassky took a second pawn with 29.Qxh5?! it allowed Fischer a very strong attack.&lt;ref&gt;Gligorić, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Spassky, on the brink of disaster, "found miraculous replies while in time pressure" and Fischer was only able to achieve a draw by [[threefold repetition]] after 43 moves.&lt;ref&gt;Gligorić 1972, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Yugoslav grandmaster [[Dragoljub Velimirović]] improved on Spassky's play with the piece sacrifice 13.Bxb5!?, winning a crushing victory in Velimirović–Al Kazzaz, Nice Olympiad 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Keene]] and [[David Levy (chess player)|David Levy]], ''The 1974 World Chess Olympiad'', R.H.M.

This game turned out to be the last game. Fischer used a line of the Sicilian that he had never before played as Black, and further surprised Spassky with a novelty on move eight.&lt;ref name="Mednisp.xxviii"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrne &amp; Nei 1974, pp. 207–08&lt;/ref&gt; After 14...Qxf6 the game was equal ([[Mark Taimanov|Taimanov]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matanović 1997 (Vol B), p. 279, n. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Spassky played badly in the [[Chess endgame|endgame]] and the game was adjourned with a big advantage for Fischer.

==Aftermath==
Fischer's crushing victory made him an instant celebrity. Upon his return to New York,&lt;ref&gt;Soltis 2003, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; a Bobby Fischer Day was held.&lt;ref&gt;"Wearing city's gold medal and accompanied by Mayor [[John Lindsay]], Bobby shakes hands with some 3,000 fans attending..." Saidy &amp; Lessing 1974, photo on pp. 224–25; captions on p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; He was offered numerous product endorsement offers worth "at least $5 million", all of which he declined.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Evans, in Müller 2009, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/43123/1/1 |title=BOBBY'S CHESSBOARD MASTERY |work=Sports Illustrated |date=August 14, 1972 |accessdate=May 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with American Olympic swimming champion [[Mark Spitz]]. Fischer also made an appearance on a [[Bob Hope]] TV special.&lt;ref name="Cavett"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cavett|first=Dick |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/was-it-only-a-game/?_r=0 |title=Was It Only a Game? |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the games in this match proved to be his last public competitive games for several decades. Fischer had, prior to the match, felt that the first-to-12½-points format was not fair, since it encouraged whoever was leading to play for draws instead of wins. He himself adopted this strategy in the match: after having taken a comfortable lead, he drew games 14–20. With each game, he coasted closer to the title, while Spassky lost a chance to fight back. This style of chess offended Fischer. Instead he demanded the format be changed to that used in the very [[World Chess Championship 1886|first World Chess Championship]], between [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and [[Johannes Zukertort]], where the winner was the first player to score 10 wins, with draws not counting. In case of a 9–9 score, the champion would retain title, and the prize fund split equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seirawan |first=Yasser |date= |title=Winning Chess Brilliancies |url= |location= |publisher=Microsoft Press |page= |isbn=978-1857443479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kasparov |first=Garry |date= |title=My Great Predecessors, Volume IV |url= |location= |publisher=Gloucester Publishers |page= |isbn=1-85744-395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A FIDE Congress was held in 1974 during the [[Nice, France|Nice]] [[Chess Olympiad|Olympiad]]. The delegates voted in favor of Fischer's 10-win proposal, but rejected the 9–9 clause as well as the possibility of an unlimited match.&lt;ref&gt;Plisetsky &amp; Voronkov 2005, pp. 412–13&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Fischer refused to defend his title. [[Anatoly Karpov]], who had fought his way through the [[World Chess Championship 1975|1975 candidates tournament]], was declared World Champion by forfeit.

Seventeen years later, Fischer entered negotiations with sponsors willing to fund a match under his proposed format, settling on a bid from Yugoslav millionaire [[Jezdimir Vasiljević]]. Fischer insisted that since he had not been defeated in a match, he was still the true World Champion. He further claimed that all the games in the FIDE-sanctioned World Championship matches, involving Karpov and his challengers [[Viktor Korchnoi|Korchnoi]] and [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], had prearranged outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weeks|first=Mark |url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/92fs$$.htm |title=1992 Fischer – Spassky Rematch Highlights |publisher=Printer |date=1997–2008 |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then challenged Spassky (tied for 96th–102nd on the FIDE rating list at the time) to a rematch, leading to the [[Fischer–Spassky (1992 match)|1992 Fischer–Spassky match]].

==In popular culture==
* The musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', with lyrics by [[Tim Rice]] and music by [[Björn Ulvaeus]] and [[Benny Andersson]], tells the story of two chess champions, referred to only as "The American" and "The Russian". The musical is loosely based on the 1972 World Championship match between Fischer and Spassky.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Hartston]], ''Chess: The Making of the Musical'', Pavilion Books, 1986, p. 10. {{ISBN|1-85145-006-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the 1972 Fischer–Spassky match, the Soviet [[bard (Soviet Union)|bard]] [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] wrote an ironic two-song cycle "Honor of the Chess Crown". The first song is about a rank-and-file Soviet worker's preparation for the match with Fischer; the second is about the game. Many expressions from the songs have become [[catchphrase]]s in Russian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zhaskyran|first=Musin |url=http://www.kulichki.com/vv/ovys/articles/0018.html |title=Chess Problems (about chess songs of Vladimir Vysotsky) |date=January 2001 |accessdate=January 29, 2014|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2014 film ''[[Pawn Sacrifice]]'' tells the story of Fischer's attempts to defeat Russian Boris Spassky and become the World Champion. The film is directed by [[Edward Zwick]] and stars [[Tobey Maguire]] as Fischer and [[Liev Schreiber]] as Spassky.
* In the sixth episode of season 3 of [[Drunk History]], comedian [[Rich Fulcher]] recounts the 1972 World Championship match between Fischer and Spassky. {{cite episode |title=Games |series=Drunk History |date=6 October 2015 |url=http://www.cc.com/episodes/4vpgrn/drunk-history-games-season-3-ep-309 |network=Comedy Central |season=3 |number=6 }}
