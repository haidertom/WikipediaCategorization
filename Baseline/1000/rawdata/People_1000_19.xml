The '''Aberdeen doctors''' or '''Doctors of Aberdeen''' were six [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divine]]s working at [[Marischal College]] and [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland in the seventeenth century. Until 1635, they enjoyed the leadership of [[Patrick Forbes]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]]. They are distinguished not only for their positions at Aberdeen, but also by their [[irenicism|irenicist]] opposition to the [[National Covenant of 1638]]. Their adherence to [[Episcopacy in the Church of Scotland|Episcopacy]] and their support for the [[Articles of the Assembly at Perth]] (1618), which prescribed several English forms of worship, form the backdrop of their opposition to the [[Presbyterian Covenanters]].

When Patrick Forbes was consecrated Bishop of Aberdeen in 1618, he [[Financial endowment|endowed]] a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|chair]] of divinity in each Aberdeen college. He revived the awarding of degrees in divinity which earlier Protestants had suppressed as [[prideful]] or as redolent of the Roman Catholic title [[Doctor of the Church]]. The early recipients of the [[Doctor of Divinity]] who stayed on to teach at the colleges became known as the "Aberdeen doctors".&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan 1909, pp.44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dury]] wrote to the doctors seeking their opinion on the points of dispute between the [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and the [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. Their reply of 20 February 1637 was supported by [[Robert Baillie]] but opposed by [[Samuel Rutherford]]. On 20 July 1638, a deputation seeking Aberdeen's adhesion to February's National Covenant arrived, comprising the [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Earl of Montrose]], [[Lord Cupar]], the [[Alexander Forbes, 10th Lord Forbes|Master of Forbes]], and Sir Thomas Burnett, Laird of Leyes representing the nobility; and [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)|Alexander Henderson]], [[David Dickson (minister)|David Dickson]], and [[Andrew Cant (minister)|Andrew Cant]], the ministry. The doctors were prepared to adhere provided satisfactory answers were given to 14 written questions, termed "demands". The Covenanter ministers' "answers" were submitted the following day, prompting "replies" from the doctors and "second answers" from the Covenanters, who then left the town. The doctors issued further replies which they called "duplies", which went unanswered. All the texts were quickly printed and widely circulated and debated.

The doctors' obduracy contributed to the [[First Bishops' War]] of 1639 in which the Covenanters sought the submission of Aberdeen.

==List==
The six doctors who participated in the 1638 disputation were:&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan 1909, pp.45–48&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[William Leslie (theologian)|William Leslie]], Principal of King's College, leader after death of Bishop Forbes in 1635
* [[John Forbes (died 1648)|John Forbes of Corse]], theologian at King's College and son of Bishop Forbes
* [[Alexander Scroggie]], scholar of King's College, Minister in [[Old Aberdeen]]
* [[Alexander Ross (Aberdeen doctor)|Alexander Ross]], Scholar of King's College, Minister in Aberdeen
* [[Robert Baron (theologian)|Robert Baron]], Professor of Divinity at Marischal, Minister in Aberdeen
* [[James Sibbald]],  Professor of Natural Philosophy at Marischal, Minister in Aberdeen

As well as Bishop Patrick Forbes, two other notable Aberdeen divines were associated with the six doctors:&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan 1909, pp.48–49&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[William Guild]], who subscribed to the six doctors' initial demands but then switched to the side of the Covenanters
* [[William Forbes (bishop)|William Forbes]], principal of Marischal until made [[Bishop of Edinburgh]] in 1634, months before his death

'''Africanization''' or '''Africanisation''' (lit., making something African) has been applied in various contexts, notably in geographic and personal naming and in the composition of the civil service e.g. via processes such as [[indigenization]].&lt;ref&gt;African Successes Four Public Managers of Kenyan Rural Development David K. Leonard UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africanization of names==

Africanization has referred to the modification of place names and personal names to reflect an "African" identity. In some cases, changes are not a change of transliteration rather than of the European name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in Africa: An Introductory Survey|author=Edgar A. Gregersen|year= 1977|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-677-04380-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases during the colonial period, African place names were [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] or [[Francization|Francized]].

===Place names===

====Country names====
Various African countries have undergone name changes during the previous century as the result of consolidations and [[secession]]s, territories gaining [[sovereignty]], and [[regime change]]s.

==Africanization of civil services==

In some countries immediately following their independence, "Africanization" was the name given to [[racial]] policies, [[affirmative action]] intended to increase the number of Africans in [[civil service]] (which had historically been dominated by whites&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ffkFRTj1WIwC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;lpg=PA406&amp;dq=Africanization+of+civil+service&amp;source=web&amp;ots=988fWraWRf&amp;sig=gMOO4OWQKqoqnhUwqSOjMnRiK2o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Adedeji, Adebayo.

==Localization in African languages==

The term Africanization, abbreviated as the [[numeronym]] "A12n," has been applied to discussion of [[internationalization and localization]] of software and content in [[African languages]].

The [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], which lasted from March 20 – May 1, 2003, resulted in a small number of American and [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition]] [[prisoner of war|POWs]].

==507th's wrong turn==
A majority of the prisoners of war were captured from the ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]]. Separated from a larger convoy, they were ambushed in the Iraqi-held town of [[Nasiriyah]] on March 23, 2003. Out of thirty-three soldiers, eleven were killed and seven captured in the fire fight. Several weapons jammed in the firefight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/10/world/after-the-war-inquiry-report-says-errors-and-fatigue-led-to-ambush-of-convoy.html|title=AFTER THE WAR: INQUIRY; Report Says Errors and Fatigue Led to Ambush of Convoy|last=Schmitt|first=Eric|date=7/10/2003|work=New York Times|access-date=11/3/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following soldiers were captured by Iraqi forces:

|}

==Capture==
When they surrendered, they feared the worst. Miller held out little hope for mercy. "I thought they were going to kill me," he said. "That was the first thing I asked when they captured me: 'Are 
you going to kill me?' They said no. . . . I still didn't believe them."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/14/sprj.irq.pows/index.html|title=Former POW: 'We were like Custer'|accessdate=2006-12-18 |publisher=CNN|date=April 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraqi TV Interview==
Soon after their capture, Jessica Lynch was taken to an Iraqi hospital due to her serious injuries. The other five POWs did not know about Lynch surviving until after they were released.  After their capture, the five remaining members of the ambushed 507th would become famous as bloody and beaten. They were then interviewed by Iraq TV, and the footage was shown worldwide by [[Al Jazeera]]. In the interview, [[Patrick Miller (soldier)|Private First Class Patrick Miller]] was asked why he came to Iraq; his reply was "I come to fix broke stuff." Asked if he came to shoot Iraqis, he answered, "No, I come to shoot only if I am shot at. They don't bother me, I don't bother them."
&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-23-pows-iraq-usat_x.htm|title=Iraq puts captive troops on TV|accessdate=2006-12-18 |agency=Associated Press|date=March 24, 2003|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two More Makes Eight==
On March 24, they were joined by Chief Warrant Officers David Williams, 31, and [[Ron Young (US Army officer)|Ronald Young Jr.]], 26, whose Apache chopper, from the 1-227 Helicopter Attack Battalion, had been shot down in central Iraq during the [[2003 attack on Karbala|attack on Karbala.]]

==Relocation==
The prisoners were taken to [[Baghdad]], where they were isolated in separate cells of a drab [[prison]] with concrete walls and a tin roof. As American troops got closer, the soldiers were shuffled from building to building. The Iraqi captors worked feverishly to stay one step ahead of the advancing units.

==Rescue==
As it became clear that the war was over for the Iraqis, some of their captors approached a Marine unit from the [[3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion|3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, Delta Co., 3rd Platoon]] which was a part of [[Task Force Tripoli]] that had been pushing up toward [[Tikrit]], [[Saddam Hussein]]'s hometown.  A Marine battalion was sent to check on the intelligence and found the seven POWs with a confused Iraqi guard unit, whose officers had fled.

On April 13, 2003, 21 days after the 507th members were captured, the 3rd Light Armored Recon Marines burst in on the Iraqi guards who gave up without a fight.  Ordering everyone on the floor, a Marine gave an order to "stand up if you're American!"  Given dirty prison clothes and fed little food, the prisoners lost a lot of weight and with their garb, and beards they looked like Iraqis.  "At first," [[Shoshana Johnson|Spc. Shoshana Johnson]] remembers that, "they didn't realize I was American. They said, 'Get down, get down,' and one of them said, 'No, she's American.' "&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/04/14/MN252903.DTL|title=Freedom for 7 American POWs|accessdate=2006-12-18 |last=Peter Baker, Washington Post|date=
April 14, 2003|work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within hours, the seven were on their way to Kuwait International Airport inside a Marine Corps KC-130 transport plane, the first stop before the United States. Amid sobs, cheers and laughter, they told their stories to two reporters accompanying them on the flight.  "I broke down. I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm home,'" Johnson said.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

==War crimes==
During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Iraqi [[Saddam Fedayeen]] irregular forces were involved in executing several Coalition prisoners of war.

Sergeant [[Donald Walters]] was initially reported to have been killed in the March 23 ambush of the [[507th Maintenance Company]]. However, witnesses later reported that they had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters' blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/05/27/iraq.pow/index.html Status changed for soldier killed in Iraq: Investigation shows POW was murdered - CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Lynch]] was reportedly raped and sodomized by Iraqi forces, based on scars, though she has no recollection of it happening.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/07/usa.iraq&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on March 23, a British Army engineering unit made a wrong turn near the town of [[Az Zubayr]], which was still held by Iraqi forces. The unit was ambushed and Sapper Luke Allsopp and Staff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth became separated from the rest. Both were captured and executed by Iraqi forces. In 2006, a video of Allsopp lying on the ground surrounded by Iraqi irregular forces was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1530205/Soldier-killed-in-convoy-ambush-'was-alive-for-four-hours-surrounded-by-mob'.html Soldier killed in convoy ambush 'was alive for four hours surrounded by mob' - The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}
In [[Christian theology]] and [[ecclesiology]], the '''apostles''' ({{Lang-el|ἀπόστολος|lit=one who is sent away|translit=apóstolos}}), particularly the '''Twelve Apostles''' (also known as the '''Twelve Disciples''' or simply the '''Twelve'''),  were the primary [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of [[Jesus]], the central figure in [[Christianity]]. During the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life]] and [[ministry of Jesus]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]], the apostles were his closest followers and became the primary teachers of [[the gospel]] message of Jesus. The word ''disciple'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''apostle''; for instance, the [[Gospel of John]] makes no distinction between the two terms.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In modern usage, prominent [[missionaries]] are often called apostles, a practice which stems from the [[Latin]] equivalent of ''apostle'', i.e. ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|missio}}}}'', the source of the [[English language|English]] word ''missionary''. For example, [[Saint Patrick]] (AD 373–463) was the "Apostle of Ireland", [[Saint Boniface]] (680–755) was the "Apostle to the [[German people|Germans]]", &lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; [[José de Anchieta|Saint José de Anchieta]] (1534–1597) was the "Apostle of Brazil" and [[Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur|Saint Peter of Betancur]] (1626–1667) was the "Apostle of Guatemala".

While [[Christian tradition]] often refers to the apostles as being twelve in number, different [[Four Evangelists|gospel writers]] give different names for the same individual, and apostles mentioned in one [[gospel]] are not mentioned in others. The [[commissioning of the Twelve Apostles]] during the ministry of Jesus is recorded in the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. After his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], Jesus sent eleven of them (minus [[Judas Iscariot]], who by then had [[Judas Iscariot#Death|died]]) by the [[Great Commission]] to spread his teachings to all nations.  This event is commonly called the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]]. There is also an [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] tradition derived from the [[Gospel of Luke]] of there having been as many as [[Seventy disciples|70 apostles]] during the time of Jesus' ministry. Prominent figures in [[early Christianity]], notably [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], were often called apostles, even though their ministry or mission came after the life of Jesus.

The period of early Christianity during the lifetimes of the apostles is called the [[Apostolic Age]].&lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; During the 1st century AD, the apostles established [[Local church|churches]] throughout the territories of the [[Roman Empire]] and, according to tradition, through the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[India]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Synaxis of the Twelve Apostles by Constantinople master (early 14th c., Pushkin museum).jpg|thumb|The [[Synaxis]] of the Twelve Apostles. Russian, 14th century, Moscow Museum.]]

The word "apostle" comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἀπόστολος}}}} (''apóstolos''), formed from the prefix {{lang|grc|{{linktext|ἀπό-}}}} (''apó-'', "from") and root {{lang|grc|{{linktext|στέλλω}}}} (''stéllō'', "I send", "I depart") and originally meaning "messenger, envoy". It has, however, a stronger sense than the word messenger, and is closer to a "delegate".&lt;ref name="Coppieters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01626c.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Apostles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Bauer lexicon|Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament]]'' argues that its Christian use translated a [[Judaism|Jewish]] position known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as the ''sheliach'' ({{lang|he|{{linktext|שליח}}}}). This ecclesiastical meaning of the word was later translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|missio}}}}'', the source of the English "[[missionary]]".

==Background==
In the New Testament, the majority of the apostles have [[Hebrew name]]s, although some have [[Greek name]]s. Many Jews at the time had Latin or Greek names as well as Hebrew names.&lt;ref&gt;As was not uncommon for Jews at the time, some of them had two names, one Hebrew/Aramaic and the other Greek. Hence the lists of Jesus' twelve apostles contains 14 names not 12; the 4 [[Greek language|Greek]] names are [[Andrew]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], [[Thaddaeus]] and [[Lebbaeus]]. Reference: [[John P. Meier]]'s [[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew|''A Marginal Jew'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bibleref2|Mark|6:7–13}} states that Jesus initially sent out these twelve in pairs ([[cf.]] {{Bibleref2|Mt|10:5–42}}, {{Bibleref2|Lk|9:1–6}}) to towns in [[Galilee]]. The text states that their initial instructions were to [[Faith healing|heal the sick]] and [[Exorcism#Jesus|drive out demons]].&lt;ref name="Coppieters" /&gt; They are also instructed to "take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse, but to wear sandals, and not put on two [[tunic]]s", and that if any town rejects them they ought to shake the dust off their feet as they leave, a gesture which some scholars think was meant as a contemptuous threat (Miller 26).{{incomplete citation|date= November 2018}} Their carrying of just a staff (Matthew and Luke say not even a staff) is sometimes given as the reason for the use by Christian [[bishop]]s of a [[Crosier|staff of office]] in those denominations that believe they maintain an [[apostolic succession]].

Later in the Gospel narratives the twelve apostles are described as [[Great Commission|having been commissioned to preach]] the Gospel to "all the nations",&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Mt|28:19}}, {{Bibleref2|Mk|13:10}}, and {{Bibleref2-nb|Mk|16:15}}&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of whether Jew or Gentile.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. also {{Bibleref2|Acts|15:1–31}}, {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2:7–9}}, {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:4–8}}, and {{Bibleref2|Acts|10:1–11:18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul emphasized the important role of the apostles in the church of God when he said that the household of God is "built upon the foundation of apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone".{{Bibleref2c|Ephesians|2:19–20}}
{{anchor|The twelve apostles}}

Although not one of the apostles commissioned during the life of Jesus, Paul, a [[Jews|Jew]] named Saul of Tarsus, claimed a special commission from the [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|risen Jesus]] and is considered "the apostle of the [[Gentiles]]",{{Bibleref2c|Romans|11:13|9}} for his missions to spread the gospel message after [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|his conversion]]. In his writings, the [[Pauline epistles|epistles]] to Christian churches throughout the [[Levant]], Paul did not restrict the term "apostle" to the Twelve, and often refers to his mentor [[Barnabas]] as an apostle.&lt;ref name="ODCC self"&gt;"Apostle." Cross, F. L., ed. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-280290-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restricted usage appears in the [[Revelation to John]].&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 21:14.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century AD]], association with the apostles was esteemed as an evidence of authority. Churches which are believed to have been founded by one of the apostles are known as [[apostolic see]]s. Paul's epistles were accepted as [[Development of the New Testament canon|scripture]], and two of the four [[Biblical canon|canonical]] gospels were associated with apostles, as were other [[New Testament]] works. Various Christian texts, such as the ''[[Didache]]'' and the ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', were attributed to the apostles. [[Bishops]] traced their lines of succession back to individual apostles, who were said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and [[Early centers of Christianity|established churches]] across great territories. Christian bishops have traditionally claimed authority deriving, by [[apostolic succession]], from the Twelve.&lt;ref name="ODCC self" /&gt; Early [[Church Fathers]] who came to be associated with apostles, such as [[Pope Clement I]] with [[St. Peter]], are referred to as the [[Apostolic Fathers]]. The [[Apostles' Creed]], popular in the [[Western Christianity|West]], was said to have been composed by the apostles themselves.

==The Twelve Apostles==

===Calling by Jesus===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Exhortation to the Apostles (Recommandation aux apôtres) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|[[James Tissot]], ''The Exhortation to the Apostles''.]]
{{Main|Commissioning of the Twelve Apostles}}
The three Synoptic Gospels record the circumstances in which some of the disciples were recruited, Matthew only describing the recruitment of Simon, Andrew, James, and John. All three Synoptic Gospels state that these four were recruited fairly soon after Jesus returned from [[Temptation of Jesus|being tempted by the devil]].

Despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, they are all described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets to do so. Traditionally the immediacy of their consent was viewed as an example of divine power, although this statement is not made in the text itself. The alternative and much more ordinary solution is that Jesus was simply friends with the individuals beforehand, as implied by the Gospel of John, which states that  Peter (Simon) and Andrew were disciples of [[John the Baptist]], and started following Jesus as soon as [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus had been baptized]].

Albright and Mann extrapolate from Simon's and Andrew's abandonment of their nets that Matthew is emphasizing the importance of renunciation by converting to Christianity, since fishing was profitable, although required large start-up costs, and abandoning everything would have been an important sacrifice. Regardless, Simon and Andrew's abandonment of what were effectively their most important worldly possessions was taken as a model by later Christian [[ascetics]].

[[File:De zielenvisserij - Fishing for souls (Adriaen Pietersz. van de Venne).jpg|thumb|[[Adriaen van de Venne]]'s ''Fishers of Men''. Oil on panel, 1614]]
Matthew describes Jesus meeting James and John, also fishermen and brothers, very shortly after recruiting Simon and Andrew. Matthew and Mark identify James and John as sons of [[Zebedee]]. Luke adds to Matthew and Mark that James and John worked as a team with Simon and Andrew. Matthew states that at the time of the encounter, James and John were repairing their nets, but readily joined Jesus without hesitation.

This parallels the accounts of Mark and Luke, but Matthew implies that the men have also abandoned their father (since he is present in the ship they abandon behind them), and Carter feels this should be interpreted to mean that Matthew's view of Jesus is one of a figure rejecting the traditional patriarchal structure of society, where the father had command over his children; most scholars, however, just interpret it to mean that Matthew intended these two to be seen as even more devoted than the other pair.

The Synoptic Gospels go on to describe that much later, after Jesus had later begun [[Ministry of Jesus|his ministry]], he noticed, while teaching, a [[tax collector]] in his booth. The tax collector,  called Matthew in {{Bibleref2|Matthew |9:9}}, Levi in {{Bibleref2|Mark|2:14}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|5:27}}, is asked by Jesus to become one of his disciples. Matthew/Levi is stated to have accepted and then invited Jesus for a meal with his friends. Tax collectors were seen as [[villain]]s in Jewish society, and the [[Pharisees]] are described as asking Jesus why he is having a meal with such disreputable people. The reply Jesus gives to this is now well known: "it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the [[righteous]], but sinners".

===Replacement of Judas===
{{Main article|Saint Matthias}}
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Christ and then in guilt committed suicide before Christ's [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] (in one Gospel account), the apostles numbered eleven. When Jesus had been taken up from them, in preparation for the coming of the Holy Spirit that he had promised them, Peter advised the brethren:
{{quote|Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus... For he was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry... For it is written in the book of Psalms, "Let his habitation be made desolate, Let no one dwell therein", and, "Let another take his office"...&amp;nbsp;So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us, must become with us a witness to his resurrection|{{Bibleref2|Acts|1:15–26}}}}

So, between the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension of Christ]] and the day of [[Pentecost]], the remaining apostles elected a twelfth apostle by [[Sortition|casting lots]], a traditional Israelite way to determine the will of God (see {{Bibleref2|Proverbs|16:33}}). The lot fell upon [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-were-twelve-disciples#replace-judas |title= Who were the 12 disciples?  |accessdate= 2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul the Apostle in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], appears to give the first historical reference to the twelve apostles:
{{quote|For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.|{{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|15:3–8}}}}

===Paul, Apostle of the Gentiles===
{{Paul}}
{{Main article|Paul the Apostle}}
In his writings, [[Paul the Apostle]], although not one of the original twelve, described himself as an ''apostle'', one "born out of due time" (e.g., {{Bibleref2|Romans|1:1}}, 1 Corinthians 15:8 and other letters). He was called by the resurrected Jesus himself during his [[Road to Damascus]] vision and given the name "Paul".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|9:1–9}} With Barnabas, he was allotted the role of apostle in the church.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|13:2}} He referred to himself as the ''apostle of the Gentiles.''{{Bibleref2c|Rom|11:13|9}}

As the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states, "It is at once evident that in a Christian sense, everyone who had received a mission from God, or Christ, to man could be called 'Apostle'"; thus extending the original sense beyond the twelve.&lt;ref name="Coppieters" /&gt;

Since Paul claimed to have received the gospel through a revelation of Jesus Christ&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{Bibleref2|Gal|1:12}}; {{Bibleref2|Acts|9:3–19}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|9:26–27}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|22:6–21}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|26:12–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the latter's death and [[resurrection]] (rather than before like the twelve), he was often obliged to defend his apostolic authority ({{Bibleref2|1Cor|9:1||1 Cor. 9:1 "Am I not an apostle?"}}) and proclaim that he had seen and was anointed by Jesus while on the road to Damascus.

James, Peter and John in Jerusalem accepted his calling to the apostleship from the Lord to the [[Gentiles]] (specifically those not [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]]) as of equal authority as Peter's to the [[Jew]]s (specifically those circumcised) according to Paul.{{Bibleref2c|Gal|2:7–9}} "James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars&amp;nbsp;... agreed that we [Paul and Barnabas] should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews."{{Bibleref2c|Gal|2:9}}

Paul, despite his divine calling as an apostle, considered himself perhaps inferior to the other apostles because he had originally persecuted Christ's followers.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|15:9||1 Cor. 15:9}} In addition, despite the [[Matthew 10|Little Commission of Matthew 10]], the twelve did not limit their mission to solely Jews as [[Cornelius the Centurion]] is widely considered the first Gentile convert and he was converted by Peter, and the [[Great Commission]] of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrected Jesus]] is specifically to "all nations".

===Deaths===

Of the twelve Apostles to hold the title after Matthias' selection, Christian tradition has generally passed down that all but one were martyred, with [[John the Evangelist|John]] surviving into old age. Only the death of [[James, son of Zebedee]] is described in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/who-were-twelve-disciples#james-the-elder|title= Who were the 12 disciples?  |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:5}} says that Judas Iscariot threw the silver he received for betraying Jesus down in the Temple, then went and hanged himself. {{bibleref2|Acts|1:18}} says that he purchased a field, then "falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out".

According to the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]], early Christians (second half of the second century and first half of the third century) believed that only Peter, Paul, and James, son of Zebedee, were martyred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|author-link1=Edward Gibbon|year=1826|chapter=Chapter XVI.

Harper for Collins &amp; Hanney|page=20|quote=27. In the time of Tertullian and Clemens of Alexandria the glory of martyrdom was confined to St. Peter, St. Paul and St. James. It was gradually bestowed on the rest of the apostles by the more recent Greeks, who prudently selected for the theatre of their preaching and sufferings some remote country beyond the limits of the Roman empire. See Mosheim, p. 81. and Tillemont, Memoires Ecclesiastiques, tom. i. part 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder or even all of the claims of martyred apostles do not rely upon historical or biblical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehrmanblog.org/were-the-disciples-martyred-for-believing-the-resurrection/ Were the Disciples Martyred for Believing the Resurrection?

===List of the Twelve Apostles as identified by the Bible===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 15464 Jesus and the 12 apostles in Domus Galileae.JPG|thumb|Jesus and the 12 apostles in [[Domus Galilaeae]], [[Israel]].]]
Each of the four listings of apostles in the New Testament ({{Bibleref2|Mark|3:13–19|9}}, {{Bibleref2|Matthew|10:1–4|9}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|6:12–16|9}}, and {{Bibleref2|Acts|1:13|9}}) indicate that all the apostles were men. The [[canonical gospels]] and the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] give varying names of the twelve apostles. The list in the [[Gospel of Luke]] differs from Matthew and Mark at two points. It lists "Judas the son of James" instead of "Thaddeus". (For more information, see [[Jude the Apostle]].) Unlike the Synoptic Gospels, the [[Gospel of John]] does not offer a formal list of apostles. Although it refers to "the Twelve" ({{Bibleref2|John|6:67–71|9}}), the gospel does not present any elaboration of who these twelve actually were, and the author of the Gospel of John does not mention them all by name. There is also no separation of the terms "apostles" and "disciples" in John.

| [[Andronicus of Pannonia|Andronicus]] and [[Junia (New Testament person)|Junia]] || {{Bibleref2|Rom|16:7}} || Paul states that Andronicus and Junia were "of note among the apostles." This has been traditionally interpreted in one of two ways:
* That Andronicus and Junia were "of note among the apostles," that is, distinguished apostles.&lt;ref name="May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
* That Andronicus and Junia were "well known ''among'' the apostles" meaning "well known ''to'' the apostles"
If the first view is correct then Paul may be referring to a female apostle&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, J. D. and Reed, J. L., ''In Search of Paul'', Harper San Francisco (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;115–116. {{ISBN|978-0-06-051457-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2006"&gt;Ehrman, Bart. ''Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend''. Oxford University Press, US. 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-530013-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; - the Greek name (Iounian) is in the accusative and could be either Junia (a woman) or Junias (a man)&lt;ref name="CBMW"&gt;CBMW [https://cbmw.org/uncategorized/a-female-apostle/ "A Female Apostle?"], June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. Later manuscripts add accents to make it unambiguously Junias, however while "Junia" was a common name, "Junias" was not&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2006" /&gt;, and both options are favoured by different Bible translations.

In the second view, it is believed that Paul is simply making mention of the outstanding character of these two people which was acknowledged by the apostles.

Historically it has been virtually impossible to tell which of the two views were correct. The second view, in recent years, has been defended from a scholarly perspective by Daniel Wallace and Michael Burer.&lt;ref&gt;See Daniel B. Wallace and Michael H. Burer, "Was Junia Really an Apostle?" NTS 47 (2001): 76–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] || {{Bibleref2|1Thes|1:1||1 Thes. 1:1}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|1Thes|2:6}} || Timothy is referred to as an apostle along with Silas and Paul. However, in {{Bibleref2|2Cor|1:1||2 Cor. 1:1}} he is only called a "brother" when Paul refers to himself as "an apostle of Christ". Timothy performs many of the functions of an apostle in the commissioning of Paul in 1st and 2nd Timothy, though in those epistles Paul refers to him as his "son" in the faith.

===Women who followed Jesus===
In Luke (10:38–42), [[Mary, sister of Lazarus]], is contrasted with her sister [[Martha]], who was "cumbered about many things" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen "the better part," that of listening to the master's discourse.  John names her as the "one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair" (11:2).  In Luke, an unidentified "sinner" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet.  In Medieval Catholic folklore, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, was seen as the same as Mary Magdalene.

Luke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve.  From among them he names three women: "[[Mary Magdalene|Mary, called Magdalene]], ... and [[Saint Joanna|Joanna]] the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]], and many others, who provided for them out of their resources" (Luke 8:2-3).  Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the "two men in dazzling clothes".  Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve.  More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers.  There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.

Other gospel writers differ as to which women witness the [[crucifixion]] and witness to the [[resurrection]].  Mark includes [[Mary Jacobe|Mary, the mother of James]] and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]] (not to be confused with [[Salome|Salomé]] the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb.  John includes [[Mary, the wife of Cleopas|Mary the wife of Clopas]] at the crucifixion.

===The Seventy disciples===
{{main|Seventy disciples}}

The "seventy disciples" or "seventy-two disciples" (known in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions as the "Seventy Apostles") were early emissaries of [[Jesus]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|10:1–24}}. According to Luke, the only [[gospel]] in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.

In [[Western Christianity]], they are usually referred to as [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Disciple]: "The disciples, in this disciples, in this context, are not the crowds of believers who flocked around Christ, but a smaller body of His followers. They are commonly identified with the seventy-two (seventy, according to the received Greek text, although several Greek manuscripts mention seventy-two, as does the Vulgate) referred to (Luke 10:1) as having been chosen by Jesus. The names of these disciples are given in several lists (Chronicon Paschale, and Pseudo-Dorotheus in Migne, P.G., XCII, 521-524; 543-545; 1061–1065); but these lists are unfortunately worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100017|title=Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles|work=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the original [[Greek language|Greek words]], both titles are descriptive, as an ''apostle'' is one sent on a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] (the Greek uses the verb form: ''apesteilen'') whereas a ''disciple'' is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words ''apostle'' and ''disciple''.

===Authorship of the Gospels===
{{main|Gospel|Synoptic Gospels}}
{{Also|Authorship of the Bible#Table IV: New Testament}}
{{off topic section}}
The [[Gospel of Matthew]] is anonymous: the author is not named within the text, and the superscription "according to Matthew" was added some time in the 2nd century.{{sfn|Harrington|1991|p=8}}{{Incomplete short citation}}{{sfn|Nolland|2005|p=16}}{{Incomplete short citation}} The tradition that the author was [[Matthew the Apostle]] begins with [[Papias of Hierapolis]] (c.&amp;nbsp;AD 100–140), an early [[bishop]] and [[Apostolic Father]], who is cited by the [[Church historian]] [[Eusebius]] (AD 260–340), as follows: "Matthew collected the oracles [''[[logia]]'': sayings of or about Jesus] in the [[Hebrew language]] [''Hebraïdi dialektōi''], and each one interpreted [''hērmēneusen—''perhaps 'translated'] them as best he could."{{sfn|Turner|2008|pp=15–16}}{{Incomplete short citation}}&lt;ref group="Notes" name="Eusebius"&gt;Eusebius, "History of the Church" 3.39.14–17, c. 325 CE, Greek text 16: "ταῦτα μὲν οὖν ἱστόρηται τῷ Παπίᾳ περὶ τοῦ Μάρκου· περὶ δὲ τοῦ Ματθαῖου ταῦτ’ εἴρηται· Ματθαῖος μὲν οὖν Ἑβραΐδι διαλέκτῳ τὰ λόγια συνετάξατο, ἡρμήνευσεν δ’ αὐτὰ ὡς ἧν δυνατὸς ἕκαστος. Various English translations published, standard reference translation by [[Philip Schaff]] at [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.viii.xxxix.html CCEL]: "[C]oncerning Matthew he [Papias] writes as follows: 'So then(963) Matthew wrote the oracles in the Hebrew language, and every one interpreted them as he was able.'(964)" Online version includes footnotes 963 and 964 by Schaff.&lt;br&gt;[[Irenaeus]] (died c.&amp;nbsp;202 CE) makes a similar comment, possibly also drawing on Papias, in his ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.ii.html Book III, Chapter 1]: "Matthew also issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect". See {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vRvCYSw4DIC|title=Irenaeus' Use of Matthew's Gospel in Adversus Haereses|last=Bingham|first=Dwight Jeffrey|publisher=Peeters Publishers|year=1998|isbn=9789068319644|series=''Traditio exegetica Graeca''|volume=7|location=[[Louvain, Belgium]]|pages=64ff|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Gospel of John]] is anonymous,{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=215}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Christian tradition historically has attributed it to [[John the Apostle]], son of [[Zebedee]] and one of Jesus' [[Twelve Apostles]]. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving [[Johannine epistles]] that commentators treat the four books,{{sfn|Lindars|1990|p=63}}{{Incomplete short citation}} along with the [[Book of Revelation]], as a single corpus of [[Johannine literature]], albeit not necessarily written by the same author.{{refn|group=Notes|{{harvnb|Harris|2006|p=479}}{{Incomplete short citation}}: "Most scholars believe that the same person wrote all three documents but that he is not to be identified with either the apostle John or the author of the Gospel."}}

The [[Gospel of Mark]] was written anonymously.{{sfn|Sanders|1995|pp=63–64}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Early Christian tradition, first attested by [[Papias of Hierapolis]], ascribes it to [[John Mark]], a companion and interpreter of the [[apostle Peter]].{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=155–56}}{{Incomplete short citation}} Hence its author is often called [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], even though most modern scholars are doubtful of the Markan tradition and instead regard the author as unknown.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=36}}{{Incomplete short citation}} It was probably written c. AD 66–70, during [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians in Rome or the Jewish revolt, as suggested by internal references to war in Judea and to persecution.{{sfn|Perkins|1998|p=241}}{{Incomplete short citation}} The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories (Mark 2:1–3:6), [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] discourse (4:1–35), and collections of sayings (although not the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and probably not the [[Q source]]).{{sfn|Boring|2006|pp=13–14}}{{Incomplete short citation}}

According to Church tradition, [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, is believed to have authored the [[Gospel of Luke]], though anonymously written and lacking an author's name; but while this view is still occasionally put forward the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=32}}{{Incomplete short citation}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|pp=172, 235}}{{Incomplete short citation}} The most probable date for its composition is around 80–110 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250–53}}{{Incomplete short citation}}

'''Gloria Jean Watkins''' (born September 25, 1952), better known by her [[pen name]] '''bell hooks''',&lt;ref name="pen-name"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dinitia Smith |title=Tough arbiter on the web has guidance for writers |work=The New York Times |date=September 28, 2006 |page=E3 |quote=But the Chicago Manual says it is not all right to capitalize the name of the writer bell hooks because she insists that it be lower case. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/books/28chic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American author, [[Feminism|feminist]], and [[Activism|social activist]]. The name "bell hooks" is derived from that of her maternal great-grandmother, Bell Blair Hooks.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell, "Inspired Eccentricity: Sarah and Gus Oldham" in Sharon Sloan Fiffer and Steve Fiffer (eds),''Family: American Writers Remember Their Own'', New York: Vintage Books, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;152.{{pb}}
hooks, bell, ''Talking Back'', Routledge, 2014 [1989], p.&amp;nbsp;161.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of hooks' writing has been the [[intersectionality]] of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[capitalism]], and [[gender]], and what she describes as their ability to produce and perpetuate systems of [[oppression]] and class domination. She has published over 30 books and numerous scholarly articles, appeared in [[documentary film]]s, and participated in public lectures. She has addressed race, class, and gender in education, art, history, [[sexuality]], mass media, and [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/He-Ho/Hooks-Bell.html|title=Bell Hooks Biography - life, childhood, children, name, school, mother, young, book, information, born|website=www.notablebiographies.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
hooks was born in [[Hopkinsville]], a small, segregated town in [[Kentucky]], to a working-class family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/He-Ho/Hooks-Bell.html|title=Bell Hooks Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Veodis Watkins, was a custodian and her mother, [[Rosa Bell Watkins]], was a homemaker. She had five sisters and one brother. An avid reader, she was educated in [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], and wrote of great adversities when making the transition to an [[Racial integration|integrated]] school, where teachers and students were predominantly white. She later graduated from [[Hopkinsville High School]] in [[Hopkinsville]], [[Kentucky]]. She obtained her BA in English from [[Stanford University]] in 1973, and her [[Master of Arts|MA]] in English from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Significant Contemporary American Feminists: A Biographical Sourcebook|last=Scanlon|first=Jennifer|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0313301254|location=Westport, CT|pages=125–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, after several years of teaching and writing, she completed her doctorate in literature at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], with a [[dissertation]] on author [[Toni Morrison]].

===Career===
hooks' teaching career began in 1976 as an English professor and senior lecturer in Ethnic Studies at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Gary L. |last1=Anderson |first2= Kathryn G|last2=Anderson|title=hooks, bell (1952– )|date=2007|publisher=SAGE Reference|pages=704–706|edition=vol. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her three years there, Golemics, a Los Angeles publisher, released her first published work, a [[chapbook]] of poems titled "[[And There We Wept]]" (1978), written under her pen name, "bell hooks". She adopted her maternal great-grandmother's name as a pen name because her great-grandmother "was known for her snappy and bold tongue, which [she] greatly admired". She put the name in lowercase letters "to distinguish [herself from] her great-grandmother." She said that her unconventional lowercasing of her name signifies what is most important is her works: the "substance of books, not who I am."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=bell hooks Speaks Up | author=Heather Williams | website=The Sandspur (2/10/06) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She taught at several post-secondary institutions in the early 1980s and 1990s, including the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[San Francisco State University]], [[Yale]], [[Oberlin College]] and [[City College of New York]].&lt;ref name="gale"&gt;"bell hooks." Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2010. Literature Resource Center. Accessed 12 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[South End Press]] published her first major work, ''[[Ain't I a Woman? (book)|Ain't I a Woman?: Black Women and Feminism]]'' in 1981, though it was written years earlier, while she was an undergraduate student.&lt;ref&gt;''Teaching to Transgress'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades since its publication, ''Ain't I a Woman?'' has gained widespread recognition as an influential contribution to feminist thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Scholar]] shows 894 citations of ''Ain't I a Woman'' (as of August 30, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ain't I a Woman?'' examines several recurring themes in her later work: the historical impact of sexism and racism on black women, devaluation of black womanhood, media roles and portrayal, the education system, the idea of a [[White supremacy|white-supremacist]]-[[Capitalism|capitalist]]-[[patriarchy]], the [[marginalization]] of black women, and the disregard for issues of race and class within feminism. Since the publication of ''Ain't I a Woman?'', she has become eminent as a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] political thinker and [[cultural critic]]. She targets and appeals to a broad audience by presenting her work in a variety of media using various writing and speaking styles. As well as having written books, she has published in numerous scholarly and mainstream magazines, lectures at widely accessible venues, and appears in various documentaries.[[File:bellhooks.jpg|thumb|bell hooks in 2009|left|247x247px]]She is frequently cited by feminists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Book Review: Feminism is for Everybody by bell hooks | url=http://underneathabook.blogspot.com/2012/02/book-review-feminism-is-for-everybody.html | accessdate =2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=10 Years of "Feminism is for Everybody" | url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/09/07/10-years-of-feminism-is-for-everybody/ | website=Ms. Magazine Blog (2010 September 7) | accessdate =2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Feminism is for Everybody: Further Discussion | url=http://feministclassics.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/feminism-is-for-everybody-further-discussion/ | accessdate =2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; as having provided the best solution to the difficulty of defining something as diverse as "feminism", addressing the problem that if feminism can mean everything, it means nothing. She asserts an answer to the question "what is feminism?" that she says is "rooted in neither fear nor fantasy... 'Feminism is a movement to end [[sexism]], sexist exploitation and oppression{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;bell hooks, ''Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics'', Pluto Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has published more than 30 books, ranging in topics from black men, [[patriarchy]], and [[masculinity]] to self-help, engaged [[pedagogy]] to personal [[memoirs]], and sexuality (in regards to feminism and politics of aesthetic/[[visual culture]]). A prevalent theme in her most recent writing is the community and communion, the ability of loving communities to overcome race, class, and gender inequalities. In three conventional books and four children's books, she suggests that communication and literacy (the ability to read, write, and think critically) are crucial to developing healthy communities and relationships that are not marred by race, class, or gender inequalities.

She has held positions as Professor of [[African-American studies|African-American Studies]] and English at [[Yale University]], Associate Professor of [[Women's studies|Women's Studies]] and American Literature at [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], Ohio, and as Distinguished Lecturer of English Literature at the [[City College of New York]].

In 2002, hooks gave a [[commencement speech]] at [[Southwestern University]]. Eschewing the congratulatory mode of traditional commencement speeches, she spoke against what she saw as government-sanctioned violence and oppression, and admonished students who she believed went along with such practices. This was followed by a controversy described in the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' after an "irate Arizonian"&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web | title=bell hooks Digs In | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2002-05-24/93217/ | author=Lauri Apple | website=The Austin Chronicle (May 24, 2002) | accessdate =December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; had criticized the speech in a letter to the editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Postmarks - Southwestern Graduation Debacle | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/columns/2002-05-24/93184/ | website=The Austin Chronicle (May 24, 2002) | accessdate =December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper reported that many in the audience booed the speech, though "several graduates passed over the provost to shake her hand or give her a hug".&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt;

In 2004, she joined [[Berea College]] in [[Berea, Kentucky|Berea]], Kentucky, as Distinguished Professor in Residence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berea.edu/appalachiancenter/people/default.asp Berea.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528042644/http://www.berea.edu/appalachiancenter/people/default.asp |date=May 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where she participated in a weekly feminist discussion group, "Monday Night Feminism"; a luncheon lecture series, "Peanut Butter and Gender"; and a seminar, "Building Beloved Community: The Practice of Impartial Love".

Her 2008 book, ''belonging: a culture of place'', includes a candid interview with author [[Wendell Berry]] as well as a discussion of her move back to [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/belonging-a-culture-of-place/oclc/228676700&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Belonging: a culture of place|last=Hooks|first=bell|date=2009-01-01|isbn=9780415968157|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has undertaken three scholar-in-residences at [[The New School]]. Mostly recently she did one for a week in October 2014. She engaged in public dialogues with [[Gloria Steinem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vagianos|first1=Alanna|title=Gloria Steinem On The Great Part Of Feminism: 'We Have Each Other's Backs'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/07/gloria-steinem-bell-hooks-the-new-school_n_5945588.html|accessdate=October 11, 2014|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laverne Cox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scherker|first1=Amanda|title=Laverne Cox And bell hooks Talk How To Survive The Patriarchy|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/08/bell-hooks-laverne-cox_n_5952780.html?ir=Women|accessdate=October 11, 2014|date=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cornel West]].

==Influences==
Those who have influenced hooks include African-American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and feminist [[Sojourner Truth]] (whose speech ''Ain't I a Woman?'' inspired her first major work), Brazilian educator [[Paulo Freire]] (whose perspectives on education she embraces in her theory of engaged pedagogy), Peruvian [[theologian]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], psychologist [[Erich Fromm]], playwright [[Lorraine Hansberry]], [[Buddhist]] monk [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], African-American writer [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], Guyanese historian [[Walter Rodney]], African-American [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] leader [[Malcolm X]], and African-American [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] (who addresses how the strength of love unites communities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iapl.info/CONFERENCE_HISTORY/IAPL_2001/iapl_2001_keynote_speaker.htm Notes on IAPL 2001 Keynote Speaker, bell hooks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131175411/http://www.iapl.info/CONFERENCE_HISTORY/IAPL_2001/iapl_2001_keynote_speaker.htm |date=January 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1844 Building a Community of Love, bell hooks &amp; Thich Nhat Hanh]&lt;/ref&gt; hooks says of Martin Luther King Jr.'s notion of a beloved community, "He had a profound awareness that the people involved in oppressive institutions will not change from the logics and practices of domination without engagement with those who are striving for a better way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Beloved Community: A Conversation between bell hooks and George Brosi|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/appalachian_heritage/v040/40.4.brosi03.html|journal = Appalachian Heritage|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1940-5081|pages = 76–86|volume = 40|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/aph.2012.0109|first = George|last = Brosi|first2 = Bell|last2 = Hooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom'' ==
In her 1994 book ''Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom,'' hooks writes about a transgressive approach in education where educators can teach students to "transgress" against racial, sexual, and class boundaries in order to achieve the gift of freedom. To educate as the practice of freedom, bell hooks describes it as "a way of teaching in which anyone can learn."&lt;ref name="1952- 11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/877868009|title=Teaching to transgress : education as the practice of freedom|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|isbn=9781135200015|location=New York|pages=11|oclc=877868009|date=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks combines her practical knowledge and personal experiences of the classroom with feminist thinking and critical pedagogy. Hooks investigates the classroom as a source of constraint but also a potential source of liberation. She argues that teachers' use of control and power over students dulls the students' enthusiasm and teaches obedience to authority, "confin[ing] each pupil to a rote, assembly-line approach to learning."&lt;ref&gt;(hooks, ''Teaching to Transgress'' 12)&lt;/ref&gt; She advocates that universities should encourage students and teachers to transgress, and seeks ways to use collaboration to make learning more relaxing and exciting. She describes teaching as a performative act and teachers as catalysts that invite everyone to become more engaged and activated. Performative aspect of learning "offers the space for change, invention, spontaneous shifts, that can serve as a catalyst drawing out the unique elements in each classroom."&lt;ref name="1952- 11"/&gt; Hooks also dedicated a chapter of the book to [[Paulo Freire]], written in a form of a playful dialogue between herself, Gloria Watkins and her writing voice, bell hooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30668295|title=Teaching to transgress : education as the practice of freedom|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415908085|location=New York|pages=45–59|oclc=30668295}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last chapter of the book, hooks raised the critical question of eros or the erotic in classrooms environment. According to hooks, eros and the erotics do not need to be denied for learning to take place. She argues that one of the central tenets of [[feminist pedagogy]] has been to subvert the [[Mind–body dualism|mind-body dualism]] and allow oneself as a teacher to be whole in the classroom, and as a consequence wholehearted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30668295|title=Teaching to transgress : education as the practice of freedom|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415908085|location=New York|pages=193|oclc=30668295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope'' ==
In 2004, ten years after the success of Teaching to Transgress, bell hooks published ''Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope''. In this book, hooks offers advice about how to continue to make the classroom a place that is life-sustaining and mind expanding, a place of liberating mutuality where teacher and student together work in partnership.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/846494699|title=Teaching community : a pedagogy of hope|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135457921|location=New York|pages=XV|oclc=846494699}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks writes that education as a practice of freedom enable us to confront feelings of loss and restore our sense of connections and consequently teaches us how to create community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Hooks locates hope in places of struggle where she witnessed individuals positively transforming their lives and the world around them. For hooks educating is always a vocation rooted in hopefulness.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==''All About Love: New Visions''==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|{{BLP sources section|date=February 2017}}
{{BLP primary sources|section|date=April 2018}}}}
After many disputes with ex-boyfriends about the nature of love, bell hooks published ''[[All About Love: New Visions]]'' in 2000. She explains how her past two long-term boyfriends were foiled by "patriarchal thinking" and sexist gender roles, so neither relationship ever really had a chance. She continuously wanted to recommend a book for the men to read, but could not find one that would clearly make her point to support her argument. For this reason, she decided to write her own, which would go into depth about her true feelings towards love.
	
In this book, hooks combines her personal life experiences, along with philosophical and psychological ideas, to shape her thesis and discuss her main concepts. She criticizes the way in which love is used in today's society. To further explain, how we use the word without much meaning, when referring to how much we like or enjoy our favorite ice cream, color, or game. Hooks is very disturbed by the fact that our culture has lost the true meaning of love, and believes it is because we have no shared definition.&lt;ref name="hooks 2001 4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the first chapter of her book primarily focuses on what she thinks the definition of love is, which she explains includes components such as care, affection, trust, respect, honesty, communication, and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She proposes that if we all came to the agreement that love is a verb rather than a noun, then we would all be happier.&lt;ref name="hooks 2001 4"/&gt; Hooks believes love is more of an interactive process. It is not about what we just feel, but more about what we do. She states, "So many people think that it's enough to say what they feel, even if their actions do not correspond to what they are feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/chat/transcripts/2000/2/hooks/index.html|title=CNN - bell hooks|website=edition.cnn.com|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell hooks strongly clarifies why society needs to adopt a universal definition of love.

bell hooks began her book with a series of spiritual messages, which include biblical verses to support her definition of love. She claims that a standard definition of love must include spiritual growth for one's self and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she refers to biblical messages, she does not promote religion in her book; on the contrary, she encourages spiritual thinking. Hooks identifies flaws with relationships nowadays since there is a loose understanding about love. She shares personal experiences about fearing rejection and emotional pain. As a result, she acknowledges lacking full commitment and expressing vulnerability because of the fear of not receiving those things in return, so giving care and affection are the minimal expectations she had in her relationships. However, those love components were not enough. Hooks introduces the necessity of practicing self-love and care to sustain healthy relationship with a concrete understanding of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, this book sheds some light on what hooks sees as the modern day abandonment of love and what it means for people of today to experience love. One argument she proposes is how love cannot exist in the middle of a power struggle. Hooks goes as far as to present a number of problems she finds with our modern ideals of love and proposes their possible solutions. She includes the propositions of full reconstruction and transformation of modern-day love based on "affection, respect, recognition, commitment, trust and care" (Nonfiction Book Review). Hooks also points out what she sees to be the roots of the problems regarding modern day love, those being gender stereotypes, domination, control, ego, and aggression (Nonfiction Book Review).

Another argument hooks discusses is one in which she describes how starting from a very young age, boys and girls are constantly being knocked down and told to fit into the tiny boxes of characteristics that are expected of them. Hooks points out that the boy is denied his right to show, or even have, any true feelings. To further explain, she uses men in the American culture as an example, and describes how they have been socialized to mistrust the value and power of love. While the girl is taught that the most important thing she can do is change herself and her own feelings, with the hopes of attracting and pleasing everyone else. These unfair expectations lead boys and girls to grow up into men and women who are convinced that lies are the way to go, and no one should be showing their truest feelings to each other. This leads to the paradox hooks points out because in order to have a functional, and healthy loving relationship, honesty is a natural requirement. In bell hooks's own words, "Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another central argument in hooks's ''All About Love'' is the way in which it is almost impossible for women to find happiness in what she sees as a brutal culture where men are taught to worry more about sexual satisfaction and performance than actually loving someone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reality pointed out by hooks, paired with the fact that women focus so strongly on obtaining themselves a partner, leads to most relationships being completely one sided. In this case, the men are emotionally satisfied, and the women are left without any true happiness. Hooks points out that despite these evident problems in modern-day love culture, love can be revived, and this is what she is arguing throughout her book.

Bell hooks wrote this book to inform the world how we can change the way we think about love, our culture, and one another. She teaches us ways to love in a face of a planet of love-lessness. Her New Visions demonstrate how love is possible, and stress that all love is important—romantic, friendship, our love of strangers, and community.

==''Feminist Theory''==
Noting a lack of diverse voices in popular [[feminist theory]], bell hooks published the book ''[[Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center]]'' in 1984. In this book, she argues that those voices have been marginalized, and states: "To be in the margin is to be part of the whole but outside the main body."&lt;ref&gt;(hooks, ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', xvi)&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks argued that if feminism seeks to make women equal to men, then it is impossible because in Western society, not all men are equal. She claimed, "Women in lower class and poor groups, particularly those who are non-white, would not have defined [[women's liberation]] as women gaining social equality with men since they are continually reminded in their everyday lives that all women do not share a common social status."&lt;ref&gt;(hooks, ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'')&lt;/ref&gt;

She used the work as a platform to offer a new, more inclusive feminist theory. Her theory encouraged the long-standing idea of sisterhood but advocated for women to acknowledge their differences while still accepting each other. Hooks challenged feminists to consider gender's relation to race, class, and sex, a concept known as [[intersectionality]]. She also argues for the importance of male involvement in the equality movement, stating that, in order for change to occur, men must do their part. Hooks also calls for a restructuring of the cultural framework of power, one that does not find oppression of others necessary.&lt;ref&gt;(hooks,92)&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of this restructuring involves allowing men into the feminist movement, so that there is not a separationist ideology, so much as an incorporating camaraderie. Additionally, she shows great appreciation for the movement away from feminist thought as led by bourgeois white women, and towards a multidimensional gathering of both genders to fight for the raising up of women. This shifts the original focus of feminism away from victimization, and towards harboring understanding, appreciation, and tolerance for all genders and sexes so that all are in control of their own destinies, uncontrolled by patriarchal, capitalist tyrants.&lt;ref&gt;(hooks,74)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another part of restructuring the movement comes from education; bell hooks points out that there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer like the rest of the masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.

In "Rethinking The Nature of Work", bell hooks goes beyond discussing work and raises a pertinent question that feminists may need to ask themselves. "Many Women active in feminist movement do not have radical political perspectives and are unwilling to face these realities, especially when they, as individuals, gain economic self-sufficiency within the existing structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminist Theory : From Margin to Center|last = hooks|first = bell|publisher = Pluto Press|year = 1984|isbn = 978-0-89608-614-2|location = London|pages = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media theory===
In her book ''Reel to Real'', hooks discusses the effect that movies have on any given individual, with specific emphasis on the black female spectator. She argues that, although we know that movies are not real life, "no matter how sophisticated our strategies of critique and intervention, [we] are usually seduced, at least for a time, by the images we see on the screen. They have power over us, and we have no power over them."{{sfn|hooks|1996}}

Hooks focuses on problematic racial representations. Bell hooks has written a number of essays and articles, and in ''Reel to Real'' she describes her experiences growing up watching mainstream movies as well as engaging in the media. Hooks believes that to engage in film was to engage in the negation of black female representation in the media.{{sfn|hooks|1996}} hooks states, "Representation is the 'hot' issue right now because it's a major realm of power for any system of domination. We keep coming back to the question of representation because identity is always about representation".{{sfn|hooks|1996}}

===Film theory===
Asserting that for her, the "gaze" had always been political, bell hooks explains how growing up she began to grow curious as to how much influence black parents were given as a result of black slaves being punished for looking at their white owners. She wondered how much had been absorbed and carried on through the generations to shift not only parenting, but spectatorship as well.{{sfn|hooks|1996}} In what is described as an "oppositional gaze", hooks explains the sometimes overwhelming desire to look and thus stating that by looking, actually declares a defiantly, "Not only will I stare, I want my look to change reality."{{sfn|hooks|1996}} The cinema became a place of critical analysis and a place where black men could view narratives starring white women without the risk of being lynched or murdered for being perceived as a threat.{{sfn|hooks|1996}}

Although much of the criticism aimed at hooks is in regard to politics, liberals and conservatives alike have critiqued her informal style of writing.{{Original research inline|date=May 2017}} After the release of her first book, ''Ain't I a Woman: Black Women in Feminism'', hooks's writing was criticized as "ahistorical [and] unscholarly"; many{{Who|date=May 2017}} complained about the absence of footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell-Scott|first=Patricia|title=The Centrality of Marginality|journal=The Women's Review of Books|date=1985|volume=2|issue=5|page=3|doi=10.2307/4019632|jstor=4019632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks does not provide a bibliography for any of her work, making it difficult to find the editors and publication information for the pieces listed under the "notes" section of her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettis|first=Joyce|title=A Review of Feminist Theory: From Margin To Center|journal=Journal of Women in Culture and Society|date=1986|volume=11|issue=4|pages=788–789|doi=10.1086/494279}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In "Theory as Liberatory Practice," hooks explains that her lack of conventional academic format was "motivated by the desire to be inclusive, to reach as many readers as possible in as many different locations as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haley|first=Shelly|title=Practicing Freedom|journal=The Women's Review of Books|date=1995|volume=7|issue=6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Remembered Rapture: The Writer at Work; By bell hooks; Mother to Mother," Nicole Abraham criticizes hooks's unconventional format rationalization. Abraham suggests that, if her rationalization for not providing footnotes and bibliographic information in her writing is that it will help her reach a broader (presumably a less academic) audience, hooks either assumes the average person has "no real interest or knowledge about who really wrote what ideas and where we can look for more thoughts on similar subjects" or "she mean[s] that we are lazy readers who have not the sophistication to grapple with the complications of an endnote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Nicole|title=Remembered Rapture: The Writer at Work; by bell hooks; Mother to Mother; by Sindiwe Magona|journal=Southern African Feminist Review|date=1999|volume=3|issue=2|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:STATUE OF BLONDELL NEAR DURNSTEIN IN THE WACHAU VALLEY.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Statue of Blondel near [[Durnstein]]]]
'''Blondel de Nesle''' – either '''Jean I of Nesle''' (c. 1155 – 1202) or his son '''Jean II of Nesle''' (died 1241) – was a [[France|French]] [[trouvère]].

The name 'Blondel de Nesle' is attached to twenty-four or twenty-five courtly songs. He was identified in 1942, by [[Holger Dyggve]], as Jean II of Nesle (near [[Amiens]]), who was nicknamed 'Blondel' for his long blond hair. He married at the time of his father's death in 1202, and that same year, went on the [[Fourth Crusade]]; he later fought in the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. However, in 1994, [[Yvan Lepage]] suggested that the poet may have been Jean I, father of Jean II, who was Lord of Nesle from 1180 to 1202; this Jean took part in the [[Third Crusade]], which may explain the subsequent legend linking him with [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]].

If the works are correctly identified and dated, he was a significant influence on his European contemporaries, who made much use of his melodies. (The melody of "L'amours dont sui espris" is used in ''[[Carmina Burana]]'', for the song "Procurans Odium"). His works are fairly conventional, and several have been recorded in modern times.

==Legend==
By 1260, Blondel's name had become attached to a legend in the highly fictionalised ''Récits d'un Ménestrel de Reims''; this claimed that, after King Richard of England was arrested and held for ransom in 1192, he was found by the [[minstrel]] Blondel, whom he saw from his window, and to whom he sang a verse of a song they both knew. Later versions of the story related that Blondel went from castle to castle, singing a particular song that only he and Richard knew, and that the imprisoned Richard replied with the second verse – thus identifying where he was imprisoned. Then, Blondel either aided the king's escape or reported his position back to his friends. Blondel finally found Richard at [[Dürnstein]]; in fact, there was no mystery about Richard's location which was widely publicized by his ransomers.

'Blondel' is a common [[surname]] on the [[Channel Island]] of [[Guernsey]]. It is recorded that King Richard granted a [[fief]] on the island to a [[vassal]] named Blondel, but it remains uncertain as to whether this has any connection with the legend, or whether the legend has any connection with the known trouvère.

==Modern versions==
The legend of Blondel did not achieve great popularity in the [[Middle Ages]], but was taken up in the late eighteenth century. It was the basis of [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Richard Coeur-de-lion (opera)|Richard Coeur-de-lion]]'' (1784). In 1822, [[Eleanor Anne Porden]] used the legend in her epic poem ''Cœur De Lion'': in her version, Blondel is really Richard's wife, [[Berengaria of Navarre]], in disguise.

A poem by Johann Gabriel Seidl titled Blondel's Lied was set to music by [[Robert Schumann]].

Throughout the nineteenth century, the legend became a key component in the mythology surrounding Richard. Some later twentieth century novelists,  placed a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] interpretation on his supposed relationship with the king. [[Norah Lofts]] in ''The Lute Player'' (1951) has Richard make a (rather gentlemanly ) approach to Blondel, which is refused, Blondel's  heart and devotion being entirely given to Richard's neglected wife Berengaria. 

In the 1962–63 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] British television series ''[[Richard the Lionheart (TV series)|Richard the Lionheart]]'', Blondel was a semi-regular character, played by [[Iain Gregory]].

The English acoustic band of the early 1970s, [[Amazing Blondel]], was named after Blondel.

The legend inspired ''[[Blondel (musical)|Blondel]]'', a 1983 [[musical theater|musical]] by [[Stephen Oliver (composer)|Stephen Oliver]] and [[Tim Rice]]. The play, a comedic [[rock opera]], is set during the period of the [[Third Crusade]]. Blondel is portrayed as a frustrated artist, seeking fame as a composer and performer, even as he searches for his imprisoned monarch. Rice collaborated with director [[Patrick Wilde]] to revive the show at the Pleasance Theatre in London in 2006.

Heraldic '''[[Label (heraldry)|labels]]''' are used to [[cadency|differentiate]] the personal [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of members of the [[royal family of the United Kingdom]] from that of the monarch and from each other.  In the Gallo-British heraldic tradition, cadency marks have been available to "difference" the arms of a son from those of his father, and the arms of brothers from each other, and traditionally this was often done when it was considered important for each man to have a distinctive individual coat of arms and/or to differentiate the arms of the head of a house from junior members of the family.  This was especially important in the case of arms of sovereignty: to use the undifferenced arms of a kingdom is to assert a claim to the throne. Therefore, in the English royal family, cadency marks were used from the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], typically a label or bordure alluding to the arms of the bearer's mother or wife. After about 1340, when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] made a claim to the throne of France, a blue label did not contrast sufficiently with the blue field of the French quarter of the royal arms; accordingly most royal cadets used labels [[argent]]: that of the heir apparent was plain, and all others were charged.&lt;ref&gt;''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'' by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies (1909), p.&amp;nbsp;494.  (Online texts at https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft or http://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~bprince/hr/foxdavies/index.htm .)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bordures of various tinctures continued to be used into the 15th century.

==The label==
{{Main|Label (heraldry)}}
In the ordinary system of differences a label of three points (which has also been termed a label with three files) is the distinction of the eldest son during the lifetime of his father. In the oldest rolls of arms the labels are all of five points; but labels of three points were at an early period used interchangeably. Besides being used as mere temporary marks of cadency, labels are also employed as permanent distinctions, borne (like any other charge) by every member of some particular branches of certain families. Labels are the principal cadency marks used in certain royal families.  In the British royal family, all labels are ''[[argent]]'' (white). The sons and daughters of the sovereign all bear labels of three points argent; that of the [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|arms of the Prince of Wales]] is plain, but all others are charged. Further descendants of princes bear labels of five points charged. All such differences should be borne on the arms, crest, and supporters.

The system of a special mark for difference for each member of the family goes back to the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], whose successor, as a prince, placed such a mark on the shield of England. Since 1340 this label has almost always been white, and overlaid with small figures, or charges, such as red [[St George's cross|crosses of St George]].&lt;ref name="Neubecker"&gt;[[Ottfried Neubecker]] &amp; [[John Brooke-Little]]: ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'' (1997). {{ISBN|0-316-64141-3}}. "Signs of Differencing" (pp. 96–97).&lt;/ref&gt; This red cross represents England and its [[patron saint]], and was first borne by Richard of Bordeaux (future king [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]) before the death of his father [[Edward, the Black Prince]] in 1376. Other charges used:
* A '''blue anchor''', a symbol of hope, or of naval service, as borne by several Dukes of York.
* The '''Crown''' of England (sometimes called the Imperial or [[St Edward's Crown]]) borne by the abdicated king the [[Duke of Windsor]], which is as unusual as the occurrence itself.
* '''[[Rose (symbolism)|Roses]]''': the [[Tudor Rose]] (combined red and white) has been used as an English [[Royal Supporters of England|royal badge]] since 1485.
* Red '''[[heart (symbol)|hearts]]''' may allude to the arms of [[Lüneburg]] (part of the Hanoverian arms) or – for the descendants of Edward VII and Alexandra of Denmark – to the [[coat of arms of Denmark]].
* The blue '''[[fleur-de-lis]]''' appears amongst the Royal Badges in England of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]].
* The '''[[thistle#Heraldry|thistle]]''' is an ancient badge of [[Scotland]].
* The '''escallop shell''' was traditionally a token of pilgrimage on the [[Way of St James]].  The shell in the labels of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Prince Harry]] alludes to their [[Diana, Princess of Wales|mother's Spencer]] arms.
* The '''bee''' is a canting charge in the label of [[Princess Beatrice of York]].
* The '''[[trefoil]]''' is a badge of Ireland, associated with [[St Patrick]], who used it to illustrate the [[doctrine of the Trinity]].

The '''Cambridge Spy Ring''' was a ring of [[espionage|spies]] in the [[United Kingdom]], who passed information to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]] and was active at least into the early 1950s. None were ever prosecuted for spying. The number and membership of the ring emerged slowly from the 1950s onwards. As far as the general public was concerned, this started with the sudden flight of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] ([[cryptonym]]: Homer) and [[Guy Burgess]] (cryptonym: Hicks) to the Soviet Union in 1951. Suspicion immediately fell on [[Kim Philby]] (cryptonym: Stanley), but he did not follow them until 1963. [[Anthony Blunt]] (cryptonyms: Tony, Johnson) and [[John Cairncross]] (cryptonym: Liszt) confessed to British intelligence but this remained secret for many years, until 1979 in the case of Blunt. It therefore took several years for the usual modern name to evolve through the '''Cambridge Four''' to the '''Cambridge Five'''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In the innermost circles of the KGB, they were supposedly known as the '''Magnificent Five'''.

The term "Cambridge" refers to the recruitment of the group during their education at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the 1930s. Debate surrounds the exact timing of their recruitment by [[KGB|Soviet intelligence]]; Anthony Blunt claimed that they were not recruited as agents until they had graduated. Blunt, an [[Honorary Fellow]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], was several years older than Burgess, Maclean, and Philby; he acted as a talent-spotter and recruiter for most of the group save Burgess.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-fourth-man-speaks-last-testimony-of-anthony-blunt-1757483.html The fourth man speaks: Last testimony of Anthony Blunt] ''The Independent'' McSmith, Andy. 23 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the five were convinced that the [[Marxism–Leninism]] of [[Soviet Communism]] was the best available political system, and especially the best defence against the rise of [[fascism]]. All pursued successful careers in branches of the British government. They passed large amounts of intelligence to the Soviet Union, so much so that the KGB became suspicious that at least some of it was false. Perhaps as important as the intelligence they passed was the demoralizing effect to the [[The Establishment|British Establishment]] of their slow unmasking, and the mistrust in British security this caused in the United States. 

Many others have also been accused of membership in the Cambridge ring. Blunt, Burgess and Cairncross were all members of the [[Cambridge Apostles]], an exclusive and prestigious society based at Trinity and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] Colleges. Other Apostles accused of having spied for the Soviets include [[Michael Straight]] and [[Guy Liddell]].

==Membership==

===Maclean and Burgess===
All five were active during [[World War II]]. Philby, when he was posted in the British embassy in Washington, DC, after the war, learned that US and British intelligence were searching for a British embassy [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] ([[Codename|cryptonym]] Homer) who was passing information to the [[Soviet Union]], relying on material uncovered by the [[Venona project]].

Philby learned one of the suspects was Maclean. Realizing he had to act fast, he ordered Burgess, who was also on the embassy staff and living with Philby, to warn Maclean in England, where he was serving in the [[Foreign Office]] headquarters. Burgess was recalled from the United States due to "bad behaviour" and upon reaching London, warned Maclean.

In early summer 1951, Burgess and Maclean made international headlines by disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Turner |first=Lauren |date=October 23, 2015 |title=Cambridge spies: Defection of 'drunken' agents shook US confidence |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34596824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their whereabouts were unclear for some time and the suspicion that they had [[defector|defected]] to the Soviet Union turned out to be correct but was not made public until 1956 when the two appeared at a press conference in Moscow.

It was obvious they had been tipped off and Philby quickly became the prime suspect, due to his close relations with Burgess. Though Burgess was not supposed to defect at the same time as Maclean, he went along. It has been claimed that the [[KGB]] ordered Burgess to go to Moscow. This move damaged Philby's reputation, with many speculating that had it not occurred, Philby could have climbed even higher in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]].&lt;ref name=The_Philby_Files&gt;''The Philby Files'' by [[Genrikh Borovik]], edited by [[Phillip Knightley]], published by [[Little, Brown and Company]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philby===
Investigation of Philby found several suspicious matters but nothing for which he could be prosecuted. Nevertheless, he was forced to resign from [[MI6]]. In 1955 he was named in the press, with questions also raised in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], as chief suspect for "the Third Man" and he called a [[news conference|press conference]] to deny the allegation. That same year, Philby was ruled out as a suspect when British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan cleared him of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/933590602|title=Villainy in Western culture : historical archetypes of danger, disorder and death|last=1953-|first=Kendrick, M. Gregory,|isbn=9780786498680|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|oclc=933590602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later 1950s, Philby left the secret service and began working as a [[journalist]] in the [[Middle East]]; both ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine and ''[[The Observer]]'' provided his employment there. MI6 then re-employed him at around the same time, to provide reports from that region.

In 1961, defector [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] provided information which pointed to Philby. An [[MI6]] officer and friend of Philby from his earlier MI6 days, [[John Nicholas Rede Elliott]], was sent in 1963 to interview him in [[Beirut]] and reported that Philby seemed to know he was coming (indicating the presence of yet another [[mole (espionage)|mole]]). Nonetheless, Philby allegedly confessed to Elliott.

Shortly afterwards, apparently fearing he might be abducted in [[Lebanon]], Philby defected to the Soviet Union under cover of night, aboard a Soviet freighter.

===Blunt===
In 1964, MI5 received information from the American [[Michael Whitney Straight]] pointing to Blunt's espionage; the two had known each other at Cambridge some thirty years before and Blunt had tried to recruit Straight as a spy. Straight, who initially agreed, changed his mind afterwards.

Blunt was interrogated by MI5 and confessed in exchange for immunity from prosecution. As he was—by 1964—without access to classified information, he had secretly been granted immunity by the [[Attorney General]], in exchange for revealing everything he knew. [[Peter Wright]], one of Blunt's interrogators, describes in his book ''[[Spycatcher]]'' how Blunt was evasive and only made admissions grudgingly, when confronted with the undeniable.

By 1979, Blunt was publicly accused of being a Soviet agent by [[investigative journalist]] [[Andrew Boyle]], in his book ''Climate of Treason''. In November 1979, [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] admitted to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that Blunt had confessed to being a Soviet spy fifteen years previously.

The term "Five" began to be used in 1961, when [[KGB]] defector [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] named Maclean and Burgess as part of a "Ring of Five", with Philby a 'probable' third, alongside two other agents whom he did not know.

Of all the information provided by Golitsyn, the only item that was ever independently confirmed was the Soviet affiliation of [[John Vassall]]. Vassall was a relatively low-ranking spy who some researchers{{Who|date=December 2013}} believe may have been sacrificed to protect a more senior one.

At the time of Golitsyn's defection, Philby had already been accused in the press and was living in a country with no extradition agreement with Britain. Select members of MI5 and MI6 already knew Philby to be a spy from [[Venona project]] decryptions. Golitsyn also provided other information, such as the claim that [[Harold Wilson]] (then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the United Kingdom) was a KGB agent.

Golitsyn's reliability remains a controversial subject and as such, there is little certainty of the number of agents he assigned to the Cambridge spy ring. To add to the confusion, when Blunt finally confessed, he named several other people{{Who|date=February 2011}} as having been recruited by him.

===John Cairncross===
On the basis of the information provided by Golitsyn, speculation raged for many years as to the identity of the "Fifth Man". The journalistic popularity of this phrase owes something to the unrelated novels ''[[The Third Man]]'' and ''[[The Tenth Man (novel)|The Tenth Man]]'', written by [[Graham Greene]] who, coincidentally, worked with Philby and Cairncross during the Second World War.

[[John Cairncross]] (1913–1995) confessed to spying in 1951 and was publicly accused of being the "fifth man" in 1990. He was also accused by Anthony Blunt during Blunt's confession in 1964. Cairncross is not always considered to have belonged to the 'Ring of Five'. He was a fellow student at Cambridge and a member of the ''Apostles'' with Blunt, therefore present at the recruitment of the others.

{{quotation|The most important agent talent spotted by Blunt was the Fifth Man, the Trinity undergraduate John Cairncross. Together with Philby, Burgess, Blunt and Maclean, he is remembered by the Center (Moscow KGB Headquarters) as one of the Magnificent Five, the ablest group of foreign agents in KGB history. Though Cairncross is the last of the five to be publicly identified, he successfully penetrated a greater variety of the corridors of power and intelligence than any of the other four.|[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Oleg Gordievsky]]|''KGB, The Inside Story''. "Chapter 6: Sigint, Agent Penetration, and the Magnificent Five from Cambridge (1930–39)"}}

This reference suggests the KGB itself recognized Cairncross as the fifth man (found by Gordievsky while doing research on the history of the KGB).

===Additional members===
Many historians now believe the spy ring had more than five members, possibly many more, since three other persons are known to have confessed, several more were nominated in confessions, and [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]] cases have been made against others. Many of the following were likely Soviet spies.&lt;ref&gt;A History of MI5 Christopher Andrew 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Baron Rothschild]] was named by [[Roland Perry]] in his book "The Fifth Man"&lt;ref&gt;Abjorensen, Norman. "Following the Moscow Line", in ''The Sunday Times Canberra'', 22 January 1995.{{pageneeded|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to ''Spycatcher'', Rothschild had been friendly with Burgess as an undergraduate, and had originally owned the lease on a house off Welbeck Street, No. 5 Bentinck Street, where Blunt and Burgess both lived during the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Spycatcher'', p.164.&lt;!--author, publisher, city, year?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was supposedly confirmed by [[Yuri Modin]], the alleged controller of the five, who claimed Cairncross was never part of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Rusbridger, Alan. ''The Guardian'', 10 December 1994.{{pageneeded|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Leo Long was accused by Blunt in 1964. Blunt claimed to have recruited Long to the Communist cause while he{{clarify|date=October 2015|Blunt, or Long?}} was tutor at Cambridge. Long served as an intelligence officer with [[MI14]] from 1940–45, and later with the British element of the [[Allied Control Commission]] in [[Allied-occupied Germany|Occupied Germany]] from 1945-1952.
* [[Guy Liddell]] was an MI5 officer and nearly rose to become director of the service but was passed over because of rumours he was a double agent; he took early retirement from MI5 in 1953 after he was investigated for his personal links to Kim Philby. He was accused of having been the "fifth man" by [[Goronwy Rees]] as part of Rees' confession in 1979. The academic consensus is that he was naïve in his friendships rather than a spy.
* [[ASF Gow|Andrew Gow]]: in his memoirs published in 2012, [[Brian Sewell]] suggested that Gow was the 'fifth man' and spy master of the group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/article3574302.ece "Cambridge don was the spy puppet-master, says Brian Sewell".] ''[[The Times]]''.

See also "character, 10b" in Trumble and Stevenson (2003, 381): "A person portrayed in a novel, a drama, etc; a part played by an actor".&lt;/ref&gt; The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a "fictional" versus "real" character may be made.&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Derived from the [[ancient Greek]] word χαρακτήρ, the English word dates from the [[English Restoration|Restoration]],&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' "character" sense 17.a citing, ''inter alia'', [[John Dryden|Dryden's]] 1679 preface to ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'': "The chief character or Hero in a Tragedy ... ought in prudence to be such a man, who has so much more in him of Virtue than of Vice... If Creon had been the chief character in ''Œdipus''..."&lt;/ref&gt; although it became widely used after its appearance in ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''  in 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34), quotation: {{quotation|[...] is first used in English to denote 'a personality in a novel or a play' in 1749 (''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51/&gt; From this, the sense of "a part played by an [[actor]]" developed.&lt;ref name=Harrison1998p51&gt;Harrison (1998, 51-2) quotation: {{quotation|Its use as 'the sum of the qualities which constitute an individual' is a mC17 development.

A character who stands as a representative of a particular [[Social class|class]] or group of people is known as a type.&lt;ref name=b265&gt;Baldick (2001, 265).&lt;/ref&gt; Types include both [[stock character]]s and those that are more fully [[individual]]ised.&lt;ref name=b265/&gt; The characters in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1891) and [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[Miss Julie]]'' (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the [[social relation]]s of class and [[gender]], such that the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflicts]] between the characters reveal [[Ideology|ideological]] conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 41).&lt;/ref&gt; The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Proxemics|proxemic]]) that it forms with the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Elam (2002, 133).&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often [[Mimesis|miming]] shifts in society and its ideas about human [[individual]]ity, [[self-determination]], and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In [[fiction writing]], authors create dynamic characters by many methods.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt; Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation, or are created from scratch as a matter of expediency.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiBattista"/&gt;

==Types==

===Round vs. flat=== &lt;!-- Characterization links here. --&gt;
In his book ''Aspects of the Novel'', [[E. M. Forster]] defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: '''flat''' characters and '''round''' characters.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Michael J|author2=Patrick D. Murphy|title=Essentials of the theory of fiction|publisher=Duke University Press, 1996|edition=2|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8223-1823-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=E.M.|title=Aspects of the Novel|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Sue]]s are characters mainly appearing in [[fan fiction]]. They are virtually devoid of flaws,&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lucy Bennett, Paul Booth|title=Seeing Fans: Representations of Fandom in Media and Popular Culture|isbn =1501318470|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|year=2016|page=160|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydwuDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore considered flat characters.

===Dynamic vs. static===
'''Dynamic''' characters are those that change over the course of the story, while '''static''' characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular static character in literature is [[Sherlock Holmes]]; an example of a dynamic character in literature is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]].

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;The TV Writer's Workbook: A Creative Approach To Television Scripts [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YeCet_B_-IC&amp;pg=PA40 p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones. 

A [[recurring character]] often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run.&lt;ref name="Crafty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Alex |title=Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year= 2006 |isbn=0-8050-8028-7 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest character is one which acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Greg M. Smith, ''Beautiful TV: The Art and Argument of Ally McBeal'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA147 p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&amp;pg=PA151 p. 151]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes a guest character may gain popularity and turn into a regular one.&lt;ref&gt;David Kukoff, ''Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9zj0AqB6bUC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical analysis==
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

In the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), the [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] deduces that character (''[[ethos]]'') is one of six qualitative parts of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] and one of the three objects that it [[Mimesis|represents]] (1450a12).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8). Aristotle defines the six qualitative elements of tragedy as "plot, character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and song" (1450a10); the three objects are plot (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]''), character (''[[ethos]]''), and reasoning (''[[dianoia]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5).&lt;ref name=j984&gt;Janko (1987, 9, 84).&lt;/ref&gt; He defines character as "that which reveals [[Decision making|decision]], of whatever sort" (1450b8).&lt;ref name=j984/&gt; It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain "characters" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the [[Ethics|ethical]] dispositions of those performing the action clear.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle writes: "Again, without action a tragedy cannot exist, but without characters it may. For the tragedies of most recent [poets] lack character, and in general there are many such poets" (1450a24-25); see Janko (1987, 9, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; If, in speeches, the speaker "decides or avoids nothing at all", then those speeches "do not have character" (1450b9—11).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle argues for the primacy of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'') over character (''[[ethos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Aston and Savona (1991, 34) and Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions" (1450a15-23).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: "the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons" by producing "hymns and praise-poems", while "ordinary people represented those of inferior ones" by "composing invectives" (1448b20—1449a5).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 5). This distinction, Aristotle argues, arises from two causes that are natural and common to all humans—the delight taken in experiencing representations and the way in which we learn through imitation (1448b4—19); see Janko (1987, 4—5).&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with [[epic poetry]], is "a representation of serious people" (1449b9—10), while [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] is "a representation of people who are rather inferior" (1449a32—33).&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 6—7). Aristotle specifies that comedy does not represent all kinds of ugliness and vice, but only that which is laughable (1449a32—1449a37).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' (which may or may not be by Aristotle), [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is defined as involving three types of characters: the [[buffoon]] (''[[bômolochus]]''), the [[Irony|ironist]] (''[[eirôn]]''), and the [[imposter]] or boaster (''[[alazôn]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; All three are central to [[Aristophanes]]' "[[old comedy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Janko (1987, 170).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] comic playwright [[Plautus]] wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic [[genre]]s was well established.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'' begins with a [[prologue]] in which [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amphritruo'', line 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

===Television===
*[[B. A. Baracus]] is afraid of flying: ''[[The A-Team]]''
*[[Homer Simpson]] is an alcoholic, not too bright and prone to reckless choices: ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Philip J. Fry]] (usually) has a severe lack of intelligence: ''[[Futurama]]''
*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''
*[[Mr. Spock]] relies heavily on logic and suppresses his more human emotions: ''[[Star Trek]]''

*[[Aang]] is too carefree and initially attempts to run from his responsibilities rather than face them: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

A '''Ciguapa''' (pronounced see-GWAH-pah) is a mythological creature of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] and [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] folklore. They are commonly described as having human female form with brown or dark blue skin, backward facing feet, and very long manes of smooth, glossy hair that covers their otherwise naked bodies. They supposedly inhabit the high mountains of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.

== Overview ==
These creatures have nocturnal habits. Also, due to the position of their feet, one can never quite tell from which direction the beings are moving from by looking at their footprints. Some people believe that they bring death, and it is said that one should not look them in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Liza Phoenix| url=http://www.lizaphoenix.com/encyclopedia/ciguapa.shtml| title= Ciguapa| publisher= lizaphoenix| date=2007-03-05 | accessdate=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise the person is at risk of being bewitched permanently. Also, the only vocalization made by ciguapas is said to be a kind of whine or chirping.

Ciguapas are considered to be magical beings, beautiful in appearance to some, yet horrendous to others. All sources agree that they are wild creatures. They are compared in many cases to mermaids: beautiful yet cruel, and far from innocent. Deceitful and ready to capture the wayward traveler, they are said that they are so beautiful as to lure men into the forest, even though following footprints is misleading, to make love with them only to kill them afterwards. Even today, one can still find inhabitants who confirm having sighted a ciguapa.

Lore states that the only way to capture a ciguapa is by tracking them at night, during a [[full moon]], with a black and white [[polydactylic]]  dog (called ''cinqueño'' dog).&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many believe that the myth of the ciguapa is of [[Taíno people|Taino]] origin, it has been argued that is probably of more recent concoction, being possibly attributed to African beliefs brought to the island by enslaved peoples during the colonial period. More to the point, no known Taino artifacts or lore make reference to any creature even remotely similar to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://mipais.jmarcano.com/cultura/mitos/ciguapa.html&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the legend may have originated from other myths, as distant as the [[Guarani people|Guaraní]] ''Curupí'' or the [[Hindu]] [[Churel]], which was described by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in ''My Own True Ghost Story'' as having traits amazingly similar to those of the ciguapa. Nonetheless, the Hindu hypothesis may be far-fetched since there is no way to ascertain how this story got to the Dominican Republic during the nineteenth century, when no cultural exchange whatsoever occurred between these nations.

A Dominican film called "''El Mito de la Ciguapa''" (The Myth of the Ciguapa) is set to be produced by [[Xenda Films]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8367">A '''clerihew''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɛr|ᵻ|h|j|uː}}) is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem invented by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light, or revealing something unknown or spurious about them. The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced.  The line length and metre are irregular. Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books. One of his best known is this (1905):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Christopher Wren]]
Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
If anyone calls
Say I am designing St. Paul's."&lt;ref name=bentley&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|year=1905|title=Biography for Beginners|isbn=978-1-4437-5315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Form==
A clerihew has the following properties:
* It is biographical and usually whimsical, showing the subject from an unusual point of view; it mostly pokes fun at famous people
* It has four lines of irregular length and metre for comic effect
* The rhyme structure is AABB; the subject matter and wording are often humorously contrived in order to achieve a rhyme, including the use of phrases in Latin, French and other non-English languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verse.org.uk/what-is-a-clerihew.html What is a Clerihew?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first line contains, and may consist solely of, the subject's name.  According to a letter in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in the 1960s, Bentley said that a true clerihew has to have the name "at the end of the first line", as the whole point was the skill in rhyming awkward names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=William|title=The Fireside Book of Humorous Poetry|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|page=xiv|chapter=Introduction|date=1965}} Retrieved 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd, [[anachronism|anachronistic]] or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description (not unlike the schoolboy style of ''[[1066 and All That]]'').

==Practitioners==
The form was invented by and is named after [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. When he was a 16-year-old pupil at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London, the lines of his first clerihew, about [[Humphry Davy]], came into his head during a science class.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;{{cite book|last=Gale|first=Steven H.|year=1996|title=Encyclopedia of British Humorists: Geoffrey Chaucer to John Cleese|page=139|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-8240-5990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with his schoolfriends, he filled a notebook with examples.&lt;ref name=First&gt;{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|title=The First Clerihews|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-212980-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the word in print was in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bentley published three volumes of his own clerihews: ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), published as "edited by E. Clerihew";&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; ''More Biography'' (1929); and ''Baseless Biography'' (1939), a compilation of clerihews originally published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' illustrated by the author's son [[Nicolas Bentley]].

[[G. K. Chesterton]], a friend of Bentley, was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided verses and illustrations for the original schoolboy notebook and illustrated ''Biography for Beginners''.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including [[W. H. Auden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Michael|year=2007|title=The All-sustaining Air: Romantic Legacies and Renewals in British, American, and Irish Poetry Since 1900|page=94|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-929928-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public. Among contemporary writers, the satirist [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]] has made considerable use of the clerihew in his columns for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

There has been newfound popularity of the form on [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Clerihew&amp;src=tyah Twitter].

==Examples==
Bentley's first clerihew, published in 1905, was written about Sir Humphry Davy:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Humphry Davy]]
Abominated gravy.
He lived in the odium
Of having discovered [[sodium]].&lt;ref name=First/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The original poem had the second line "Was not fond of gravy";&lt;ref name=First/&gt; but the published version has "Abominated gravy".

Other clerihews by Bentley include:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[George III of the United Kingdom|George the Third]]
Ought never to have occurred.
One can only wonder
At so grotesque a blunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Morton S. (ed.)|year=1997|title=A New Dictionary of Eponyms|page=50|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-509354-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
and
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]],
By a mighty effort of will,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography for Beginners''. {{cite book|last=Swainson|first=Bill (ed.)|year=2000|title=Encarta Book of Quotations|pages=642–43|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-23000-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

W. H. Auden's ''[[Academic Graffiti]]'' (1971) includes:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Sir [[Henry Rider Haggard]]
Was completely staggered
When his bride-to-be
Announced, "I am [[She (novel)|She]]!"&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' noted Auden's work and responded:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;W. H. Auden
Suffers from acute boredom
But for his readers he's got some merry news
He's written a collection of rather bad clerihews&lt;/poem&gt;}}
A second stanza aimed a jibe at Auden's publisher, [[Faber and Faber]].

Alan Turing, one of the founders of computing, was the subject of a clerihew written by the pupils of his ''alma mater'', [[Sherborne School]] in England:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Turing]]
Must have been alluring
To get made a don
So early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodges|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Hodges|year=1983|title=[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]]|page=94|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0-671-52809-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

A clerihew appreciated by chemists is cited in ''Dark Sun'' by [[Richard Rhodes]], and regards the inventor of the thermos bottle (or [[Dewar flask]]): 
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Sir James Dewar]]
Is a better man than you are
None of you asses
Can liquefy gases.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

''Dark Sun'' also features a clerihew about the German-British physicist and [[Soviet]] nuclear spy [[Klaus Fuchs]]:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;[[Klaus Fuchs|Fuchs]]
Looks 
Like an ascetic
Theoretic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32509950 |title=Dark Sun : The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb |last=Rhodes |first=Richard, |date=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=068480400X |location=New York |pages=57, 488}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In 1983, ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' magazine ran a contest titled "Do You Clerihew?" The winning entry was:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Did [[Descartes]]
Depart
With the thought
"[[Cogito ergo sum|Therefore I'm not]]"?&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Other uses of the form==
The clerihew form has also occasionally been used for non-biographical verses. Bentley opened his 1905 ''Biography for Beginners'' with an example, entitled "Introductory Remarks", on the theme of biography itself:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;The Art of Biography
Is different from Geography.

The '''coat of arms of the Prince of Wales''' is the official [[Heraldry|heraldic]] insignia of the [[Prince of Wales]], a title traditionally granted to the [[heir apparent]] to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], formerly the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and before that the [[Kingdom of England]].

The [[coat of arms]], in its current form, was devised for [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] in 1958. It contains the badges and elements taken from all four of the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries of the United Kingdom]] as well as from the many [[List of titles and honours of Charles, Prince of Wales|titles the prince holds]] as [[heir apparent]].

The history of the coat of arms is closely linked with that of the [[Royal Arms of England|Royal coat of arms of England]] and the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]]. However, as the noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] wrote in 1863, "The Arms of the Prince of Wales have a distinct individuality of their own, with which nothing ought to be directly associated."&lt;ref name="Boutell 256"&gt;Boutell p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
====Coronet====
[[File:Ströhl-Regentenkronen-Fig. 31.png|thumb|130px|left|The British heir-apparent's coronet as depicted by [[Hugo Gerard Ströhl]]]]
The [[Coronet|coronets of the Prince and the Peers]] of the realm were regulated by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] by Royal Warrant, signed on 9 February 1661. Part of the warrant proclaimed: "Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, That the Son and Heir Apparent of the Crown for the time being, shall use and bear his Coronet composed of Crosses and [[Fleur-de-lis|Flower-de-Lized]] with one Arch; and in the midst a [[Globus cruciger|Ball and Cross]], as hath our Royal Diadem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#The_Warrant_of_1661 |title=Warrant of Feb 9, 1661|accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=www.heraldica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the heraldic coronet used in the Prince of Wales's coat of arms is similar to the [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] ([[St. Edward's crown]]) used in the Royal arms, except that instead of two intersecting arches it has only one. Boutell wrote that: "It should be noticed, however, that this coronet belongs to the prince as eldest son of the Sovereign and heir-apparent to the Throne, and not as Prince of Wales". The coronet is also used by the Prince of Wales's consort, in her coat of arms.&lt;ref name="Boutell 363"&gt;Boutell p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

The heir's coronet was confirmed in another Royal Warrant signed on 19 November 1917 by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. The warrant proclaimed: "by the son and heir apparent of the sovereign and his successors a coronet composed of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch and in the midst a ball and cross as in the royal crown."&lt;ref name="1917 warrant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#Warrant_of_Nov_19_1917 |title=Warrant of Nov 19, 1917|accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=www.heraldica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are three physical examples of coronets used at one time or other as part of the [[Honours of the Principality of Wales]]; the [[Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales|Coronet of Frederick]], the [[Coronet of George, Prince of Wales|Coronet of George]] and the [[Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales|Coronet of Charles]]. However these physical manifestations have not affected the graphical representation of the coronet in heraldic art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/honours-principality-wales |title=Honours of the Principality of Wales |website=www.royal.uk |access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Label====
Beginning with the reign of King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] (or blue) was used by his son, the future King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], to differentiate his arms from those of his father. Without such a label their arms would be identical. Within [[heraldry]] this system of differentiating arms is called [[cadency]]. The label is placed on the [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]] (or top) of the [[shield]] of arms, with the ends extending across from the dexter to the sinister sides of the shield. It was Prince [[Edward the Black Prince]], heir of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], who first used a label of three points [[Argent]], also white or silver. This has been the label of the heir apparent ever since, without regard to the system of [[Cadency labels of the British royal family|cadency used by other members]] of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boutell p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crest====
[[File:Prince of Wales 1914.png|thumb|200px|right|Coat of arms of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] as illustrated in [[Burke's Peerage]] 1914 edition.]]
The Prince of Wales's [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] follows closely that of the Sovereign, but always with the appropriate label of [[Cadency|difference]] displayed. This crest depicts a "Lion [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], passant guardant, wearing a coronet of the Heir, and differenced on the shoulders with a label of three points Argent." The lion always stands on a larger coronet of the Heir, which then sits on a golden [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] or the Royal Helm. From the sides flow the gold and [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] [[mantling]] of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Supporters====
Similarly to the crest, the prince's [[supporter]]s follow those of the Sovereign. On either side of the shield of arms and standing on gold scrollwork are the royal supporters: the [[Lion and the Unicorn]]. Both beasts have the prince's label charged around their necks, again as an appropriate mark of difference. The [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] on the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter side]], an [[National symbols of England|ancient symbol of England]], is crowned with the coronet of the Heir. The beast has been a [[Royal Supporters of England|supporter of the English royal arms]] since the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The white [[Unicorn#Heraldry|unicorn]] of [[Scotland]] on the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister side]], was incorporated into the royal arms from the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scottish royal arms]] after the Union of the crowns in 1603.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Order====
Prince Charles was appointed a [[List of current members of the Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] in 1958. Since the founding of the Order in 1348, almost every Prince of Wales has been appointed to the Order.&lt;ref&gt;Boutell p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Order of the Garter]] is represented in the coat of arms by its namesake the blue buckled [[Garter (stockings)|garter]], which bears in gold letters the motto, ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'', [[French language|French]] for "Shame upon him who thinks evil of it".&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;

====Motto====
Under the coat of arms is a scroll bearing the [[motto]] ''[[Ich dien]]'', German for "I serve". The motto of uncertain origin first appeared on the arms of [[Edward, the Black Prince|Edward of Woodstock]], or the Black Prince. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales by his father King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] on 12 May 1343. Legend holds that the Black Prince took the motto as well as the ostrich feathers from King [[John of Bohemia|John the Blind of Bohemia]], who was killed fighting alongside the prince and his father at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346. The motto is also a near [[homophone]] for ''Eich Dyn'', "Your Man" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prince of Wales as part of his full achievement of arms has many [[Heraldic badge]]s, which represents the history and sovereignty of his many titles.

====Prince of Wales' feathers====
{{Main|Prince of Wales's feathers}}
 
The Prince of Wales's feathers badge comprises "A plume of three [[ostrich]] feathers Argent enfiled by a royal coronet of alternate crosses and fleur-de-lys Or" with the motto 'Ich Dien' on a dark blue ribbon. The badge is probably the most recognisable element of the Prince of Wales's coat of arms. It has become synonymous as a personal insignia of the prince and also of the [[Principality of Wales]] itself.&lt;ref name="Official Web"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feathers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/titles-and-heraldry|title=Titles and Heraldry: Prince of Wales's Feathers |accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a personal capacity the badge is granted as a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant of Appointment]] to companies that regularly supply of goods and services to the Prince. Currently there are 170 companies which are entitled to display this badge with the words 'By Appointment to HRH The Prince of Wales' underneath. The badge can be depicted on all premises, delivery vehicles, stationery and advertisements as well as on the individual products themselves.&lt;ref name="Warrants"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/titles-and-heraldry |title=Titles and Heraldry: Royal Warrants |accessdate=2018-08-10 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisations associated with Wales or the prince incorporate the badge into their own insignia including many Welsh regiments of the [[British Army]] (such as the [[Royal Regiment of Wales]]) and the [[Welsh Rugby Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Feathers used as either a crest or a badge have been an [[Royal badges of England|ancient heraldic badge]] of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. However it was not until its incorporation into the heraldic achievements of the Black Prince that the feathers have become an omnipresent feature of the coats of arms of the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Scott-Giles pp. 89&amp;ndash;93&lt;/ref&gt;

====Red Dragon of Wales====
{{Main|Royal Badge of Wales}}
On 10 December 1901 a warrant signed by King [[Edward VII]] approved the addition of a badge of the [[Welsh Dragon|Red Dragon]] to the coat of arms of the Prince of Wales. The proclamation stated that: "on the sinister side a representation of the [[Royal badge of Wales|Badge of Wales]], namely, on a mount vert a Dragon, passant [[gules]], differenced (as in the Crest) with a label of three points argent." This was to complement the feathers badge, which was to be depicted on the dexter side of the prince's crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=27385 |date=10 December 1901 |page=8714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Dragon, or ''Y Ddraig Goch'', has been a symbol associated with Wales since the time of [[Cadwaladr]], [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|King of Gwynedd]] in the 7th century. It was not until the beginning of the [[House of Tudor]] that the Red Dragon became a royal badge of the kings of England. Henry Tudor (later King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]) displayed the Dragon of Cadwaladr on his [[Royal standards of England|battle standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Robin%20Ashburner.pdf |title=Flags in Wales |last=Ashburner |first=Robin |date=2001 |website=flaginstitute.org |access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red dragon became an official royal badge of the sovereign (representing Wales) according to a warrant issued in 1801. The warrant at the same time also confirmed the [[Tudor rose]] as a royal badge for England, the [[thistle]] for Scotland and the [[Celtic harp|golden harp]] for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arms of the Duchy of Cornwall====
{{Main|Duke of Cornwall}}
The arms of the Duke of Cornwall are: "[[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]], fifteen [[bezant]]s, five, four, three, two and one." These arms were derived from those of [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]], [[King of the Romans]], son and heir of King [[John, King of England|John]], who was also [[Count of Poitiers]] (or [[Poitou]]), represented by arms made up of [[pea]]s (poix) or [[gold coin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fox-Davis |first=Arthur Charles|authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |title=The Book Of Public Arms.

Upon the accession of the prince's mother as Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 6 February 1952, Prince Charles was automatically made the [[Duke of Cornwall]]. As such he is able to display the arms of the duchy on his coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke's Peerage|first= |authorlink=Burke's Peerage |title=Burke's guide to the Royal Family (Burke's genealogical series)|url=https://archive.org/details/burkesguidetoroy00lond/page/136 |year=1973 |publisher=Burke's Peerage; 1st edition |location=London |isbn=0220662223|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This title has been granted to every heir apparent since 17 March 1337, in accordance with a charter issued by King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] for Prince [[Edward the Black Prince]], his eldest son and heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke's Peerage|first= |authorlink=Burke's Peerage |title=Burke's genealogical and heraldic history of peerage, baronetage and knightage |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Pf8cAAAAYAAJ/page/n213 |year=1914 |publisher=Burke's Peerage |location=London |isbn=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms were then granted twice more to the future Charles I and Charles II.

||[[File:Royal Hanover Inescutcheon.svg|100px|right|thumb|Arms of Hanover with the crown of Charlemagne]] The [[House of Hanover]] inherited the throne of Great Britain after the death of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] in 1714, which led to the incorporation of the arms of King George I's possessions in [[Germany]] into the Royal arms. The blazon for the arms became: ''"1st quarter England impaling Scotland, 2nd France moderne, 3rd Ireland and 4th the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Electorate of Hanover]], with a label of three points Argent. The Hanoverian quarter depicted: [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Duchy of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and an inescutcheon plain Gules, over all three."'' In the Royal arms the inescutcheon contained a depiction of the [[Crown of Charlemagne]], which was an [[augmentation of honour]] granted to the [[Prince-elector]]s of Hanover as [[Arch-Treasurer]] to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. As heir to this Imperial office, only the Prince of Wales was entitled to bear the empty inescutcheon, in right of inheritance of this imperial office.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces pp. 206-229&lt;/ref&gt;

||With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union of 1800]], the arms of the Prince of Wales changed with those of the Kingdom. The ancient claim to France was abandoned, and England occupied the 1st and 4th quarter, while the Hanoverian quarter became an inescutcheon at the centre of the shield. This shield of arms was granted only once to George Augustus Frederick (the future George IV), who also became [[Prince regent]] in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

||The Royal arms were once again altered following the ascension of Queen [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] to the throne in 1837, when the Hanoverian shield was dropped. The Hanoverian inescutcheon was replaced by the [[Coat of arms of Saxony|arms of Saxony]], which was a heraldic inheritance from the queen's husband Prince [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (a Duke of Saxony).&lt;ref name="Aveling 287"&gt;Aveling p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; The inescutcheon only appeared in the arms of Albert's male-line descendants, and not in the Royal arms itself. According to the antiquarian Charles Boutell, the inescutcheon was placed as an "escutcheon of pretence", that "does not appear to be in accordance with either the spirit or the practical usage of true historical Heraldry".&lt;ref name="Boutell 256"/&gt; These arms were granted twice, first to 'Bertie' (later King Edward VII) and to the future George V. In his 1909 book ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry,'' [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] writes: "It is much to be regretted that the arms of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales (the future George V) do not include the arms of his sovereignty of the Duchy of Cornwall, nor any allusion to his dignities of Prince of Wales or [[Earl of Chester]]."&lt;ref name="FD 486"&gt;Fox-Davies (1909) p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

||In 1910 Prince Edward Albert was invested and presented to the Welsh people as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle, the first time in six hundred years. Welsh local authorities had asked that the red dragon might be introduced into the Royal arms and the coinage, but neither of these wishes were granted. However a year later in 1911, King George V issued an [[order in council]] that replaced the inescutcheon of Saxony, in the Arms of the Prince of Wales, with an inescutcheon with the arms "representing the Principality of Wales". Blazoned as: ''"Quarterly Or and Gules four lions passant guardant counterchanged, ensigned by the Coronet of His degree."''&lt;ref&gt;{{LondonGazette|issue=28473 |date=7 March 1911 |page=1939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Prince Charles, the Duke of Cornwall, son of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] was granted the same arms when he was made Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Pinces &amp; Pinces p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
===Consorts===
The family of the Prince of Wales is entitled to use certain heraldic features. The consort of the Prince of Wales (titled the [[Princess of Wales]]) is granted a unique coat of arms upon marriage, based on the [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] of the prince's arms (on the dexter side) and her father's arms (on the sinister side). The consort is also entitled to use the prince's supporters (with the appropriate label) and the use of the prince's coronet over the arms.&lt;ref name="Boutell 363"/&gt; The current consort; [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]], the [[Duchess of Cornwall]], was granted a coat of arms on 17 July 2005 upon her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/biographies/hrh-duchess-cornwall |title=HRH The Duchess of Cornwall: Titles and Heraldry |accessdate=2018-10-09 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
===Children===
The children of the heir apparent were given their own distinct coronet, unlike any other grandchildren of the sovereign. This was confirmed in the 1917 Royal Warrant, which proclaimed: ''"to all the sons and daughters of the son and heir apparent of us and of our successors a coronet composed of two [[Cross pattée|crosses pattée]] (or crosses formy) four fleurs-de-lis and two strawberry leaves."''&lt;ref name= "1917 warrant"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/grants/item/71-coat-of-arms-prince-william |title=The Coat of Arms of HRH Prince William of Wales |accessdate=2018-10-09 |work=Official website of the College of Arms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wives of the sons of the Prince of Wales use the same coronet as their husbands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">'''Creirwy''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈkrəirʊɨ}}) is a figure in the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and the ''[[s:The Mabinogion/Taliesin|Hanes Taliesin]]'' (the story of [[Taliesin]]'s life), daughter of the enchantress [[Ceridwen]] and [[Tegid Foel]] ("Tacitus the Bald"). The [[Welsh Triads]] name her one of the three most beautiful maids of the Isle of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Triads of Britain|Triads of Britain]]&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Penllyn (cantref)|Penllyn]] in [[Powys]], Wales, Creirwy (also known as ''Llywy'') has a dark, hideous brother named [[Morfran]] and a foster brother, [[Gwion Bach]] (who would become the bard Taliesin). She does not appear in the stories about [[Afagddu]] and Taliesin.

==Interpretation as a goddess==
[[Celtic Revival|Celtic]] researcher [[Edward Davies (Celtic)|Edward Davies]] deemed Creirwy "the [[Proserpina|Proserpine]] of the [[Britons (historical)|British]] [[Druid]]s"—also [[Comparative mythology|comparing]] her mother Ceridwen to [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] of Roman myth.&lt;ref name=virago&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mythologyritesof00davirich ''The Mythology and Rites of the British Druids''], [https://archive.org/stream/mythologyritesof00davirich#page/205/mode/1up/ page 205]&lt;/ref&gt; Mythographer [[Jacob Bryant]] theorized that Creirwy and Ceridwen were essentially "the same mystical personage."&lt;ref name=virago /&gt;

Her name possibly means "sacred symbol of the egg" (i.e., "[[mundane egg]]", "[[adder stone]]") from the Welsh elements ''creir'' "a token, jewel, sacred object, relic, talisman, treasure, richly decorated article, object of admiration or love, darling, safeguard, strength, hand-bell, church-bell"&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, August. [http://thedarkavalonbooks.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/creirwy-the-lake-monster-of-bala-lakellyn-tegid/ "Creirwy, the Lake Monster of Bala Lake/Llyn Tegid?"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719142009/http://thedarkavalonbooks.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/creirwy-the-lake-monster-of-bala-lakellyn-tegid/ |date=2012-07-19 }} ''Dark Avalon Books''. Retrieved 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''wy'' "egg".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ŵy|Wiktionary: "ŵy"]]&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Druids, the mundane egg allegedly symbolized chaos, the beginning of all things, and upon it oaths were administered.

==Saint Creirwy==
This was also the name of a 6th-century Breton saint from Wales, daughter of Saint [[Gwen Teirbron|Gwen the Triple-Breasted]] and sister of the great regional saint [[Winwaloe]]. According to [[hagiographies]] of Winwaloe, Saint Creirwy ({{lang-la|Creirvia}}; {{lang-br|'''Klervi'''}}) as a young girl had one or both eyes gouged out by a wild [[goose]], but Winwaloe retrieved the eyeball(s) from the gander's belly and returned it/them to his little sister's [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbit(s)]], and Creirwy's eyesight was miraculously restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://louis.buchillot.perso.sfr.fr/page369.htm#fiche5 "Sainte Chreirbia" (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, she is allegedly a patron saint of the blind. The story is memorialized in a 16th-century statue in Keravézan, [[Saint-Frégant]]; known as ''la fontaine de Saint Guénolé'', it depicts Winwaloe (Guénolé) holding the goose and the eyeball, with little Creirwy at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saint-fregant.e-monsite.com/pages/patrimoine/fontaine-de-saint-guenole.html Fontaine de Saint-Guénolé (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:br:Restr:St Frégant 2.jpg|A photo of the statue of Winwaloe and Creirwy on Breton Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the legend is dismissed by [[Sabine Baring-Gould|Baring-Gould]] and Fisher, who say it originated with an expression that "Creirwe" used; supposedly she would often say she "owed her eye to Winwaloe", but in reference to a much more ordinary childhood event, in which her brother stepped in and protected her when a wild goose flew at Creirwy and almost pecked out her eye.&lt;ref&gt;Anna of the blog ''Early Western Saints''.

'''Elaine''' is a name shared by several different female characters in [[Arthurian legend]].

==Elaine of Astolat==
{{Main|Elaine of Astolat}}

Elaine of [[Astolat]], also known in some texts as Elaine the Fair or the Fair Maid of Astolat and (as ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]'' in [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]]'s same-titled poem) is a maiden who falls in unrequited love with Sir [[Lancelot]].

==Elaine of Benoic==
Elaine of Benoic (or Benwick) is the wife of [[King Ban]] and the mother of [[Lancelot]]. She is the sister of [[Evaine]], wife of King Bors of Gaunnes and mother of [[Sir Lionel]] and Sir [[Bors]]. Her husband dies of grief when his enemy [[Claudas]] attacks his city, and Elaine goes to attend to him. She sets the infant Lancelot down, and he is taken by the [[Lady of the Lake]], who raises him. Elaine sees her son for the first time in years just before she dies.

==Elaine of Corbenic==
{{main|Elaine of Corbenic}}

Elaine of [[Corbenic]] (also known as Amite, Heliaebel, Helaine, Perevida or Helizabel; identified as "The Grail Maiden" or "Grail Bearer") is the daughter of [[Fisher King|King Pelles]] and the mother of Sir [[Galahad]] by Sir [[Lancelot]]. She first appears in the Prose Lancelot (the [[Vulgate Cycle]]), but fully emerges as a character in Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte D'Arthur]]''. Her first significant action is showing the [[Holy Grail]] to Sir Lancelot.

==Elaine of Garlot==
Elaine of Garlot is the daughter of [[Gorlois]], [[List of legendary rulers of Cornwall|Duke of Cornwall]], and [[Igraine]]. She is a sister of [[Morgan le Fay]] and [[Morgause]] and a half-sister of [[King Arthur]]. She marries King [[Nentres of Garlot]] and has a son named [[Galeschin]], who becomes a [[Knight of the Round Table]], and a daughter named Elaine the Younger. 

Considering the actions of her sisters, she is remarkable in that she is otherwise unremarkable. It is assumed she stayed in her own lands and did little to help or hinder any of her siblings.

==Elaine of Listenoise==
Elaine of Listenoise is the daughter of King [[Pellinore]]. She kills herself after the death of her lover Sir Miles of the Laundes. 

Some modern authors, such as [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]] in ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', combine or conflate her with Elaine of Corbenic, due to their shared name and the similarity of their fathers' names.

==Elaine the Peerless==
Elaine the Peerless is the niece of the Lord of the Fens and wife of Persides the Red of the Castle of Gazevilte.

==Elaine the Younger==
Elaine the Younger is the daughter of Elaine of Garlot and (usually) [[King Nentres]], and a niece of [[King Arthur]]. In some versions of the legend, she falls in love with Sir [[Percival]]. Other versions cast her as a child of [[King Lot]].

'''Saint Francisco de Jesus Marto''' (11 June 1908 – 4 April 1919), his sister '''Saint Jacinta de Jesus Marto''' (5 March 1910 – 20 February 1920)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fatima.pt/en/news/today-marks-the-anniversary-of-saint-jacinta-martos-birth Article on Official Webpage: Shrime of Fatima, "Today marks the anniversary of Saint Jacinta Marto's birth."]&lt;/ref&gt; and their cousin [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] (1907&amp;ndash;2005) were children from Aljustrel, a small hamlet near [[Fátima, Portugal]], who witnessed three apparitions of the [[Guardian Angel of Portugal|Angel of Peace]] in 1916 and several [[Marian apparition|apparitions]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] at [[Cova da Iria]] in 1917. The title [[Our Lady of Fátima]] was given to the Virgin Mary as a result, and the [[Sanctuary of Fátima]] became a major centre of world [[Christian pilgrimage]]. The two were solemnly [[Canonization|canonized]] by [[Pope Francis]] at the [[Sanctuary of Fátima|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima]], in [[Portugal]] on 13 May 2017, the first centennial of the first Apparition of [[Our Lady of Fátima]].

== Life ==
[[File:Francisco Marto2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Francisco Marto]]
The youngest children of Manuel and Olimpia Marto, Francisco and Jacinta were typical of Portuguese village children of that time. They were illiterate&lt;ref name="Religious Phenomena"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=J. Gordon |last=Melton |year=2008 |title=Fatima (Portugal) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOldV3dVOoUC&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Jacinta%20and%20Francisco%20Marto%20illiterate&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacinta%20and%20Francisco%20Marto%20illiterate&amp;f=false |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena |pages=107–109 |location=[[Canton, Maine]] |publisher=[[Visible Ink Press]] |isbn=1-57859-209-7 |accessdate=15 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but had a rich [[oral tradition]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

According to the memoirs of their cousin [[Sister Lúcia]], Francisco had a placid disposition, was somewhat musically inclined, and liked to be by himself to think. Jacinta was affectionate with a sweet singing voice and a gift for dancing. Following their experiences, their fundamental personalities remained the same. Francisco preferred to pray alone, saying that this would "console Jesus for the sins of the world". Jacinta said she was deeply affected by a terrifying vision of Hell shown to the children at the third apparition, and deeply convinced of the need to save sinners through penance and sacrifice as the Virgin had told the children to do. All three children, but particularly Francisco and Jacinta, practised stringent [[Mortification of the flesh|self-mortification]]s to this end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastorinhos.com/_wp/wp-content/uploads/MemoriasI_en.pdf Sister Lúcia: ''Fatima in Lucia's Own Words'', ''Memoir 2'', p. 94], online, accessed 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregation for the Causes of Saints, in the report that confirmed Jacinta as [[Beatification|beatified]], observed that she seemed to have "an insatiable hunger for immolation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/saints/jacinta.htm Congregation for the Causes of Saints Decree regarding the Canonization of the Servant of God Jacinta Marto]. 13 May 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apparitions ==
The brother and sister, who tended to their families’ sheep with their cousin Lúcia in the fields of Fátima, Portugal, are said to have witnessed several apparitions of an angel in 1916. Lúcia later recorded the words of several prayers she said they learned from this angel.&lt;ref name="Religious Phenomena"/&gt;

Sister Lúcia wrote in her memoirs that she and her cousins saw the first apparition of Mary on 13 May 1917. At the time of the apparition, Francisco was 8 years old, and Jacinta was 7.&lt;ref name=nd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faith.nd.edu/s/1210/faith/interior.aspx?sitebuilder=1&amp;pgid=13446&amp;cid=28049&amp;ecid=28049&amp;crid=0&amp;calpgid=10817&amp;calcid=24284|title=Blessed Francisco and Jacinta Marto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first apparition, Mary is said to have asked the three children to say the Rosary and to make sacrifices, offering them for the conversion of sinners.&lt;ref name=cna/&gt; She also asked them to return to that spot on the thirteenth of each month for the next six months.&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/features/saints/saint.aspx?id=1297 Foley O.F.M., Leonard. "Blesseds Jacinta and Francisco Marto", ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons and Feast'', (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illness and death ==
The siblings were victims of the great [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 influenza]] epidemic that swept through Europe that year. In October 1918, Jacinta told Lucia that Mary had appeared to her and promised to take them to heaven soon.&lt;ref name=cna/&gt; Both lingered for many months, insisting on walking to church to make Eucharistic devotions and prostrating themselves to pray for hours, [[proskynesis|kneeling with their heads on the ground]] as they said the angel had instructed them to do.&lt;ref name=nd/&gt;

[[File:Fatima children with rosaries.jpg|thumb|left|220px|From left to right: Jacinta Marto, [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] and Francisco Marto, holding their [[rosary|rosaries]] in 1917]]
Francisco declined hospital treatment on 3 April 1919, and died at home the next day. Jacinta was moved from one hospital to another in an attempt to save her life, which she insisted was futile. She developed purulent [[pleurisy]] and endured an operation in which two of her ribs were removed. Because of the condition of her heart, she could not be fully anesthetized, and suffered terrible pain, which she said would help to convert many sinners. On 19 February 1920, Jacinta asked the hospital [[chaplain]] who heard her [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to bring her [[Holy Communion]] and administer [[Extreme Unction]] because she was going to die "the next night". He told her that her condition was not that serious and that he would return the next day.  The next day Jacinta was dead; she had died, as she had often said she would, alone.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed account of the lives, illnesses and deaths of both children is given in de Marchi, John, ''The True Story of Fatima'', 1950 edition, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/tsfatima.htm entire text on line], found 19 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, shortly before her death at age nine, Jacinta Marto reportedly discussed the [[Alliance of the Hearts of Jesus and Mary]] with a then 12-year-old [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] and said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you are to say this, don't go and hide. Tell everybody that God grants us graces through the Immaculate Heart of Mary; that people are to ask her for them; and that the Heart of Jesus wants the Immaculate Heart of Mary to be venerated at his side. Tell them also to pray to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for peace, since God entrusted it to her.&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, Leo. ''The children of Fatima: Blessed Francisco &amp; Blessed Jacinta Marto'' 2003 OSV Press {{ISBN|1-931709-57-2}} page 248&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cause for the siblings' canonization began in 1946.&lt;ref name="nd"/&gt; Exhumed in 1935, Jacinta's face was found [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]];&lt;ref&gt;"On September 12, 1935, the mortal remains of Jacinta, who died in 1920, were exhumed. Her face was found to be incorrupt." Solimeo, Luiz. ''Fatima: A Message More Urgent Than Ever''. (2008) pg. 97. "Today, the remnants of both Francisco and Jacinta rest at the Basilica of Fátima." pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120309072403/http://www.crc-internet.org/images/jacinta.jpg Jacinta's exhumation photo] at Catholic Counter-Reformation, Page found 13 May 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029034002/http://www.crc-internet.org/images/jacinta.jpg |date=29 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco's had decomposed. By 1951, when she was again exhumed for her reburial in the Basilica, Jacinta had begun to decompose also.&lt;ref&gt;Alipio da Silva Vicente, "[http://ecommons.udayton.edu/imri_photos/138/ Exhumation of Jacinta]". Photograph taken May 1, 1951. Source: University of Dayton Marian Library &amp; Research Institute Photo Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 [[Pope Pius XI]] decided that causes for minors should not be accepted as they could not fully understand [[heroic virtue]] or practice it repeatedly, both of which are essential for canonization. For the next four decades, no sainthood processes for children were pursued. In 1979 the bishop of Leiria-Fátima asked all the world's bishops to write to the Pope, petitioning him to make an exception for Francisco, who had died at age 10, and Jacinta, who had died at age 9. More than 300 bishops sent letters to the Pope, writing that “the children were known, admired and attracted people to the way of sanctity. Favors were received through their intercession.” The bishops also said that the children's canonization was a pastoral necessity for the children and teenagers of the day.&lt;ref name=seyer&gt;[http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/fatima_has_high_hopes_for_francisco_and_jacinta/ Seyer, Loretta G., "Fatima Has High Hopes For Francisco and Jacinta", ''National Catholic Register'', May 16, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] convened a general assembly. Cardinals, bishops, theologians and other experts debated whether it was possible for children to display heroic virtue. Eventually, they decided that, like the very few children who have a genius for music or mathematics, "in some supernatural way, some children could be spiritual prodigies." They were declared venerable by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=seyer/&gt;

On 13 May 2000, they were declared "blessed" in a decree from the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]. Jacinta is the youngest non-martyred child ever to be beatified.&lt;ref name=cna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=153|title=BLESSED FRANCISCO AND JACINTA MARTO :: Catholic News Agency (CNA)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her biography of Jacinta Marto, [[Sister Lúcia]] said that Jacinta had told her of having had many personal visions outside of the Marian visitations; one involved a pope who prayed alone in a room while people outside shouted ugly things and threw rocks through the window. At another time, Jacinta said she saw a pope who had gathered a huge number of people together to pray to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

When Pope John Paul II arrived in Fátima for the first time, in 1982, he said that he had come "because, on this exact date last year in [[St. Peter's Square]], in Rome, there was [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|an attempt on the life of your Pope]], which mysteriously coincided with the anniversary of the first vision at Fátima, that of 13 May 1917. The coincidence of these dates was so great that it seemed to be a special invitation for me to come here."&lt;ref name=seyer/&gt;

Sister Lúcia, when questioned about the [[Third Secret of Fatima|Third Secret]], said that the three of them had been very sad about the suffering of the Pope, and that Jacinta kept saying: ''Coitadinho do Santo Padre, tenho muita pena dos pecadores!'' ("Poor Holy Father, I feel a lot of pity for the sinners!"){{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Another miracle was found to have been attributed to their intercession and the process that investigated the presumed miracle was validated on 8 February 2013. On 23 March 2017, it was announced that Pope Francis would canonize them while visiting Portugal on 12 and 13 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/03/23/pope-francis-will-canonize-two-children-who-saw-our-lady-fatima|title=Pope Francis will canonize two of the children who saw Our Lady of Fatima|date=23 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope solemnly canonized the children on 13 May 2017 during the centennial of the first apparition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-Latest-Pope-Francis-prays-at-Fatima-basilica-11143520.php#item-39786|title=The Latest: Pope ends Portugal visit, leaves for Rome|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the Catholic Church's youngest saints who did not die as martyrs, with Jacinta the youngest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pope-francis-canonizes-children-behind-three-secrets-fatima-n758531|title=Pope canonizes children behind 'Three Secrets of Fatima'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/world/europe/in-portugal-pope-proclaims-two-fatima-siblings-saints.html|title=In Portugal, Pope Proclaims Two Fátima Siblings Saints|first=Raphael|last=Minder|date=13 May 2017|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2017/pope-recognizes-miracle-attributed-to-fatima-visionaries.cfm|title=Pope recognizes miracle attributed to Fatima visionaries|website=www.catholicnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15427">The '''Frank Gardiner–Ben Hall Gang''' was an informal group of [[bushranger]]s who roamed the central west of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] in the 1860s. The gang was responsible for the largest gold robbery in Australia’s history at [[Eugowra, New South Wales|Eugowra Rocks]]. The gang had its origins in 1861; its demise came with the execution of [[John Dunn (bushranger)|John Dunn]] in 1866.

== Gang activities ==

John Peisley was born at Bathurst in 1835. While a teenager, he became a notorious horse thief in the area. He was convicted and sentenced to serve time on Cockatoo Island near [[Sydney]], where he met [[Frank Gardiner]].  In December 1860, Peisley gained his [[ticket of leave]], on the condition that he remain in the [[Hunter Region|Hunter River Valley]] area.  He absconded to the Abercrombie Ranges, where his parents once lived, and became a lone [[highwayman|highway robber]], "sticking up" travellers in the area south and west of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].

Gardiner was granted a ticket of leave in December 1859 on the condition of staying in the [[Carcoar, New South Wales|Carcoar]] district, and he soon joined up with Peisley. [[John Gilbert (bushranger)|Johnny Gilbert]] joined them soon afterwards, and the gang started stealing cattle and horses. Gardiner's [[ticket of leave]] was revoked when a warrant for his arrest for cattle stealing was issued.
 
Gardiner had a partnership with William Fogg in a butcher shop at Spring Creek. Gardiner supplied Fogg with stolen cattle, and Fogg would slaughter the cattle and sell the meat.

===1861===
*May: Gardiner, Peisley and Gilbert robbed mail in [[Cowra, New South Wales|Cowra]].
*16 July: Sgt. John Middleton and Constable William Hosie went to Fogg's house in search of Gardiner. He was briefly captured after a gunfight, but he was rescued by Peisley and John Gilbert, who ambushed the police on their return to town.
*25 December: Peisley shot William Benyon, who died seven days later.

===1862===
*29 January: Peisley was captured and committed for trial by the Carcoar bench for murdering an innkeeper at [[Bigga, New South Wales|Bigga]].  Within two months he was convicted and hanged at Bathurst.
*January: "The Three Jacks" &amp;ndash; Davis, McGuinness, and Connors &amp;ndash; committed their first robberies with Gardiner.
*10 April: Davis was wounded four times by police near [[Young, New South Wales|Lambing Flat]]. His companions, the other two Jacks, escaped.
*13 April: McGuiness was found dead near where Davis was captured; he had been shot.
*14 April: Gardiner, Hall, Youngman, and Gilbert robbed [[Wagon|dray]] near [[Forbes, New South Wales|Forbes]].
In 1862, John Gilbert was first named as an accomplice of Gardiner when they and two others held up a storekeeper.  Just over a month later, John Gilbert was involved in another robbery, this time with Gardiner and Ben Hall. From then on John Gilbert was identified as being involved in several hold-ups between Lambing Flat and Lachlan.
*25 April: Peisley was hanged in Bathurst.
[[Image:Escort Rock near Eugowra NSW.jpg|thumb|left|the location of the robbery at Eugowra Rocks]]
*15 June: Frank Gardiner enlisted the assistance of John Gilbert, Ben Hall, John O'Meally, Dan Charters, Henry Manns, Alexander Fordyce, and Johnny Bow to rob the Forbes gold escort, at a place called [[Eugowra, New South Wales|Eugowra Rocks]], of banknotes and 2700 ounces of gold worth more than £14,000.
*27 July: Hall and several others were arrested. Charters turned [[Queen's evidence]] but failed to name Hall or O'Meally.
*23 August: Hall was released. Gardiner left the district and moved to Queensland.

===1863===
*1 January: Fred Lowry shot a man whilst robbing the Brisbane Valley races (near the head of Fish River Creek) with John Foley. Lowry robbed settlers at Wambanamba. Lowry shot John Mcbride, who died from his leg wound.
* 13 February: Fred Lowry had been captured and placed in Bathurst Jail. On Feb 13 he had a mattock secreted into the jail and smashed a hole in the jail wall. Five prisoners escaped. Three escapees were caught that day. Fred Lowry and William Woodhart escaped capture. Lowry and Woodhart joined up with Gardiner.
*12 May: William Woodhart caught at Fowlow by Senior Constable Reilly and brought into Braidwood.
*13 July: Johnny Gilbert and John O'Meally, led by Ben Hall, held up the Commercial Bank at Carcoar.  A brave teller in the bank fired a shot into the ceiling of the bank, thwarting the robbery. The manager was shot outside the bank as he was returning to the bank, and the gang fled without seizing anything.  This was Australia's first bank robbery, and it took place in broad daylight.
*13 July: Lowry, with Cummins and John Foley, robbed the [[Mudgee, New South Wales|Mudgee]] mailcoach.
*August: John O'Meally shot dead John Barnes, a shopkeeper near [[Wallendbeen, New South Wales|Wallendbeen]].
*30 August: Fred Lowry died from wounds after a shootout with police at [[Crookwell, New South Wales|Crookwell]] the night before. Cummins was arrested.
*7 September: Francis Foley was sentenced to ten years "on the roads", with the first year in irons. Francis' brother, John Foley, was sentenced on the same day to fifteen years hard labour, with the first three in irons.
*23 September 1863, Patrick Daley sentenced to fifteen years on the roads
*27 September: First raid on Canowindra.
*1 October: John Gilbert, Ben Hall, John O’Meally, and two Mount Macquarie lads, John Vane and Micky Burke, held up a jeweller’s shop and the Sportsman’s Arms Hotel in Bathurst in broad daylight.  They exchanged shots with police as they made their escape down George Street.  Three days later they returned to rob more stores, houses, and hotels on the outskirts of the town.
*12 October: Hall and his gang bailed up Robinson's Hotel in [[Canowindra, New South Wales|Canowindra]] and held all the people of the town captive for three days. The hostages were allegedly not mistreated, and were provided with entertainment. The local policeman was subjected to humiliation by being locked in his own cell.  When the hostages were set free, the gang insisted on paying the hotelier and giving the townspeople "expenses".
*24 October: Twenty-year-old Michael Burke’s bushranging career ended at Rockley. Holding up Gold Commissioner Keightley, he was wounded in the stomach and, believing he was about to die, shot himself in the head.  While he was still alive and in pain, one of his friends killed him (the coroner named Hall as the person who fired the shot).
*3 November: Third raid on Canowindra.
*18 November: John Vane surrendered to police. Vane was sentenced to fifteen years; he was released in 1870.
*19 November: John O'Meally was shot dead during a raid on Goimbla station.
*December: Dunleavy and Mount joined the gang.

===1864===

*24 March: Frank Gardiner was living at Apis Creek near [[Rockhampton]], Queensland, where he was running a general store. He was recognised and reported to the police in Sydney. Gardiner was arrested and taken back to Sydney, and sentenced to 32 years hard labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/30938549?searchTerm=frank%20gardiner&amp;searchLimits= |title=Capture of Frank Gardiner the Highwayman |date=21 March 1864 |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date=24 January 2013 |via=[[Trove]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*12 May: Gilbert and Dunn, on hearing the news of Hall's death, headed for Dunn's grandfather's property at Murrumbarrah.

[[Image:JohnGilbertGraveInfo.JPG|thumb|right]]

*13 May: The [[Binalong, New South Wales|Binalong]] Police Station Senior Constable Charles Hales thought they might visit John Kelly, Dunn's grandfather. On the morning of the 13th of May, John Kelly informed Senior Constable Hales that Gilbert and Dunn were at his hut. Hales gathered Constables John Bright, Michael King, and Henry Hall and headed to Kelly's place. Two parties were formed: Bright and Hall went to the back of the hut and were stationed in the creek, while Hales and King were stationed at the front of the hut.

:As Hales and King approached the hut, the dogs started barking. Bushrangers ran out the back of the hut firing their guns, and kept up the fire as they got through a bush fence that led to the creek. They positioned themselves behind a large tree. Gilbert fired his revolving rifle at Hales and Bright, but it misfired. Meanwhile, King and Hall took up positions. Dunn and Gilbert started firing their revolvers at Hall and King and ran down to the creek. Hales and Bright immediately fired at the bushrangers; Gilbert was shot and died instantly.

:Hales ordered his men to follow and to chase Dunn. The three constables chased Dunn for about a mile and a half; they were exhausted and had to give up the pursuit. Dunn stole a horse from nearby Bogolong station and wasn't heard from again for seven months.

*18 December: Dunn was recognized by Police at McPhails Station near [[Walgett, New South Wales|Walgett]]. A week later on the 26th of December, after a gunfight with police, he was wounded and captured near [[Coonamble, New South Wales|Coonamble]].&lt;ref name=career/&gt; He was tried on 19 January 1866; the jury took ten minutes to find him guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to hang.  He was hanged in [[Darlinghurst Gaol]] on 19 March 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18702710 |title=Execution of Dunn |date=22 March 1866 |newspaper=[[The Maitland Mercury &amp; Hunter River General Advertiser]] |access-date=24 January 2013 |via=[[Trove]] |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaitelgrima''' is a [[Lombards|Lombard]] feminine name. There are several notable Gaitelgrimas in history.  The identities of these five women (as well as some others of the same name) are often confused because they were all closely related to each other and to two men: [[Guaimar III of Salerno]] and his son, [[Guaimar IV of Salerno|Guaimar IV]]; they were the princes of Salerno from about 983 to 1027 and from 1027 to 1052.

The first was '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''', daughter of [[Atenulf I of Capua]], married [[Guaimar II of Salerno]] and was the mother of [[Gisulf I of Salerno]]. 

The second, also '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''' or '''Gaitelgrima of Benevento''' (died after 1027), was the daughter of [[Pandulf II of Benevento]] and sister of [[Pandulf IV of Capua]].  She was the second wife of Guaimar III and mother of Guaimar IV (his successor), [[Guy, Duke of Sorrento|Guy]] (later duke of [[Sorrento]]), and [[Pandulf of Capaccio|Pandulf]] (later lord of [[Capaccio]]).  She was also the mother of the third Gaitelgrima.  

This third was '''Gaitelgrima of Salerno''', also known as '''Altrude''', who married successively two brothers, [[Drogo of Hauteville]] and [[Humphrey of Hauteville]], who were [[counts of Apulia]].  Through the latter, she was mother to [[Abelard of Hauteville|Abelard]] and [[Herman of Hauteville|Herman]].  

The fourth, also named after Gaitelgrima of Benevento, was also a '''[[Gaitelgrima, daughter of Guaimar IV|Gaitelgrima of Salerno]]'''.  She was the daughter of Guaimar IV of Salerno (see above) and Gemma.  She was married off by her brother [[Gisulf II of Salerno]] to [[Jordan I of Capua]] as was her sister, [[Sichelgaita]], to [[Robert Guiscard]]. 

The last was '''Gaitelgrima, [[Duke of Apulia|Duchess of Apulia]]''', the second wife of [[William II, Duke of Apulia]].  She was the daughter of [[Jordan II of Capua]]. She deeply loved her husband and cut off her hair to cover his coffin at his funeral.

'''Geert Adriaans Boomgaard''' (21 September 1788 &amp;ndash; 3 February 1899) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[supercentenarian]]. He is accepted as the first validated supercentenarian case on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/A.HTM |title=Table A - Verified Supercentenarians (Listed Chronologically By Birth Date)|accessdate=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grg.org/Gallery/Pre1850sGallery.html Gerontology Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is evidence that he served as a soldier in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]], in the 33rd Light Infantry Division, Boomgaard might in fact have been the oldest military veteran ever for several decades.&lt;ref name="derniersveterans.free.fr"&gt;[http://derniersveterans.free.fr/napoleon1.html Derniers vétérans de l'Armée napoléonienne, Premier Empire] {{fr-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}

==Life==
[[File:GeertAdriaansBoomgaard.jpg|thumb|left|Boomgaard later in life, in the 1890s]]
Little is known about Boomgaard's life. He was born in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], Netherlands, where he also died. His parents were Adriaan Jacobs Boomgaard (1763-1844) and Geesje Geerts Bontekoe (1762-1834).&lt;ref name="delpher"&gt;[http://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten/view?query=Geert+Adriaans+Boomgaard&amp;coll=ddd&amp;identifier=ddd:011010387:mpeg21:a0422&amp;resultsidentifier=ddd:011010387:mpeg21:a0422 Nieuwsblad van het Noorden, 3 April 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was captain on a boat, and civil records say that Geert did the same work.&lt;ref name=wiewaswie1&gt;[https://www.wiewaswie.nl/personen-zoeken/zoeken/document/a2apersonid/163990124/srcid/18794926/oid/31]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2016}} Other sources&lt;ref name="derniersveterans.free.fr"/&gt; say that he had also served as a soldier in the 33rd Light Infantry Regiment in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]].

At the age of 29, on 4 March 1818, he married Stijntje Bus (baptized 19 February 1797 - died 24 March 1830&lt;ref name="delpher" /&gt;).&lt;ref name="wiewaswie1"/&gt; Stijntje died aged 33, a month after the birth of their 8th child. A year later, 17 March 1831, Boomgaard married Grietje Abels Jonker (baptized 19 May 1793 - 18 May 1864&lt;ref name="delpher" /&gt;), with whom he had four more children, for a total of 12. His last surviving child, Jansje Hinderika, died at the age of 57 in May 1885.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Boomgaard died at age 110 years 135 days in Groningen.

==Evidence==
{{Original research section|date=November 2016}}
Research on Boomgaard was published in three articles by E.J. Heeres in the genealogical periodical ''Gruoninga'' in 1976, 1977 and 1978. The website http://www.stehelene.org, which is dedicated to the rebuilding of the lost archives on the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène, shows his photograph, his (presumed) personal Sainte-Hélène medal, and a certificate which states that "Adriaans, Gerrit, à Groningue, Pays-Bas, received this medal" on behalf of his active military service during the reign of [[Napoleon I]]. The certificate is registered at la Grande Chancellerie No. 1871, and bears the stamped signature of the Duc de Plaisance Général {{ill|Anne-Charles Lebrun|fr}}, Grand Chancelier (1853&amp;ndash;1859).

'''Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland – Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|proporzec Prezydenta Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej – Zwierzchnika Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej}}) is a [[Maritime flag#Jacks|jack flag]] used in the [[Polish Armed Forces]] to mark the presence and pay respect to the [[President of the Republic of Poland]] who is also ''ex officio'' the [[commander-in-chief]] of the Armed Forces. The jack is raised on [[Polish Navy]] ships when the president is officially on board, as well as on land, if the president is present. The design of the jack is based directly on the [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|pre-war]] [[Banner of Poland|Banner of the Republic of Poland]] which used to be part of presidential insignia.

The jack of the President is defined in the Ordinance of the Minister of National Defense on the Use of Insignia of the Armed Forces of January 26, 1996 with subsequent amendments. The ordinance defines the jack of the President as "a piece of red cloth with the image of the state eagle (i.e. the White Eagle from the [[Coat of Arms of Poland|national coat of arms]]) in the middle, bordered with a ''wężyk generalski''", an ornate wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of [[generał|general's]] rank. The [[Hoist (flag)|hoist]] to [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]] ratio is 5:6. The proportion of the eagle's height to the fly is 3:5.&lt;ref name=ordinance&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 29 stycznia 1996 r. w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm M.P.96.14.178] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015219/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/1996/0178.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The presidential jack is used in military ceremonies attended by the commander-in-chief. Celebrations of the Constitution Day, May 3; Polish Armed Forces Day, August 15; and Independence Day, November 11 (see [[Public holidays in Poland]]) are typical occasions. For example, during the grand military parade on August 15, 2007 in [[Warsaw]], President [[Lech Kaczyński]] rode in a convertible jeep preceded by a mounted [[Polish cavalry|cavalry]] officer carrying the presidential jack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
while a smaller jack was attached to the president's jeep as a car flag. The jack also draped the coffins of President Kaczyński (see [[Death and state funeral of Lech Kaczyński and Maria Kaczyńska]]) and former President-in-exile [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]] after both died in the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Smolensk air crash]] of 2010.

== History ==
[[File:Banner of Poland.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Banner of the Republic on display in the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]]

{{Main article|Banner of Poland}}

A state banner was used in Poland as insignia of the head of state (king, president, etc.) as early as the 11th century CE. Although its design changed with time, it was always a heraldic banner, i.e. one based directly on the national coat of arms: a crowned White Eagle in a red field. In 1919, the [[Sejm]] (lower house of parliament) established the [[Banner of the Republic of Poland]], reserved for use by the head of state &amp;ndash; the State Leader (''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'') and, later, President of the Republic. In 1927, it was modified to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms. At this point the banner was virtually identical to the current design for the presidential jack.&lt;ref name=znamier&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn = 83-7115-055-5|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], the Banner of the Republic was still used by [[Polish government-in-exile|presidents-in-exile]] while a variant with a crownless eagle was used by Communist authorities at home. Officially abandoned in 1955, the banner continued to be used in practice by the [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|prime minister]] and, during the 1960s, by the [[Polish Council of State|Council of State]], a collective head of state of the time.&lt;ref name=znamier/&gt;

The modern Jack of the President of the Republic of Poland was established by the Minister of National Defense on January 29, 1996 with the sole purpose of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board.&lt;ref name=ordinance/&gt; On December 14, 2005, the use of the presidential jack was extended to all branches of Polish Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} ''Zarządzenie Ministra Obrony Narodowej z dnia 14 grudnia 2005 r. zmieniające zarządzenie w sprawie szczegółowych zasad używania znaków Sił Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej oraz ustalenia innych znaków używanych w Siłach Zbrojnych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej'' ([http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm M.P.05.82.1165] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033325/http://www.abc.com.pl/serwis/mp/2005/1165.htm |date=2007-09-30 }})&lt;/ref&gt; It was first flown on land during a Constitution Day ceremony at the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw]] on May 3, 2005.

'''Liath Luachra''', the "'''Gray of Luachair'''", is the name of two characters in the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. Both appear in ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn]]'', which details the young life and adventures of the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]].

The first Liath Luachra is one of Fionn's foster mothers who raise him after the death of his father [[Cumhal]] at the hands of [[Goll mac Morna]]. She is a great warrior and a companion of Fionn's aunt, the druidess [[Bodhmall]]; together they raise the boy in secret in the forest of [[Slieve Bloom Mountains|Sliabh Bladhma]]. Eventually Fionn's ever-spreading fame threatens to bring his father's killers to him, and his caretakers send him to find his own way. By this point they have taught him enough that he can survive on his own, and he goes into the king of [[Bantry]]'s service.

The second Liath Luachra is a tall, hideous warrior and a member of the [[Fianna]]. He had been an enemy of Cumhal, and even dealt him the first blow in the battle at which he died. Later Goll mac Morna gave him possession of Cumhal's treasures, and made him the Fianna's official treasurer. His ''corrbolg'' or ''crane bag'' is one of the warrior band's great treasures. Eventually he kills a young warrior named Glonda; Fionn sees the man's mother crying blood over the murder and decides to avenge him. He kills Liath easily and takes his treasure from him. This Liath has a son, [[Conán mac Lia]], who becomes lord of Luchair and a marauder against Fionn and the Fianna. He is eventually reconciled with the group and joins them.

=== Line Offline ===
Line Offline is an animated series created by [[Shogakukan Productions]], based on [[salaryman]] characters working at "Line Corporation". All 114 episodes last about three minutes. The series was aired from January 8, 2013, to October 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/07/line-offline/|title=Messaging App Line’s Kawaii Characters Get Their Own Cartoon Series In Japan – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episodes of Line Offline are not connected to each other. The idea behind the series is to represent the ordinary life of company employees (in this case Line's employees, that's why the series is called "Line Offline"), in which every small problem could lead to weird and funny situations that require some effort in order to restore the [[status quo]].

Most characters from Line Offline are part of Line's universe (the characters who are shown in the animated series are also Line Friends, and they can be seen by users in Line Messaging App and used as emoticons).

[[File:Blenda uppmanar - August Malmström 1860.jpg|thumb|The Swedish heroine Blenda advises the women of Värend to fight off the Danish army in a painting by August Malström (1860).]]

[[File:Joan of Arc miniature graded.jpg|thumb|The peasant Joan of Arc (Jeanne D'Arc) led the French army to important victories in the Hundred Years' War. The only direct portrait of Joan of Arc has not survived; this artist's interpretation was painted between AD 1450 and 1500.]]

This is a list of women who engaged in war, found throughout [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], studied in fields such as [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[film studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[women's studies]]. A ''mythological'' figure does not always mean a ''fictional'' one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of [[history]] (e.g. the [[Ancient Briton]] queen [[Boudica]], who led the [[Iceni]] into battle against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of [[military]], be it recognized, like an organized [[army]], or unrecognized, like [[revolutionaries]].

==Pirates and seafarers==
*[[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]] sailed alongside [[Calico Jack]], Mary dressing as a man. Anne eventually became Jack's lover, and they had a child. In October 1720, their ship was attacked by a royal fleet. All but one of the male crew members, drunk and afraid, hid below deck as the two women fought on with the help of the unknown man. While imprisoned, Bonny is reported to have said of her doomed lover: "Sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have been hanged like a dog."&lt;ref&gt;^ Druett, Joan (2000). She Captains : Heroines and Hellions of the Sea. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Ching Shih]], legendary "Pirate Queen" of China, famous for commanding over 300 ships and an army of 20,000 to 40,000 pirates. She lived during the 18th and 19th centuries.
*[[Gráinne O'Malley]], legendary "Pirate Queen" of Ireland. She lived during the 16th century.
*[[Muirisc]], daughter of [[Úgaine Mór]] (Hugony the Great), the sixty-sixth high king of Ireland, c. 600 BC  to AD 500.

==Africa==

===Angola===
*[[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba]]  valiantly fought and held off [[Portugal|Portuguese]] control of present-day [[Angola]] for over thirty years during the early 17th century.

===Benin history===

* The [[Dahomey Amazons]] (or ''N'Nonmiton'', meaning ''our mothers'' in the [[Fon language]]), were a [[Fon people|Fon]] all-female military regiment in [[Dahomey]], an African kingdom (c. 1600–1894) located in the area of the present-day [[Republic of Benin]]. They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the semi-mythical [[Amazons]] of ancient [[Anatolia]] and the [[Black Sea]].

===Berber history===
*[[Kahina]] or '''al-Kāhina''' ([[Classical Arabic]] for "female seer"; modern [[Maghreb Arabic]] '''l-Kahna''', commonly romanised as '''Kah(i)na''', also known as '''Dihya''' or '''Kahya''') was a 7th-century female [[Berber people|Berber]] religious and military leader, who led indigenous resistance to Arab expansion in [[Northwest Africa]], the region then known as [[Numidia]], known as the [[Maghreb]] today. She was born in the early 7th century and died around the end of the 7th century probably in modern-day [[Algeria]].

===Burkina Faso===
*[[Yennenga]] was a legendary warrior woman skilled in spear and bow, considered by the [[Mossi people]] as the mother of their empire.

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:GD-EG-KomOmbo016.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The warrior goddess [[Sekhmet]], shown with her sun disk and cobra crown]]
*[[Ankt]] may have originated in [[Asia Minor]]. Within [[Egypt]] she was later syncretized as [[Neith]] (who by that time had developed aspects of a war goddess).
*[[Cleopatra VII]] was a [[Hellenistic]] co-ruler of Egypt with her father ([[Ptolemy XII of Egypt|Ptolemy XII Auletes]]) and later with her brothers/husbands [[Ptolemy XIII of Egypt|Ptolemy XIII]] and [[Ptolemy XIV of Egypt|Ptolemy XIV]]. Her patron goddess was [[Isis]], and thus during her reign, it was believed that she was the re-incarnation and embodiment of the goddess of wisdom.
*[[Sekhmet]] is a warrior goddess depicted as a [[lion]]ess, the fiercest hunter known to the Egyptians.
*Though her reign was primarily peaceful, the pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] fought in several battles during her younger years.
*[[Nefertiti]], wife of the pharaoh [[Akhenaten]], has been at times depicted as smiting enemies in a manner similar to how a male ruler typically would.
*[[Ahhotep I|Ahhotep]], wife of [[Seqenenre Tao II]], was believed to have been in command of the army while her son Ahmose I was still young.

===Ethiopia===
*[[Gudit]] (Ge'ez: Yodit, Judith) is a semi-legendary, non-Christian, [[Beta Israel]], queen (flourished c.960) who laid waste to [[Aksum]] and its countryside, destroyed churches and monuments, and attempted to exterminate the members of the ruling Axumite dynasty. Her deeds are recorded in the oral tradition and mentioned incidentally in various historical accounts.

===Ghana (then [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]])===
*[[Yaa Asantewaa]] was the Queen Mother of Ejisu ([[Ashanti Empire|Asante]] Confederacy)—now part of modern-day [[Ghana]]. In 1900 she led the Ashanti rebellion known as the [[War of the Golden Stool]] against British colonialism.

===Hausa history===
*[[Amina Sukhera]] (also called Aminatu) was a Muslim princess of the royal family of the kingdom of [[Zazzau]], in what is now northeast [[Nigeria]], who lived c. 1533 - 1610. Her military achievements brought her great wealth and power; she was responsible for conquering many of the cities in the area surrounding her seat.
* [[Sarraounia | Sarraounia Mangou]], chief/priestess of the animist Azna subgroup of the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], who fought French colonial troops of the [[Voulet–Chanoine Mission]] at the [[Battle of Lougou]] (in present-day [[Niger]]) in 1899. She is the subject of the 1986 film ''[[Sarraounia (film)|Sarraounia]]'' based on the novel of the same name by Nigerien writer [[Abdoulaye Mamani]].&lt;ref name="alou2009"&gt;Alou, Antoinette Tidjani. (2009). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30131185 "Niger and Sarraounia: One Hundred Years of Forgetting Female Leadership."] ''Research in African Literatures'' 40(1): 42–56 (Spring 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoruba mythology and history===
*[[Oya]] is the [[Orisha]] of the [[Niger River]]. She is the [[warrior]]-[[spirit]] of the wind, lightning, fertility, fire, and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. It is believed that she creates hurricanes and tornadoes, and serves as guardian of the [[underworld]]. Prior to her post-mortem [[Apotheosis|deification]], the historical Oya was a princess of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] clan as the consort of [[Shango]], its reigning [[king]]. She is often depicted with leopard-like spots, these being either [[wikt:war paint|war paint]] or ritual [[scarification]]. This is done for propaganda purposes, as the [[Leopard]] is famous in Yoruba folklore for its cunning.
*[[Madam Tinubu]] was a powerful titled aristocrat in [[Colonial Nigeria]]. As the first [[Queen mothers  (Africa)#Yoruba tradition|Iyalode]] of [[Egbaland]], she and her private battalion fought against the  [[Dahomey]]ans when they invaded [[Abeokuta]] in the 1850s and the 1860s.

===Nubia/Kush (Sudanese) history===
*The legendary [[Candace of Meroe]] (a title, her real name never given) was a warrior queen in the [[Alexander Romance]] who caused [[Alexander The Great]] himself to retreat upon witnessing the army she'd gathered. This however may be classified a non-historical account because Alexander never reached Sudan.

While devotions to Marishi-ten predate [[Zen]], they appear to be geared towards a similar meditative mode in order to enable the warrior to achieve a more heightened spiritual level. He lost interest in the issues of victory or defeat (or life and death), thus transcending to a level where he became so empowered that he was freed from his own grasp on mortality. The end result was that he became a better warrior.
*[[Kaihime]] (presumably born 1572) was said to have fought during the Siege of Odawara and to have personally crushed a rebellion, earning her father the respect of [[Hideyoshi Toyotomi]]. However, historians aren't entirely sure if she truly did accomplish those events.

[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]] was the daughter of one of the chiefs of [[Bani Assad]] tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.

When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.

*Tanit is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling "Tanith", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal ("face of Baal") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).

===Kittur Chennamma===
*[[Kittur Chennamma]] (1778–1829) was the queen of the princely state of Kittur in Karnataka. Her legacy and first victory are still commemorated in Kittur, during the Kittur Utsava of every 22–24 October. The festival is similar to the Mysore Dasara.

===Rani Lakshmibai===
*[[Rani Lakshmibai]] known as Jhansi Ki Rani, was the queen of the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha-ruled]] the princely state of Jhansi, was one of the leading figures of the India  Rebellion of 1857, and a symbol of resistance to British rule in India.

===Rani Durgavati===
*[[Rani Durgavati]] was born in the family of famous [[Rajput]] Chandel Emperor Keerat Rai.

===Keladi Chennamma===
*[[Keladi Chennamma]] was the daughter of Siddappa Setty of Kundapur. She became the queen of Keladi Nayaka dynasty who fought the Mughal Army of Aurangzeb from her base in the kingdom of Keladi in the Shimoga district of Karnataka State, India. Her rule lasted for 25 years and Keladi kingdom was probably the last to lose autonomy to Mysore rulers and subsequently to British.

===Belawadi Mallamma===
*[[Belawadi Mallamma]], to defend her husband's kingdom, she fought against the Maratha king [[Shivaji Maharaj]].

===Unniyarcha===
*[[Unniyarcha]]: She was a chekava/[[Ezhava]] woman warrior from [[Kerala]] famous for her valour and beauty.

===Hinduism===
*[[Durga]] ({{lang-sa|"the inaccessible"&lt;ref&gt;"Durga." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 25 February  2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9363243/Durga"&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;}} or "the invincible",&lt;ref&gt;"Durga" Sanatan Society &lt;http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses/durga.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bn|দুর্গা}}) is a form of [[Devi]], the supreme [[goddess]] of [[Hinduism]]. According to the narrative from the [[Devi Mahatmya]] of the [[Markandeya Purana]], the form of Durga was created as a warrior goddess to fight a demon. The nine-day holiday dedicated to Durga, ''The [[Durga Puja]],'' is the biggest annual festival in [[Bengal]] and other parts of Eastern India and is celebrated by Hindus all over the world.
*[[Kālī]] ({{lang-sa|काली}}, {{IPA-sa|kɑːliː|IPA}}; {{lang-bn|কালী}}; {{lang-pa|ਕਾਲੀ}};  {{lang-si|කාලි}}; {{lang-te|కాళికాదేవి}}; {{lang-kn|ಕಾಳಿ ಮಾತಾ}}; {{lang-ta|காளி}}), also known as '''{{IAST|Kālikā}}''' ({{lang-sa|कालिका}}, {{lang-bn|কালিকা}}), is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[goddess]] associated with empowerment, [[shakti]]. The name Kali comes from ''kāla'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, and thus another name for [[Shiva]]. Kali means "the black one".  Although sometimes presented as dark and violent, her earliest incarnation as a figure of annihilation still has some influence. In Kāli's most famous myth, [[Durga]] and her assistants, the [[Matrikas]], wound the demon [[Raktabija]], in various ways and with a variety of weapons in an attempt to destroy him.  They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kinsley p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.
* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] ("the killer of demon Chanda and Munda") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] ("Mothers").
*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made. Afterwards, she returned to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpoc.org/library/1976_05_015.asp|title=A Brief Review of the History of Amputations and Prostheses Earl E.

[[Saint]] '''Lupus of Sens''' (or '''Saint Loup de Sens''') (born c. 573; died c. 623)&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA716#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Sens |first=Georges |last=Goyau |editor1-last=Herberman |editor1-first=Charles G.|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia|The Catholic Encyclopedia]] |others=Volume 13: Revelation–Simon Stock |publisher=The Encyclopedia Press |location=New York |year=1913 |page=716|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an early French [[bishop of Sens]].

He was the son of Betton, Count of Tonnerre, "[[Blessed Betto]]," a member of the [[royal house]] of the [[Kingdom of Burgundy]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Church in Saint-Loup-de-Naud==

The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church dedicated to Saint Loup at [[Saint-Loup-de-Naud|Naud]], 8&amp;nbsp;km from [[Provins]] in Champagne in the east of France is distinguished by the outstanding sculptures in the porch of its great doorway, with an ambitious [[iconography|iconographic program]] in which Saint Loup mediates entry into the mystery of the [[Trinity]]. About 980, Sevinus, [[archbishop of Sens]], made a gift to the [[Benedictine order|Benedictine community]] of the [[abbey of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif]] at Sens of four altars ''in villa que dicitus Naudus, in honore sancti lupi consecratum''&amp;mdash;"in the demesne that is called Naud, consecrated in honor of Saint Loup"&amp;mdash;betokening the presence of a shrine already on this site, a priory under the direction of the abbot of Saint-Pierre-le-Vif. Other documents mention [[Saint-Loup-de-Naud]] among the possessions of the abbey at Sens, seat of an archbishop with close political ties to the French Crown, who had Paris within his diocese. Thus, though it lay so close to Provins, a seat of the [[counts of Champagne]] and the abbey church was completed by Henri le Libéral, comte de Champagne, the priory at Saint-Loup-de-Naud looked to Sens for its patronage: a visit from the abbot is documented in 1120. In 1160/61 Hugues de Toucy, Archbishop of Sens, presented to the priory the relic of Saint Loup, brought from the abbey of Sainte-Colombe, to that community's dismay;&lt;ref&gt;William W. Kibler, ed., ''Medieval France: an encyclopedia'', ''s.v.'' "Saint-Loup-de-Naud".&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpted ''portail'' with an iconography comparable to the royal portal at [[Chartres]]&lt;ref&gt;Clark Maines, ''The Western Portals at Saint-Loup-de-Naud'', (New York: Garland) 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; was doubtless undertaken shortly thereafter, when [[pilgrimage]]s brought wealth to the community.

The priory was laid waste by the English in 1432, during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and again by the [[Huguenots]] in 1567, during the [[French Wars of Religion]].

==Other saints Lupus/Loup==

Numerous communes of France are named Saint-Loup;&lt;ref&gt;For a full list of French places with this name, see [[Saint-Loup (disambiguation)|Saint-Loup]]. There is also a Saint-Loup in [[Namur (city)|Namur]], Belgium, and another in Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; they commemorate several venerable early saints with the Latinized Germanic name of ''Lupus'' ("wolf"): besides Saint Loup de Sens, venerated in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], [[Île-de-France]] and [[Picardy]] there are [[Lupus of Troyes|Saint Loup de Troyes]], Saint Loup de [[Bayeux]], one of the early Bishops of Bayeux; and—more locally venerated—Saint Loup de [[Limoges]], Saint Loup de [[Soissons]], and Saint Loup de [[Châlons-en-Champagne]]. A number of the communes called Saint-Loup in the west of France are not easily connected with a specific Saint Loup.

[[Image:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Man in the Moon is struck by a spacecraft in the 1902 fantasy film ''[[Le Voyage dans la Lune]]'']]
The '''Man in the Moon''' refers to any of several [[Pareidolia|pareidolic images]] of a human face, head or body that certain traditions recognize in the disc of the [[full moon]]. The images are composed of the dark areas of the [[Lunar mare|lunar ''maria'']], or "seas" and the lighter highlands of the lunar surface.

==Origin==
[[File:Man In The Moon2.png|thumb|right|200px|Possible interpretations of the Man in the Moon]]
There are various explanations for how the Man in the Moon came to be.

A longstanding European tradition holds that the man was banished to the moon for some crime. Christian lore commonly held that he is the man caught gathering sticks on the Sabbath and sentenced by God to death by stoning in the book of Numbers XV.32-36.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, the Rev. Timothy, FRAS (1885). ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ml/ml00.htm Moon Lore]'', London; Swan Sonnenschein, Le Bas &amp; Lowry. p.21. Archived at [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]. Retrieved March 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Germanic cultures thought he was a man caught stealing from a neighbor's hedgerow to repair his own.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} There is a Roman legend that he is a sheep-thief.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

One medieval Christian tradition claims him to be [[Cain]], the Wanderer, forever doomed to circle the Earth. [[Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]''&lt;ref name="Inferno126"&gt;[[Dante]], [[The Divine Comedy]], [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], canto 20, [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&amp;cmd=Search&amp;commentary%5B%5D=0&amp;language=any&amp;cantica=1&amp;canto=20&amp;line=126 line 126] and [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&amp;cmd=Search&amp;commentary%5B%5D=0&amp;language=any&amp;cantica=1&amp;canto=20&amp;line=127 127]. The Dante Dartmouth Project contains the original text and centuries of commentary.&lt;/ref&gt; alludes to this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine
On either hemisphere, touching the wave
Beneath the towers of [[Seville]]. Yesternight
The moon was round.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is mentioned again in his ''[[The Divine Comedy#Paradiso|Paradise]]'':&lt;ref name="Paradise"&gt;Dante, The Divine Comedy, Paradiso, canto 2, [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&amp;cmd=Search&amp;commentary%5B%5D=0&amp;language=any&amp;cantica=3&amp;canto=2&amp;line=51 line 51].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
But tell, I [[pray thee]], whence the gloomy spots
Upon this body, which below on earth
Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is also a [[Talmud]]ic tradition that the image of [[Jacob]] is engraved on the moon,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, Elliot R. "The Face of Jacob in the Moon" in ''The Seductiveness of Jewish Myth: Challenge or Response?'' edited by S. Daniel Breslauer, Albany NY; SUNY Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; although no such mention appears in the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;Harley, the Rev. Timothy, FRAS (1885). ''Moon Lore'', London; Swan Sonnenschein, Le Bas &amp; Lowry. P.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harley, Timothy (1885). [http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/ml/ml06.htm "II. THE MAN IN THE MOON."] [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]. Retrieved March 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Lyly]] says in the prologue to his ''[[Endymion (play)|Endymion]]'' (1591), ''"There liveth none under the sunne, that knows what to make of the man in the moone."''&lt;ref&gt;Child, Clarence Griffin (1894). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fmAvAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA118 John Lyly and Euphuism]''. Erlangen [etc.]: A. Deichert. p. 118. {{OCLC|1014813258}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norse mythology]], [[Máni]] is the male personification of the moon who crosses the sky in a horse-drawn carriage. He is continually pursued by the Great Wolf [[Hati Hróðvitnisson|Hati]] who catches him at [[Ragnarök]]. ''Máni'' simply means "Moon".

In [[Chinese mythology]], the goddess [[Chang'e]] is stranded upon the moon after foolishly consuming a double dose of an [[elixir of life|immortality potion]]. In some versions of the myth she is accompanied by Yu Tu, a [[moon rabbit]].&lt;ref&gt;Xueting Christine Ni (2018). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ck9UDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 From Kuan Yin to Chairman Mao: The Essential Guide to Chinese Deities]''. Red Wheel/Weiser. pp. 40–43. {{ISBN|1578636256}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Haida mythology]], the figure represents a boy gathering sticks. The boy's father had told him the moon's light would brighten the night, allowing the chore to be completed. Not wanting to gather sticks, the boy complained and ridiculed the moon. As punishment for his disrespect, the boy was taken from Earth and trapped on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;(1899). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=S8U4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA704 Report of the 68th Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1898]''. 1899. London: Murray. p. 704.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=605508 ''The Hydah mission, Queen Charlotte's Islands''] Charles Harrison, [[Church Missionary Society]] c. 1884{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
There is a traditional belief that the Man in the Moon enjoyed drinking, especially claret. An old [[ballad]] runs (original spelling):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Our man in the moon drinks clarret,
With powder-beef, turnep, and carret.
If he doth so, why should not you
Drink until the sky looks blew?&lt;ref&gt;''The Man in the Moon drinks Claret'', as it was sung at the Court in Holy-well. ''Bagford Ballads'', ''Folio Collection'' in the [[British Museum]], vol. ii. No. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the English Middle Ages and renaissance, the moon was held to be the god of drunkards, and at least three London taverns were named "The Man in the Moone".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Poole |first=William |contribution=Introduction |title=The Man in the Moone |year=2009 |editor-last=Poole |editor-first=William |pages=13–62 |publisher=Broadview |isbn=978-1-55111-896-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The man in the moon is named in an early dated English [[nursery rhyme]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The man in the moon came tumbling down
And asked his way to [[Norwich]];
He went by the south and burnt his mouth
With supping cold pease porridge.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Examples and occurrence globally==
One tradition sees a figure of a man carrying a wide burden on his back. He is sometimes seen as accompanied by a small dog.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Ben (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MYasNyKQIxMC&amp;pg=PA143 Foothold in the Heavens: The Seventies]''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media. p. 143. {{ISBN|1441963421}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various cultures recognise other examples of [[lunar pareidolia]], such as the [[Moon rabbit]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Terri Windling|Windling, Terri]]. "[https://www.webcitation.org/67AkEBAkB?url=http://www.endicott-studio.com/rdrm/rrRabbits.html The Symbolism of Rabbits and Hares]" Retrieved September 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Northern Hemisphere, a common Western perception of the face has it that the figure's eyes are [[Mare Imbrium]] and [[Mare Serenitatis]], its nose is [[Sinus Aestuum]], and its open mouth is [[Mare Nubium]] and [[Mare Cognitum]].&lt;ref&gt;Skilling, Tom (January 20, 2017). "[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/weather/ct-wea-0121-asktom-20170120-column.html Ask Tom: What creates the 'man in the moon'? ]". ''Chicago Tribune''. Retrieved September 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular human face can also be seen in tropical regions on both sides of the [[equator]]. However, the moon orientation associated with the face is observed less frequently—and eventually not at all—as one moves toward the [[South Pole]].

Conventionalized illustrations of the Man in the Moon seen in Western art often show a very simple face in the full moon, or a human profile in the crescent moon, corresponding to no actual markings.

"The Man in the Moon" can also refer to a mythological character said to live on or in the moon, but who is not necessarily represented by the markings on the face of the moon. An example is [[Yue-Laou]], from [[China|Chinese]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Xueting Christine Ni (2018). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ck9UDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141 From Kuan Yin to Chairman Mao: The Essential Guide to Chinese Deities]''. Red Wheel/Weiser. p. 141. {{ISBN|1578636256}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Man in the Moone]], by [[Francis Godwin]] is one of the earliest novels thought of as containing several traits prototypical of [[science fiction]].

==Scientific explanation==
The Man in the Moon is made up of various lunar maria (which ones depend on the pareidolic image seen). These vast, flat spots on the Moon are called "maria" or "seas" because, for a long time, astronomers believed they were large bodies of water. They are large areas formed by lava that covered up old craters and then cooled, becoming smooth, [[basalt]] rock.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Philip S., and Edward Pascuzzi (1994). ''Astronomy for All Ages: Discovering the Universe through Activities for Children and Adults''. Old Saybrook, CT: Globe Pequot.&lt;/ref&gt;

The near side of the Moon, containing these maria that make up the man, is always facing Earth. This is due to a [[tidal locking]] or synchronous orbit. Thought to have occurred because of the gravitational forces partially caused by the Moon's oblong shape, its rotation has slowed to the point where it rotates exactly once on each trip around the Earth. This causes the near side of the Moon to always turn its face toward Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caltech.edu/content/looking-man-moon | title=Looking at the Man in the Moon | website=www.caltech.edu | publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]] | accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natascha Maria Kampusch''' (born 17 February 1988) is an Austrian woman who was [[Child abduction|abducted]] at the age of 10 on 2 March 1998 and held in a secret [[Basement|cellar]] by her [[Kidnapping|kidnapper]] [[Wolfgang Přiklopil]] for more than eight years, until she escaped on 23 August 2006. She has written a book about her ordeal, ''3,096 Days'' (2010), upon which the 2013 German film ''[[3096]]'' is based.

== Early years and family ==
Kampusch was raised by her mother, Brigitta Sirny (née Kampusch), and her father, Ludwig Koch, in [[Vienna]], Austria. Her early life with her mother was reportedly not a happy one, according to Ludwig Adamovich, head of a special commission looking into possible police failures in the investigation of the kidnapping. He claimed that "the time Kampusch was imprisoned might have been better for her than what she experienced before", a statement absolutely denied by Brigitta Sirny, who threatened to sue the commission chief over his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2009-08-05/15306/Kampusch_mum_may_sue_commission_chief |title=Kampusch mum may sue commission chief – General News – Austrian Times Online News – English Newspaper |publisher=Austriantimes.at |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her family included two adult sisters, and five nieces and nephews. Sirny and Koch separated while Kampusch was still a child and divorced after her abduction. Kampusch spent time with both of them, and had returned to her mother's home from a holiday with Koch the day before her kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Kidnapping ==
The 10-year-old Kampusch left her family's residence in [[Vienna]]'s [[Donaustadt]] district on the morning of 2 March 1998, but failed to arrive at school or come home. A 12-year-old witness reported having seen her being dragged into a white minibus by two men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Captivity ===
During the eight years of her captivity, Kampusch was held in a small cellar underneath Přiklopil's garage. The entrance was concealed behind a cupboard. The cellar only had {{convert|5|sqm}} of space. It had a door made of concrete and was reinforced with steel. The room had no windows and was soundproof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5285048.stm | title = Inside the Austrian girl's 'dungeon' | publisher = BBC Online | date=25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first six months of her captivity, Kampusch was not allowed to leave the chamber at any time, and for several years of her captivity she was not allowed to leave the tiny space at night. Afterwards, she spent increasing amounts of time upstairs in the rest of the house, but each night was sent back to the chamber to sleep, as well as while Přiklopil was at work.

In later years, she was seen outside in the garden alone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=William J. |last= Kole |url=http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyNiZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5NTMxNDk1MiZ5cmlyeTdmNzE3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTY= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514045312/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkyNiZmZ2JlbDdmN3ZxZWVFRXl5NTMxNDk1MiZ5cmlyeTdmNzE3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTY= |archivedate=14 May 2007 |title=Neighbors say they saw captive girl alone outside|publisher=NorthJersey.com|date=30 August 2006|accessdate=4 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Přiklopil's business partner has said that Kampusch seemed relaxed and happy when she and Přiklopil called at his home to borrow a trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last = Leidig |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2335782,00.html |title=Kidnapper's friend says he met 'cheerful' Natascha |publisher=The Times |date=31 August 2006 |accessdate=2 September 2006 | location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227130950/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article623344.ece |archive-date=27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oesterreich.orf.at/wien/stories/133065|title=Die Erklärung von Ernst H. im Wortlaut (The explanation by Ernst Holzapfel in his wording)|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)]] (online)|date=30 August 2006 |accessdate=1 October 2006|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--important--&gt; After her eighteenth birthday, she was allowed to leave the house with Přiklopil, but her kidnapper threatened to kill her if she made any noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last= Leidig |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2337830,00.html|title=Natascha tells of abductor's violence and terrifying lies|publisher=The Times|date=1 September 2006|accessdate=2 September 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later took her on a skiing trip to a resort near Vienna for a few hours.

According to Kampusch's official statement after her escape, she and Přiklopil would get up early each morning to have breakfast together. Přiklopil gave her books, so she educated herself.&lt;!-- important: http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/:Fall-Kampusch-Verlies-Schule/569880.html --&gt; Later, when explaining that in general she did not feel she had missed anything during her imprisonment, she noted, "I spared myself many things, I did not start smoking or drinking and I did not hang out in bad company". But she also said: "I always had the thought: surely I didn't come into the world so I could be locked up and my life completely ruined. I give up in despair about this unfairness. I always felt like a poor chicken in a hen house. You saw my dungeon on television and in the media. Thus you know how small it was.

=== Escape ===
The 18-year-old Kampusch reappeared on 23 August 2006. At 12:53&amp;nbsp;pm, when Kampusch was cleaning and vacuuming her kidnapper's [[BMW 850]]i automobile in the garden, Přiklopil got a call on his mobile phone.  Because of the vacuuming noise, he walked away to take the call. Kampusch left the vacuum cleaner running and ran away, unseen by Přiklopil, who, according to the caller, completed the phone call without any sign of being disturbed or distracted. Kampusch ran for some 200&amp;nbsp;metres through gardens and a street, jumping fences, and asking passers-by to call the police, but they paid her no attention. After about five minutes, she knocked on the window of a 71-year-old neighbour known as Inge T, saying, "I am Natascha Kampusch".&lt;ref name="elkins"&gt;{{cite news

Sabine Freudenberger, the first police officer to speak to Kampusch after her ordeal, said that she was astonished by her "intelligence, her [[vocabulary]]". After two years, Přiklopil had brought her books, newspapers and a radio, which she kept tuned mainly to [[Ö1 International|Ö1]], an [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] station that is known for promoting education and classical music. She also states that she constantly had a feeling that she lacked something: "a deficit. So I wanted to make that better and I tried to educate myself, to teach myself skills.

Přiklopil, knowing that the police were after him, killed himself by jumping in front of a [[Vienna S-Bahn|suburban train]] near the [[Wien Nord]] station in [[Vienna]].

'''Wolfgang Přiklopil''' (14 May 1962 – 23 August 2006) was an [[Austria]]n communications technician of [[Czech people|Czech]] origin. Přiklopil was born to Karl and Waltraud Přiklopil, in [[Vienna]], and was an only child. His father, Karl, was a cognac salesman and his mother, Waltraud, a shoe saleswoman.&lt;ref name="GUARD1206"&gt;{{cite news|title=The silence of the lamb|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2099-2483706_2,00.html|accessdate=10 December 2006| location=London|author=Patrick Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Přiklopil worked for a time at [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] as a communications technician.

Evidence recovery was complicated by the fact that Přiklopil's only computer was a 1980s Commodore 64, which is incompatible with modern-day data recovery programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/austria/article/0,,1865500,00.html|title=Kidnapper's retro computer offers scant clues|author=Mark Oliver|date=5 September 2006|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried under the name "Karl Wendelberger" on 8 September 2006 in the Piplitz family grave plot{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} in the town of [[Laxenburg]], south of Vienna.

Přiklopil allegedly had a daughter with the sister of a business partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2303168/Natascha-Kampuschs-father-names-second-kidnapper-claims-police-covered-errors-search-daughter-explosive-new-book.html|title=Natascha Kampusch's father names a second kidnapper and claims police covered up errors in the search for his daughter in explosive new book|author=Allan Hall|date=3 April 2013|work=Daily Mail|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Kampusch escaped, Přiklopil was trying to procure false papers as a Czech citizen, in order to "begin a new life" with Kampusch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/crooked-nose-drove-kampusch-kidnapper-claims-his-best-friend-2044822.html Crooked nose drove Kampusch kidnapper claims his best friend], The Independent&lt;/ref&gt;

She said "I feel more and more sorry for him—he's a poor soul", in spite of the fact that he held her captive for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6958733.stm |title=Ex-kidnap girl attracts media glare |publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=23 August 2007|accessdate=23 August 2007 | first=Tristana | last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to police she "cried inconsolably" when she was told he was dead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14497151/ |title=Kidnapped girl weeps for dead 'master' &amp;ndash; World news &amp;ndash; Europe |publisher=MSNBC |date=26 August 2006 |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lit a candle for him at the morgue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5327772.stm |title=Natascha abductor buried secretly |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=8 September 2006|accessdate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has, however, referred to her captor as a "criminal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Kate|last=Connolly |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/07/wnatascha07.xml|title=Kidnapped Austrian Teenager Thought ‘Only of Escape' |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=7 September 2006|accessdate=7 September 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers quoting unnamed psychologists suggested Kampusch may suffer from [[Stockholm syndrome]],&lt;!-- a new so called Vienna syndrome, see also:http://www.zeit.de/2006/39/Titel-Richter-39?page=all --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://a.abcnews.com/GMA/story?id=2379231&amp;page=1 |title=Escaped Austrian Teen May Have Stockholm Syndrome |publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=31 August 2006|accessdate=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5280472.stm |title=Austrian girl 'found' after years |publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=24 August 2006 |accessdate=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Kampusch, in her book ''3096 Tage'' (''3,096 Days'') says this is not the case.  She suggests that people who use this term about her are disrespectful of her and do not allow her the right to describe and analyse the complex relationship she had with her kidnapper in her own words.

In 2009, Kampusch became the new face of [[animal rights]] group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] in Austria. In June, Kampusch wrote to [[Ilse Aigner]], agriculture minister in Germany where the campaign is based, demanding freedom for zoo animals, stating: "The animals would, if they could, flee as I did, because a life in captivity is a life full of deprivation. It is up to you whether social, intelligent and wonderful creatures are to be freed from their chains and cages where ruthless people keep them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1194077/Cellar-victim-Natascha-Kampusch-strip-animal-rights.html Cellar victim Natascha Kampusch may strip for animal rights], [[Daily Mail]], 19 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Vienna's public prosecutor stated that DNA tests and questioning of witnesses had led to theories being discounted that Přiklopil had an accomplice. Kampusch has also maintained that her captor acted alone.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, 8 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interviews ===
After reportedly "hundreds of requests for an interview" with the teenager, "with media outlets offering vast sums of money", Kampusch was interviewed by Austrian public broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]. The interview was broadcast on 6 September 2006 with her approval.&lt;!-- Wednesday, 18:15 (UTC) and a copy by RTL Television: 19:15 (UTC) --&gt; ORF did not pay for its interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5313762.stm|title=Kidnap girl to give TV interview |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=4 September 2006|accessdate=4 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said any proceeds from selling the interview to other channels would be forwarded to Kampusch. The interview was sold to more than 120 countries at a fee of 290 euros per minute. This money, estimated to some hundred thousand euros,&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.extradienst.at/jaos/page/main_heute.tmpl?article_id=18721&amp;offset=0&lt;/ref&gt; was to be donated to women in Africa and Mexico by Kampusch. Likewise she was planning projects to help these women.&lt;ref&gt;''Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung'': Natascha Kampusch - the interview, 7 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was enormous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1446532.ece|title=Natascha Kampusch: 400 interview requests — that was just the start|work=The Independent|date=11 September 2006|accessdate=11 September 2006|location=London|first=Alexandra|last=Buxton|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008134748/http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1446532.ece|archivedate=8 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper ''[[Kronen Zeitung]]'' and news magazine ''[[NEWS (Austrian magazine)|NEWS]]'' also interviewed Kampusch. The interview was published on 6 September 2006. Both press interviews were given in return for a package including housing support, a long-term job offer, and help with her education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=2574050|title=Kampusch spricht – am Boulevard|publisher=[[Der Standard|derStandard.at]] |date=6 September 2006|accessdate=8 September 2006|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revelations of mistakes in the interior ministry's investigation of her kidnapping came to light, as well as statements of a policeman which were repeatedly ignored in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On 16 June 2008, the newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' published an in-depth interview with Kampusch by Bojan Pancevski and [[Stefanie Marsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article4044283.ece?print=yes |title=Natascha Kampusch: from darkness to limelight |accessdate=16 June 2008 |last=Pancevski |first=Bojan |author2=Marsh, Stefanie |date=2 June 2008 |publisher=[[The Times|Times Online]] |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615175158/http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article4044283.ece?print=yes |archivedate=15 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 February 2010, the British TV channel [[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]] broadcast an hour-long documentary about the case, including an exclusive interview with Kampusch:  ''Natascha: the Girl in the Cellar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Jane|title=Natascha: The girl in the Cellar, FIVE, 8pm|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-previews/natascha-the-girl-in-the-cellar-five-8pm-201922|accessdate=13 March 2017|work=the Daily Mirror|publisher=MGN Limited|date=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natascha: The Girl In The Cellar|url=http://www.documentarytube.com/videos/natascha-the-girl-in-the-cellar|website=DocumentaryTube|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Books ===
The book ''Girl in the Cellar: the Natascha Kampusch Story''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Girl-Cellar-Natascha-Kampusch-Story/dp/0340936487 |title=Girl in the Cellar |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Allan Hall and Michael Leidig appeared in November 2006, written in English. Kampusch's lawyer described the book as being both speculative and premature, and therefore planned to take legal action against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,451732,00.html Skandal-Buch über entführte Natascha erzürnt Familie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711143400/http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,451732,00.html |date=11 July 2007 }}, ''Der Spiegel,'' 30. November 2006. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with two journalists, Kampusch's mother Brigitta Sirny wrote a book about the ordeal, ''Verzweifelte Jahre'' ("Desperate Years"). Kampusch appeared at the initial presentation of the book in August 2007, but did not want to be photographed or interviewed. Sirny writes that she did not have much contact with Kampusch after the escape because Kampusch was shielded from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,499269,00.html "Natürlich verdiene ich daran"] ''Spiegel Online,'' 10 August 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kampusch wrote a book about her ordeal, ''3096 Tage'' (''3,096 Days''), published in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/entfuehrungsfall-kampusch-schreibt-autobiografie_aid_522314.html Entführungsfall: Kampusch schreibt Autobiografie] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted into a German movie, ''[[3096]]'', in 2013.

On 12 August 2016 Natascha Kampusch released her second book titled ''10 Years of Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kampusch|first1=Natascha|title=10 Jahre Freiheit" {{!}} Natascha Kampusch|url=http://natascha-kampusch.at/das-neue-buch-von-natascha-kampusch-10-jahre-freiheit/|website=natascha-kampusch.at|accessdate=13 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Saying No to defeat is the only way to survive" – Interview with Natascha Kampusch|url=http://www.moonproject.co.uk/saying-no-to-defeat-is-the-only-way-to-survive-interview-with-natascha-kampusch/|website=MoonProject|accessdate=13 March 2017|date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media endeavors ===
Kampusch established her own website containing personal information including pictures of herself on 5 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natascha-kampusch.at/|title=Natascha Kampusch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had her own talk show on the new Austria TV channel, PULS 4,&lt;!--http://www.puls4.com--&gt; starting on 1 June 2008&lt;!--http://www.kurier.at/kultur/163008.php--&gt;. The show had the working title of ''In Conversation with…Natascha Kampusch'' and eventually premiered as ''Natascha Kampusch trifft'' (''Natascha Kampusch meets...'').&lt;ref name="tvshow"&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/programming/a81588/kidnapped-austrian-girl-to-host-own-show.html Kidnapped Austrian girl to host own show] Digital Spy, 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/medien/380538/index.do |title=DiePresse.com |publisher=DiePresse.com |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for only three shows.

On 17 June 2010, German film-maker and director [[Bernd Eichinger]] announced that he was making a film based on Kampusch's captivity and wanted [[Kate Winslet]] to star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/17/kate-winslet-natascha-kampusch | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Natascha Kampusch film director eyes Kate Winslet as lead | first=Xan | last=Brooks | date=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernd Eichinger died on 24 January 2011; Kampusch attended his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=German filmmaker Bernd Eichinger dies at 61|work=Reuters|date=25 January 2011|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/25/us-eichinger-idUSTRE70O7W420110125|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Austrian film ''[[Michael (2011 Austrian film)|Michael]]'', which has a plot that resembles the Natascha Kampusch case, was released.

On 15 April 2012, a German newspaper reported that a movie based on her autobiography with the same name was to be made, featuring [[Antonia Campbell-Hughes]] as Kampusch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Film review: Natascha Kampusch’s eight years in captivity – distilled into 111 minutes of cinematic brutality in 3096 Days|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=March 2015|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/film-review-natascha-kampuschs-eight-years-in-captivity--distilled-into-111-minutes-of-cinematic-brutality-in-3096-days-8517557.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thure Lindhardt]] as Přiklopil.

=== House ===
[[File:Das Haus von Wolfgang Priklopil.jpg|thumb|Wolfgang Přiklopil's house in [[Strasshof]]]]
The house where Kampusch was imprisoned was built by Přiklopil's grandfather, Oskar Přiklopil, after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="GUARD1206"/&gt; During the [[Cold War]] period, Oskar and his son Karl built a [[Air-raid shelter|bomb shelter]], thought to be the origin of Kampusch's dungeon.  Přiklopil took over the house in 1984 following his grandmother's death.

Kampusch now owns the house in which she was imprisoned, saying, "I know it's grotesque – I must now pay for electricity, water and taxes on a house I never wanted to live in". It was reported that she claimed the house from Přiklopil's estate because she wanted to protect it from vandals and being torn down; she also noted that she has visited it since her escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1316125,00.html|title=Kidnap Victim Owns Her House of Horrors|publisher=Sky News|date=15 May 2008|accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the third anniversary of her escape approached, it was revealed she had become a regular visitor at the property and was cleaning it out possibly to move in herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |title=Kampusch to auction off horror house items – Panorama – Austrian Times |work= |accessdate=15 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/688Ynv8tb?url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-30/15162/Kampusch_to_auction_off_horror_house_items |archivedate=3 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Kampusch said she had retained the house because it was such a big part of her formative years, also stating that she would fill in the cellar if it is ever sold, adamant that it will never become a macabre museum to her lost adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1245899/Natascha-Kampusch-If-I-sell-house-I-held-captive-half-years-I-make-sure-cellar-filled-in.html Natascha Kampusch: He put me inside the cellar for eight-and-a-half years, preserved alive like an Egyptian pharaoh], ''Daily Mail''.

A '''necronym''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words νεκρός, ''nekros'', "dead" and ὄνομα ''ónoma'', "name") is a reference to, or [[name]] of, a person who has [[death|died]].  Many [[culture]]s have [[taboo]]s and [[tradition]]s associated with referring to such a person.  These vary from the extreme of never again speaking the person's real name, often using some [[wikt:circumlocution|circumlocution]] instead, to the opposite extreme of commemorating it incessantly by naming other things or people after the deceased.

For instance, in some cultures it is common for a newborn child to receive the name (a necronym) of a [[family|relative]] who has recently died, while in others to reuse such a name would be considered extremely inappropriate or even forbidden. While this varies from culture to culture, the use of necronyms is quite common.

==Examples==
Composer [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], born in 1770, had a brother named Ludwig Maria who was born in 1769 and lived for only six days. [[Vincent van Gogh]] had a brother of the same name who was born, and died, on March 30, 1852, exactly one year before the painter's birth. The artist [[Salvador Dalí]] was born nine months and ten days after his brother, also named Salvador, died from gastroenteritis at the age of one year and nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Believer - What's in a Necronym?|url = http://www.believermag.com/issues/201508/?read=article_vanasco|website = The Believer|date = 2015-08-01|accessdate = 2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish culture, it is a custom to name a child after a beloved relative who died as a way of honoring the deceased. Often the child will share the same [[Hebrew name]] as the namesake but not the given name in the vernacular language (e.g. English).

In [[Culture of Japan|Japan]], [[Buddhist]] families usually obtain a necronym, called a ''[[Dharma name|kaimyō]]'', for a deceased relative from a Buddhist priest in exchange for a donation to the temple.  Traditionally, the deceased were thereafter referred to by the necronym, as a sign of pious respect.  This name was often the only one inscribed on [[gravestone]]s in the past, though now it is more common to have the necronym in addition to the given name.

Necronyms were also commonly used during the [[Cold War]] as a means of protecting an [[intelligence officer]]'s true identity. For example, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]] agent [[Konon Molody]] was only known as Gordon Lonsdale (the true Lonsdale was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] born two years after Molody and died in 1943 when he was 19) in the United States. Molody adopted the name when he was 32, 11 years after the real Lonsdale's death.

==Historiography==
The practice of bestowing necronyms has sometimes caused confusion for [[historian]]s. This is primarily because of the two birth certificates or records that could be present at a given time. This confusion often stems from the inability to differentiate the records of each child. One such example is the case of [[Shigechiyo Izumi]] (1865?–1986), accepted in 1986 as the world's oldest man by ''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book of World Records]]'', but who was in fact possibly born in 1880, after one previous brother whose name he assumed upon his death.

According to the legend, a group of settlers led by a figure named Nunong Karugtong crossed the Sierra Madre Mountains from somewhere in what is now Rizal Province in search of better living conditions.  After examining multiple sites in what is now the Municipality of Infanta, they eventually settled on a site near the Bantilan River, where the discovery of a huge Yam root convinced them that the site was ideal for settlement.  This eventually became the site of the settlement which European colonizers would call "Binangonan de Lampon," which in turn would evolve into the Municipality of Infanta.&lt;ref name="infantagov"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4226">A '''patrial name''' or '''geographical surname''' is a surname or second [[cognomen]] given to person deriving from a [[toponym]], the name for a geographical place. It was particularly common in ancient Greece and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The New Century classical handbook Catherine B. Avery - 1962 "Toponyms (place names) also appear: Coriolanus, Norbanus, Sabinus, Soranus, Tusculanus.&lt;/ref&gt;
The lack of a family [[surname]] and use of a geographical cognomen as a surname may the sign of a lower class, such as courtesans when signing a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Molière: A Theatrical Life - Page 42 Virginia Scott - 2002 "Taviani identifies Lucrezia as a courtesan because of her name that, in the fashion of courtesans, joins a Roman first name to a geographical surname and because the contract was signed in a house owned or leased by her at a time when  "&lt;/ref&gt; With medieval writers, Christian, Jewish and Muslim, whose works circulated around many countries, geographical cognomens sometimes served to distinguish better than "son of," "ben" or "ibn." 

Roman Military commanders often took a second cognomen, an [[agnomen]], recalling a victorious campaign: Africanus, Asiaticus, Macedonicus, Numantinus. These may be inherited as in the case of [[Augustus]] who inherited the cognomen Thurinus.

==Formation==
Examples in formation of patrial names include:

1. definite article and noun - using a [[demonym]] (also called [[gentile name]] or [[gentilic]], from Latin ''[[nomen gentile]]'' or ''[[gentilicium]]'')
* [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras the Athenian]] (''Athenagoras o Athenaios,'' Ἀθηναγόρας ὁ Ἀθηναῖος).
* [[Saul of Tarsus]] "Saul the Tarsian" (''Saulos o Tarseus'', Σαῦλος [ὁ] Ταρσεύς)
* [[Lucius of Cyrene|Lucius the Cyrenian]] (''Loukios o Kurenaios'' Λούκιος ὁ Κυρηναῖος)
* [[Trophimus]] "called the Ephesian" (''Trofimos o Efesios'', Τρόφιμος ὁ Ἐφέσιος)
* [[Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī|Ibn Muadh al-Jayyani]] (989-1079) "al Jayyani", the man of [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]]
* [[Isaac Alfasi]] (1013-1103) "al Fasi", the man of [[Fez, Morocco]]

2. unclear: indefinite noun / adjectival forms
* [[Mary Magdalene]], "Mary of [[Magdala]]" (Greek ''Maria Magadelene,'' Μαρία Μαγδαληνή).
 
3. adjectives - a common Latin method for making a [[toponym]]ic adjective is to add -[i]ensis
* [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] "Gerald of [[Wales]]"
* [[Galfridus Monemutensis]], "Geoffrey of [[Monmouth]]"

4. genitive "of" constructions
* [[Jacopo da Bologna]] "Jacob of [[Bologna]]"
* [[Jacques de Vitry]] "James of [[Vitry-sur-Seine]]"

In examples 1 through 3, where the noun or adjective has case [[declension]] the partial name will typically decline in accordance with normal noun or adjective rules. For example, in ''Giraldi Cambrensis opera'' - "the works of [genitive] Gerald of Wales" - ''Giraldus'' declines to ''Giraldi'' (the genitive form of Gerald) and ''cambrensis'' (nominative adjective) declines to ''cambrensis'' (genitive adjective, but the same as nominative in this example). The declension is normally not followed when citing Latin patrial names in English, "of Giraldus Cambrensis," but may cause confusion when trying to identify the nominative spellings of patrial names from Latin or Greek sources.

==Modern era examples==
Modern era examples in Europe are generally limited to nicknames, or deliberate choices of a birthplace as a penname or stagename or change of name by deed poll:
* [[Bela Lugosi]] stagename "from [[Lugoj]]"&lt;ref&gt;Transylvania: Birthplace of Vampires - Page 32 Robert Z. Cohen - 2011  This onscreen Dracula was the creation of Transylvanian-Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi. Born Béla Blaskó in the western Transylvanian city of Lugoj (his stage name means “from Lugoj” in Hungarian&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Brassaï]] pseudonym "from [[Braşov]]"&lt;ref&gt;European culture: a contemporary companion Jonathan Law - 1993 "His professional name means 'from Brasso', his birthplace. After studying in Budapest and Berlin he moved to Paris in 1924, where he worked as a journalist; he did not take his first photograph until the age of 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''PayPal Mafia'''" is a group of former [[PayPal]] employees and founders who have since founded and developed additional technology companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://projects.wsj.com/soty/mentor/david-sacks/david-sacks-drills-into-light-points-technology | title=David Sacks: Biography | publisher=Wall Street Journal online | accessdate=August 30, 2013 | author=Staff Writer}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Tesla Motors]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Palantir Technologies]], [[SpaceX]], [[YouTube]], [[Yelp]], and [[Yammer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=San Jose Mercury News|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business-headlines/ci_13617121|title=PayPal finally poised to enter Web 2.0|author=Duke Harris|date=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the members attended [[Stanford University]] or [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] at some point in their studies. Six members, [[Peter Thiel]], [[Elon Musk]], [[Reid Hoffman]], [[Luke Nosek]], [[Ken Howery]], and [[Keith Rabois]], have become billionaires.

==History==
Originally, PayPal was a money-transfer service offered by a company called [[Confinity]] which was acquired by [[X.com]] in 1999. Later X.com was renamed PayPal and purchased by [[eBay]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt;&lt;ref name=fortune&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/11/13/magazines/fortune/paypal_mafia.fortune/index.htm | title=Meet the PayPal mafia | date=November 26, 2007 | last=O'Brien | first=Jeffrey M. | accessdate=December 4, 2009 | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | publisher=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original PayPal employees had difficulty adjusting to eBay's more traditional corporate culture and within four years all but 12 of the first 50 employees had left.&lt;ref name=exodus/&gt;  They remained connected as social and business acquaintances,&lt;ref name=exodus/&gt; and a number of them worked together to form new companies in subsequent years.  This group of PayPal alumni became so prolific that the term PayPal Mafia was coined.&lt;ref name=pays&gt;{{Cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/technology/17paypal.html?ei=5088&amp;en=943bf3f552d09fb2&amp;ex=1318737600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|title=It Pays to Have Pals in Silicon Valley |author=Miguel Helft|date=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Fortune|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=71077|title=Thiel, Levchin and the PayPal Mafia|date=November 15, 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; gained even wider exposure when a 2007 article in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine used the phrase in its headline and featured a photo of former PayPal employees in gangster attire.&lt;ref name=fortune/&gt;&lt;ref name=vw1/&gt;&lt;ref name=vw2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Valleywag|url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/315670/the-paypal-mafia-personified|title=The Paypal Mafia Personified|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705143412/http://valleywag.gawker.com/315670/the-paypal-mafia-personified|archivedate=July 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The PayPal Mafia is sometimes credited with inspiring the re-emergence of consumer-focused Internet companies after the [[dot-com bust]] of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/05/15/DDOH107DLG.DTL|date=May 16, 2008|title=Nonfiction review: 'Once You're Lucky'|author=Marcus Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PayPal Mafia phenomenon has been compared to the founding of [[Intel]] in the late 1960s by engineers who had earlier founded [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] after leaving [[Shockley Semiconductor]].&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; They are discussed in journalist [[Sarah Lacy]]'s book ''Once You're Lucky, Twice You're Good.''  According to Lacy,  the selection process and technical learning at PayPal played a role, but the main factor behind their future success was the confidence they gained there. Their success has been attributed to their youth; the physical, cultural, and economic infrastructure of [[Silicon Valley]]; and the diversity of their skill-sets.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; PayPal's founders encouraged tight social bonds among its employees, and many of them continued to trust and support one another after leaving PayPal.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt; An intensely competitive environment and a shared struggle to keep the company solvent despite many setbacks also contributed to a strong and lasting camaraderie amongst former employees.&lt;ref name=pays/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Wired|title=How PayPal Gave Rise to a Silicon Valley ‘Mafia’|author=Dylan Tweney|date=November 15, 2007|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2007/11/how-paypal-gave/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''people''' is a plurality of [[person]]s considered as a whole, as is the case with an [[ethnic group]] or [[nation]]. Collectively, for example, the contemporary [[Frisians]] and [[Danes]] are two related [[Germanic peoples]], while various [[Middle East]]ern ethnic groups are often linguistically categorized as [[Semitic people]]s.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]]]]

Various [[sovereign state|states]] govern, or claim to govern, in the name of ''the people''. Both the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]] used the [[Latin]] term ''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'', (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed to Roman legionary standards, and even after the [[Roman Emperor]]s achieved a state of total personal [[autarchy]], they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.

A [[People's Republic]] is typically a [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]] [[one-party state]] that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a [[dictatorship]]. [[Populism]] is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the ''common people'' instead of the [[Elitism|elite]].

Chapter One, Article One of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] states that peoples have the right to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter I: Purposes and Principles |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 April 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YNQicd2P?url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |archive-date=8 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law ==
{{further information|Popular sovereignty}}
In [[criminal law]], in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of ''the People''. Several U.S. states, including [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], use this style.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'' 6 Cal. 3d 628; 493 P.2d 880; 100 Cal. Rptr. 152; 1972 Cal. LEXIS 154 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words "the People" in the case captions.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, ''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', rule 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Four states&amp;nbsp;— [[Massachusetts]], [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Kentucky]]&amp;nbsp;— refer to themselves as ''the [[Commonwealth]]'' in case captions and legal process.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Commonwealth (United States)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other states, such as [[Indiana]], typically refer to themselves as ''the State'' in case captions and legal process. Outside the United States, criminal trials in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Philippines]] are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.

The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]]; thus, in these [[U.S. states]], the "people" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the [[United Kingdom]] and other dependencies of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of [[the Crown]]. "The people" identifies the entire body of the [[citizen]]s of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 5th ed., "People".&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with both techniques, there has been discussion of how photography can affect an [[autobiographical]] discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Fabien Arribert-Narce, "Photographs in Autobiographies: Identities in Progress", In: ''Skepsi'', Vol. 1 (1), 2008, Graft &amp; Transplant, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roland Barthes]], for example, in his ''[[Camera Lucida]]'', suggests how photographs can fascinate the reader like no other images when he describes photography as a "pure deictic language".&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Camera Lucida'', translated by [[Richard Howard]] (London:Jonathan Cape, 1982), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''real-name system''' is a system in which when a user who wants to register an account on a [[blog]], website or [[bulletin board system]], is required to offer [[Identity document|identification credentials]] including their legal name to the network service centre. One may use an on-line [[pseudonym]], however, the person's real identity would be available if rules or laws are broken.

==Practice==

===South Korea===

[[South Korea]] is the first country to put the real-name system into practice. Since June 28, 2009, thirty-five Korean websites have implemented a name-registration system pursuant to the newly amended Information and Communications Network Act of Korea. It was enacted after the suicide of [[Choi Jin-sil]] which was said to be related to malicious comments about her on Internet bulletin boards. The new rule is aimed at minimizing the amount of negative information to make [[netizen]]s responsible for their behavior on the [[Internet]].

South Koreans have been familiar with the real-name system. Since the mid-1990s, doing real property transactions and financial transactions must be performed under a real name following relevant laws. The real-name system in real property transactions and financial transactions is believed to contribute to the sound economic order of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' the [http://koreanlii.or.kr/w/index.php/Real_name_system real name system] in Korea.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2012, however, the [[Constitutional Court of Korea]] ruled unanimously that the real-name requirements imposed on big portal service providers by a relevant law&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [http://koreanlii.or.kr/w/index.php/Real_name_system Korean Legal Information Institute] for further information of the Act.&lt;/ref&gt; is unconstitutional, citing such provision's violation of freedom of speech in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;Korea Times, "[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/08/117_118115.html Online real-name system unconstitutional]", August 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the so-called "Choi Jin-sil Law", under the deceased celebrity's name, is to be discarded. Until then, websites with more than 100 thousand visitors per day required users to authenticate their identities by entering their ID numbers when they used portals or other sites.

The Constitutional Court said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The system does not seem to have been beneficial to the public. Despite the enforcement of the system, the number of illegal or malicious postings online has not decreased. Instead, users moved to foreign Websites and the system became discriminatory against domestic operators. It also prevented foreigners who didn’t have a resident registration number here from expressing their opinions online.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Court Decision 2010Hun-Ma47 delivered on August 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Yonhap News Agency]], the public voice started to agree on the abolishment of a name-registration system because of the severe problem caused by information leakage. Now the official response from the administration is that they will supplement the certain regulations of personal information on the Internet.

===China===

The Chinese government stated in December 2011 that microblogging sites should make sure users are registered with their real names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China moves to tame microbloggers amid censorship claims|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-microblogging/china-moves-to-tame-microbloggers-amid-censorship-claims-idUSBRE84S03T20120529|agency=Reuters|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement of Regulations on the Development and Management of microblogging, Beijing in December 2011, the major microblogging sites like Sina, 163 and Sohu all put real name system into practice in 16 March 2012. The users in Beijing who hadn't provided their real information would be barred from posting and transmitting messages after 16 March 2012.{{cn|date=November 2018}}{{update inline|date=November 2018}}
&lt;!--describe more precisely with the history and nature of real name system in China--&gt;

==History==
The introduction to real names in modern society originated from state regulations. State governments, in order to monitor and keep track of its citizens, provided citizens with surnames. This allowed them to track property ownership and inheritance, collect taxes, maintain court records, perform police work, conscript soldiers, and control epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, James. (1998). Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social networking sites==

===Facebook===
{{see also|Facebook real-name policy controversy}}
Though the  [[Facebook]] [[social networking site]] does not directly employ the real-name system, the site's online Name Policy indicates the following:
"Facebook is a community where people use their real identities. We require everyone to provide their real names, so you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/help/292517374180078|title=Facebook's Name Policy - Facebook Help Center - Facebook|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that under Facebook's Name Policy, users are strongly encouraged to provide their real names when creating an account on Facebook. This, according to Facebook, ensures that its users remain safe by knowing who they are connecting and communicating with at all times.

Facebook was first launched at [[Harvard]], where the new social networking site provided a safe, intimate alternative to the other popular social networking sites. According to [[danah boyd]], a social media scholar, "people provided their name because they saw the site as an extension of campus life." Because of this, new users adopted the norms and practices of the early adopters and began to also see Facebook as a secure and private site. Through this early adoption, today, Facebook's astronomical value stems from the quality and quantity of information it has about its users. The social networking site has become an identity service by creating a value proposition based on social norms in which users would naturally share their real names instead of feeling forced to.&lt;ref name="real names"&gt;boyd, danah (2012). "The Politics of 'Real Names': Power, Context, and Control in Networked  Publics." Communications of the ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though requiring users to provide their real names such as the ones listed on credit cards, driver's licenses, and student IDs ensures safety for users, using real names could also be harmful. Emil Protalinski, technology journalist for The Next Web, states how many "Facebook users opt to use [[pseudonyms]] to hide from stalkers, abusive exes, and even governments that don't condone free speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2012/09/21/facebook-now-wants-snitch-friends-arent-using-real-name/|title=Facebook tests prompt asking you to snitch on your friends who aren't using their real name|first=Emil|last=Protalinski|date=2012-09-21|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these specific users, using pseudonyms allows for them to still be able to connect with colleagues, friends, and family without having to entirely worry about their safety had they provided Facebook with their real names that others could find more easily. This brings up the issues of privacy for Facebook users. "People feel as though their privacy has been violated when their agency has been undermined or when information about a particular social context has been obscured in ways that subvert people's ability to make an informed decision about what to reveal."&lt;ref name="real names"/&gt; Some users may feel uncomfortable with the knowledge that their real names would be publicly displayed and choose, instead, to use a fake name that appears real to Facebook under its Name Policy.

===Twitter===
[[File:Twitter name looks great.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Twitter registration page saying "Name looks great" after a made-up, meaningless, and unformatted name is entered.]]
Unlike Facebook, the [[Twitter]] social networking site does not require users to enter real names when creating Twitter accounts, and the site is entirely void of the real-name system. According to Twitter's former [[CEO]], [[Dick Costolo]], the social networking site does not care what a user's real name is as long as the site connects users to the information that they care about. Whether the information comes from an account with a real name or one using a pseudonym does not matter. 
Yet, Costolo also points out that Twitter is not necessarily in full support of the idea of users having pseudonyms; instead, Twitter is simply "wedded to people being able to use the service as they see fit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2011/09/16/why-twitter-doesnt-care-what-your-real-name-is/|title=Why Twitter doesn’t care what your real name is|date=2011-09-16|work=Gigaom.com|first=Mathew|last=Ingram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter emphasizes care in its services that it provides for users rather than requiring real names. This does not mean, however, that Twitter ignores the issue regarding real identities. Regarding this matter, Twitter is able to verify accounts of prominent Twitter users such as celebrities in order to ensure identity fraud is not being committed on the social networking site.

==In fiction==
[[Vernor Vinge]]'s novella ''[[True Names]]'' charts the idea of how serious knowing one's identity can be. As such it is also a part of [[cypherpunk]] culture.

'''Salome Sellers''' (''née'' '''Sylvester'''; January 1{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}, 1800 &amp;ndash; January 9, 1909) was an American centenarian who was the last known survivor from the [[18th century]].

==Biography==
Salome Sylvester was born in [[Deer Isle, Maine]] (then part of [[Massachusetts]]), the daughter of Edward and Deborah (''née'' Cushman) Sylvester. She grew up on Deer Isle and married Joseph Sellers on 23 December 1830. The couple had six children together, Salome outliving all but her oldest son, William. She was widowed in 1865.

Due to her unusually long life, Salome was often featured in local newspapers and visited by people interested in her long life, something Salome once expressed as, "I've lived too long. I'm only a curiosity now for people to come and stare at".

Salome Sellers died in the same house she and her husband had built in 1830 in Deer Isle, Maine on 9 January 1909, aged 109 years, 8 days. Her house is now known as the [[Salome Sellers House]] and home to the Deer Isle-Stonington Historical Society. There has also been a book written about her life: "An Island Woman: Salome Sylvester Sellers, 1800-1909".

[[File:Soslan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dancing Soslan, [[Vladikavkaz]]]]
[[File:Sosruko DSC06305.JPG|thumb|Sosruko tower in [[Nalchik]]]]
'''Sosruko''' or '''Sosriqwa''' ({{lang-os|Сослан}}, ''Soslan''; {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}}, ''Sosryqwa''; {{lang-krc|Сосурукъ/Сосуркъа}}, ''Sosuruq/Sosurqa'') is a central character in many cycles of the [[Nart sagas]] of the [[Caucasus]].

Sosruko is a powerful but devious man who is the smallest of the Narts; as a character, he is sometimes cast in the light of the [[trickster]] god, comparable to the [[Scandinavia]]n [[Loki]] (who finds a closer parallel in the Nart [[Syrdon]] however), [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[Amirani]], or the [[Ancient Greek]] [[Prometheus]]. It is possible that at least in the latter case, Sosruku served as a direct inspiration.

In Circassian mythology, it was Nart Sosriqwe, minion of the gods and his doting mother, Lady [[Satanaya]], who stole fire from the giant.

== Etymology ==
The name etymologically came from Turkic languages: [[Nogai language|Nogai]] ''suslan-'' "to look menacing", ''suslä'' "menacing, gloomy" (hence {{lang-os|Soslan}}). The variants {{lang-ab|Sasərqwa}}, {{lang-ady|Саусырыкъо}} [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}], {{lang-kbd|Сосрыкъуэ}} [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]]: [{{ipa|sawsərəqʷa}}], [[Digor dialect|Digor]] {{lang-os|Sosruqo, Sozyryqo, Sozuruqo}}.
The name Sosruko [{{ipa|saːwsərəqʷa}}] is from [[Circassian language|Circassian]] {{ipa|sa}} "sword" + {{ipa|wa}} "hit" + {{ipa|sər}} "heat" + {{ipa|qʷa}} "son"; hence literally “The son of the fiery sword hit”.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">The '''Syndicate of Seven''' is the name given to the original members of the Broken Hill Mining Company formed in 1883, who lodged applications for mining leases along the Line of Lode at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

The members, who all worked at the remote [[Mount Gipps Station|Mount Gipps]] [[Sheep station]], were:-

#[[George McCulloch (mine owner)|George McCulloch]] (1848 – 1907) – station manager.
#[[Charles Rasp]] (1846 – 1907) – a [[boundary rider]], who was interested in [[prospecting]], recognised the importance of the site and pegged out the first mining lease.
#Philip Charley (1863 – 1937) – a young man learning to be a sheep farmer, employed as a [[boundary rider]].
#David James (1854 – 1926) – a contractor employed to sink water tanks and mend fences.
#James Poole (1848 – 1924) – an employee of David James.
#George Urquhart (1845 – 1915) – a bookkeeper and overseer
#George Lind (1861 – 1941) – a storekeeper.

[[Image:Philip Charley thumb.jpg|right|Philip Charley in 1887]]

"Each of the above seven contributing the sum of £70 each".

(Curtis 1908, and Camilleri 2006).

In September 1883 they pegged seven {{convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on}} blocks (blocks No 10–16) along the exposed lode at Broken Hill, thus securing almost the whole of the easily worked ore (Curtis, 1908).

The Syndicate of Seven was masterminded by [[George McCulloch (mine owner)|George McCulloch]] (Camilleri, p17, 2006).

The initial assay results were not encouraging and Poole, Urquhart and Lind sold their share before the boom days and flotation of Broken Hill Proprietary in 1885 (Curtis, 1908 and Camilleri, 2006). James Poole sold half his share to [[Sidney Kidman]] who went on to become a wealthy cattle baron and landowner.

They fought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927,&lt;ref name="Alberta1999"&gt;{{cite book| title=Alberta History| volume=47–49| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jL06AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=famous+five+persons+case+august+27&amp;dq=famous+five+persons+case+august+27| accessdate=May 10, 2013| year=1999| publisher=Historical Society of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 24, 1928, Canada's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such "persons".&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt;

The last line of the judgement reads, "Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the [[Senate of Canada]],' the question is answered in the negative." This judgement was overturned by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the "[[Persons Case]]". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a continent-wide drive for political equality, coming seven years after discrimination against women's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and thus had important ramifications.

Some saw this as "radical change"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the [[1689 Bill of Rights]], which uses only the term "person", not the term "man" (or "woman" for that matter).

Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], an approach that has come to be known as the "[[living tree doctrine]]".

==The Five==
The famous five women were:

* [[Emily Murphy]] (1868–1933), the [[British Empire]]'s first female judge;
* [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]] (1868–1965), farm women's leader, political activist and first female [[Cabinet minister]] in Alberta, still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case;
* [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]] (1873–1951), a [[suffragist]] and author, member of the Alberta Legislature 1921–1926;
* [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] (1868–1931), the first woman elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], or any legislature in Canada or the rest of the British Empire, but no longer MLA at the time of the court case;
* [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]] (1849–1931), an advocate for working women, author and a founding member of the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]].

===Emily Murphy===
{{Main|Emily Murphy}}
Emily Murphy stood out in the famous five, bringing them to a victory in 1929. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected.&lt;ref name=MacEwan&gt;{{cite book |first=Grant| last=MacEwan| title=...and Mighty Women too: Stories of Notable Western Canadian Women| year=1975| publisher= Western Producer Prairie Books| isbn=978-0919306653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name "Janey Canuck". In 1922, she wrote ''The Black Candle'' which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. Murphy came from a privileged background in which white women were protected from many topics.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Millar |title=The Famous Five: Five Canadian Women and Their Fight to Become Persons |year=1999 |publisher=Western Heritage Centre| isbn=978-0920109168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irene Parlby===
{{Main|Irene Parlby}}
In 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta and in 1921, was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She served as cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during [[World War I]] and later served on the Board of Governors of the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Nellie McClung===
{{Main|Nellie McClung}}
Nellie McClung's jobs in her lifetime included teacher, author, public speaker, temperance activist, internationally known women's rights activist, and politician {Warne, Literature as Pulpit]. In 1918, she was a member of the Dominion War Council and the only woman representative at the League of Nations.  She represented Canada at the Ecumenical Council of the Methodist church in 1921 and was the first woman on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Board of the Governors.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;  In 1921, McClung was elected to the Alberta legislature as an MLA in Edmonton for the Liberal Party.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt; She served one term, not being re-elected in 1926. She was a member of the Political Equality League of Manitoba, and she played the leading role in the Mock Parliament held on January 29, 1914, at the Walker Theatre in Winnipeg, which humorously discussed Votes for Men.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Louise McKinney===
{{Main|Louise McKinney}}
Louise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in Alberta and the West – she served as the organization's vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 – and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union. McKinney was also named to be Commissioner for the first General Council of the [[United Church of Canada]], and was the only woman to sign the Basis of Union.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

===Henrietta Muir Edwards===
{{Main|Henrietta Muir Edwards}}
Henrietta Muir Edwards, author and researcher on women's topics, held an influence within the National Council of Women&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt; and held chairmanship of the Committee in Law in the National Council of Women for more than 35 years. She was also a Red Cross leader during the war years. Edwards was the secretary of the National Subcommittee which focused on thrift and economy in Canadian homes.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Honorary senators===
None of the five became [[Senate of Canada#Senators|senators]]; the first female senator was Quebecer [[Cairine Reay Wilson]], appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first "honorary senators".&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/10/calgary-famous-five-honourary-senators.html |title='Famous 5' named honorary senators |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=CBC.ca |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/..%5C40%5C2%5Cparlbus%5Cchambus%5Csenate/deb-E/059db_2009-10-08-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=2#53|title=Senate of Canada – Debates|first=Senate of|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.

Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful [[House of Commons of Canada]] had elected its first female member ([[Agnes Macphail]]) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}} The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.

===Opinions on the Famous Five===
Opinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have [[eugenics]] legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed "mentally deficient" or "insane" in Alberta and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/eugenics-keeping-canada-sane-feature/&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;  Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as "tenacious" with her work with prohibition.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights.&lt;ref name = Sharpe&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert J.| last=Sharpe| title=The Persons Case: The Origins and Legacy of the Fight for Legal Personhood| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOwC1vcGgcEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4| isbn=978-0802096289| year=2007| publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the "evils of alcohol" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War&amp;nbsp;I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the [[Dower Act]]. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;

===Commemorations===
The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the [[Centre Block#Senate foyer|foyer]] and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist [[Barbara Paterson]], one on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]], the other at the [[Olympic Plaza (Calgary)|Olympic Plaza]] in [[Calgary]]. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included [[French language in Canada|French]] and [[Canadian English|English]] singers, [[Inuit]] dancers, and speeches by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.

The City of [[Edmonton]] has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the "Famous Five".&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web| title=Alphabetical Park Listing| url=http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| publisher=City of Edmonton| date=May 14, 2012| accessdate=May 14, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115516/http://edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| archivedate=November 27, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of [[National Council of Women]] of Canada, president of [[Canadian Women's Press Club]], director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King [[George V]] to be a Lady of Grace of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of St. John of Jerusalem]].

Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the [[University of Alberta]] with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, "who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women" should not be forgotten.&lt;ref name="MacEwan" /&gt;

Along with [[Thérèse Casgrain]], the Five were commemorated in the 2001 [[Journey Series (banknotes)|Journey Series]] of Canada's [[Canadian fifty-dollar bill|fifty-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt;  In December 2011, the [[Bank of Canada]] announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 [[Frontier Series]] banknote that it issued in 2012.&lt;ref name="50dollars"&gt;{{cite news| title=Should the new $50 bill show an Arctic research boat instead of the Famous Five?| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/should-the-new-50-bill-show-an-arctic-research-boat-instead-of-the-famous-five.html| work=CBC News| date=December 7, 2011| publisher=cbc.ca| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.&lt;ref name="5foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225022456/http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| dead-url=yes| archive-date=December 25, 2012| title=About Us| publisher=Famous 5 Foundation| date=| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''widowhood effect''' is the increase in the probability of a person dying a relatively short time  after their long-time [[spouse]] has died. The pattern indicates a sharp increase in risk of death for the widower, particularly but not exclusively, in the three months closest thereafter the death of the spouse. This process of losing a spouse and dying shortly after has also been called "dying of a [[broken heart]]". Becoming a widow is often a very detrimental and life changing time in a spouse's life, that forces them to go through changes that they may not have anticipated to make for a significant amount of time. Responses of grief and bereavement due to the loss of a spouse increases vulnerability to psychological and physical illnesses (Ramadas &amp; Kuttichira, 2013).

Psychologically, losing a long-term spouse can cause symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of guilt. Physical illness may also occur as the body becomes more vulnerable to emotional and environmental stressors. There are many factors that may be affected when one becomes a widow. A widow (or widower if referring to a male who lost a spouse) tends to have a decline in health regulation. Higher prevalence in mortality rates are noted among bereaved spouses during the first six months of bereavement compared to the last six months of bereavement.  The most crucial are said to be the first three months during grief processing.  Grieving spouses are more vulnerable during these few months not only health wise but socially and physically.  During this early period of bereavement spouses tend to have less interest in their health as well as physical appearance caring less about continuing with medications or adapting healthy behaviors such as eating healthy or exercising.  Also, they are likelier to practice risky behaviors and commit suicide.  Men on the other hand, are more likely to look for social support such as friends, family, or support groups regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, P. J., Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011). Does Widowhood Increase Mortality Risk? Epidemiology, 22(1), 1-5. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3181fdcc0b&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect appears to be far more prevalent in older married couples than in younger married couples. As a result, studies that have been conducted in regards to this phenomenon since the early 2000s have revolved primarily around observations of older widows. Through the many studies that have been conducted over the years, it has been found that the widowhood effect affects the mortality rates of people with varying levels of severity depending on their genders and religions.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}}It is far more frequent in more seasoned, long-term, elder couples than in recently married couples. Since the topic has only been recently studied within this last decade, and due to the prevalence of older couples being affected, most widows in similar studies are typically over the age of 50&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-widowhood-effect-idUSBRE9AD0VU20131114|title='Widowhood effect' strongest during first three months|date=2016-11-14|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jegtvig, 2013).

Although there have not been many studies, the phenomenon is one of the best documented examples of the effect of social relations on health. Through the numerous studies that have been directed throughout the years, it has been found that the widowhood impact influences the death rates of individuals with changing levels of stringencies relying upon their sexual orientations and religions. There are many theories as to what causes this to occur. There are many factors and theories about the widowhood effect, but in general, a study on a large population sample has suggested rates of death nearly double during the first three months after loss of a spouse, and quickly taper thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=J.

==Gender differences==

Both men and women respond differently to the death of their spouse. In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women.  Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136854 Widowhood and Depression: Explaining Long-Term Gender Differences in Vulnerability.] ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior.'' (1992). Retrieved on 2016-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peer-reviewed articles suggest that it is indeed women that are more frequently at risk of succumbing to the widowhood effect. A collaborative study by Gary R. Lee et al. (2001) surveyed 1686 married and widowed people age 65 or older using data from 1988 [[National Survey of Families and Households]]. The study took into account the psychological well-being of each person on a [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies]]— Depression scale (CES-D), and found that women were further depressed by the loss of their spouse than men were. Women were also more likely to die soon after the death of their spouse compared to men. The researchers hypothesized that this was because older married women had a higher baseline happiness than their spouses, so they had more happiness to lose. Women in this study were also less likely to be avid church goers, despised chores, and were not as adept at helping their adult children. The lack of social behavior and general activity may contribute to the widowhood effect's influence on female mortality.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Is Broken Heart Syndrome Difficult? |url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/Cardiomyopathy/Is-Broken-Heart-Syndrome-Difficult_UCM_448547_Article.jsp |location=Dallas |publisher=American Heart Association |access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lee|DeMaris|Bavin|Sullivan|2001}}

Experimenters involved in the study regarding: ''The effects of widowhood on physical and mental health, health behaviors, and health outcomes'', took a deeper look into the overall health differences between recent widowers and those who are currently involved in a marriage (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Mental health alterations include those of depression and socially extracting yourself were the most common for women who have become widowed in the past year or so (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003). Although some of these women were shown to extract them selves from social settings, the study also supported an alternate hypothesis that women experiencing the effects of widowhood are less likely to engage coping mechanisms such as support groups, fellow widowers, and overall strong support systems such as close friends and family (Wilcox, Evenson, Aragaki, Wassertheil-Smoller, Mouton, Loevinger, 2003).

In a study done by Stahl and Shultz, they found that the death of a woman’s spouse affected her physical activity (2014). Women’s physical activity increases immediately following the death of a spouse, and the authors note that this may perhaps be a coping mechanism to alleviate depressive symptoms (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). In the year following the death of a spouse, women are more likely to experience a fluctuation in physical activity during the transition into widowhood, if they did not die (Stahl &amp; Shultz, 2014). Women in the youngest age group of this study (55– 65 years) were at the highest risk of mortality after the death of their spouse (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Elwert and Christakis found that within the first month of bereavement after widowhood morality is largest and doesn’t decline sharply until the sixth month of widowhood for females, compared to only the third month for males (2006).

Nicholas A. Christakis of Harvard and Felix Elwert of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 9 years’ worth of data gathered from almost 373,189 elderly married couples in the U.S. Their findings showed an 18 percent increase in “all-cause mortality” for women whose husbands died first; for men, the risk is 16 percent (Elwert 2008). Although the percentage of females was higher than males, it is not a significant difference to state that women are more affected than men. It is hard to say whether males or females suffer from the widowhood effect more, however it is clear that it is higher in couples that are older.

&lt;ref&gt;In conclusion to this, other research that has been conducted has gathered similar statistics regarding widowhood effect between genders. A comparable study taken place in the U.S found that “The death of a husband is associated with a greater rate in all-cause mortality for women, and the death of a wife is associated with a lesser rate in all-cause mortality for men, after adjusting for covariates (Elwert, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects of widowhood==
The death of a spouse can have a major impact on a person’s mental health. Each individual may respond to their spouse’s death differently. After the death of a spouse many widows begin to take more prescription medications for mental health issues (Avis, Brambilla, Vass, &amp; Mckinlay, 1991). The mental health effects of men and women also differ. Women become more depressed in widowhood compared to men because women may not have as strong of a support group. Married women also report a higher rate of happiness in their marriage and the death of their spouse could drastically alter this happiness. Men may have an easier time adapting to widowhood and be more willing to seek mental help while women tend to be less social and did not like to do chores, go to church, or help their children. Men and women both show greater rates of depression after the death of a spouse but the rates of depression in women tends to be higher than in men (Lee, DeMaris, &amp; Sullivan, 2001).

==Takotsubo and the widowhood effect==

Recently, there has been a phenomenon discussed and researched dubbed the takotsubo condition, also referred to as the [[broken heart syndrome]] (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016). Takotsubo has been discussed in contexts surrounding great physical and emotional stress, such as circumstance in which someone has been widowed, and emotional stress has long been associated with myocardial infarction. In their research, Brenn and Ytterstad saw an increase in death of women 55–64 years old due to heart disease in the first week of widowhood than married women 55–64 years old (2016). Although takotsubo is not considered to be the direct cause of death at this time, it is an observed phenomenon (Brenn &amp; Ytterstad, 2016.)

==Effects of widowhood on social life==

Elderly widows experience changes in their social lives prior to and following the deaths of their spouses. A study conducted by Rebecca L. Utz et al. (2002) revealed that elderly persons experiencing widowhood spent more time with family and friends than nonwidowed counterparts, based on the lifestyle changes that occur in elderly couples. Although widowed subjects were more likely to socialize with family and friends, they were no more likely to visit church or volunteer than the intact couples. This study also found that healthy spouses were reclusive while their significant other was on their deathbed, but due to a network of family and friends; the surviving spouse entered society being more social than had been prior to the death of their husband or wife. Elderly widows were more or less involved socially depending on the amount of support they had from family and friends.{{sfn|Utz|Carr|Nesse|Wortman|2002}} It has been noted that widows who have a close and supportive social network can counteract the effects of widowhood by remaining active in their social group. The loss of a spouse affects almost every domain of life, and as a consequence has a significant impact on wellbeing: psychological, social, physical, practical, and economic (Bennett, 2012). With all of these aspects of a widowed individuals being affected maintaining a sense of normality is important to help avoid depression like symptoms. Social support, as well as creating new lasting relationships through social interaction can help the process of bereavement go smoother for widow effected individuals.

==Urban, rural and race variations==

A study conducted by Rosato, O’Reilly and Wright (2015) revealed that there is a significant difference in urban-rural variation in the social environment as well as in health outcomes. There is evidence that social support from family and friends have better health outcomes on mortality rates. Investigations showed that the race of the partner influences widowhood effect; whites in endogamous marriages had greater mortality risks that were not obvious among blacks, which the authors concluded was due to a high level of family support for elderly among black families versuswhite families. Moreover, the study also found differences in urban and rural areas around the world. They found that elderly married couples in the US suffered significant mortality risks compared to those in Ireland where older people living in more rural areas receive more social support from their families, and they live with their children, while in the US elderly people live in care homes. As a result, mortality rates are greater in urban areas and less in rural areas.

In a study done by Elwert and Christakis, they found that there was no widowhood effect found in endogamously married black men or women (2016). Deducing this finding, they proposed that this might be because blacks are able to extend their marital survival advantage into widowhood. This is likely because blacks are prone to have kin nearer to help take care of them, they may be more self-sufficient than their white counterparts, and there is greater religious participation in blacks that may help them with spiritual comfort (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2016). Whites were found to have “a large and enduring widowhood effect” because there is no reparation to make up for the survival advantages that marriage gave them, even if they have been widowed for years (Elwert &amp; Christakis, 2008).

The widowhood effect appears to have a higher impact in rural and intermediate areas compared to urban areas. One factor may be that there are greater distances to primary care services in rural areas, and this increases mortality due to discouraged health checkups (Wright, 2015). It is known that the size of family and social network coincides with physical functioning; the bigger the social group one belongs to the better they can physically function. Residential areas near green areas are associated with an increase in physical activity and lowered mortality (Wright, 2015). Researchers measured peak flow to show the increases or decreases in physical functioning, and the results suggest that married subjects have a higher peak flow compared to those divorced or widowed (Clouston, 2014).

==Possible causes==

It was suggested that the widowhood effect was a mere coincidence resulting from the selection of mates with similar health risk. In a recent study by Paul J. Boyle, Feng, Z., &amp; Raab, G. M. (2011), it was concluded that the increased [[mortality rate]] of widows is caused by the death of their spouse. Researchers in the study used data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study to compare the ratios of death in widowed males and females. The male and female subjects were categorized into different groups dependent on the manner in which their spouse died. The results provided evidence that suggest a causal relationship between mortality rate and widowhood.{{sfn|Boyle|Feng|Raab|2011}}

In April 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an article regarding phenomenon referred to as "broken heart syndrome". This particular syndrome seems to occur when a person experiences an overwhelming amount of stress in their life in a short period of time. The cases mentioned involved both positive events like winning the lottery as well as negative events like experiencing the death of a spouse. Though broken heart syndrome has been misdiagnosed as a heart attack, the differences between the two phenomena are clear. Heart attacks are the result of a blockage of arteries, but broken heart syndrome is the result of a hormone induced enlargement of a portion of the heart. The enlarged region of the heart is less effective in regards to pumping blood, and the normal sized regions of the heart are forced to work harder as a result.&lt;ref name="American Heart Association"/&gt;


== Widowhood Effect Solution == 
	Widowhood effect is important to be aware of because of the affects that it can have on the body; mentally, physically, emotionally. Although there is no correct coping mechanism when losing a partner, it is important to find preventative ways to fight this from occurring because of the depressive symptoms and state of mental health that are a result from a partner passing away. Being aware of widowhood effect and acknowledging the feelings, such as grieving over that individual can be a way of coping with their current situation. Individuals that result to safe methods with grieving such as counseling or finding different hobbies can decrease their chances of experiencing widowhood effect. 


== Coping Mechanisms ==
There is no universally accepted “proper” method or way to grieve or adjust to life after loss; it varies among individuals, influenced by their cultural and social practices, personality, and the circumstances surrounding the death. Even though grief processing varies, there are ways to reduce the effects of widowhood. Since a spouse is often one’s primary source of social interactions, maintaining and establishing social bonds is a crucial aspect in determining the outcome of a widowed individual’s bereavement (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Social participation may be utilized “as an active coping strategy” as discovered in a study by Rebecca Utz and colleagues (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Additionally, the loss of a spouse means the loss of a partner; the loss of a supportive presence with whom responsibility was shared amongst one another. Studies have shown that for couples who followed traditional gender roles, adjustment to life after their loss was often more difficult than for couples who did not (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Undertaking the responsibilities previously considered the ‘job’ of one’s deceased partner is often hard to handle on top of processing the loss; therefore, the utilization of organizations built to support and help widowed individuals may also prove to be helpful in reducing grief. The Widowed Persons Service (WPS) and their parent organization, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), are two organizations which provide aid specifically to widowed individuals (DeSpelder &amp; Strickland, 2015). Effective and safe methods of grief processing are important for all individuals dealing with loss; however, the utilization of organizations may prove to be beneficial for those who need a little more help.

The '''Witches Belvoir''' were a mother and her two daughters accused of [[witchcraft]] in England in the deaths of two young nobles, Henry (died 1613) and Francis Manners (died 1620), the heirs to [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland]], whose seat was at [[Belvoir Castle]] . The mother, Joan Flower, died on the way to her trial, and the two daughters, Margaret and Philippa, were supposed to be hanged in [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]. It is said that Phillipa drugged the guards and managed to escape and make her way to Kent where she died after having three children.

==Flowers of Bottesford==
Joan, Margaret and Philippa Flowers were "known to be herbal healers" and came from a local family that "had fallen on hard times".&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"&gt;{{cite news | title = Witches of Belvoir 'may have been framed' | date = 2013-10-31 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24748721 | work = BBC | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They accepted employment as servants with the [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland|6th Earl and Countess of Rutland]], at [[Belvoir Castle]] near [[Grantham, Lincolnshire]], when additional staff were needed for an upcoming visit by [[James VI and I|King James I]].&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; But the sisters, and their mother, were unpopular with the other staff, and there were suggestions of theft, and misdemeanors.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; All three were dismissed and only Joan was given a payment of severance amounting to "40 shillings, a bolster (pillow), and a mattress of wool".&lt;ref name="thiswasleics"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Witches of Belvoir Castle | date = 2012-11-12 | url = http://www.thiswasleicestershire.co.uk/2012/11/the-witches-of-belvoir-castle.html | work = This Was Leicestershire | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charge of witchcraft==
Three years after Henry's death, on 16 July 1616, nine women were hanged as witches in [[Leicestershire]] for having bewitched a young boy and, in charges similar to those in the Flowers' case, were said to have kept cats as familiars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Briscoe | first1 = J.

She was not known to be a Church-goer, but at [[Ancaster, Lincolnshire|Ancaster]], en route to the prison at [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]],&lt;ref name="bygone"/&gt; she asked for bread as a substitute for the Eucharist.&lt;ref name="BormanRev"&gt;{{cite news | first = Bella | last = Bathurst | title = Witches: A Tale of Sorcery, Scandal and Seduction by Tracy Borman – review | date = 2013-08-25 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/25/witches-sorcery-scandal-borman-review | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that something so blessed could not be consumed by a witch but she was to choke and die, after the first bite.&lt;ref name="BormanRev"/&gt;

At Lincoln, Margaret was to accuse her mother of witchcraft, while Phillipa admitted to witchcraft on behalf of herself, Margaret and Joan.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; The sisters said they had entered into communion with [[familiar spirit]]s that had assisted them with their schemes. The mother's familiar was a cat named ''Rutterkin''.&lt;ref name="bookdays"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Chambers | first1 = Robert | title = The Book Of Days | chapter = March 11th | year = 1869 | url = http://www.thebookofdays.com/months/march/11.htm | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women admitted that they stole the glove of Lord Ros and gave it to their mother, who had dipped it in boiling water, stroked it along Rutterkin's back, and pricked it.&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt; Combined with some incantations this supposedly caused Lord Ros to become ill and die. An attempt to harm [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Lady Katherine]], the Earl's daughter, had failed when it was found that ''Rutterkin'' had no power over her. The women had also taken some feathers from the quilt of Rutland's bed and a pair of gloves. By boiling these in water mixed with blood they cast spells to prevent the Earl and Countess from having any more children.&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt; Both women admitted to experiencing visions of devils and that their familiar spirits visited them and sucked at their bodies.&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt;

==Others accused==
[[File:Threewitches.jpg|right|250px|thumb|left|A contemporary sketch of three other women accused: Anne Baker, Joan Willimot &amp; Ellen Greene.]]
During the examination, they revealed the names of other women who had aided them: Anne Baker of [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]]; Joan Willimot of [[Goadby, Leicestershire|Goadby]]; and Ellen Greene of [[Stathern]].&lt;ref name="bottshist2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bottesfordhistory.org.uk/page_id__62_path__0p2p46p.aspx | title = The Bottesford Witches, The Wonderful Discovery of the Witchcrafts of Joan, Margaret and Phillipa Flower | accessdate = 2013-11-01 | last = Bob | first = Sparford | work = Bottesford Living History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three women were taken for examination and revealed that they too had visions and consorted with familiar spirits.&lt;ref name="bottshist2"/&gt; Willimott said her familiar was called ''Pretty'' and had been blown into her mouth by her former master in the form of a fairy, later reappearing in the form of a woman who asked her to give up her soul. Willimott testified more as a [[Cunning folk in Britain|cunning woman]] than a witch, and insisted ''Pretty'' only helped her to inquire about the health of people she had attempted to heal:

{{quote|She never hurt any body, but did help divers persons that were stricken or fore-spoken (bewitched): and that her Spirit came weekly to her, and would tell of divers persons that were stricken and fore-spoken: and she saith that the use which she had of the Spirit, was to know those did which she had undertaken to amend and she did help them by certain prayers which she used.&lt;ref name="bottshist2"/&gt;}}

Greene claimed that she had accompanied Willimot into a wood where she said Willimot had conjured up two spirits in the form of a kitten and a "moldewarp" ([[mole (animal)|mole]]) which had climbed on her shoulders and sucked at her ears. Greene sent these familiars to kill a man and woman with whom she had argued and both died within a fortnight. Baker also confessed to possessing a familiar in the form of a white dog, but most of her testimony concerned the visions she had witnessed.

==Aftermath and legacy==
[[File:Inscription on Tomb of 6th Earl of Rutland.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Images of memorial text at Bottesford|'died in their infancy by wicked practises and sorcerye' – part of the memorial at [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]]]]
Margaret and Philippa Flowers were tried before [[Sir Henry Hobart, 1st Baronet|Henry Hobart]], Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and [[Edward Bromley]], a [[Exchequer of Pleas|Baron of the Exchequer]], and found guilty.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; and Margaret was hung at [[Lincoln castle]] on 11 March 1619.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt;

Later that year a ballad, ''Damnable Practises of Three Lincolnshire Witches Joane Flower and Her Two Daughters'', printed by 'G. Eld for John Barnes' appeared.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;

The Earl and Countess remained so convinced that their son had been killed by the effects of witchcraft that they had it inscribed on their monument at [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]] church. It reads, in part:

{{quote|In 1608 he married ye lady Cecila Hungerford, daughter to ye Honorable Knight Sir John Tufton, by whom he had two sons, both of which died in their infancy by wicked practises and sorcerye&lt;ref name="bottshist"/&gt;}}

In 1953, Hilda Lewis published a historical romance, ''The Witch and the Priest'', which consists of a series of conversations between Samuel Fleming, the clergyman who oversaw the Flowers' examinations, and the ghost of Joan Flower.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;

In 2013, historian Tracey Borman suggested that the Flowers women may have been framed by a favourite of [[James VI and I|King James I]], the [[Lincolnshire]] born George Villiers, who was created [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1623.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; Watson's theory is that Villiers had plans to marry the [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland|Rutland's]] daughter [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Katherine]] and, with her two brothers dead, inherit the title.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; Watson argues 'he had them poisoned – then framed Joan Flower and her two daughters as witches to create a smokescreen to cover up his own guilt'.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; After the execution of the Flowers sisters, [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Villiers]] went on to marry the [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland|Rutland's]] sole heir [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Katherine]] on 16 May 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Manners, Francis|volume=36|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
