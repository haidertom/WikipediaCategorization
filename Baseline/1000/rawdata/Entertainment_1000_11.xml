The '''opening ceremony for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]]''' was held at [[Celtic Park]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, between 21:00 and 23:40 BST, on 23 July 2014.

==Parade of Nations==
The ceremony was directed by [[David Zolkwer]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/24/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-glasgow-review |title=Commonwealth Games opening ceremony review – no lack of heart but a lack of oomph |last=Gardner |first=Lyn|authorlink=Lyn Gardner|date=24 July 2014|website=[[theguardian.com]]|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included the [[2014 Commonwealth Games Parade of Nations]] where 71 athletes, bearing the flags of their respective nations and territories, led their national delegations as they paraded into the stadium. The games were formally opened by [[Her Majesty (style)|Her Majesty]] [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. She referred to the Commonwealth's "shared ideals and ambitions" and the "bonds that unite" its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duncanson|first=Hilary|date= 23 July 2014|title=Queen tells of 'shared ideals' at Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/queen-tells-of-shared-ideals-at-commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-30455671.html|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|agency=[[Press Association]]|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme==

The programme, which included about 2,000 performers, featured [[Karen Dunbar]], [[John Barrowman]], [[Amy Macdonald]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Susan Boyle]], [[Nicola Benedetti]], [[Julie Fowlis]], [[Pumeza Matshikiza]], [[Eric Whitacre]] and the [[National Youth Choir of Scotland]], as well as a message from the [[International Space Station]]. The ceremony began with a countdown and a recorded video message from Scottish actor [[Ewan McGregor]], explaining the partnership between the Games and [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2014-opening-ceremony-ewan-mcgregor-launches-unicef-charity-fundraiser-during-performance-9624536.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the arrival of the Queen there was a [[flypast]] by the [[Red Arrows]] display team. The venue featured the largest LED video screen in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Withnall |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/commonwealth-games/commonwealth-games-2014--on-your-marks-glasgow-ready-for-opening-ceremony-as-scotland-promises-to-show-what-were-made-of-9623129.html |title=Commonwealth Games 2014 – on your marks: Glasgow ready for opening ceremony as Scotland promises to show ‘what we’re made of’ – Commonwealth Games – Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=19 March 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplied by Sports Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/media-centre/press-releases/sports-technology-showcase-all-bigscreen-action-glasgow-2014 |title=Sports Technology to showcase all the big-screen action of Glasgow 2014 &amp;#124; Glasgow 2014 – Commonwealth Games |publisher=Glasgow 2014 |date= |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland's then First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] welcomed the participants and spectators, and introduced a moment of silence in memory of the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] disaster.

The final part of the [[Queen's Baton Relay]] was run by 32 Scottish volunteers nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to [[Chris Hoy|Sir Chris Hoy]], who delivered  it to President of the [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] HRH [[Tunku Muda Serting Imran|Prince Imran]] and the Queen. The display of the message concealed within the baton was delayed by a difficulty in opening the device.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

The Games were launched in partnership with UNICEF, to save and change children’s lives. The unique partnership aimed "to use the power of sport to reach every child in Scotland and benefit children in every Commonwealth nation and territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/about-us/our-sponsors/unicef |title=Unicef &amp;#124; Glasgow 2014 – Commonwealth Games |publisher=Glasgow 2014 |date= |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:T1ModuleCover.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|T1 Dungeon Module Cover, an example of an early Adventure for ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' published by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]]]

In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]], an '''adventure''' or '''module''' is a pre-packaged book or box set that helps the [[Dungeon Master]] manage the plot or story of a game. The term ''adventure'' is currently used by the game's publisher [[Wizards of the Coast]].

In early [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|editions]] of the game these publications were commonly referred to as ''modules'', which stems from the term ''dungeon module'', used to refer to the earliest adventures published by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], with other variations on the module name appearing on latter adventures. The term ''module'' continued to be popular among players of the original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' even after newer publications were labeled ''adventure''. Adventures that appear as a part of a larger accessory are often referred to as scenarios.

The exact differences between the terms adventure, module, scenario, and accessory are hard to precisely define in ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' terminology, as they all have been used in different ways.

==History of official modules and adventures==
The first published ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' scenario was "Temple of the Frog", included in 1975's ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'' ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' rules supplement. This scenario was later developed into the stand-alone module DA2&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Temple of the Frog]]'' for the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Expert Set|D&amp;D Expert set]]'' rules (TSR, 1986).

The first stand-alone ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' adventure module, ''[[Palace of the Vampire Queen]]'', was published in 1976 by [[Wee Warriors]]. Although TSR did not produce this module, the company did distribute the first three printings on behalf of Wee Warriors. The adventure was described as a "Dungeon Masters Kit" rather than a "module" or an "adventure".

Also in 1976, the adventure ''[[Lost Caverns of Tsojconth]]'' was distributed by Metro Detroit Gamers as the tournament module for the [[gaming convention]] Wintercon V, but was not published for general distribution at the time. The adventure was later re-written for the first edition ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' rules and published as module S4&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth|The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth]]'' (TSR, 1982).

Additional unpublished adventures were distributed at gaming conventions during this period, including ''[[Steading of the Hill Giant Chief]]'', used as a tournament module for [[Origins International Game Expo|Origins '78]]. Later in 1978, ''Steading of the Hill Giant Chief'' became the first stand-alone ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' module actually produced and published by TSR. TSR Hobbies produced a series of six adventures in 1978 that had previously only been used in tournaments.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp| title=The History of TSR| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=2005-08-20| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_History.asp&amp;date=2008-10-04| archivedate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company initiated its practice of assigning a code to each module published at the time, assigning the "G1" code to ''Steading of the Hill Giant Chief''. TSR's practice of coding modules into various series would continue into the 1990s.

==Contents of adventures==
The standard adventure is essentially an adventure kit including a backstory, maps and one or more objectives for the players to fulfill. Some include numerous illustrations. A [[Dungeon Master]] could purchase these pre-made adventures and use it or parts of it for a gaming session. The early format was a single booklet inserted, but not fixed, in a cardboard cover. As time went by the format and information included in module increased in variety. [[Dark Sun]] modules, for example, contained top-spiralbound notebooks.  Eventually, the line blurred somewhat between what was an accessory or supplement and a module.

Modules had a suggested [[character level]], often displayed prominently on the cover, and from the late 1980s prominently display the [[logo]] of the [[campaign setting]] they were set in. Some modules were reprints or revisions of modules used at [[gaming convention]]s before being published. All early modules are now out of print, though some have been reprinted in revised form. As such, many early modules are now highly sought-out collector items, particularly the earliest printings.

==Module codes==
Except for a few early limited edition modules, all ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' modules until late 1994 were denoted with an alphanumeric code consisting of a letter and a number. The letter codes were based in some way on the product, with the number following the letter designating what number the product was in the series.&lt;ref name="D&amp;Dfaq"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp| title = ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' FAQ| accessdate = 2008-10-03| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_FAQ.asp&amp;date=2008-10-03| archivedate = 2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modules within a letter set were usually somehow related, either [[Theme (literature)|thematically]] or as a series of linked adventures.  For example, Z1 may be a prologue to Z2. Or Z1, Z2 and Z3 may have the adventurers fighting a similar enemy such as [[Beholder (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|beholders]]. Though related, most modules were stand-alone and could be played without playing any of the other related modules.

TSR also used the module coding system on modules for several of non-''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' roleplaying games including modules for '' [[Marvel Super-Heroes (role-playing game)|(Advanced) Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' and the ''[[Conan Role-Playing Game]]''. The module code was de-emphasised in the late 1980s, which also saw the [[campaign setting]] logo become a main feature of the cover. The code was dropped altogether by the end of 1993. In 2008, the adventure code was reintroduced with the release of the 4th edition ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' adventure: H1 [[Keep on the Shadowfell]].&lt;ref name="H1KotS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/dndacc/217187400 |title=''H1 Keep on the Shadowfell'' |accessdate=2009-02-13 |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216110955/http://wizards.com/default.asp?x=products%2Fdndacc%2F217187400 |archivedate=16 February 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''American Cheerleader''''' is the first and largest national teen magazine dedicated to covering sideline and competitive cheerleading. It was founded in 1995 and is currently based in Memphis, Tennessee. Staff includes Editor-in-Chief Jackie Martin and Managing Editor Kim Conley.

==History==
Inspired by the popularity and competitive nature of cheerleading in the early 1990s, publishing executive Michael Weiskopf started a magazine to take advantage of its evolving culture. The first issue was published in New York in January 1995.

It was published by Lifestyle Ventures, LLC, and the first issue featured [[University of Maryland]] cheerleader Penny Ramsey, who went on to become a castaway in Thailand on the CBS show ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"Penny Ramsey - IMDb." The Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Web. 20 Oct. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Special Collector’s Editions were produced in February 2005 and February 2010 to commemorate the magazine’s 10th and 15th anniversaries. Lifestyle Media, Inc. was acquired by [[Macfadden Performing Arts Media]], LLC in 2006. [[Varsity Spirit]] bought the magazine in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2012/american-cheerleader-sold-varsity-spirit-corp|title=American Cheerleader Sold to Varsity Spirit Corp.|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2012/01/23/varsity-spirit-corp-buys-american.html Varsity Spirit Corp. buys American Cheerleader magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|the entertainment industry|the concept of ancillary markets in power systems|ancillary services (electric power)}}

'''Ancillary markets''' are non-theatrical markets for [[feature films]], like [[home video]], television, [[Pay Per View]], [[Video on demand|VOD]], Internet streaming, airlines and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://indieranch.com/distribute.html |title=Knowing your audience is one thing, reaching them is another. |first=Yuri |last=Koll |work=indieranch.com |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maccs.com/non-theatrical |title=MACCS International Theatrical Film Distribution Software |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109215530/http://www.maccs.com/non-theatrical |archivedate=January 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Before television, studios played their films in theaters exclusively. However, in 1950 many studios began to sell all their pre-1948 features to television syndicators. The television syndicators then would use these films to fill in their programming schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Criticism-Ideology/Distribution-ANCILLARY-MARKETS.html |title=Ancillary markets - Distribution |first= |last= |work=filmreference.com |year=2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the 1960s, the first domestic ancillary market for feature films was created. NBC was the first to practice the market on September 23, 1961 by programming "NBC Saturday Night at the Movies." After such success, ABC became the second network ever to program a series of prime time features in 1962. One of the other networks, CBS, followed and added a prime time feature program in 1965.

Today, feature films opens in motion picture theaters to establish its box-office value. After that is established, it is then released to ancillary markets in a particular order as follows:

* Video and [[Pay Per View]] (PPV)
* Premium cable services such as HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax
* Cable television
* Network television
* Television syndication

The sequence is to maximize the full economic potential of each market.

==VCR==
Home video recorders were made public when Sony introduced the half-inch Betamax cassette in 1975. Following Betamax, the company JVC introduced the Video Home System (VHS).  Marketed by RCA and manufactured by Matsushita, VHS soon became known as the video-cassette recorders (VCRs). VCRs, which gave the consumer the option of recording programs from television, were a new form of competition in the demanding consumer market. VCRs revenue contributed to the development of the ancillary market of video and DVD. By the 1980s, five million households owned VCRs. Major studios had not yet adapted to the new video technologies that were being developed for consumers. There were no anticipations of new markets or other opportunities to expand until an entrepreneur, Andre Blay, opened Hollywood film companies’ eyes. Blay wanted the license to transfer and sell their films on tape.  After he succeeded and his approach was beneficial, film companies all around became a part of the video distribution. The film companies could not deny the fact that this new distribution would lead to a new revenue stream.&lt;ref&gt;P., McDonald &amp; J., Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD==
As the VHS market saturated, multiple media executives and manufacturers liked the idea of utilizing other home video technologies. In 1993, the film industry upgraded their technology with the creation of several new formats including the DVD, or digital video disc. Many manufacturers such as the Japanese (Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba) and the European (Philips and Thomson) collaborated to facilitate development of the DVD Forum. In March 1997, the US launch of the DVD systems went smoothly due to Hollywood's solidarity. Manufacturers and film studios decided to avoid making the same mistake of the VHS format battles and agreed upon a universal standard of cooperation. When first introduced in 1997, DVDs sold at the low price of $20, for which they offered high-quality image and extra special features. Consumers liked the advantages of the DVDs and soon surpassed VHS sales.&lt;ref&gt;Wasser, Frederick.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video and DVD: Hollywood Retools". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premium television==

The first premium rate television services were [[Phonevision]], [[Telemeter (pay television)|Telemeter]], SubscriberVision, among others. None of them were successful, until the launch of Home Box Office ([[HBO]]) in 1972, considered the first successful premium-rate subscription television service. Other services were launched: [[Z Channel]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[The Movie Channel]], [[Cinemax]], [[Spotlight (TV channel)|Spotlight]] and [[Home Theater Network]]. Only Showtime, The Movie Channel and Cinemax survived through the 1980s. These premium rate services air features unedited, uncut, and commercial-free, the same way they were shown on theaters and/or home video.

==Cable television==
{{Empty section|date=June 2011}}

==Network television==
Out of the many ancillary markets out there, none were more effective and revenue rewarding than network television, and eventually syndication began. [[Amanda D. Lotz]] spoke on the radical change in her book titled ''Television Will Be Revolutionized (2008)."
She mentions how time went on and as the post-network era developed, that the limited ways there were for medium to be distributed was eliminated. What was expanding, and evolving was network television as a whole.&lt;Lotz 85&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotz|first=Amanda|title=Television Will be Revolutionized|year=2007|publisher=NYU Press|pages=86|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/archivedassets/096/15646.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt; At first channels were few, and very limited. But soon came the multi-channel transition, then on with the creation of cable TV. As that later expended cable began to see the 'cash cow' in that and began selling shares to different networks in order to air their studio programs. Not only did Network Television open up ancillary markets for TV, but other markets as well. The VCR then became a hot commodity, because the consumer wanted the option of recording. That slowly transitioned to the DVD that took out the VCR, and finally DVR. Which seems to be just that, a VCR and a DVD combined. Network television took a gigantic step when it later allowed programs to have different showing dates, and even multiple air times. This offered different networks to still be able to ear revenue off of an older film that already has left the box office.

==Making Television Safe for Film==

According to McDonald and Wasko, Hollywood's interest in emerging medium of television dates from the 1920s and includes experiments with the developing technology, an alternative model of television as home theater, applications for television frequencies, as well as investments in broadcasting companies that were exploring television (Anderson, 1994; Hilmes, 1990; Wasko, 1994). The evidence suggests that studios clearly wanted to control the development and implementation of television technology. Securing that control required the assistance of the Federal Communication Commission, which regulated television's development by articulating technical standards and operating rules and through the FCC's exclusive right to license the use of television frequencies for experimentation or broadcast (McDonald and Wasko, p.&amp;nbsp;107).

==Video games==
Video games are a rapidly growing ancillary market for feature films. Video game over-all gross income has consistently surpassed that of movie sales since 2004. Because of the increased interest in video games many major media and communication companies have begun to show interest in video games as a way to market, brand, and advertise for their product.  Some movies that have benefited from this are the ''Harry Potter'', ''Lord of the Rings'', and ''James Bond'' series. Because the video game industry has been able to outplay and outgross many movies, video game manufacturers are beginning to look in the direction of producing their own movies as well. Microsoft's producers of ''Halo'' have decided to pass Hollywood studios and produce their own movie.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Randy.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood has shown interest in the video game industry as an ancillary market almost as far as video games have existed. The film industry's goal within the video game industry is to either seek control and therefore ownership of the video game market or to license products to video game producers. Once the video game profits are high, that is when Hollywood seeks control. On the other hand, when profits are down, that is when Hollywood offers the licensing. The collaboration had always been problematic since the film industry had been uncertain about the development of video games. Hollywood has seen video games as another promotional scheme for a film.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Randy.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recorded Music==
Hollywood has had interactions with the recorded music industry that dates back as far as the studio system itself.  The interactions between the two include three main periods; 1927-1957: recorded music as a form of promotion, 1957-1977: recorded music as cross-promotion and ancillary revenue, and 1977-1997: recorded music as cross-promotion, ancillary revenue stream, and means of spreading risk.
In addition to music's promotional value, studios realized that, "A chart success was an effective way of generating additional revenue for their companies, both in terms of publishing and performance royalties and, of course, in outright sales."  Recorded music proved to be of great value as an ancillary market to the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-3388-3|pages=143–151|author=Smith, Jeff|authorlink=Ancillary Markets-Recorded Music: Charting the Rise and Fall of the Soundtrack Album|editor=McDonald &amp; Wasko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Like many [[paraphilia]]s, the origins of a balloon fetish are complex and vary between individuals, but may be explained as a form of [[imprinting (psychology)#Sexual imprinting|sexual imprinting]].  Many "looners" attribute their fetish to early sexual or pre-sexual experiences with balloons, often involving their being burst by members of the desirable sex.&lt;ref name=awesome /&gt; These experiences frequently accompany or instigate a [[phobia]] of balloons in the individual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balloonland.com/Fet/Fetdangers.htm|title=Dangerous balloons !|website=Balloonland.com|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; most often associated with the sudden loud noise when they burst, a form of [[phonophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phobia-fear-release.com/fear-of-balloons-popping.html|title=Get Rid of Fear Of Balloons Popping. How To Cure Fear Of Balloons Popping|website=Phobia-fear-release.com|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the extent to which this phobia persists through and after [[puberty]], balloon fetishists may regard balloons bursting as either essential to the sexual experience (and frequently refer to themselves as '''poppers'''), or to be avoided at all costs (as '''non-poppers'''). Even those who are not phobic of the act of a balloon popping may prefer not to pop due to an [[anthropomorphized]] emotional attachment to the balloon, which is perfectly normal to non-poppers. One hallmark of the distinction between poppers and non-poppers may be in seeing balloons' bursting either as a metaphor for [[orgasm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=B is for... |url=http://www.iateskinny.com/2013/01/b-is-for.html |website=I Ate Skinny |accessdate=17 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223135525/http://www.iateskinny.com/2013/01/b-is-for.html |archivedate=23 February 2014 |date=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a metaphor for [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mistressofasia.com/fetish-balloon.php|title=Balloon Fetish / Mistress of Asia|website=Mistressofasia.com|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That popping balloons is central to several popular [[party games]] suggests that enjoyment of the act, the challenge, and the anticipation of popping is not confined to fetishists. However, for fetishists the [[wikt:adrenaline rush|adrenaline rush]] associated with the "danger" that a balloon will pop produces a sexual response. This helps to explain why even non-poppers who have an intense phobia of balloons popping in non-sexual contexts may be aroused by the possibility within safe sexual contexts. It may even suggest that balloon fetish, for poppers and non-poppers alike, is part of the [[BDSM]] spectrum of fetishes in which a controlled amount of danger is used to elicit a pleasurable [[fight-or-flight response]] in participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Mental_Health_Letter/2011/March/understanding-the-stress-response|title=Understanding the stress response|author=Harvard Health Publications|website=Health.harvard.edu|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazard==
A true [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] is characterized in the [[DSM-IV]] by its social and occupational impedance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26861774_The_DSM_diagnostic_criteria_for_fetishism/file/79e4150ec25370dde7.pdf|title=ResearchGate - Share and discover research|website=Researchgate.net|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is currently in the DSM-V (see Paraphilic Disorders)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf |title=Page Not Found |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226050453/http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to where a fetish is no longer considered as a disorder (except for fetishistic disorder where if the fetish interferes with the person's life).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globophilia.blogspot.com/2014/05/from-kink-to-fetish-to-dsm-vi.html?zx=c89b7bf74f6e3567|title=Globophilia|author=Tim Popper|website=Globophiliablogspot.com|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, fetishism is classified as code F65.0 in the ICD-10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F65.0|title=ICD-10 Version:2015|website=Apps.who.int|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from these hazards, balloon fetishism carries with it the hazards of bursting balloons in close proximity to one's body. Eye and ear protection is recommended for such exposure to avoid eye damage or hearing loss. These hazards may be heightened since balloon fetishists often employ larger-than-average balloons and high-energy forms of popping them, such as overinflation.&lt;ref name=awesome /&gt;

In addition, those who sit, stomp, or lie on large balloons may be vulnerable to [[Falling (accident)|fall injuries]] when the balloons burst. Additional injuries may occur due to friction and static electricity during prolonged interactions with balloons. Choking is a potential risk for those "looners" for whom the fetish includes kissing or mouthing the balloon. Although largely hypothetical, a "looner" engaged in an orgy with multiple helium-filled balloons may sustain impact injuries such as pelvic fractures, falling from heights at the moment of climax.

==Variations==
A different form of this fetish is the "Bubblegum Balloon Fetish" or "Bubblegum Looning", where, instead of latex balloons, [[Bubblegum]] is used to produce small to big balloons (depending on the size of the gum). In this case, the "popper" or "non-popper" difference is absent since  balloons can be produced over and over (differently from latex ones, that, once burst, have to be discarded).
Bubblegum looners tend to like watching people produce balloons with bubblegum or producing balloons themselves.

As with balloon looning, Bubblegum Looning can be used in sexual activities to enhance sexual performances. In this case, bubblegum balloons may also be blown against some partner's body parts to enhance sexual excitement or as a form of game play.

A number of looners also enjoy other variations, such as rubber glove balloons (mainly latex  and nitrile [[medical glove]]s), condoms, beach balls, the Wubble Bubble Ball, inflatable PVC plastic toys (mainly blow up sharks, whales, and hammers), and inflating bin liners or garbage bags.  The latter is often combined with a [[crush fetish]] where the looner is aroused  the sight of glossy, polyethylene garbage sacks being compressed by the hydraulic compactor of a [[garbage truck]] or other similar apparatus to the point where they burst or explode - in its most extreme form this may even be combined with a form of  [[vorarephilia]], where the looner desires to be crushed and consumed by the machine itself along with the sacks.

The '''Bud Light Daredevils''' were an American acrobatic basketball show that performed during the halftime of college and NBA basketball games from 1983 to 1998.  The show combined gymnastics, trampoline, acrobatics, and basketball.  The team was started by [[University of Mississippi]] cheerleaders [[Ty Cobb (cheerleader)|Ty Cobb]], Sam Martin, Robert Kirby, Tyler Hubbard, John White, and Ty Cobb's younger brother [[Guy Cobb]].

==Ole Miss and the Inception of Acrobatic Basketball (1979–83)==
[[File:Ole Miss Cheerleaders at Houston Rockets.jpg|thumb|Ole Miss cheerleaders (including [[Colonel Reb]]) performing as the halftime entertainment during a Houston Rockets game]]
In 1980, Ty Cobb, along with fellow cheerleaders Sam Martin, John White, and Jeff Hubbard (as [[Ole Miss Rebels]] mascot [[Colonel Reb]]) began performing ball handling skits and acrobatics which incorporated a mini-trampoline during the time-outs and half-time of Ole Miss basketball games. Using his previous trampoline and diving skills and the cheerleader's mini-trampoline, Ty Cobb, on a dare performed the first successful acrobatic "flip dunk" at the Ole Miss vs. Alabama basketball game in 1980 and received a standing ovation by Alabama fans. Ole Miss Head Basketball Coach Bob Weltlich, recognizing the group's potential to soften up an opposing team's crowd, began flying the foursome with the Ole Miss Basketball team to away games.

In 1980, Ty Cobb's fraternity brother and fellow Ole Miss cheerleader Walt Shinault was practicing stunts using a mini-trampoline in the yard of his apartment complex in Oxford when he fell and broke his neck. The fall left him a quadriplegic. After the accident the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) banned the use of mini-trampolines by all cheerleaders at SEC games.

With the banning of the use of mini-trampolines by cheerleaders throughout the SEC, Ty Cobb began looking for other ways for the group to continue performing their developing halftime show. Working on a marketing class project which had asked that students create their own company, Ty Cobb created a company called "The Ole Miss Cheerleaders Half Time Show". He designed marketing brochures and advertising materials that he then sent to [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) promotional directors as part of a direct marketing campaign. The concept worked as the promotional directors at many of the NBA teams were looking for new ways to increase attendance and contacted Ty to schedule the "Ole Miss Cheerleaders" to perform during the time outs and halftime of their home games. The first professional NBA performance by The Ole Miss Cheerleaders was for the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in 1980, followed by shows for the [[Houston Rockets]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]].

Still in high school in 1981, Ty Cobb's younger brother [[Guy Cobb]] joined the show for performances at NBA games. With the addition of Guy, the team began experimenting with different ways to acrobatically pass the basketball. These passes were mixed and matched with each other to not only allow for more complex acrobatic dunks to be performed but also to provide a way for the team to incorporate more passes into the dunk sequences without having to stop the show. One example was the "flip-pass" off the basketball backboard. This pass could be followed by another flip-pass and another and then a dunk ("Congo Dunk" 1987).

==The Dixie Daredevils (1983–84)==
[[File:The Dixie Daredevils.jpg|thumb|left|Brothers Ty and [[Guy Cobb]] performing with Steve Cliffe as "The Dixie Daredevils" in a grocery store parking lot (Summer 1983).]]
Following his graduation from Ole Miss in the Fall of 1983, Ty Cobb began planning to create a professional half-time show that would travel and perform during the college and NBA basketball season.[10] Guy Cobb, having just completed his freshman year at Ole Miss, dropped out of school to join his brother.[13]

In 1983 Cobb's father became President of Colonial Baking Company in St. Louis.[2] The two Cobb brothers relocated with their parents to the small community of Columbia, Illinois located southeast of St. Louis. They set up an office in their parent's basement and began organizing a performance schedule for the 1983-84 basketball season. Charles Cobb came up with the team's new professional name of "Dixie Daredevils". Steve Cliffe, a former Mehlville High School school mate of Ty Cobb's also joined the Dixie Daredevils at this time.[2] [14]

In the Summer of 1983, Cobb's father scheduled the Dixie Daredevils as a Colonial Bread promotion. He sponsored the Dixie Daredevils for performances in grocery store parking lots and at high school assemblies throughout the metro St. Louis and central Illinois areas.[2] [14]

During the 1983-84 basketball season, Ty and [[Guy Cobb]] performed 45 shows throughout the United States. At the end of the season they received a call from Anheuser-Busch to discuss a sponsorship of the Dixie Daredevils to be associated with a new beer called "Budweiser Light".[2]

==The Bud Light Daredevils (1984–1998)==
[[File:Guy Cobb Bud Light Daredevils.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guy Cobb]] performing with the Bud Light Daredevils in 1987.]] 
Both Cobb brothers worked for Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) during the Summer of 1982 as cheerleading instructors. Ty Cobb had met Mack Hirshberg at UCA's college cheerleading camp the previous Summer. Hirshberg was a cheerleader at the University of South Carolina and had just graduated. In the Summer of 1983 Anheuser-Busch changed the name of their new beer "Budweiser Light" to "Bud Light". Mack Hirshberg joined the group for the 1984-85 premiere season and the team's name was changed from The Dixie Daredevils to The Bud Light Daredevils.[10] [15]

From 1984 to 1998 the Bud Light Daredevils performed at universities and NBA games throughout all 50 United States.[16] When they were not performing during the American basketball season, they found sponsors for tours of the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, Japan, China, Norway, South America, Australia, Israel, and Puerto Rico. Corporate sponsors included Boeing, Converse, Wang Laboratories, SportLife Chewing Gum, and Gordon's Gin. The group was also featured on national television shows such as ABC's That's Incredible!, Incredible Sunday, Showtime's Super Dave (TV series), Disney's The Mickey Mouse Club, and most recently, former Bud Light Daredevil Mark Odgers was featured performing a flip dunk over a New York City Cab live on Late Night with David Letterman.[10]

Anheuser-Busch ended their fourteen-year sponsorship of the Bud Light Daredevils in 1998 in response to both governmental and social pressure to eliminate all alcohol marketing to college students.[17] [18]

Each team must perform a 2 minutes and 30 seconds routine in which 1 minute and 30 seconds of the routine may contain music. Routines showcase different elements including sideline cheers, pyramids and stunts, dance, and gymnastics. There is also a division for group stunt competition where a group of five participants perform a 60–65 seconds routine of strictly stunts. There is also a division for partner stunt competition that includes one male and one female and one spotter. These routines last around 55–60 seconds and can only incorporate stunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Rules|url=http://www.fjca.jp/cheerleading/contents_03.php|website=Foundation of Japan Cheerleading Association|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''childhood secret club''' is an informal [[organization]] created by children.

==Key elements==
Some common features of a childhood secret club may include:

'''Names.'''  Unlike [[clique]]s, these associations often have names. These younger groups don't have the social competition that adolescent cliques do, or the level of bad behaviour that street [[gang]]s have. However, in rare instances there may be rivalry with other such groups around the same age, which can lead to physical fights between them.

'''Peer leadership.''' Unlike group activities like [[Scouting]], which are led by adults, these groups are led by children.

'''[[Pro forma]] secrecy.''' The secrecy may be more imaginary than real. For instance the name of the club (if it has one) and its membership are usually obvious to all. There may be a desire to create secret [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and plans, but they are rarely implemented. A ramshackle den, [[tree house]], clubhouse, fort, or "secret base" may be built in nearby scrub-land or an abandoned building. Some children in a secret club may use a part of the grounds of the school they attend together as their "base" during periods of recess.

'''Single-sex membership.''' Such clubs are usually either all boys or all girls but not mixed {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} but exceptions do occur. There may be a sense of competition between the genders, as well as independence from adult authority.

'''Catch-phrase/greetings/secret words.''' Sometimes the clubs develop one or more secret catch-phrases or (sometimes nonsensical words) and greetings. This is illustrated in the 1982 film ''[[P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang]]''.

==Their status==
Many schools have rules against secret clubs, and some jurisdictions even have laws prohibiting secret or invitation-only societies in public elementary or secondary schools.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The fact that interest in these clubs tends to be a passing phase at a certain age{{clarify|reason=Avoid weasel words / What age?|date=June 2015}} may result from the stages of children's [[cognitive development]]. After growing out of the "[[egocentric]]", or "preoperational" stage, {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} reaching the "[[age of reason]]", one is able to understand other people's intentions. The next step is the ability to understand groups and the desire to belong to a club.

Written material about these secret clubs, such as the external links listed below, cites eight- and nine-year-olds most often. While slightly older children may also participate in secret clubs, they would be less expected to use fantasy elements in their activities.

Juvenile comics and literature often feature such clubs as a [[plot device]], often with spy or detective themes, and often far more organized than their real-life counterparts. A more realistic depiction is found in [[Zilpha Keatley Snyder]]'s novel ''[[The Egypt Game]]'', in which six children gather in an abandoned storage yard to [[Storytelling game|enact fantasy adventures]] and recreate actual ceremonies based on and adapted from their knowledge of ancient Egypt.

Movies have featured such clubs, notably the early [[Ealing Studios|Ealing]] comedy-thriller [[Hue and Cry (film)|''Hue &amp; Cry'']]. There are also juvenile non-fiction books that serve as "how-to's" for code-making and [[surveillance]], most notably the [[Usborne Publishing|Usborne]] ''[[Good Spy Guide]]'' series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4852">[[Image:Chinface.jpg|300px|thumb]] A rare esemplare of a chinface.

A '''chinface''', sometimes referred to as a '''chinikin''', '''chinhead''', '''chinman''', or '''chinmonster''' is a [[performance]], usually of a [[comedy|comical]] nature, involving someone's chin. By drawing or attaching eyes, it gives the impression of a distorted face when viewed upside down.

==Origins==
In the early 1950s ventriloquist [[Paul Winchell]] created a chin face character named Oswald [https://books.google.com/books?id=VVYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=oswald+paul+winchell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BUHA3YUivG&amp;sig=PK9jb1tsgkTITv_G3QZeipgfOzE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwDmoVChMItfOgue2XyAIVgS6ICh3E1Qo_#v=onepage&amp;q=oswald%20paul%20winchell&amp;f=false.]

In 1964, [[Bob Denver]] performed a chin face in the [[beach party film]], "[https://archive.is/20060327025828/http://www.bobdenver.com/Big_Screen_Bob/For_Those_Who_Think_Young/for_those_who_think_young.html For Those Who Think Young]".

In 1988, McEwans Lager launched a new TV ad campaign featuring 'The Chinheads', a fictional and quirky 'upside-down' rock/soul band. The award-winning TV advert was directed by [[Steve Barron]] (director of [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Billie Jean]]", [[A-Ha]]'s "[[Take on Me]]", and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'') and featured the track "Something So Real" by Scottish band, [[The Love Decree]].

In 1989, a single was subsequently released and charted nationally, peaking at No.61 (No.1, Outselling [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]]'s "[[Ride On Time]]" in Scotland).
The Love Decree were: Robin Gow (Keyboards/Songwriter), Grant Macintosh (Vocals/Songwriter) and Gordon Gow (Percussion). The track 'Something So Real" was produced by Robin Gow.

The 'Chinheads' TV Ad can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wRBBzOqafE Here]

[[Ben Elton]]'s 1990 television show ''[[The Man from Auntie]]'' featured several chinface performances.

In 1993, an episode of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', "Gunmen of the Apocalypse", Lister used a chinface when the crew had to convince a ship of simulants (artificially created, [[cyborg]] humanoids) that there were no humans aboard, insisting instead that the ship was crewed by curry-based lifeforms known as "[[Vindaloo]]vians".

==Popular culture==
Since [[video hosting]] sites have become available on the [[internet]], chinface videos have become increasingly common.

In the mid&amp;ndash;1990s, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] [[Canada]] released TV ads for [[Kraft Dinner]] featuring various people performing chinfaces and eating the product.

The [[video game]] ''[[You Don't Know Jack (franchise)|You Don't Know Jack]]'' featured as an ending to Volume 4 ''(The Ride)'' footage showing part of the hosts' faces. The character Guy Towers is portrayed as a chin face, with oversized glasses.

Disc 4 of the ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' DVD Box Set features [[Chris Pontius]] performing a chinface of a "Latvian Gangster" during a running of the [[Gumball 3000]].

[[They Might Be Giants]]' first video, for their song "[[Put Your Hand Inside the Puppet Head]]," features one of them doing the chinface, with a xeroxed picture of his eyes placed on his chin.

In the video for [[Weird Al Yankovic]]'s style-parody of [[Devo]], his band is shown several times as chinfaces wearing Devo's yellow tyvek suits.

In the [[Monstrosity (film)|Atomic Brain]] episode of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]] demonstrates to the 'bots a "chin face".  He says that the tradition is "fun...whimsical"; [[Crow T. Robot|Crow]] counters that it is "odd and disturbing".

In ''[[The Nanny]]'', Fran and Gracie enter a Mother-Daughter beauty pageant, for the talent competition both sang a song as chin faces.

In the popular French film ''[[Amélie]]'', the main character is shown in a scene performing chinface.

In ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'', one of Gumball's classmates, Sussie, is a chin face puppet, as are her parents.

In ''[[Jackass 3D]]'', [[Chris Pontius]] performs a chinface of a barbarian as part of the stunt "Pontius the barbarian"

In the YouTube channel The 298Universe, one of the main characters, Bob Cumberland, is a chinkin puppet. He is known as simply, Bob the Chinkin.

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Death of Caesar, the well-known climax of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'']]

The '''climax''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word ''κλῖμαξ'', meaning "staircase" and "ladder") or '''turning point''' of a [[narrative|narrative work]] is its point of highest tension and drama, or it is the time when the action starts during which the solution is given.&lt;ref Name="Herrick"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Robert Herrick |author2=Lindsay Todd Damon  | title = Composition and Rhetoric for Schools  | publisher = Scott, Foresman and Co.  | year=  1902  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 382  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XwABAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA382&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1   | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book  |author1=Jefferson Butler Fletcher |author2=George Rice Carpenter  | title = Introduction to Theme-writing  | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon  | year=  1893  | location = Original from Harvard University  | pages = 84  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dP0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Climax+(narrative)+-wikipedia&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1  | doi =    }}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax of a story is a [[literary element]].

== Examples ==
The [[punch line]] of a [[joke]] is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative, though the absence of any [[falling action]] is an essential difference, which may reflect the nature of [[humor]] as opposed to the nature of [[drama]].

In non-fictional narrative [[genre]]s, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and "plot" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.

In the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', by the famous Greek playwright, [[Euripides]], the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that [[Aphrodite]]'s curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.

== {{anchor|Anti-climax}} Anticlimax ==
An anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, "Emergency Self-Destruct", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet [[Earth]], the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.

CAPE was founded in 1991 as a way to connect AAPIs in the entertainment industry by television producer and executive [[Wenda Fong]], publicist [[Fritz Friedman]], and film producer and executive [[Chris Lee (producer)|Chris Lee]]. The organization had few members when it was founded, as there were very few Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who were very visible in the media. However, since its founding, CAPE has grown to support both new and established actors, writers, directors, producers, agents, and executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission and History|url=http://capeusa.org/mission/|website=CAPE Usa|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite starting small, the CAPE community mobilized through volunteer efforts, and their educational programs and opportunities have helped members develop their careers in the entertainment industry by connecting them to the tools they need to enhance their careers. Additionally, CAPE has been working on developing connections with US and International film industries of [[China]], [[India]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Philippines]].

In 2009, CAPE hired its first Executive Director, Jennifer Sanderson. In 2014, CAPE moved from being a paid membership-driven organization to a mission-driven organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Important Announcement from CAPE|url=http://capeusa.org/an-important-announcement-from-cape/|website=CAPE Usa|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization decided that in order to fulfill its original goals of serving the AAPI community, they needed to open up their resources to be available to anyone who needed to access them.

In December 2014, Jennifer Sanderson officially stepped down. In 2015, Michelle K. Sugihara took helm and is currently CAPE's Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://capeusa.org/2015/04/cape-welcomes-new-executive-director-michelle-k-sugihara/|title=CAPE Welcomes New Executive Director Michelle K.

In October 2016, CAPE celebrated its 25th Anniversary. [[Steven Yeun]], [[Harry Shum Jr.]], and [[Constance Wu]] were some of the many in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yomyomf.com/cape-celebrates-25-years-of-asians-in-entertainment-and-calls-loudly-for-greater-diversity/|title=CAPE Celebrates 25 Years Of Asians In Entertainment And Calls Loudly For Greater Diversity|website=www.yomyomf.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">'''Dial-A-Poem''' is  a phone-based service started in 1968 by poet [[John Giorno]] after a phone conversation with his friend [[William Burroughs]]. Fifteen phone lines were connected to individual answering machines; anyone could phone [[Giorno Poetry Systems]] and listen for free to a poem offered from various live recordings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/30/arts/dialapoem-enters-the-internet-age.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weirdretro.org.uk/the-dial-a-poem-poets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The venture was a success from 1969 on, and the poems dealt with numerous social issues such as the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[sexual revolution]]. Giorno claimed the service later influenced the creation of other information services over the telephone, such as banking, sports, and investing. It spawned a number of imitators. Eventually, all of them were eclipsed by the internet, most particularly by [[YouTube]].

[[Image:Skegness4web.jpg|thumb|British seaside donkeys in [[Skegness]], [[Lincolnshire]], used for donkey rides on the beach.]]

'''Donkey rides''' are a traditional feature of [[seaside resort]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]. Children are allowed to ride [[donkey]]s on a sandy [[beach]] for a fee in summer months while on holiday, normally led in groups at walking pace. Typically, the donkeys used to have their names on their [[safety harness|harnesses]] so they could be identified by children and parents alike.

Donkey rides have been available since 1886 in [[Weston Super Mare]] and since 1895 in [[Bridlington]].

The tradition started in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, but is now much less popular. It is probable that the donkeys offered to ride on were originally working draught animals in the cockle industries around the coast.

{{Nihongo|'''''Dragon Ball'''''|ドラゴンボール|Doragon Bōru|lead=yes}}, sometimes styled as ''Dragonball'', is a Japanese [[media franchise]] created by [[Akira Toriyama]] in 1984. The initial [[manga]], written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes by its publisher [[Shueisha]]. ''Dragon Ball'' was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, [[Goku|Son Goku]], from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting [[Japanese dragon|dragon]] when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.

Toriyama's [[Dragon Ball (manga)|manga]] was adapted and divided into two [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]]: ''[[Dragon Ball (anime)|Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed [[List of Dragon Ball films|19 animated feature films]] and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'' (1996–1997) and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' (2015–2018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of ''Dragon Ball Z'' aired in Japan under the title ''Dragon Ball Kai'', as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with [[List of Dragon Ball soundtracks|several collections of soundtracks]] and a [[List of Dragon Ball video games|large number of video games]]. {{As of|December 2014}},  the franchise has generated over {{US$|5&amp;nbsp;billion|link=yes}} in merchandise sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecnl.com/FunimationDec2014Catalog.pdf|title=Funimation December 2014 catalogue|date=December 2014|website=www.thecnl.com|access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dragon Ball'' is one of the top ten [[List of the highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]], as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pokemon Beats Out Star Wars, Marvel as Highest Grossing Media Franchise |url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/08/28/pokemon-highest-grossing-media-franchise/ |work=ComicBook.com |date=August 28, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its release, ''Dragon Ball'' has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time. The manga's 42 volumes have sold over 159{{nbsp}}million copies in Japan and over 350{{nbsp}}million copies worldwide, making it the second [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history&lt;!-- this is referenced in the reception section below. --&gt;. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest manga series ever made, with many [[Mangaka|manga artists]] citing ''Dragon Ball'' as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly ''Dragon Ball Z'', is also highly popular in various countries and was arguably one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture.

[[Akira Toriyama]] loosely modeled ''Dragon Ball'' on the classic Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'';&lt;ref name="Manga Design"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manga Design |chapter=Akira Toriyama |first=Julius |last=Wiedemann |editor=Amano Masanao (ed.) |publisher=[[Taschen]] |date=September 25, 2004 |page=372 |isbn=3-8228-2591-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clements |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Clements |author2=[[Helen McCarthy]]  |title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917 |date=September 1, 2001 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-880656-64-7 |oclc=47255331 |pages=101–102 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also redeveloped it from his 1983 [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] manga ''Dragon Boy''.&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"/&gt; He has said that the fighting was influenced from movies by famous martial arts actor [[Jackie Chan]],&lt;ref name="Illustrations"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 大全集 1: COMPLETE ILLUSTRATIONS|year=1995|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=206–207|language =Japanese|isbn=4-08-782754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Story"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: STORY GUIDE|year=1995|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=261–265|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-782752-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he wanted to create a story with the basic theme of ''Journey to the West'', but with "a little [[kung fu]]."&lt;ref name="TenkaDen"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 天下一伝説|year=2004|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=80–91|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-873705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama was a fan of [[Hong Kong martial arts films]] such as ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]'' in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dragon Ball Z Legend: The Quest Continues |date=2004 |publisher=DH Publishing Inc |isbn=9780972312493 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEeDFD3KItgC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was serialized in a shōnen magazine, he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something, without thinking of what the characters would wish for.&lt;ref name="TenkaDen"/&gt; With Goku being [[Sun Wukong]], [[Bulma]] as [[Tang Sanzang]], [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Oolong|Oolong]] as [[Zhu Bajie]] and [[Yamcha]] being [[Sha Wujing]], he originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shenlong2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Shenlong Times 2 |work=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: Story Guide |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |year=1995| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed ''Dragon Ball'' at readers older than those of his previous serial ''[[Dr. Slump]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/takahashi4.html |title=Toriyama/Takahashi interview |publisher=Furinkan.com |date=1986 |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in ''Dr. Slump'', deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of [[China]] his wife had bought.&lt;ref name="World"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 大全集 4: WORLD GUIDE|year=1995|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=164–169 |isbn=4-08-782754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island where the {{nihongo|Tenkaichi Budōkai|天下一武道会||lit. "Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament"}} is held is modeled after [[Bali]], which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around [[Babidi|Bobbidi]]'s spaceship he consulted photos of [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="World"/&gt;
[[File:Wiki DragonBall Earth.png|thumb|right|The Earth of ''Dragon Ball'', as published in ''Daizenshuu 4: World Guide'']]

During the early chapters of the manga Toriyama's editor, [[Kazuhiko Torishima]], commented that Goku looked rather plain, so to combat this he added several characters like [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Kame-Sennin|Kame-Sen'nin]] and [[Krillin|Kuririn]], and created the Tenkaichi Budōkai martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting. It was when the first Tenkaichi Budōkai began that ''Dragon Ball'' truly became popular, having recalled the races and tournaments in ''Dr. Slump''.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt; Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Spartan X]]'', in which enemies tended to appear very fast. He then created [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo Daimao]] as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;

Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the {{nihongo|Saiyans|サイヤ人|Saiya-jin}}; and Goku himself was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|authorlink1= Akira Toriyama|title=DRAGON BALL 天下一伝説|year=2004|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=80–91|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-873705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frieza|Freeza]], who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese economic bubble]] and was inspired by [[real estate]] [[Speculation|speculators]], whom Toriyama called the "worst kind of people."&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt; Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Ginyu Force|Ginyu Force]] to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the {{nihongo4|Super Saiyan|{{ruby|超|スーパー}}サイヤ人|Sūpā Saiya-jin}} transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|authorlink1= Akira Toriyama|title=DRAGON　BALL　大全集　5: TV ANIMATION PART 2 |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=206–210 |isbn=4-08-782755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added [[time travel]] next during the [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]] arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt; After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for [[Gohan]] to replace Goku as the series' [[protagonist]], but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;

Going against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of ''Dragon Ball''{{'s}} most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku.&lt;ref name="SJ interview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Interview with the Majin! Revisited |journal=[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]] |volume=5 |issue=11 |page=388 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |date=November 2007 |issn=1545-7818}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor [[Kazuhiko Torishima]] was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically.&lt;ref name="Chogashu"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 超画集|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=224–225|year=2013|isbn=978-4-08-782520-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings.&lt;ref name="World"/&gt; Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having [[screentone]] because he found it difficult to use.&lt;ref name="Illustrations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TenkaDen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shenlong2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON　BALL　大全集　5: TV ANIMATION PART 2 |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=206–210 |isbn=4-08-782755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the completion of ''Dragon Ball'', Toriyama has continued to add to its story, mostly background information on its universe, through guidebooks published by Shueisha.

During the second half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more interested in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines.&lt;ref name="Illustrations"/&gt; In 2013, he stated that because ''Dragon Ball'' is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art.&lt;ref name="Chogashu"/&gt; He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an "unconventional and contradictory" story.&lt;ref name="SJ interview"/&gt; In 2013, commenting on ''Dragon Ball''{{'}}s global success, Toriyama said, "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.", "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [my works] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers."&lt;ref name="AsahiInterview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Iwamoto |first=Tetsuo|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/AJ201303270032|title=Dragon Ball artist: 'I just wanted to make boys happy'|publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spin-offs====
Another manga penned by Ōishi, the three-chapter ''[[Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock]]'' that revolves around [[Burdock (Dragon Ball)|Bardock]], Goku's father, was published in the monthly magazine ''[[V Jump]]'' from August and October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-11-21/dragon-ball-episode-of-bardock-spinoff-manga-gets-anime |title=Dragon Ball Episode of Bardock Spinoff Manga Gets Anime |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, a spin-off manga titled ''Dragon Ball Side Story: The Case of Being Reincarnated as Yamcha'' began in Shueisha's ''Shōnen Jump+'' digital magazine. Written and illustrated by Dragon Garow Lee, it is about a high school boy who after an accident wakes up in the body of Yamcha in the ''Dragon Ball'' manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/12/11-1/dragon-ball-spin-off-imagines-a-world-where-yamcha-totally-rules|title="Dragon Ball" Spin-Off Imagines a World Where Yamcha Totally Rules|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|first=Paul|last=Chapman|date=December 12, 2016|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Crossovers ====
Toriyama also created a short series, ''[[Neko Majin]]'' (1999–2005), that became a self-parody of ''Dragon Ball''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-851090-9&amp;mode=1|script-title=ja:ネコマジン 完全版 |publisher=Shueisha|accessdate=June 22, 2008|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] between ''[[Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo]]'' (or ''Kochikame'') and ''Dragon Ball'' by Toriyama and ''Kochikame'' author [[Osamu Akimoto]] appeared in the {{nihongo4|''Super Kochikame''|超こち亀|Chō Kochikame}} manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/超こち亀-ジャンプコミックス-秋本-治/dp/4088740963|title=超こち亀|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Toriyama teamed up with [[Eiichiro Oda]] to create a crossover chapter of ''Dragon Ball'' and ''[[One Piece]]'' titled ''Cross Epoch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/03/comics-spotlight-on-shonen-jump-100/|title=Comics Spotlight on Shonen Jump #100|publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anime ===
''Dragon Ball'', ''Dragon Ball Z'', and ''Dragon Ball Z Kai'' are all adaptations of the manga, with various new material added in to make extra episodes so that Toriyama would have more time to write original chapters for them to adapt. ''Dragon Ball GT'' and ''Dragon Ball Heroes'' are not originated from any direct source material from Toriyama, being fully created by their respective animation studios. ''Dragon Ball Super'' was released parallel to (and many times ahead of) the manga of the same name, due to the fact that they were both based on the same outline by Toriyama for the story of ''Super''.

==== ''Dragon Ball'' ====
{{main|Dragon Ball (anime)|List of Dragon Ball episodes}}
[[Toei Animation]] produced an [[anime]] television series based on the first 194 manga chapters, also titled ''Dragon Ball''. The series premiered in Japan on [[Fuji Television]] on February 26, 1986 and ran until April 19, 1989, lasting 153 episodes.&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"/&gt;

==== ''Dragon Ball Z'' ====
{{main|Dragon Ball Z|List of Dragon Ball Z episodes}}
Instead of continuing the anime as ''Dragon Ball'', Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. {{Nihongo|''Dragon Ball Z''|ドラゴンボールZ(ゼット)|Doragon Bōru Zetto|commonly abbreviated as ''DBZ''}} picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"/&gt; Two television specials based on the ''Z'' series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, ''The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Freeza -- Son Goku's Father~'', renamed ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku|Bardock – The Father of Goku]]'' by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, ''Defiance in the Face of Despair!! The Remaining Super-Warriors: Gohan and Trunks'', renamed ''[[Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks|The History of Trunks]]'' by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on February 24, 1993.

{{Main|List of Dragon Ball Z Kai episodes}}
In February 2009, ''Dragon Ball Z'' celebrated its 20th anniversary, with Toei Animation announcing that it would broadcast a re-edited and remastered version under the name {{Nihongo|''Dragon Ball Kai''|ドラゴンボール改|Doragon Bōru Kai|lit. "Dragon Ball Revised"}}. The footage would be re-edited to follow the manga more closely, eliminating scenes and episodes which were not featured in the original manga, resulting in a more faithful adaptation, as well as in a faster-moving, and more focused story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= ｢ドラゴンボールZ｣放送開始20周年記念!

In addition to this, Toriyama also oversaw production of the series, just as he had for the ''Dragon Ball'' and ''Dragon Ball Z'' anime. The television special episode, ''Goku's Side Story! The Proof of his Courage is the Four-Star Ball'', or ''[[Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy|A Hero's Legacy]]'' as Funimation titled it for their dub, aired on March 26, 1997, between episodes 41 and 42, serving as a kind of precursor to the epilogue to the series shown at the end of episode 64.

{{See also|List of Dragon Ball films}}
Nineteen animated theatrical films based on the ''Dragon Ball'' series have been released in Japan. The two most recent films, ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'' (2013) and ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F']]'' (2015), were produced as full-length feature films and were given stand-alone theatrical releases in Japan (as well as limited theatrical releases in the U.S.); these two have a greater sense of continuity with the series than the older films, especially since their storylines were directly adapted into the first-two story arcs of the ''Dragon Ball Super'' anime. They're also the first movies to have original creator Akira Toriyama deeply involved in their production.&lt;ref name="BattleGods"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-07-10/toei-toriyama-work-on-march-2013-dragon-ball-z-film |title = Akira Toriyama, Toei Make Dragon Ball Z Film Next March |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |accessdate = March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Key Visual For 2015 Dragon Ball Z Film Reveals Frieza|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-11-17/1st-key-visual-for-2015-dragon-ball-z-film-reveals-frieza/.81112|website=ANN|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 feature film, ''[[Dragon Ball: The Path to Power]]'', with a running time of 80 minutes was produced to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the anime and is a re-imagining of the first arc of the series.

All films preceding these three were usually below [[feature length]] (around 45–60 minutes each), making them only slightly longer than an episode of the TV series, this is due to them being originally shown as back-to-back presentations alongside other Toei film productions. These films are also mostly alternate re-tellings of certain story arcs (like ''The Path to Power'') or extra side-stories that do not correlate with the continuity of the series. The first three films, along with ''The Path to Power'', are based on the original ''Dragon Ball'' anime series. The remaining fifteen films are based on ''Dragon Ball Z''. The first five films were shown at the {{nihongo4|Toei Manga Festival|[[:ja:東映まんがまつり|東映まんがまつり]]|Tōei Manga Matsuri}}, while the sixth through seventeenth films were shown at the {{nihongo4|Toei Anime Fair|[[:ja:東映アニメフェア|東映アニメフェア]]|Toei Anime Fea}}.

=== Companion books ===
[[File:Db TCI.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations'']]
There have been numerous companion books to the ''Dragon Ball'' franchise. Chief among these are the {{nihongo|''Daizenshuu''|大全集}} series, comprising seven hardback main volumes and three supplemental softcover volumes, covering the manga and the first two anime series and their theatrical films. The first of these, ''Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations'' (''Daizenshuu'' volume 1), first published in Japan in 1995, is the only one that was released in English, being printed in 2008 by Viz Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viz.com/books/print/dragon-ball-the-complete-illustrations-volume-1/7952 |title=Dragon Ball: The Complete Illustrations |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115314/http://www.viz.com/books/print/dragon-ball-the-complete-illustrations-volume-1/7952 |archivedate=December 24, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains all 264 colored illustrations Akira Toriyama drew for the ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' magazines' covers, bonus giveaways and specials, and all the covers for the 42 ''tankōbon''. It also includes an interview with Toriyama on his work process. The remainder have never been released in English, and all are now out of print in Japan. From February 4 to May 9, 2013, condensed versions of the ''Daizenshuu'' with some updated information were released as the four-volume {{nihongo|''Chōzenshū''|超全集}} series.&lt;ref name="colorchozenshuu"/&gt; For ''Dragon Ball GT'', the ''Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files'' were released in May and December 1997 by [[Shueisha]]'s ''Jump Comics Selection'' imprint.

''Dragon Ball Landmark'' and ''Dragon Ball Forever'' cover the manga, using volume numbers for story points that reference the ''kanzenban'' release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-873702-4&amp;mode=1 | title=Dragonball　FOREVER| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-873478-5&amp;mode=1 | title=Dragonball　LANDMARK| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball: Tenkaichi Densetsu''|ドラゴンボール 天下一伝説}} and {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku Densetsu''|ドラゴンボールZ 孫悟空伝説}} cover the ''Dragon Ball'' and ''Dragon Ball Z'' anime, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-873705-9 | title=テレビアニメ完全カイド「DRAGONBALL」～天下一伝説～ (Dragon Ball: Tenkaichi Densetsu)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-873546-3 | title=テレビアニメ完全ガイド Dragonball　Z 孫悟空伝説 (Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku Densetsu)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the material in these books is reused from the earlier ''Daizenshuu'' volumes, but they include new textual material including substantial interviews with the creator, cast and production staff of the series. ''Son Goku Densetsu'' in particular showcases previously-unpublished design sketches of Goku's father Bardock, drawn by character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru prior to creator Akira Toriyama's revisions that resulted in the final version.

Following the release of ''Dragon Ball Kai'' in Japan, four new guidebooks were released: the two-volume {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide''|ドラゴンボール 超エキサイティングガイド}} in 2009, covering the manga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-874803-0 | title=DRAGON　BALL　超エキサイティングガイド ストーリー編 (Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide Story)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-874804-7 | title=DRAGON　BALL　超エキサイティングガイド キャラクター編 (Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide Character)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two-volume {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball: Extreme Battle Collection''|ドラゴンボール　極限バトルコレクション}} in 2010, covering the anime series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-874840-5&amp;mode=1 | title=DRAGON　BALL　極限バトルコレクション　ラウンド01 (Dragon Ball: Extreme Battle Collection: Round 1)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-874841-2&amp;mode=1 | title=DRAGON　BALL　極限バトルコレクション　ラウンド02 (Dragon Ball: Extreme Battle Collection: Round 2)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the TV series airing during this time being ''Kai'', the ''Extreme Battle Collection'' books reference the earlier ''Z'' series in content and episode numbers. These books also include new question-and-answer sessions with Akira Toriyama, revealing a few new details about the world and characters of the series. 2010 also saw the release of a new artbook, {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball: Anime Illustrations Guide - The Golden Warrior''|ドラゴンボール アニメイラスト集 「黄金の戦士」}}; a sort of anime-counterpart to the manga-oriented ''Complete Illustrations'', it showcases anime-original illustrations and includes interviews with the three principal character designers for the anime. Each of the Japanese "Dragon Box" DVD releases of the series and movies, which were released from 2003 to 2006, as well as the Blu-ray boxed sets of ''Dragon Ball Kai'', released 2009 to 2011, come with a ''Dragon Book'' guide that contains details about the content therein. Each also contains a new interview with a member of the cast or staff of the series. These books have been reproduced textually for Funimation's release of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' Dragon Box sets from 2009 to 2011.

Manga critic [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] stated in 2011 that "''Dragon Ball'' is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every ''Shonen Jump'' artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways."&lt;ref name="ANNJT"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Jason|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2011-03-10|title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - Dragon Ball|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 10, 2011|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says the series "turns from a gag/adventure manga to an nearly-pure fighting manga",&lt;ref name="ANNJT"/&gt; and its basic formula of "lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, a few jokes" became the model for other [[Shōnen manga|shōnen]] series, such as ''Naruto''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Dragon Ball?|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5201656/what-is-dragon-ball|author=Thompson, Jason|authorlink=Jason Thompson (writer)|publisher=Io9|accessdate=December 9, 2009|date=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson also called Toriyama's art influential and cited it as a reason for the series' popularity.&lt;ref name="ANNJT"/&gt; James S.

"Also in evidence is the influence of ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', especially in the early chapters, which play out much like ''[[Journey to the West|Saiyuki]]'' with ''Dr. Slump''-like humour built in."&lt;/ref&gt; He feels the series "established its unique identity" after the first occasion when Goku's group disbands and he trains under Kame-sen'nin, when the story develops "a far more action-packed, sinister tone" with "wilder" battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count, while humor still makes an occasional appearance.&lt;ref name=Yadao116/&gt; Yadao claims that an art shift occurs when the characters "lose the rounded, innocent look that he established in ''Dr. Slump'' and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity."&lt;ref name=Yadao116117&gt;Yadao, James S.

''[[Animerica]]'' felt the series had "worldwide appeal", using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to "maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans".&lt;ref name="Animerica"&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 2001 |title=Anime Radar: News |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume=9 |issue=2 |page=36 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |location=San Francisco, California |issn=1067-0831 |oclc=27130932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Little Boy: The Art of Japan's Exploding Subculture'', Takashi Murakami commented that ''Dragon Ball''{{'s}} "never-ending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly, seamlessly, and with great finesse."&lt;ref name="LittleBoy"/&gt; Ridwan Khan from Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a "chubby" art style, but as the series continued the characters got more refined, leaner, and more muscular.

Aviva Rothschild of Rationalmagic.com remarked the first manga volume as "a superior humor title".

The content of the manga has been controversial in the United States. In November 1999, [[Toys "R" Us]] removed Viz's ''Dragon Ball'' from their stores nationwide when a [[Dallas]] parent complained the series had "borderline soft porn" after he bought them for his four-year-old son.&lt;ref name="Maryland"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maryland School Library to Remove Dragon Ball Manga|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-10-07/maryland-school-library-to-remove-dragon-ball-manga |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=October 7, 2009 |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the issue, [[Susan J.

The anime adaptations have also been very well-received and are better known in the Western world than the manga, with Anime News Network saying, "Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way ''Dragon Ball Z'' has. To a certain generation of television consumers its characters are as well known as any in the animated realm, and for many it was the first step into the wilderness of anime fandom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-z/dvd-dragon-box-z-set-2|title= Dragon Box Z Set 2|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 8, 2010|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, satellite TV channel [[Animax]] together with ''[[Brutus (magazine)|Brutus]]'', a men's lifestyle magazine, and [[Culture Convenience Club|Tsutaya]], Japan's largest video rental chain, conducted a poll among 200,000 fans on the top anime series, with ''Dragon Ball'' coming in fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2000-09-11/gundam-tops-anime-poll |title= Gundam Tops Anime Poll |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=September 12, 2000|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV Asahi]] conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime, ''Dragon Ball'' came in second in the nationwide survey conducted with multiple age-groups and in third in the online poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-09-23/tv-asahi-top-100-anime-part-2 |title= Part 2 - TV Asahi Top 100 Anime |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=September 23, 2005|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-09-23/tv-asahi-top-100-anime |title= TV Asahi Top 100 Anime |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=September 23, 2005|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On several occasions, the ''Dragon Ball'' anime has topped Japan's [[DVD]] sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-20/japanese-animation-dvd-ranking-september-10-16|title= Japanese Animation DVD Ranking, September 10–16 |publisher= [[Anime News Network]] |date= September 20, 2008 |accessdate= October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-08-14/japanese-animation-dvd-ranking-august-6-12|title= Japanese Animation DVD Ranking, August 6–12 |publisher= [[Anime News Network]] |date= August 14, 2008 |accessdate= October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the anime series has also sold over 25{{nbsp}}million DVD units by January 2012,&lt;ref name="Funimation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecnl.com/FunimationJan2012Catalog.pdf|title=Funimation January 2012 Catalog|website=thecnl.com|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 30{{nbsp}}million DVD and [[Blu-ray]] units as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Dragon Ball's' voice of Goku speaks for himself |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630183914/www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-conversation-dragon-ball-goku-20170630-story.html |accessdate=June 30, 2017 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anime films also drew a box office audience of 49{{nbsp}}million viewers by 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=世界中で大ヒットを記録しつづける超人気アニメーション「ドラゴンボールＺ」のTVシリーズがついにDVD-BOXで登場！|url=http://corp.toei-anim.co.jp/press/detail.php?id=18 |work=[[Toei Animation]] |publisher=[[Toei Company]] |date=November 6, 2002 |language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summed up ''Dragon Ball'' as "an action-packed tale told with rare humor and something even rarer—a genuine sense of adventure."&lt;ref name="DBseason2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball/dvd-season-2|last=Kimlinger|first=Carl|title= Dragon Ball DVD Season 2 Uncut Set|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kimlinger and colleague Theron Martin noted Funimation's reputation for drastic alterations of the script, but praised the dub.&lt;ref name="DBseason2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DBseason3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball/dvd-season-3|last=Martin|first=Theron|title= Dragon Ball DVD Season 3|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some critics and most fans of the Japanese version have been more critical with Funimation's English dub and script of ''Dragon Ball Z'' over the years. Jeffrey Harris [[IGN]] criticized the voices including how Freeza's appearance combined with the feminine English voice left fans confused about Freeza's gender.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/12/dragon-ball-gt-the-lost-episodes-dvd-box-set-review|title= Dragon Ball GT&amp;nbsp;— The Lost Episodes DVD Box Set Review|publisher= IGN|date=November 12, 2007|author= Harris, Jeffrey |accessdate= October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Ross of T.H.E.M.

''Dragon Ball Z'' is well-known, and often criticized, for its long, repetitive, dragged-out fights that span several episodes, with Martin commenting "DBZ practically turned drawing out fights into an art form."&lt;ref name="DBZSeason6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-z/dvd-season-6|last=Martin|first=Theron|title= Dragon Ball Z DVD Season 6|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jason Thompson of io9 explained that this comes from the fact that the anime was being created alongside the manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isn't Dragon Ball just a bunch of speedlines and ripped dudes with bad hair screaming "It's over 9,000!"|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5201669/isnt-dragon-ball-just-a-bunch-of-speedlines-and-ripped-dudes-with-bad-hair-screaming-its-over-9000|author=Thompson, Jason|authorlink=Jason Thompson (writer)|publisher=Io9|date=April 8, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dragon Ball Z'' was listed as the 78th best animated show in [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Animated Series,&lt;ref name="ign100"&gt;{{cite web |title=78.

Harris commented that ''Dragon Ball GT'' "is downright repellent", mentioning that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun. He also criticized the ''GT'' character designs of [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] and [[Vegeta]] as being goofy.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network also gave negative comments about ''GT'', mentioning that the fights from the series were "a very simple childish exercise" and that many other anime were superior. The plot of ''Dragon Ball GT'' has also been criticized for giving a formula that was already used in its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-gt/dvd-8|title=Dragon Ball GT DVD 8: Salvation|publisher= [[Anime News Network]]|date=June 6, 2004|author= Bertschy, Zac |accessdate= October 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past several decades, researchers have spent continuous efforts on exploring how '''sexual content in the media''' influence individuals' perceptions of sex, marriage, and rape.  Among these sexual content in the media, pornography has been a big business, generating $13 billion just in the U.S. in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itfacts.biz/?id=p7960|website=IT Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have reached agreement on some effects of sexual content in the media, such as arousal and some attitudinal effects. However, there is still an argument on whether the Catharsis effects resulting from the sexual media content.

==Types of Sexual Content==

Scholars analyzed the violent sexual content based on different types of sexual content, which sexual content portray rape, bondage, torture, sadomasochism, hitting, spanking, hair pulling, and genital mutilation, and nonviolent sexual material. Nonviolent sexual material is much harder to categorize. Some nonviolent sexual material is entirely mutually consenting and affectionate, depicting vagina or oral intercourse in a loving, or at least non-coercive, fashion. On the other hand, some nonviolent sexual material is sexually dehumanizing, depicting degradation, domination, subordination or [[humiliation]]. Nonviolent sexual material presents the woman with few human attributes besides body parts and sexual appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=edited by Jennings|last2=Oliver|first2=Mary Beth|title=Media effects : advances in theory and research|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-8058-6449-0|page=205|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of Sexual Content in the Media==

===[[Arousal]]===

One crucial effect of consuming sexual media is sexual arousal, "the heightened physiological state that energizes sexual behavior. Arousal can be measured in two methods. One method is self-ratings of participants and the other is that physiological measures such as electronic sensors measuring penile tumescence, vaginal lubrication, or temperature (thermography).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=edited by Jennings|last2=Oliver|first2=Mary Beth|title=Media effects : advances in theory and research|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-8058-6449-0|page=307|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers found that men are more aroused by sexual media than are women, especially in response to sexually violent or dehumanizing materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mallamuth|first1=Nell|title=Sexually explicit media, gender differences, and evolutionary theory|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Neil_Malamuth/publication/227585245_Sexually_Explicit_Media_Gender_Differences_and_Evolutionary_Theory/links/00b7d5217c318d0d1d000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, sexual violence may only appeal to sex offenders and other violence-prone men and even to "normal" men if the victim is portrayed as being aroused by the assault. Slides or verbal descriptions of coercive sex are more appealing to sexually coercive men physiologically than "normal" men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lohr|first1=Bethany A.|last2=Adams|first2=Henry E.|last3=Davis|first3=J. Mark|title=Sexual arousal to erotic and aggressive stimuli in sexually coercive and noncoercive men.|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1997|volume=106|issue=2|pages=230–242|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.106.2.230|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=1997-03909-007&amp;S=L&amp;D=pdh&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLe80SeprA4y9fwOLCmr0%2BeqK9Sr6i4SraWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGqs1Gyr7NJuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the Internet provides unlimited number of websites that feature any sexual desire that the user wants, it results in sexual arousal because the stimuli are new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carnes|first1=Patrick J.|title=Cybersex, Courtship, and Escalating Arousal: Factors in Addictive Sexual Desire|journal=Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity|date=13 October 2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=45–78|doi=10.1080/10720160127560|url=https://www.iitap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ARTICLECybersex-Courtship-Escalating-Arousal_PCarnes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnes think that the Internet can allow people to see any of their fantasy, which usually do not exist in most people's daily lives. These images can be reactivated during the sexual intercourse.

=== Attitudinal Effects ===

One of the major criticism from scholars is that the dehumanization of women in sexual explicit materials. Men rated their own partners as being less physically endowed after seeing beautiful female nudes engaged in sexual activity. It seems that the voluptuous model has become the norm or anchor to which real people are compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utility, Probability, and Human Decision Making Selected Proceedings of an Interdisciplinary Research Conference, Rome, 3-6 September, 1973.|date=2013|publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=9789401018364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zillmann and Bryant also found that such effects are not limited to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ZILLMANN|first1=DOLF|last2=BRYANT|first2=JENNINGS|title=Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography on Family Values|journal=Journal of Family Issues|date=December 1988|volume=9|issue=4|pages=518–544|doi=10.1177/019251388009004006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zillmann|first1=Dolf|last2=Bryant|first2=Jennings|title=Pornography's Impact on Sexual Satisfaction1|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=April 1988|volume=18|issue=5|pages=438–453|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1988.tb00027.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with control groups, both men and women who watched weekly pornographic films later reported that they are less satisfied with their partners' affection, appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performances. They also sex with less emotional involvement and showed greater acceptance of premarital and extramarital sex. They placed less values on monogamy and marriage. Teenagers who have watched a whole day of talk shows discussing about sexual topics later overestimated the frequency of such behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg|last2=Smith|title=Daytime talk shows: Up close and in your face. Sexual teens, sexual media|pages=79–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individual Differences ===

Different people have different reactions to sexual content in the media. Men are more likely to be aroused by the sexual content than women. Gettleman argued that men are main consumers of sex videos, with an estimated 71 of sex videos consumed by men by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gettleman|title=XXX=$$$|journal=Manhattan Mercury|date=1999|page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not mean that men are more interested in sex videos than women. Women have been found to be more interested in written and directed by women and for women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senn|first1=Charlene Y.|last2=Desmarais|first2=Serge|title=Impact of Interaction With a Partner or Friend on the Exposure Effects of Pornography and Erotica|journal=Violence and Victims|date=1 December 2004|volume=19|issue=6|pages=645–658|doi=10.1891/vivi.19.6.645.66347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quackenbush|first1=Debra M.|last2=Strassberg|first2=Donald S.|last3=Turner|first3=Charles W.|title=Gender effects of romantic themes in erotica|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=February 1995|volume=24|issue=1|pages=21–35|doi=10.1007/BF01541986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosher|first1=Donald L.|last2=MacIan|first2=Paula|title=College men and women respond to X‐rated videos intended for male or female audiences: Gender and sexual scripts|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=January 1994|volume=31|issue=2|pages=99–113|doi=10.1080/00224499409551736}}&lt;/ref&gt; while men appear to be more interested in seek out sexual media and be aroused by it.  Malamuth and Check found that men, not women, were as aroused by a rape scene as by a consenting sex scene but only if the victim was portrayed as enjoying the rape and coming to orgasm. The men were not aroused if the victim was shown to be terrorized.

Personality can also be an indicator of individuals' different reactions to sexual content. Bushman, Bonacci, van Dijk, and Baumeister found that narcissistic men will be more likely to enjoy the rape scene preceded by affection between the parties than low narcissists did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushman|first1=Brad J.|last2=Bonacci|first2=Angelica M.|last3=van Dijk|first3=Mirjam|last4=Baumeister|first4=Roy F.|title=Narcissism, sexual refusal, and aggression: Testing a narcissistic reactance model of sexual coercion.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2003|volume=84|issue=5|pages=1027–1040|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.5.1027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borgaert's study considered intelligence is a mediator between personality and arousal attitudes. Men, who have lower intelligence and higher aggressive/antisocial inclinations, are more likely to prefer violent sexual stimuli than men higher in intelligence and lower in aggressive/antisocial tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogaert|first1=Anthony F.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=2001|volume=30|issue=1|pages=29–53|doi=10.1023/A:1026416723291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Effects ===

Bryant and Zillmann concluded that potential behavioral effects of violent sexual media content include: catharsis, disinhibition, imitation, and desensitization.

==== [[Catharsis]] ====

Catharsis holds that "vicariously participating in others' fictionalized hostility or aggression enables drama watchers, readers, or listeners to be purged of their anger and hostility and there by become less aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=Jennings|last2=Zillmann|first2=Dolf|title=Violence and Sex in the Media|volume=An integrated approach to communication theory and research|pages=195–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;" This popular idea comes directly from [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic models of personality]]. The Catharsis effect has been applied to support loosening restrictions on pornography and it has also been reported by sex offenders as a strategy for reducing impulses for committing an offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langevin|first1=Ron|last2=Lang|first2=Reuben A.|last3=Wright|first3=Percy|last4=Handy|first4=Lorraine|last5=Frenzel|first5=Roy R.|last6=Black|first6=Edward L.|title=Pornography and sexual offences|journal=Annals of Sex Research|date=1988|volume=1|issue=3|pages=335–362|doi=10.1007/BF00878103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=CARTER|first1=DANIEL LEE|last2=PRENTKY|first2=ROBERT ALAN|last3=KNIGHT|first3=RAYMOND A.|last4=VANDERVEER|first4=PENNY L.|last5=BOUCHER|first5=RICHARD J.|title=Use of Pornography in the Criminal and Developmental Histories of Sexual Offenders|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=June 1987|volume=2|issue=2|pages=196–211|doi=10.1177/088626087002002005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, very few empirical studies support the [[catharsis]] effect.

==== [[Disinhibition]] ====
Disinhibition is that after being repetitive exposed to sexual materials may undermine learned social sanctions against using violence that usually inhibit aggressive behaviors. People may become more aggressive after watching, reading or listening to media violence because they may tend to legitimize using violence in real life. A dozen experimental investigations have explored the disinhibition effects and provided support for this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Leonard|title=Some determinants of impulsive aggression: Role of mediated associations with reinforcements for aggression.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1974|volume=81|issue=2|pages=165–176|doi=10.1037/h0036094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donnerstein|first1=Edward|title=Aggressive erotica and violence against women.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1980|volume=39|issue=2|pages=269–277|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.2.269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Imitation ====
Imitation is explained in terms of social learning theory, which argues that "humans have evolved an advanced capacity for observational learning that enables them to expand their knowledge and skills on the basis of information conveyed by modeling influences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|title=Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication|journal=Media Psychology|date=August 2001|volume=3|issue=3|pages=265–299|doi=10.1207/S1532785XMEP0303_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social learning explains how observers match the performances of models. Four things must happen before imitation: The first is attentional process, which people must have seen, read, listened to sexual materials. The second is retention process, which people can retain some memories of what they have seen, read and listened to. The third is production process, which the learner must have the capabilities to replicate the action. The fourth is motivational process, which people must have sufficient desire or will to perform what the violent behavior. Only when all of these four conditions were met, people imitate the performances of actors.

==== Desensitization ====
The desensitization effects have been touted by some researchers. The desensitization hypothesis argues that the repeated exposure to sexual violent materials can result in less emotional responsiveness to violence in fiction, news, and reality fare, which could in turn result in an increased acceptance of violent behaviors. However, this notion was touted a lot and limited research evidence available supports disinhibition effects.

== Mitigating the Negative Effects ==
Harris and Barlett concluded that a few studies have developed extensive pre-exposure training and/or post-exposure debriefing procedures to lessen the desensitizing effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LINZ|first1=DANIEL|last2=FUSON|first2=ILENE ARLUK|last3=DONNERSTEIN|first3=EDWARD|title=Mitigating the Negative Effects of Sexually Violent Mass Communications Through Preexposure Briefings|journal=Communication Research|date=October 1990|volume=17|issue=5|pages=641–674|doi=10.1177/009365090017005004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linz found that by offering pertinent educational information about rape myths reduced the effect of desensitization, which means experimental participation can also help reduce the rape myth acceptance. Wilson, Linz, Donnerstein, and Stipp conducted a field experiment, they found that men who are older than 50 had preexisting attitudes reinforced and actually blamed women for rape after seeing the film. In other words, preexisting attitudes and personal experience should be considered when conducting research studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WILSON|first1=BARBARA J.|last2=LINZ|first2=DANIEL|last3=DONNERSTEIN|first3=EDWARD|last4=STIPP|first4=HORST|title=The Impact of Social Issue Television Programming on Attitudes Toward Rape|journal=Human Communication Research|date=December 1992|volume=19|issue=2|pages=179–208|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1992.tb00299.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen, Emmers, Gebhardt, and Giery concluded that experimental studies show positive significant effect between pornography exposure and rape myth acceptance, whereas correlational field studies how a very small effect or nonexistent effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Mike|last2=D’Alessio|first2=David|last3=Emmers-Sommer|first3=Tara M.|title=Reactions of Criminal Sexual Offenders to Pornography: A Meta-Analytic Summary|journal=Annals of the International Communication Association|date=18 May 2016|volume=22|issue=1|pages=139–169|doi=10.1080/23808985.1999.11678961}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the relationship consistently stronger when the sexual materials was violent than it was nonviolent.

A '''false document''' is often promoted in conjunction with a criminal enterprise, such as [[fraud]] or a [[confidence game]]. 

However, a ''false document'' is also a technique employed to create [[verisimilitude]] in a work of fiction. By inventing and inserting documents that appear to be factual, an author tries to create a sense of authenticity beyond the normal and expected [[suspension of disbelief]] for a [[work of art]]. The goal of a false document is to convince an audience that what is being presented is factual.

==In business==
Forged documents in business are typically for financial gain.

=== Material certificates ===
A material's [[Mill Test Report|certification]], essentially a report of its composition and properties, may be forged.  A low-property material, produced for lower cost, may be passed as a higher-property material, which has a higher price.  The difference becomes illicit profit. Counterfeit fasteners have low-strength alloys or inferior production processes, but are sold as high-strength fasteners.

=== Safety certificates ===
Similarly, parts, systems, and processes for high-valued operations may have their [[Quality Assurance|quality-assurance documents]] forged.  Substandard items may be cheaper or simply more readily available. Nuclear power plants in Japan and Korea have found components with forged safety documents.
''See also'': [[Information Assurance]]

=== Degree certificates ===
Academic degrees often qualify for recruitment, promotions and additional pay. There are many methods to get false degree certificates. First, university officials have been bribed to issue a certificate without study. Second, false universities called [[diploma mill]]s issue certificates that have no legal standing and are usually purchased outright without study, but they may still be legal. Finally, degree certificates have been directly [[Forgery|forged]], which is a felony in most jurisdictions. Besides the degree certificate itself, final theses and essays have been falsified by e.g. plagiarism, ghost writing or inclusion of fake references. Thus, the degree certificate itself is genuine but it may be revoked.

==In politics==
A forged document, the [[Zinoviev Letter]], helped bring the downfall of the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]] in Britain. Conspiracies within secret intelligence services have occurred more recently, leading [[Harold Wilson]]  to put in place rules to prevent in the 1960s [[phone tapping]] of [[members of Parliament]], for example.

''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', purporting to describe a [[Jew]]ish plan for global domination, was first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century.

== In art ==
Artist [[J. S. G. Boggs|JSG Boggs]]'s life and work have been extensively explored by author and journalist [[Lawrence Weschler]]. Boggs draws currency with exceptional care and accuracy, but he only ever draws one side. He then attempts to buy things with the piece of paper upon which he has drawn the currency. His goal is to pass each bill for its face value in common transactions. He buys lunch, clothes, and lodging in this manner, and after the transactions are complete, his bills fetch many times their face value on the art market. Boggs does not make any money from the much larger art market value of his work, only from reselling the goods bought, the change and receipts and other such materials. He has been arrested in many countries, and there is much controversy surrounding his work.

[[Orson Welles]]' ''[[F for Fake]]'' is a prime example of a film which is both about falsification ([[art forgery]] and the journalism surrounding art forgery) as well as having falsified moments within the film. The movie follows the exploits of a famous art forger, his biographer [[Clifford Irving]], and the subsequent fake [[autobiography]] of [[Howard Hughes]] that Irving tries to publish. The issues of veracity and forgery are explored in the film, while at the same time, Welles tricks the audience by incorporating fake bits of narrative alongside the documentary footage.

==In cross-marketing==
There is a long history of producers creating tie-in material to promote and merchandise movies and television shows. Tie-in materials as far-ranging as toys, games, lunch boxes, clothing and so on have all been created and in some cases generate as much or more revenue as the original programming. One big merchandising arena is publishing. In most cases such material is not considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]] within the show's mythology; however, in some instances the books, magazines, etc. are specifically designed by the creators to be canonical. With the rise of the Internet, in-canon online material has become more prominent.

The following is a list of "false document" in-canon supplemental material:
* ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' spawned three [[Books of Twin Peaks|canon books]]:
**''[[The Autobiography of F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes]]'' {{ISBN|0-671-74400-3}}
**''[[The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer]]'' {{ISBN|0-671-73590-X}}
**''[[Twin Peaks: An Access Guide to the Town]]'' {{ISBN|0-671-74399-6}}
Additionally, a set of [[trading cards]] was produced which are also canon.
* ''[[Gary Troup (Lost)|Bad Twin]]'' {{ISBN|1-4013-0276-9}} is a canon tie-in novel for the TV series ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]''

== Hoaxes ==
{{Main|Hoax}}
A number of [[hoax]]es have involved false documents:
* [[Salamander Letter]]
* ''[[The Report From Iron Mountain]]''
* The [[Oera Linda]] book
* The [[Hitler Diaries]]
* The ''[[Dossiers Secrets|Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5166">The '''Family Entertainment and Copyright Act''', Pub. L. 109-9, 119 Stat. 218 (April 27, 2005), is a [[Government of the United States|federal]] [[Act of Congress|legislative act]] regarding [[United States copyright law|copyright]] that became law in the United States in 2005&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/167/text&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Act consists of two subparts: the Artist's Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005, which increases penalties for [[copyright infringement]], and the Family Home Movie Act of 2005, which permits the development of technology to "sanitize" potentially offensive DVD and VOD content.  

The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] (of the [[109th United States Congress]]) on January 25, 2005 by Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]] - [[Utah]]), and was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on April 27, 2005.

The act provides theater owners and employees with both civil and criminal immunity for questioning suspected violators or detaining them while police are summoned.

== Artist's Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005 ==
This act, also known as the "ART Act", is targeted at preventing copyright infringement of movies and software. It specifically targets two activities: filming movies in a movie theater, and early release of movies and software before they become publicly available.

It permits preregistration of certain types of unpublished works if it determines that such works have a history of infringement prior to commercial distribution. The purpose of preregistration is related to potential litigation protection in view of the fact that it allows an infringement action to be brought before the authorized commercial distribution of a work and the work’s full-fledged registration. Preregistration makes possible—only upon full registration—for the copyright owner to receive statutory damages and attorneys’ fees in an infringement action.  Works determined eligible for copyright preregistration are: motion pictures, sound recordings, musical compositions, literary works being prepared as books, computer programs (including videogames), and advertising or marketing photographs.&lt;ref&gt;http://aplegal.com/2014/12/10/copyright-preregistration/&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone who "knowingly uses or attempts to use an audiovisual recording device to transmit or make a copy of a ... protected work... from a performance of such work in a motion picture exhibition facility..." may be imprisoned up to three years for a first time offender, and up to six years for a repeat offender, in addition to any fines that may be levied under the U.S. Criminal Code for copyright infringement. This could apply to merely taking a cell phone snapshot of a theatre screen.

With regard to unreleased works intended for public distribution (e.g., [[beta version|beta software]] or [[workprint]]s), anyone who makes available a work that the copyright owner expects to distribute commercially, but is not yet distributed, shall be punished if the work is "made available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution." First time offenders can get up to three years in jail, or five if they committed the offense for financial gain. Repeat offenders can get ten years if the offense was committed for financial gain. These penalties are in addition to any penalties for violating [[non-disclosure agreement]]s or [[trade secret]] law.

== Family Home Movie Act of 2005 ==

This section is an exemption of liability allowing the creation of technology that can edit a DVD or transmitted movie on the fly (during playback) and thus present a censored version of that movie.  This provision arose out of a lawsuit between ''[[ClearPlay]]'', a [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]]-based company that markets DVD-sanitizing technology, and a number of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] studios and directors. The ClearPlay technology allows a home consumer to screen out up to 14 different categories of objectionable content, such as drug use, sexual situations, or foul language.  The act is codified in [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/110- 17 U.S.C. 110(11)]

'''''FightBox''''' is a [[game show]] that aired on [[BBC Three]] from 13 October to 10 November 2003 and is hosted by [[Lisa Snowdon]] and [[Trevor Nelson]] with [[Paul Dickenson]] as commentator.

==Format==
Contestants design their fighters and submit them to the BBC. Out of hundreds of submissions, only sixty were chosen to appear on the programme.

As well as battling each other, the fighters would face one of six "Sentients", warriors who had won previous (unseen) tournaments and achieved this honour. The Sentients were: Banshee, Big George, Kodiak, Nail, Pearl and Vesuvius. Although [[immortality|immortal]], they did have certain weaknesses which a fighter could use against them. After winning the first series, competitor warrior Kill Frenzy, created by Usman Arshad, achieved sentience and joined the current six. These seven Sentients featured in the video game mentioned below.

Six Games were played during the show these were: Conquest, Demolition, Duel, Helix, Panic and Revolution. Another game was Showdown, a straight one on one battle to determine the winner of each tournament.

Even though the show only lasted one season, a video game for the [[PlayStation 2]], PC and [[Game Boy Advance]] was made, developed by the BBC's internal development division [[BBC Multimedia|Gamezlab]].

Those who play video games regularly are split roughly equally between male and female, but men are more likely to call themselves a 'Gamer.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/|title=Gaming and Gamers|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|date=2015-12-15|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.&lt;ref name="Theesa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Facts and Figures"/&gt;
According to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duggan |first1=Maeve |title=Who plays video games and identifies as a “gamer” |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/who-plays-video-games-and-identifies-as-a-gamer/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=17 September 2018 |date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term "girl gamer" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[reappropriation|reappropriated term]], while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/10699-In-Defense-of-the-Casual-Gamer | title=In Defense of the Casual Gamer | publisher=Escapist magazine | date=30 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2014 | author=Heather Barefoot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotypes==
Although men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a [[stereotype]] that women are not considered ¨True Gamers¨ because they tend to play more [[Casual game|casual games]] which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-016-0678-y|title=SpringerLink|last=|first=|date=|website=db16.linccweb.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.

*''Newbie'': ''[[Newbie]]'', (commonly shortened to "noob", "n00b", or "newb") is a slang term for a [[wikt:novice|novice]] or [[wikt:newcomer|newcomer]] to a certain game, or to gaming in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masonry/Misc/welaish.html |title=Masonry on the Internet |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/words-online-gaming-opinions-books-newbs.html|title=Gamer Speak for Newbs|work=Forbes|author=Anna Vander Broek|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Casual gamer'': The term ''casual gamer'' is often used for gamers who primarily play [[casual games]], but can also refer to gamers who play less frequently than other gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/30/core-and-casual-whats-the-difference/|title=Core and Casual: What’s the difference?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casual gamers may play games designed for ease of gameplay, or play more involved games in short sessions, or at a slower pace than hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"/&gt; The types of game that casual gamers play vary, and they are less likely to own a dedicated video game console.&lt;ref&gt;Magrino, Tom, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6178563.html?tag=result;title;1 GameStop: Casual gamers spurring hardcore holiday sales]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072417/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6178563.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B1 |date=July 11, 2011 }}, GameSpot, Sep 11, 2007, Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyes, Emma, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result;title;0 GDC '08: Are casual games the future?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711000000/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |date=July 11, 2011 }}, ''GameSpot'', Feb 18, 2008, Accessed May 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of casual games include ''[[The Sims]]'' and ''[[Nintendogs]]''.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Casual gamer demographics vary greatly from those of other video gamers, as the typical casual gamer is older and more predominantly female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_6695921|title=Women driving 'casual game' boom|first=Troy|last=Wolverton|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=2007-08-23|accessdate=2007-10-13

[...] The keyword for our presentation at this year's E3 is "Deeper and Wider". With Wii U, I would like to offer this proposal with that concept.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of theories have been presented regarding the rise in popularity of mid-core games.  James Hursthouse, the founder of Roadhouse Interactive, credits the evolution of devices towards tablets and touch-screen interfaces, whereas [[Jon Radoff]] of [[Disruptor Beam]] compares the emergence of mid-core games to similar increases in media sophistication that have occurred in media such as [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/9/4604088/the-rise-of-midcore-gaming|title=Core gamers, mobile games and the origins of the midcore audience|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have attempted to draw the distinction based primarily on which platforms a gamer prefers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcauthority.com.au/Feature/260885,the-problems-of-defining-a-hardcore-gamer.aspx|title=The problems of defining a hardcore gamer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to decry the entire concept of delineating casual from hardcore as divisive and vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/10/22/call-of-duty-demonstrates-the-completely-fictitious-line-between-hardcore-and-casual-gaming/|title='Call of Duty' Demonstrates The Completely Fictitious Line Between Hardcore And Casual Gaming|first=Paul|last=Tassi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional]] gamers generally play video games for [[prize]] [[money]] or [[salaries]].

===Retrogamer===
{{Main|Retrogaming}}
A retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, [[retro games]]—older video games and [[arcade game]]s. They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification in taxonomies===

A number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:
* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.
* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[Glitch|glitches]], and expose all game mechanics.
* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.
* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.
* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it.
The [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avatar==
{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}
{{See also|Player character}}
An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Similarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.

==Clans and guilds==
A [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).

==Identity==
{{See also|Gamergate controversy}}
The identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the "true gamer" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to "[[cinemaphile]]".&lt;ref name="escapistPublisherNote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;
People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play "enough" to qualify.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term "gamer", even though they may play regularly.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newmediaDoYou"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

In August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named [[Gamergate controversy]]. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a [[culture war]] over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The [[Gamergate controversy]] concerns issues of [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism]] and [[progressivism]] in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] #GamerGate.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of [[feminism]] on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Demographics===
[[File:Hillary Rodham Clinton playing a Nintendo Game Boy video game on the flight from Austin en route to Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hillary Clinton]] playing a [[Nintendo Game Boy]] video game on a flight]]
Games are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been increasing over time.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-10-30-platform-not-gender-drives-gamer-differences-eedar|last=Nofziger|first=Heather|title=Platform, not gender, drives gamer differences
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/public-debates-about-gaming-and-gamers/|title=2. Public debates about gaming and gamers|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|date=2015-12-15|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt; Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by [[Nintendo marketing#Demographic shifts|Nintendo's efforts to reach new demographics]].&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Market penetration of [[smartphones]] with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience,&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt;

While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=Why ALL gamers matter — my view as a female games analyst|date=28 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun ‘Gamer’ Label}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of [[hispanics]] identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of [[African-Americans]] and 7% of [[whites]].&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt; The competitive [[fighting game]] scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant.&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/2/6/5361004/fighting-game-diversity|last=Bowman|first=Rich|work=Polygon|title=Why the Fighting Game Community is Color Blind}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]].&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"/&gt; Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt;

===Casualization===
Casualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarrazin|first=Vincent|date=October 7, 2011|url=http://www.inaglobal.fr/en/video-games/article/casualisation-video-games|title=The Casualisation of Video Games|work=ina global|publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]]|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of [[gameplay]] in established genres and franchises.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"/&gt; Compared to seminal titles like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]]'', more recent mass-market action games like the [[Call of Duty]] series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of [[interactive movie]]s.&lt;ref name="eurogamerDoom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-06-22-years-on-doom-retains-the-ability-to-shock|last=Stewart|first=Keith|work=The Guardian|title=22 years on, Doom retains the ability to shock}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in [[retro games]] but missing from new releases.&lt;ref name="gamasutraAmnesiac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20141009/227370/Amnesiac_Heroes_Why_are_we_abandoning_gaming_history.php|last=Pepe|first=Felipe|work=Gamasutra|title=Amnesiac Heroes: Why are we abandoning gaming history?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/1201/articles/kirkpatrick|title=Constitutive tensions of gaming's field: UK gaming magazines and the formation of gaming culture|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Graeme|work=Gamestudies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Brendan Keogh]], these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; Belying these trends, games including ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Minecraft]]'' have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnathonSwift/20140110/208440/quotDumbing_downquot.php|last=Swift|first=Johnathon|work=Gamasutra|title=Dumbing down}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are "just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays ''[[Counter-Strike]]''"&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/17/more-women-play-video-games-than-boys-and-other-surprising-facts-lost-in-the-mess-of-gamergate/|last=Harwell|first=Drew|work=The Washington Post|title=More women play video games than boys, and other surprising facts lost in the mess of Gamergate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls.&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"/&gt; [[Leigh Alexander (journalist)|Leigh Alexander]] argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.&lt;ref name="edgeDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |last=Alexander |first=Leigh |work=Edge |title=Too many gamers think diversity means dumbing down – it’s time to forget that outmoded view |date=August 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713174818/http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |archivedate=July 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Girls Gone Wild ''' ('''GGW''') is an [[exhibitionism|exhibitionist]] entertainment franchise created by [[Joe Francis]] in 1997,&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/04/style/the-very-long-legs-of-girls-gone-wild.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Very Long Legs of 'Girls Gone Wild' |author=Mireya Navarro |date=4 April 2004 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who occasionally appears as the host of the videos.

The eponymous company "Girls Gone Wild" was known for its early use of [[direct-response marketing]] techniques, including its late-night [[infomercials]] that began airing in 1997.&lt;ref name="VT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117876991 |title= 'Wild' infomercial struts its stuff |author=Michael Schneider |date=8 December 2002 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The videos typically involve camera crews at [[party]] locations engaging young college-aged women who expose their bodies or act [[Female promiscuity|"wild"]], especially during [[Spring break]].&lt;ref name = "NYT"/&gt; Since 2008, the Girls Gone Wild products have been sold primarily through their website as streaming videos, downloads, and DVDs.

In February 2013, the company filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name=chap11&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Girls Gone Wild’ Files Bankruptcy to Fight Vegas Debt|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-28/-girls-gone-wild-files-bankruptcy-to-fight-vegas-debt.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The first Girls Gone Wild film was released in 1997.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/la-tm-gonewild32aug06,0,6367343.story |title= Joe Francis: 'Baby, give me a kiss' |author=Claire Hoffman |date=6 August 2006 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the company sold 4.5 million videos and DVDs.&lt;ref name = "VT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/features/2004/dispatches_from_girls_gone_wild/girls_get_naked_for_tshirts_and_trucker_hats.html |title=Dispatches from Girls Gone Wild |author=Ariel Levy |date=22 March 2004 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2002, the company had produced 83 different titles and had begun airing 30-minute infomercials on [[E!]] Entertainment Television, [[Fox Sports]] Net, [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], [[Comedy Central]], [[Tech TV]], [[Style (TV network)|Style]], and all other major U.S. networks.&lt;ref name = "VT"/&gt; The infomercials targeted a late-night channel-surfing demographic that Joe Francis had identified in the late 90s.&lt;ref name = "VT"/&gt; According to [[TNS Media Intelligence]], Girls Gone Wild spent more than $21 million in advertising in 2003, becoming the largest advertiser for programs on the [[E!]] channel. In 2008, Francis' net worth was approximately $150 million.&lt;ref name="VI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vegasinc.com/news/2012/sep/24/wynn-sets-precedent/ |title=Wynn sets the precedent|author=Bruce Spotleson|date=24 September 2012 |publisher= Vegas Inc|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instances of Girls Gone Wild in popular culture include the appearance of [[Eminem]] and [[Snoop Lion|Snoop Dogg]] in the company's videos,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VT"/&gt; [[MGM]]’s announcement in 2002 that it would release a feature-length film based on the Girls Gone Wild concept,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TG"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/oct/03/news1 |title= MGM plans Girls Gone Wild Film |date=2 October 2002 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various references and parodies of the show in popular television series and movies. In Season 4, Episode 8 of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" Wandering Bear, aired 29 Feb 2004, Larry and Jeff decide to buy a "Girls Gone Wild" video tape, and that lands them both in the hot seat with Larry's secretary and Jeff's wife after the dog leaves the house during the viewing of the tape.

===Content===
Most Girls Gone Wild videos follow a common formula in which a film crew interacts with a large crowd of people either at a [[party]], club, or other event.&lt;ref name = "SE"/&gt; Women willingly take off their clothes, engage in sexual activities, or participate in [[wet T-shirt contest]]s.&lt;ref name ="VT"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "SE"/&gt; Compensation for taking part in a Girls Gone Wild video often consists of a free hat, T-shirt, or money.&lt;ref name ="SE"/&gt; Occasionally, participants are invited to be filmed on a Girls Gone Wild tour bus.&lt;ref name ="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="VT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/GIRLS+GONE+WILD+IN+IRELAND%3B+US+sex+show+eyes+up+Irish+venues+for+tour.-a0258654156 |title=Girls Gone Wild in Ireland; US sex show eyes up Irish venues for tour |author=Keith Falkiner |date=12 June 2011 |publisher= Sunday Mirror (London)|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Girls Gone Wild for Katrina==
In September 2005, Girls Gone Wild announced that it would donate all proceeds of [[Mardi Gras]]–themed DVDs and videos to the [[Red Cross]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/20/news/katrina_girls_gone_wild/|title='Girls Gone Wild' for Katrina |date=20 September 2005 |publisher= CNN Money|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from the video sales, which included a title featuring [[Snoop Dogg]], were intended to help the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name = "CNN"/&gt;

These [[video tape]]s and [[DVD]]s featured much the same content as the ''Girls'' equivalent, only instead showing young men performing for the  camera—e.g., in the shower, playing football naked, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swaim |first=Michael |title=Guys Gone Wild: A Comparative Study for the Well Versed Pornographist |url=http://www.collegehumor.com/article/1410034/guys-gone-wild-a-comparative-study-for-the-well-versed-pornographist |publisher=College Humor |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304110200/http://www.collegehumor.com/article/1410034/guys-gone-wild-a-comparative-study-for-the-well-versed-pornographist |archivedate=4 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/07/03/2003177572|title=The world's gone mad for wild guys and girls|publisher=|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Horn, spokesman for [[Mantra Entertainment]] which produced the videos, notes a [[gender]]-related [[double standard]] in these videos. In the ''Girls Gone Wild'' series, sometimes the young women kiss, while the guys' series does not have that feature. Horn explains: "Let's face it, there's a double standard when it comes to guy-on-guy as opposed to [[girl-on-girl]]. It's sexy to see two girls [[making out]]. It's not considered sexy to see two guys making out. That's just the reality, and, we were there to capture the reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Guys Go Wild" in New Video Series|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,124478,00.html|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hour-long ''Guys Gone Wild'' productions featured women camera operators who encouraged men to get naked and perform strip teases.&lt;ref name="CHRON"/&gt;

==Legal==
In 2003, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] filed a complaint against Girls Gone Wild alleging that the company failed to notify customers when they purchased subscriptions under a continuity program, rather than single DVDs.&lt;ref name="FTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/12/girlsgonewild.shtm |title=Sellers of ‘Girls Gone Wild’ Videos Charged with Deceptive Practices |date=17 December 2003 |publisher=Federal Trade Commission |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214015818/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2003/12/girlsgonewild.shtm |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, GGW settled for $1.1 million and agreed to disclose all terms and get consent for recurring charges.&lt;ref name="FTC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/07/girlsgonewild.shtm |title=Sellers of ‘Girls Gone Wild’ Videos to Pay $1.1 Million to Settle Charges of Unauthorized Shipping and Billing |date=30 July 2004 |publisher=Federal Trade Commission |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728095620/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/07/girlsgonewild.shtm |archivedate=28 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Girls Gone Wild marketer [[Marketing Research Association|MRA Holdings]] pleaded guilty to charges for failing to record filmed subject's ages in 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref name="FINDLAW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/pornlaw/dfrprosmra91206.html |title=Deferred Prosecution Agreement, Stipulation of Fact, Public Statement of Joseph Francis, and Films Subject to the Agreement |date=12 September 2006 |publisher= FindLaw|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parties agreed to pay $2.1 million in restitution and fines.&lt;ref name = "FINDLAW"/&gt;

In 2008, [[Ashley Dupré]] filed against Joe Francis and other defendants claiming that they filmed her without consent.&lt;ref name="TMZ"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tmz.com/2008/03/19/ashley-dupre-gone-wild-legal-or-jailbait/ |title=Ashley Dupre Gone "Wild" -- Legal or Jailbait? |date=19 March 2008 |publisher= TMZ|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FINDLAW2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/spitzer/dupreggw42808cmp.html |title=Ashley Alexandra Dupre, the Former Prostitute Who Had a Paid Liaison With Ex-N.Y.

Dupré dropped the suit after Francis released footage of her consent.&lt;ref name = "RS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call girl in Spitzer case drops "Gone Wild" suit|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/07/03/people-dupre-lawsuit-dc-idUKN0327672620080703|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a Missouri woman claimed that she was filmed without consent when a Girls Gone Wild contractor removed her [[halter top]] at a St. Louis bar.&lt;ref name="FINDLAW3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/apnews/9ba575eb243348c684dbb49c89d58b69 |title=Mo. woman wins $5.8M in 'Girls Gone Wild' case |author =Jim Salter | date=27 April 2012 |publisher= FindLaw|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A jury found that she consented. On re-trial, a judge awarded the woman $5.77 million after the defense failed to show at court.&lt;ref name="STL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/girls-gone-wild-ordered-to-pay-million-to-woman-filmed/article_0bbb7adf-757b-53cb-90ce-124a459dd28d.html |title='Girls Gone Wild' ordered to pay $5.77 million to woman filmed in St. Louis |author =Robert Patrick | date=26 April 2012 |publisher= The St. Louis Post-Dispatch|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the judge upheld the verdict.&lt;ref name="MOLAW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://molawyersmedia.com/blog/2012/06/20/5-77m-judgment-stands-in-girls-gone-wild-case/ |title=$5.77M judgment stands in Girls Gone Wild case |author =Donna Walter | date=20 June 2012 |publisher= Missouri Lawyers Media|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, four women claimed that they suffered emotional distress by being shown in Girls Gone Wild film.&lt;ref name="MIAMI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/04/07/all-female-jury-throws-out-girls-gone-wild-lawsuit/ |title=All-Female Jury Throws Out "Girls Gone Wild" Lawsuit | date=7 April 2011 |publisher= CBS Miami|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, an all-female jury declined to award damages to the plaintiffs.&lt;ref name = "MIAMI"/&gt;

===Bankruptcy===
In 2013, GGW Brands LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.&lt;ref name=chap11/&gt;&lt;ref name=FB&gt;{{cite web|last=Egan|first=Matt|title=Legal Headaches Force 'Girls Gone Wild' Into Bankruptcy |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2013/03/01/legal-headaches-force-girls-gone-wild-into-bankruptcy/|publisher=Fox Business|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joke theft''' is the act of performing and taking credit for comic material written by another person without their [[consent]]. This is a form of [[plagiarism]] and can, in some cases, be [[copyright infringement]]. 
==History==
===Vaudeville years===
In [[music hall]]s and [[vaudeville]], it was common for performers to "borrow" material. According to [[Milton Berle]], [[etiquette]] only required that "the borrower add to the joke and make it his own".&lt;ref name="Berle1989xxiii"&gt;Berle, Milton (1989) ''Private joke file'', ''Introduction'', p.xxiii quotation: {{quotation|Of course, in the days of vaudeville, it wasn't uncommon for a performer to "borrow" a joke from another performer. Etiquette demanded only that the borrower add to the joke and make it his own. Bert Williams, a star of the Ziegfeld Follies, pilfered a story about fish and added enough laughs to turn it into a classic fifteen-minute routine. Naturally, that routine happens to be in my file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade. Most jokes at the time were one-liners and there was little in the way of proof of a joke's origin, but the value of each joke was immeasurable to a comedian.&lt;ref name="radartake"&gt;{{cite web
  |url =http://www.radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_1.php 
  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217031356/http://www.radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2007/02/take_the_funny_and_run_1.php

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Berle and [[Bob Hope]] had a long-standing feud due to Hope's accusation that Milton Berle had stolen some of his jokes.&lt;ref name="radartake" /&gt; Berle never disputed the claim, but instead embraced the title "The Thief of Bad Gag".

Even the most famous of comics have found themselves, knowingly or unknowingly, stealing material. [[Bill Cosby]] admitted to stealing a joke by George Carlin involving an uneducated football player doing a television commercial. Cosby said that what makes the routine his own is the surreal phrase "little tiny hairs".&lt;ref name="funny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-joketheft24jul24,1,6252669,full.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=5&amp;cset=true |title=Funny, that was my joke |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Welkos |first=Robert W. |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221013725/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-joketheft24jul24%2C1%2C6252669%2Cfull.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=5&amp;cset=true |archivedate=21 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Cosby, Bill|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AikgyewBn8k|title=Late Show with David Letterman – Bill Cosby's Race Against George Carlin|publisher=[[CBS]]|medium=TV|date=2009-06-01|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later, [[Carlos Mencia]] performed a bit about athletes and their parents that hearkened back to a Cosby bit from his album ''[[Bill Cosby: Himself]]''.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The 1980s and 1990s saw the popularity of [[stand-up comedy]] continue to increase. The advent of pay-cable networks afforded comics the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft in which the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.

[[Robin Williams]] was accused of stealing material from another comic. [[David Brenner]] claims that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes.&lt;ref name="Comedy at the Edge"&gt;{{cite book | title=Comedy at the Edge | author=Richard Zoglin | year=2008 | publisher=Bloomsbury USA | isbn=978-1582346243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
For many years, [[Denis Leary]] had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1993 album ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt Leary had stolen his act and material, and the friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=[[Kevin Booth]] and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170  |title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | author=Joe Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-10-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051218140900/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 |archivedate = 2005-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Joe Rogan answers 20 Questions | last=Rogan | first=Joe | work=Playboy Magazine |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html | title=Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions | author=Tim McIntire | year=1998 | publisher=BillHicks.com | archivedate=2006-03-20 | accessdate=2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from [[pancreatic cancer]], an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; "Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer").&lt;ref name="hicksfaq" /&gt;

In a 2008 appearance on ''The Opie and Anthony Show'', comedian [[Louis C.K.]] claimed that Leary stole his "I'm an asshole" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.&lt;ref name="Berle1989xxiii"/&gt; On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips.&lt;ref name="radartake"/&gt;

In his memoir ''[[Gasping for Airtime]]'', [[Jay Mohr]] admitted that he lifted an entire routine from [[Rick Shapiro]]'s act for a 1995 ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch. He stated that Shapiro sued the show and was financially compensated, but Shapiro later disputed that he received any compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohr|first1=Jay|title=Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live|date=2004|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=1401300065|pages=276–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and 2010s===
Louis C.K. has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with [[Dane Cook]] over three bits on Cook's album, ''Retaliation'', that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on C.K.'s album ''Live in Houston''.  C.K. and Cook portray this rivalry with comedy and sincerity in an episode of C.K.'s series ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thecomicscomic.com/2011/08/05/dane-cook-confronts-louis-ck-in-an-honest-way-about-joke-theft-read-the-transcript-watch-the-video/ | title = Dane Cook confronts Louis CK in an honest way about joke theft.

[[George Lopez]] has accused Carlos Mencia of plagiarizing his material and claimed that the two once had a physical altercation over the alleged plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml |author=Goldyn, Debra |title=Is Carlos Mencia a thief? |work=Advocate |publisher=[[University of Colorado at Denver]] |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2007-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007092111/http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml |archivedate=7 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fellow comedian Ted Sarnowski countered this claim and stated that it was he, not Lopez, who had originally penned the joke and that he had given Mencia permission to use it when he discovered that Lopez had stolen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5264&amp;IssueNum=199|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216161529/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5264&amp;IssueNum=199|archivedate=16 February 2008|author=Kozlowski, Carl|title=Carlos Mencia Just Said That|work=|publisher=Los Angeles CityBeat|date=2007-03-29|accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Italian comic and satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] was accused by anonymous bloggers of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as [[George Carlin]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Robert Schimmel]].&lt;ref name="rep_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2010/06/09/news/luttazzi-secopia-4703064/ |title=La Rete contro Luttazzi: "Copia" I dubbi dei fan, il tam-tam cresce – Repubblica.it |accessdate=2010-06-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html |title=Luttazzi copia – Parte 1 |accessdate=2010-06-11 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612084318/http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a personal blog entry published five years prior, Luttazzi himself offered his blog readers a prize if they were able to identify a "nugget" (i.e. a reference to a famous joke), calling the game a "treasure hunt".&lt;ref name="blo_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danieleluttazzi.blogspot.com/|title=Caccia al tesoro|author=Luttazzi, Daniele}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against [[La7]] broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show "Decameron", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. Luttazzi got 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros as compensation.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/12_marzo_10/satira-tv-luttazzi-vince-causa-contro-la-7-franco_69183226-6a83-11e1-8b63-010bde402ef9.shtml|title=Luttazzi vince la causa contro La7|date=10 March 2012|accessdate=10 March 2012|publisher=corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls this ruse "the [[Lenny Bruce]] trick" (named for the comic of same name).  Luttazzi asserts that the jokes he references are not "plagiarized" but "calqued", which is a fair use of original material. In 2014, an academic paper explained why Luttazzi's jokes are his own and not "plagiarised" ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caimotto|first1=M.Cristina|title=Transcreating a New Kind of Humor: the case of Daniele Luttazzi|url=http://www.cultusjournal.com/index.php/archive/16-issue-2014-v-7-transcreation-and-the-professions|website=cultusjournal.com|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' contestant Jordan Paris presented an act of stand-up comedy and quickly proceeded to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, G 2011, '[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/comedy/australias-got-plagiarism-ripoff-comic-exposed-20110526-1f50v.html Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip-off comic exposed]', ''Brisbane Times'' 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians [[Lee Mack]] and [[Geoff Keith]]. The television network gave him a chance to redeem himself and allowed him to compete in the semi-finals using his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well – "I just sacked my two writers – Copy and Paste" – had been done in 2009 by comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]], about [[Brad Garrett]], at a roast of [[Joan Rivers]]. Ross had said, "This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste."&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, D 2011, [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/oops-he-did-it-again-ripoff-comic-plunders-joke-about-plagiarism-20110629-1gq1d.html 'Oops. He did it again: Rip-off comic plunders joke about plagiarism'], ''Brisbane Times'', 29 June 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, blogger and comedian Troy Holm was ridiculed on the [[social networking]] site Facebook&lt;ref name="facebook1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-Troy-Holm/217011661714006 |title=Occupy Troy Holm |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for stealing jokes and stories from comedian [[Doug Stanhope]] and posting them to his blog from 2010, [[plagiarism|claiming them as his own work]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701002315/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; including Stanhope's "Fuck someone uglier than you" routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103154727/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |archivedate=3 January 2012 |title=Fuck Someone Ugly|date=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found on Stanhope's ''Acid Bootleg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Doug+Stanhope/ACID+Bootleg |title=ACID Bootleg – Doug Stanhope – Listen and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute&lt;ref&gt;[[Sicko (album)]]&lt;/ref&gt; nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701001921/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the "Occupy Troy Holm" Movement.&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;  Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that "To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that ''isn't'' mine?"&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;

==In other media==
Joke theft is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often jokes in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.
[[Dick Cavett]] wrote about joke theft in his autobiography. He'd written a bit about eating Chinese-German food and, an hour later, being hungry for power. After a few days of performing the bit, he discovered a column by [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] which attributed the joke to [[Rip Taylor]]. However, after calling Taylor to ask him to stop using the bit, he discovered that not only had Taylor never performed the bit, he had never even heard it and laughed heartily at the joke's humor. It was then that Cavett discovered that some journalists often falsely attribute jokes to the wrong comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Cavett | author=Dick Cavett, Christopher Porterfield | year=1974| publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |pages=227–228| isbn=978-0151161300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavett and [[Woody Allen]] often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other. Allen's jokes, when he still lacked access to television, were regularly stolen by top mainstream shows ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' and ''[[Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name="Cavett interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/cavett.htm |title=SHECKY! Interview: DICK CAVETT! |publisher=Sheckymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-07-11}} quotation: {{quotation|Woody's best lines would show up, while he was still confined to little Village clubs, on the Red Skelton show and that alleged entertainment, Laugh-In.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved extremely painful to Allen.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including "[[Missionary: Impossible]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]" and "[[The Italian Bob]]" have poked fun at ''[[Family Guy]]'', implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from the Simpsons. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | title = Interview: Matt Groening | accessdate = 2006-12-12 | author = Nathan Rabin | date = 2006-04-26 | work = The A.V.

Matt Groening and I actually have a great relationship...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the Australian television show host [[Grant Denyer]] was interviewed on the radio programme ''[[The Grill Team]]'', which is on [[2MMM]]. In the interview, ''The Grill Team''{{'}}s co-host [[Matty Johns]] told an amusing anecdote about introducing a child to the board game ''[[Test Match (board game)|Test Match]]''. Later that morning, Grant Denyer was interviewed on the radio programme ''[[The Kyle and Jackie O Show]]'', which is on [[KIIS 106.5]]. In that interview, he told the same anecdote about ''Test Match'', passing it off as his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://au.be.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/a/34283262/grant-denyer-banned-from-triple-m-and-kiis-fm-radio-stations-for-stealing-story-yahoo7-be/#page1 | title = Grant Denyer Banned From Triple M and KIIS FM Radio Stations For Stealing Story | accessdate = 2017-01-28 | author = Leah Cohen | date = 2017-01-28 | work = Yahoo7Be | publisher = Yahoo!7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recourse and consequences==
There is, historically, very little [[legal recourse]] taken in cases of joke theft. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. [[W. C. Fields]] reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a thieving comic's legs broken.&lt;ref name="radartake" /&gt;

"You have a better chance of stopping a serial killer than a serial thief in comedy," said comedian [[David Brenner]]. "If we could protect our jokes, I'd be a retired billionaire in Europe somewhere – and what I just said is original."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/24/entertainment/et-joketheft24|title=Funny, that was my joke|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|date=2007-07-24|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2018 study in the ''American Sociological Review'', "most instances of possible joke theft are ambiguous owing to the potential for simultaneous and coincidental discovery".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reilly|first=Patrick|date=2018-08-17|title=No Laughter among Thieves: Authenticity and the Enforcement of Community Norms in Stand-Up Comedy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122418791174|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|pages=000312241879117|doi=10.1177/0003122418791174|issn=0003-1224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"that accusations are not strongly coupled to jokes’ similarity, and enforcement depends mainly on the extent to which insiders view the comic in question as being authentic to the community. Comics who are oriented toward external rewards, have a track record of anti-social behavior, and exhibit lackluster on-stage craft are vulnerable to joke theft accusations even in borderline cases because those inauthentic characteristics are typical of transgressors. Vulnerability is greatest for comics who enjoy commercial success despite low peer esteem."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Kanon'''''|カノン}} is a Japanese [[Eroge|adult]] [[visual novel]] developed by [[Key (company)|Key]] released on June 4, 1999 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[Personal computers|PCs]]. Key later released versions of ''Kanon'' without the erotic content, and the game was [[Porting|ported]] to the [[Dreamcast]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. The story follows the life of Yuichi Aizawa, a high school student who returns to a city he last visited seven years prior, and he has little recollection of the events from back then. He meets several girls and slowly regains his lost memories. The [[gameplay]] in ''Kanon'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the [[player character]]. The game once ranked as the second best-selling PC game sold in Japan, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. ''Kanon'' has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.

Following the game's release, ''Kanon'' made several transitions into other media. Two [[manga]] series were serialized in ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age Pure]]''. [[Comic anthology|Comic anthologies]], [[light novel]]s and [[art book]]s were also published, as were [[audio drama]]s and several music albums. [[Toei Animation]] produced a 13-episode anime television series in 2002 and an [[original video animation]] (OVA) episode in 2003. [[Kyoto Animation]] produced a 24-episode anime series in 2006. The 2006 anime was licensed and dubbed in English by [[ADV Films]] in 2008, but the license was given to [[Funimation]] after ADV's closure. The 2006 anime plays on the association between ''Kanon'' and the musical term [[Canon (music)|canon]] by using [[Johann Pachelbel|Pachelbel]]'s ''Kanon D-dur'', or ''[[Pachelbel's Canon|Canon in D major]]'', as a background piece at certain instances throughout the series.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Kanon Ayu screenshot.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Typical dialogue and narrative in ''Kanon'', depicting the main character Yuichi talking to Ayu.]]
''Kanon'' is a [[Romance (love)|romance]] [[visual novel]] in which the player assumes the role of Yuichi Aizawa.&lt;ref name="visual-book"&gt;{{cite book|publication-date=June 2000|title=Kanon Visual Fan Book|publisher=[[Enterbrain]]|isbn=978-4-7577-0039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its [[gameplay]] is spent on reading the story's [[narrative]] and [[dialogue]]. ''Kanon'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.&lt;ref name="Kanon-PSP" /&gt;

There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's [[back-story]]. [[Jun Maeda]], who worked on the scenario for ''Kanon'', commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes soothing games because of ''Kanon'''s influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on ''Kanon'' who thought that.&lt;ref name="Air-interview"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605054025/http://akirunoneko.at.infoseek.co.jp/archive/text/AIR_interview.htm|url= http://akirunoneko.at.infoseek.co.jp/archive/text/AIR_interview.htm|title=カラフル・ピュアガール 2001年3月号 Keyシナリオスタッフ ロングインタビュー |trans-title=''Colorful Pure Girl'' March 2001 Issue Key Scenario Staff Long Interview|publisher=Colorful Pure Girl|date=March 2001|archivedate=June 5, 2008|accessdate=August 11, 2012|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hentai|adult]] versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual [[Computer graphics|CGs]] depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Key-official" /&gt; Later, Key released versions of ''Kanon'' without the erotic content. The versions that include the adult content have one explicit sex scene in each of the five main story routes, in addition to one fantasy scene.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; Outside of these, there are two scenes with [[nudity]].&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; [[Yūichi Suzumoto]], a scenario writer who worked on later Key titles, commented that the sex scenes in ''Kanon'' are very self-contained, and can be easily removed without altering the story.&lt;ref name="Air-interview" /&gt; Maeda remarked that the sex scenes were not written with [[Human reproduction|reproduction]] in mind.&lt;ref name="Air-interview" /&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting and themes===
There are several important locations featured in the ''Kanon'' story, though the location names are seldom mentioned explicitly in Key's works. The events of the story occur during winter, and since it often snows periodically over the course of the entire story, the city is always presented covered in a layer of snow. The [[Shōtengai|shopping district]] is featured throughout the story when the characters go into town, and especially whenever Ayu appears in the early story. The high school where Yuichi and the other main characters attend, including the school grounds, is shown predominantly in Shiori's and Mai's stories, and is otherwise a general setting where Yuichi interacts with other characters.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;

There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. A music theme is present, as the episode titles from the 2006–2007 anime have parts in their titles related to music, such as [[overture]] and [[introit]]. [[Miracle]]s play a large part in the story; ''Kanon''{{'}}s plot line and characters are influenced by various instances where miracles occur.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 起きないから、奇跡って言うんですよ&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "It's called a miracle because it doesn't happen."&lt;/ref&gt; The act of promising and keeping promises is found throughout the story.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 約束、だよ&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "It's a promise."&lt;/ref&gt; Yuichi eventually makes important promises to the five main girls while at the same time fulfilling past promises he had made with four of them when he used to visit the city as a kid.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;

One of the [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] in the story is [[amnesia]], or memory loss; three of the main characters—Yuichi, Ayu and Makoto—suffer from amnesia in varying degrees; this is used as a plot device to advance the story.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; Another motif deals with the favorite foods of the five main heroines. ''[[Newtype USA]]'' stated in an article on ''Kanon'' that "it's when the characters are eating something really tasty that they seem most beautiful and alive", despite the somber setting and overall tone of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nakagami |first=Yoshikatsu |last2=Ikeda |first2=Kazumi |last3=Takeda |first3=Akiyo |last4=Miyata |first4=Kana |last5=Unoguchi |first5=Joh |date=January 2007 |title=Kanon |journal=[[Newtype USA]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=62–63 |publisher=[[A.D. Vision]] |location=Houston, TX |issn=1541-4817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These five foods of choice are: [[taiyaki]] (Ayu), strawberries (Nayuki), [[nikuman]] (Makoto), ice cream (Shiori), and [[gyudon]] (Mai).&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;

===Principal characters===
{{main article|List of Kanon characters}}
The player assumes the role of [[List of Kanon characters#Yuichi Aizawa|Yuichi Aizawa]], the protagonist of ''Kanon''. He is a cynical 17-year-old high school student, and is known to play jokes on the girls his age he knows and interacts with throughout the story. Despite this, Yuichi is very loyal and will go to great lengths to please others, even at the expense of his own time and money. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them. [[Ayu Tsukimiya]], the main heroine of ''Kanon'', is a short, strange, and mysterious girl immediately recognizable by her winged backpack, red hair band, and tendency to refer to herself with the [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese|masculine first-person pronoun]] {{Nihongo|''[[Japanese pronouns|boku]]''|僕}}. She has a fondness for eating [[taiyaki]], and is notorious for her [[catchphrase]], {{Nihongo|"ugū"|うぐぅ}}, which she mutters as an expression of various negative emotions such as frustration, pain, and fear. Yuichi's first cousin [[List of Kanon characters#Nayuki Minase|Nayuki Minase]], another of ''Kanon'''s heroines, has been in love with him since childhood, and must learn how to deal with her feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall in love with one of the other girls. Nayuki talks noticeably slower than those around her, and has constant trouble waking up in the morning except on a few occasions when she is up before Yuichi, much to his surprise.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;

Yuichi is accosted a few days after arriving in the city by ''Kanon'''s third heroine [[List of Kanon characters#Makoto Sawatari|Makoto Sawatari]], a young girl who has [[Amnesia|lost her memories]], but despite this she is sure that she holds a grudge against Yuichi from when he last visited the city. Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 春がきて･･･ずっと春だったらいいのに&lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "If only spring would come and stay forever."&lt;/ref&gt; Yuichi coincidentally runs into [[List of Kanon characters#Shiori Misaka|Shiori Misaka]], another heroine and first-year high school student suffering from an unexplained illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. She tries to be strong in the face of her condition, and gets along well with others, even though she does not know very many people her age due to her condition. The fifth and final heroine in ''Kanon'' is [[List of Kanon characters#Mai Kawasumi|Mai Kawasumi]], a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She has a cold attitude towards almost everyone, but despite this, she is actually a very kind and caring person; she "punishes" someone who makes a playful joke about her by giving them a light [[karate]] chop to the head.&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt;

===Story===
''Kanon''{{'}}s story revolves around a group of five girls whose lives are connected to the same boy. Yuichi Aizawa is a second-year high school student who had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to ''Kanon'''s beginning. The story opens on Wednesday January 6, 1999&lt;ref name="visual-book" /&gt; when Yuichi arrives in the city and is very detached from it and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his first cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten almost everything except minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind. Nayuki initially tries repeatedly to jog his memory, but is unsuccessful. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the city, Yuichi is reminded of the events of seven years ago.

On the day after Yuichi's return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around city. Nayuki remembers that she has to buy things for dinner, but Yuichi is reluctant to go into the store with her. Moments after Nayuki leaves him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya collides with him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby café and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with [[taiyaki]] after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off. A few days after he has been in the city, Yuichi is accosted by a girl named Makoto Sawatari who has [[Amnesia|lost her memories]], though still remembers that she has a grudge against him from when he last visited the city. After she collapses in the street, he takes her home and learns about her situation. Akiko gives her permission to live with them for the time being, which is against Yuichi's plan to hand her over to the police.

Another girl who is connected to Yuichi's past is Mai Kawasumi who attends his high school as a third-year. She takes it upon herself to fight and defeat [[demon]]s at night while the school is deserted.&lt;ref&gt;'''Untranslated quote:''' 私は魔物を討つ者だから &lt;br /&gt;'''Translated quote:''' "I'm a demon hunter."&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, she is constantly blamed for accidents because she never denies them, being too sincere to say anything and knowing that no one will believe that there are demons in the school. Yuichi coincidentally meets a fifth girl named Shiori Misaka who he gets to know along with the other four heroines in the story. She has suffered from an unexplained affliction since birth which makes her weak to the point of missing school because of it. Yuichi starts to talk with her more after noticing her in the school courtyard one day. It turns out that Shiori stands outside on the school grounds nearly every day because she wants to meet someone dear to her.

==Development==
Most of ''Kanon''{{'}}s development staff originally worked for the visual novel publisher [[Nexton]] under the brand [[Tactics (brand)|Tactics]]. After the release of the brand's third game ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]'', most of Tactics' staff left Nexton to pursue work in another publishing company where they could have the freedom to produce their next game.&lt;ref name="10th-anniversary-book"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|journal=Key 10th Anniversary Book|title=Jun Maeda Long Interview|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|pages=48–60|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Itaru Hinoue, who had previously worked at [[VisualArt's]] once before, introduced Key's founding members to the president of VisualArt's, Takahiro Baba.&lt;ref name="10th-anniversary-book" /&gt; Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired, and they officially transferred to VisualArt's where they formed Key on July 21, 1998 and started production on ''Kanon''.&lt;ref name="10th-anniversary-book" /&gt; The planning for the visual novel was headed by [[Naoki Hisaya]] who was also one of two scenario writers with [[Jun Maeda]].&lt;ref name="staff1"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228084754/http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=187|url=http://erogamescape.ddo.jp/~ap2/ero/toukei_kaiseki/game.php?game=187|archivedate=December 28, 2007|title=''Kanon'' ErogameScape－エロゲー批評空間－|trans-title=''Kanon'' ErogameScape - Eroge Commentary Room -| publisher=Erogamescape|accessdate=October 19, 2014|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hisaya wrote the scenarios for Ayu, Nayuki and Shiori, while Maeda wrote the routes for Makoto and Mai.

==Adaptations==

===Light novels===
Five [[Erotic literature|adult]] [[light novel]]s written by Mariko Shimizu and published by [[Paradigm (publisher)|Paradigm]] were released in Japan between October 1999 and August 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4894900580/|title=Kanon 雪の少女|trans-title=Kanon Yuki no Shōjo|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=May 29, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4894900947/|title=Kanon 日溜まりの街|trans-title=Kanon Hidamari no Machi|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=May 29, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover art and internal illustrations were drawn by [[Itaru Hinoue]], the artist who drew the artwork in the visual novel. The basis for each novel was one of each of the five heroines and had titles that were taken from the musical themes pertaining to each character in the original game. The first two released were {{Nihongo|''Yuki no Shōjo''|雪の少女|Girl in the Snow|Nayuki}} and {{Nihongo|''Egao no Mukougawa ni''|笑顔の向こう側に|Beyond the Smile|Shiori}} in December 1999. The third was {{Nihongo|''Shōjo no Ori''|少女の檻|Girl's Prison|Mai}} released in April 2000 and the fourth novel was titled ''The Fox and the Grapes'' (Makoto), released two months later. The final novel titled {{Nihongo|''Hidamari no Machi''|日溜りの街|A Sunny City|Ayu}} was released in August 2000. Paradigm re-released the five novels in conjunction with [[VisualArt's]] under their VA Bunko [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], which removed the erotic scenes, starting with ''Yuki no Shōjo'' on June 27, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4894906236|title=Kanon 雪の少女|trans-title=''Kanon: Yuki no Shōjo''|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|language=Japanese|isbn=4894906236|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ending with ''Hidamari no Machi'' on December 26, 2009. To make up for the missing erotic content, Shimizu wrote additional content for each volume.

===Manga===
The first ''Kanon'' [[manga]] illustrated by Petit Morishima was serialized in [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]' manga magazine ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'' between the February 2000 and July 2002 issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kanon|journal=[[Dengeki Daioh]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|issue=February 2000|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Kanon|journal=[[Dengeki Daioh]]|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|issue=July 2002|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual chapters were later collected into two separate ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes published by MediaWorks under their ''[[Dengeki Comics]]'' imprint released in September 2000 and on July 27, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4840216789/|title=Kanon 1|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=September 1, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4840221308/|title=Kanon 2|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=September 1, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six chapters in total, three in each volume. Aside from the [[prologue]] in volume one and the [[epilogue]] in volume two, the other four chapters concern four of the main heroines. From chapters one through four, the main heroines presented are: Shiori Misaka, Makoto Sawatari, Mai Kawasumi and Ayu Tsukimiya. To make up for Nayuki not getting a chapter of her own, the story is altered in that Nayuki is in most of the scenes Yuichi is in.&lt;ref name="kanonmanga1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kanonmanga2" /&gt; The first manga is different from the visual novel in that Shiori's, Makoto's, and Mai's stories are not told in their entirety. Near the end of each of these girls' stories were originally intended to give the viewer the remaining answers, but the manga version ends these girls' stories prematurely.&lt;ref name="kanonmanga1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morishima|first=Petit|title=Kanon manga |volume=1|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kanonmanga2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morishima|first=Petit|title=Kanon manga |volume=2|publisher= [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the manga putting more focus on Ayu's story.

The second manga illustrated by Kinusa Shimotsuki, under the main title {{Nihongo|''Kanon: Honto no Omoi wa Egao no Mukōgawa ni''|Kanon ホントの想いは笑顔の向こう側に|Kanon: The Real Feelings of the Other Side of the Smiling Face}} with the subtitle ''each regret of Kanon'', was serialized between volumes two and seven of [[Fujimi Shobo]]'s ''[[Dragon Age Pure]]'' magazine sold between June 29, 2006 and October 20, 2007, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622041253/http://www.fujimishobo.co.jp/pure/2006/06/post_75.php|url=http://www.fujimishobo.co.jp/pure/2006/06/post_75.php|archivedate=June 22, 2007|script-title=ja:大人気ゲーム｢Ｋａｎｏｎ｣をコミカライズ!!|trans-title=Highly Popular Game ''Kanon'' Becomes a Comic!!|publisher=[[Fujimi Shobo]]|date=June 30, 2006|accessdate=October 19, 2014|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kanon|journal=[[Dragon Age Pure]]|publisher=[[Fujimi Shobo]]|volume=2|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kanon|journal=[[Dragon Age Pure]]|publisher=[[Fujimi Shobo]]|volume=7|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume was released in Japan on April 1, 2007 and focused on Nayuki's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/comic/bk_detail.php?pcd=200701000223|title=Kanon ホントの想いは笑顔の向こう側に1|trans-title=''Kanon: The Real Feelings of the Other Side of the Smiling Face'' 1|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|accessdate=December 3, 2007|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume was released on December 8, 2007 and focused on the other four heroines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/comic/bk_detail.php?pcd=200707000422|title=Kanon ホントの想いは笑顔の向こう側に2|trans-title=''Kanon: The Real Feelings of the Other Side of the Smiling Face'' 2|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|accessdate=December 3, 2007|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are nine chapters in total, five in volume one and four in volume two.

The second TV ''Kanon'' animation features updated animation quality, and uses the same [[Seiyū|voice acting]] cast as the first anime, with the exception of [[List of Kanon characters#Yuichi Aizawa|Yuichi]] and [[List of Kanon characters#Kuze|Kuze]]. Unlike the first anime, the actual theme songs from the ''Kanon'' game are used for the second anime's opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack. There is one song featured as an insert song in episode 16 that did not come from the visual novel titled "Last regrets (X'mas floor style)" by [[Eiko Shimamiya]] from [[I've Sound]]'s first album ''[[Regret (album)|Regret]]''. Other songs are used from the [[Arrangement|arrange]] albums released over the years, which include ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Anemoscope|Anemoscope]]'', ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Recollections|Recollections]]'', ''[[List of Kanon soundtracks#Re-feel|Re-feel]]'', and ''[[Ma-Na]]''.

Five days before the first PS2 release for ''Kanon'', a PS2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. ''Kanon'' was one of the three games supported at launch, the other two being ''America Ōden Ultra Quiz'' from [[DigiCube]] and ''Marle de Jigsaw'' from [[Nippon Ichi Software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111195733/http://www.allrpg.com/cgi-bin/news/archives.cgi?category=1&amp;view=1-02|url=http://www.allrpg.com/cgi-bin/news/archives.cgi?category=1&amp;view=1-02|title=A PlayStation 2 Printer|publisher=Allrpg.com|archivedate=January 11, 2008|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' where the game received an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Famitsu Scores for the Week of 02/20/2002|journal=[[Famitsu]]|date=February 2002|quote=Kanon (PS2, NEC Interchannel): 7 / 8 / 7 / 7 - (29/40)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yūichi Suzumoto]] commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of ''Kanon'''s story could be summed up as "the prince and princess live happily ever after. The end," resulting in an ending that does not expand on what could possibly happen afterwards.&lt;ref name="Air-interview" /&gt; In the October 2007 issue of ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'', poll results for the 50 best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, ''Kanon'' ranked fifth with 71 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011213916/http://gs.dengekinet.com/ranking/index.html|url= http://gs.dengeki.com/ranking/index.html|title=読者が選ぶ MY BEST ギャルゲーランキング 電撃G'smagazine.com|trans-title=Reader Chosen MY BEST Girl Game Ranking Dengeki G's magazine.com|publisher= [[ASCII Media Works]]|archivedate=October 11, 2007|accessdate=January 3, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characters from ''Kanon'' have appeared in several [[Dōjin soft|dōjin games]] not directly based on the ''Kanon'' series such as the ''[[Eternal Fighter Zero]]'' game by [[Twilight Frontier]] where most of the playable characters either came from ''Kanon'' or from ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Eternal Fighter Zero]]|developer=[[Twilight Frontier]]|publisher=[[Twilight Frontier]]|platform=PC|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dōjin game ''[[Glove on Fight]]'' featured at least two ''Kanon'' characters: Ayu Tsukimiya and Akiko Minase in a [[Versus fighting game|fighting]] style game along with various other characters taken from other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Glove on Fight]]|developer=[[Twilight Frontier]]|publisher=[[Twilight Frontier]]|platform=PC|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character [[Ayu Tsukimiya]] in particular is known to appear in works outside ''Kanon'', such as in strip 67 of the [[webcomic]] ''[[Megatokyo]]'' where Ayu is shown eating ''[[taiyaki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Gallagher|url= http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=67|title=MegaTokyo - (67) Saving Points|publisher=Fredart Studios|accessdate=June 15, 2009|authorlink= Fred Gallagher (cartoonist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second ''Kanon'' anime series was reviewed at [[Anime News Network]] where Theron Martin commented how the series is a "formulaic moe haremfest", and how the [[Moe (slang)|moe]] aspects of the series may make viewers "feel like they're drowning in a vat of gooey cuteness". The series is described as being similar to the anime television adaptation of ''[[Air (visual novel)|Air]]'', saying "Like ''Air'', the first four episodes can be simply summarized as 'male lead arrives in town and kills time interacting with cute girls.' Unlike ''Air'', however, these interactions can occasionally be very funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kanon/dvd-1|title=Kanon DVD 1 Review|author=Martin, Theron|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 22, 2007|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin also compares ''Kanon'' to the anime adaptation of ''[[Shuffle!]]'' which is described as "bombing" where ''Kanon'' "works". The reviewer chalks this up to the characters "endear[ing] themselves to the viewer...far better than what ''Shuffle!'''s do." Martin cites the transition between humor and serious content as a defining feature of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kanon/dvds-2|title=Kanon DVDs 2-3 Review|author=Martin, Theron|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 8, 2008|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Martin comments how one of the series' flaws is how it "overplays the mundane cutesiness and moe cards at times" causing little to happen with the plot. Yuichi is described as being "too erratic to be fully credible" or easily believable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kanon/dvd-5|title=Kanon DVDs 4-5 Review|author=Martin, Theron|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 29, 2008|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the series' drawbacks, Martin still describes the series as "one of the best moe-centric series to date" and lauds Kyoto Animation's production values making ''Kanon'' "one of the prettiest-looking anime series of the past year". Martin adds another series comparison, citing ''Kanon'' as the "polar opposite of ''[[Gurren Lagann]]''", which deals primarily in its action-oriented content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kanon/dvd-6|title=Kanon DVD 6 Review|author=Martin, Theron|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 29, 2008|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuso''' is the term used in [[East Asia]] for the [[internet culture]] that generally includes all types of [[camp (style)|camp]] and [[parody]]. In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], {{Nihongo|kuso|糞,くそ}} means "crap" or "[[shit]]" and "bullshit", and is often uttered as an interjection. It is also used to describe outrageous matters and objects of poor quality. This definition of kuso was brought into Taiwan around 2000 by young people who frequently visited Japanese websites and quickly became an [[internet phenomenon]], spreading to [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]] and subsequently to the rest of [[China]]. 

==Etymology==
In Chinese kuso is called "e'gao" (S: 恶搞, T: 惡搞, P: ''ègǎo''), with the first character meaning "evil" or "gross" and the second meaning "to make fun of [someone/something]." In 2007 the word was so new that it was not listed in Chinese dictionaries.{{update inline|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref name="egao"&gt;Wu, Jiao. "[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-01/22/content_788600.htm E'gao: Art criticism or evil?]" ''[[China Daily]]''. January 22, 2007. Retrieved on January 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Christopher Rea, "E’gao, the main buzzword associated with online Chinese parody, literally means “evil doings” or “malicious manipulation”"; he notes that e'gao's "semantic associations [to kuso] can be misleading, however, since e’gao is not fundamentally scatological—or even, as the Chinese term might suggest, malicious. In its broad usage, it may be applied to parody of any stripe, from fan tribute-mimicry to withering mockery. In a more restricted sense, it refers the practice of digitally manipulating mass culture products to comic effect and circulating them via the internet. The term e’gao may thus be interpreted in multiple senses, as it denotes variously a genre, a mode, a practice, an ethos and a culture."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, “Spoofing (e’gao) Culture on the Chinese Internet.”In Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times. Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2013, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The root of Taiwanese "kuso" was ''kuso-ge'' from [[Japan]]. The word ''[[kusoge]]'' is a [[clipped compound]] of ''kuso'' and ''gēmu'' (ゲーム, game), which means, quite literally, "crappy (video) games." The introduction of such a category originally was to teach gamers how to appreciate and enjoy a game of poor quality—such as appreciating the games' outrageous flaws instead of becoming frustrated by them. This philosophy soon spread to Taiwan, where people would share the games and often satirical comments on [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]es. Games generally branded as kuso in Taiwan include ''[[Hong Kong 97 (video game)|Hong Kong 97]]'' and the ''[[Death Crimson]]'' series.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Because ''kuso-ge''s were often unintentionally funny, soon the definition of kuso in Taiwan shifted to "anything hilarious," and people started to brand anything outrageous and funny as kuso. Parodies, such as the Chinese [[robot]] [[Xianxingzhe]] ridiculed by a Japanese website, were marked as kuso. [[Mo lei tau]] films by [[Stephen Chow]] are often said to be kuso as well. The [[Cultural Revolution]] is often a subject of parody too, with songs such as ''[[I Love Beijing Tiananmen]]'' spread around the internet for laughs.

Some, however, limit the definition of kuso to "humour limited to those about [[Hong Kong comics]] or Japanese [[anime]], [[manga]], and games." Kuso by such definitions are primarily [[doujin]] or [[fanfiction]]. [[Fictional crossover]]s are common media for kuso, such as redrawing certain [[bishōjo]] anime in the style of ''[[Fist of the North Star]]'', or blending elements of two different items together. (For example, in ''[[Densha de D]]'', both ''[[Initial D]]'' and ''[[Densha de Go!]]'' are parodied, as [[Initial D characters and teams|Takumi]] races trains and [[Drifting (motorsport)|drift]]s his railcar across multiple railway tracks.)

In [[China]], earlier ''e gao'' works consisted of images edited in [[Adobe Photoshop]]. An example of this would be the [[Little Fatty]] internet meme.&lt;ref&gt;Meng 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light poetry''' or '''light verse''' is [[poetry]] that attempts to be humorous.  Light poems are usually brief, can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]] including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme, and heavy [[alliteration]]. Typically, light verse in English is formal verse, although a few [[free verse]] poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition.

While light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]] or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned "serious" poets, such as Horace, Swift, Pope, and Auden, also excelled at light verse.

An [[Internet forum]], or ''message board'', is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages.&lt;ref name="vBfaqFORUM"&gt;{{cite web|title=vBulletin Community Forum - FAQ: What is a bulletin board?|url=http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/faq.php?faq=vb3_board_usage#faq_vb3_forums_threads_posts|publisher=vBulletin.com|quote=A bulletin board is an online discussion site. It is sometimes also called a 'board' or 'forum'. It may contain several categories, consisting of sub-forums, threads and individual posts. |accessdate = 2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On one level, it serves as a fun, informative place for people to read product reviews, download software and compare everything from the size of their poop to quiz show answers.

This is a '''list of catchphrases''' found in British and American television and film, where a [[catchphrase]] is a short phrase or expression that has gained usage beyond its initial scope. These are not merely catchy sayings. Even though some sources may identify a phrase as a catchphrase, this list is for those that meet the definition given in the lead section of the catchphrase article and are [[wp:notability|notable]] for their widespread use within the culture.

This list is distinct from the [[list of political catchphrases]].

== In British culture ==
&lt;!-- READ THIS FIRST: Please see the discussion at [[Talk:List of catchphrases]] regarding the consensus for whether to include your favourite catchphrase in this list.
This list is for phrases that meet the definition and notability guidelines of a catchphrase. The standard for inclusion is that it be internally linked to articles or article sections. This list is not a dumping ground for favourite quotes, slogans, catchwords, idioms, neologisms, etc.

'''Marriage plot''' is a term used, often in academic circles, to categorize a [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] that recurs in novels most prominently and more recently in films. Until the expansion of the definition of marriage to include [[same-sex couple]]s, this [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] centered exclusively on the courtship rituals between a man and a woman and the obstacles that faced the potential couple on its way to the nuptial payoff. The marriage plot became a popular source of entertainment in the 18th and 19th centuries with the rise of the [[middle class]] novel. The foremost practitioners of the form include some of the more illustrious names in English letters, among them [[Samuel Richardson]], [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]] and the [[Brontë sisters]].

==Use in novels==
Post-1980 deconstructionist criticism has highlighted how the plot was a profitable publishing and ideological production that served to ensure the ascendancy of the [[middle class]]. The marriage plot was the liberal age's reformulation of the [[medieval romance]], which excluded all but aristocratic ladies and their chivalrous knights from its epics of love. The marriage plot promises to liberate romance by making it available to greater sections of society: the middle class and to some extent, the [[working class]]es, who are relegated to [[comic relief]] in 16th- and 17th-century theater, suddenly become serious moral subjects. Today, few doubt the ennobling qualities of love, but giving that nobility of soul to anyone but nobles was an innovation to be found foundationally in the marriage plot, perhaps pioneered by Richardson's ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'', wherein a lowly but virtuous maid is raised beyond her birth through her insistent [[chastity]] and her subsequent marriage to the lordly Mr. B.

==Use in film==
Film, which supplanted the novel as the most popular narrative form in the 20th century, did not abandon this innovation of the novel. Rather, the marriage plot has enjoyed a continued efflorescence, visible to this day in the popular film form known as the "[[romantic comedy]]". At its most formulaic, critics have asserted, the conventions of the marriage plot, with the cathartic closure that its marriage ending delivers to its believers, ultimately renounces politics and engagement in the world in favor of privacy and domestic bliss. We may see this, for instance, in the film ''[[You've Got Mail]]'', which resolves the political opposition between mega-bookstore boss [[Tom Hanks]] and bookshop-around-the-corner owner, [[Meg Ryan]], by uniting its lead characters in a union that effaces the unequal distribution of capital that originally put them at odds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11843">'''MyLink'''  a.k.a. '''Intellilink''' is a [[telematics]] system/infotainment system offered by [[General Motors]] vehicles starting in the 2012 model year. 

It is offered in all GM brands aside from [[Cadillac]], who uses their exclusive CUE infotainment system. The MyLink name is used for vehicles under the [[Chevrolet]] and [[Holden]] brands, while the Intellilink name is used for [[Buick]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] and [[Opel]]. MyLink systems are manufactured by three companies for GM, [[Panasonic]] for most MyLink models, [[LG Electronics]] for the unit equipped on the [[Chevrolet Sonic]], [[Chevrolet Spark]], [[Chevrolet Trax]] and Vauxhall/[[Opel Adam]], and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] for [[Cadillac]]'s CUE system.

The system is based on [[QNX]] [[real-time operating system]] and voice recognition software from [[Nuance Communications|Nuance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autonews.com/article/20110419/OEM06/110419863/buick-gmc-will-get-version-of-chevrolet%E2%80%99s-mylink&lt;/ref&gt; It allows users to control online services through apps, like [[Pandora Internet Radio]] or [[Stitcher Radio]] through voice commands or the touch-screen interface. The car is able to access online content via a smartphone with a 3G data connection connected through [[Bluetooth]].&lt;ref name="allcartech"&gt;[http://www.allcartech.com/blog/1055574_chevrolet-launches-mylink-infotainment-system-on-volt-equinox Chevrolet Launches MyLink Infotainment System On Volt and Equinox], All Car Tech.&lt;/ref&gt; Users are also able to control their phone wirelessly via the same interface. MyLink also integrates [[OnStar]]'s services ([[Advanced Automatic Collision Notification]], roadside assistance, vehicle diagnostics information, live advisors, and turn-by-turn navigation).&lt;ref name="Motortrend"&gt;[http://wot.motortrend.com/2011-new-york-buicks-new-intellilink-looks-lot-like-chevy-mylink-69499.html 2011 New York: Buick’s New IntelliLink Looks A Lot Like Chevy Mylink], Motortrend.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capabilities ==
MyLink can play video and image files in select formats. Images should be in .jpg, .bmp, .png, or .gif format. Video files should be .avi, .mpg, .mp4, .divx, .xvid, or .wmv. Additionally, MyLink supports a large variety of song file formats, including MP3, WMA, and AAC. It also supports the following playlist files M3U standard and extended, iTunes, PLS, WAX, ASX and RMP.&lt;ref name=mylink-capabilities&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chevrolet MyLink Radio Connects to Your Media|url=http://www.chevrolet.com/mylink-bring-your-own-media.html|publisher=Chrvrolet|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
* Integration with driver's iOS, Android or Windows Phone mobile devices, allowing music on the device to be browsed and played from the built-in touch screen
* Integration with iOS, Android or Windows Phone smart phones via Bluetooth to allow hands-free phone conversations
* Pandora internet radio, which provides personalized radio stations based on a user's favorite artists, songs, or genres; purchase songs; and rate songs "up" or "down"&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;
* Stitcher SmartRadio, which lets users build a personalized listening experience from thousands of audio choices&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;
* Gracenote music identification, which provides artist names, music genre, and album art&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;
* Hands-free control of infotainment and vehicle climate controls, powered by Nuance&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;
* Flash-memory capability added to in-car USB connections, so users can bring their own media storage&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;
* MyLink software upgrades that users can download online and transfer to the vehicle&lt;ref name="allcartech" /&gt;
*Some functionality is being withheld based on vehicle style/trim level

Note that the supported features and services vary from model to model. For example, MyLink in the Chevrolet Sonic and Spark models does not support Gracenote (since those models have no CD player) or climate control.  The screen size, trim and appearance vary from model to model as well.

Additional features have been announced by Chevrolet for delivery in calendar year 2013.

== Intellilink ==
'''Intellilink''' is the branding for MyLink used by [[Buick]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] and [[Opel]]. It is basically the same system as MyLink with the only differences being the graphic interface used.&lt;ref name="Motortrend" /&gt;

== Availability ==

Originally the MyLink systems were set to be available on select 2012 model year vehicles before the end of 2011, however that was pushed back until "Spring 2012".&lt;ref name=mylink-delay&gt;{{cite web|last=Luft|first=Alex|title=Chevy Delays MyLink Until Spring 2012|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2011/12/chevy-delays-mylink-infotainment-system-to-spring-2012/|publisher=GM Authority|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Coffee Park''' ({{lang|es|Parque Nacional del Café}}) is a [[theme park]] located in the department of [[Quindío Department|Quindío]], [[Colombia]], 4&amp;nbsp;km south-west of the town of [[Montenegro, Colombia|Montenegro]] and 11&amp;nbsp;km west of the departmental capital city [[Armenia, Quindío|Armenia]]. The park was founded by the [[National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia]] ({{lang|es|La Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia}}) and the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindío ({{lang|es|El Comité Departamental de Cafeteros del Quindío}}), and opened on 24 February 1995.&lt;ref name="Dinero20180322"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Parque del Café invierte más de $27.000 millones en nueva montaña rusa y teleférico |url=https://www.dinero.com/empresas/articulo/nuevas-atracciones-del-parque-del-cafe-en-quindio/256626 |magazine=[[Dinero (magazine)|Dinero]] |date=22 March 2018 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronica20180322"&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Parque del Café inauguró Yippe, su nueva montaña rusa |url=https://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-parque-del-cafe-inauguro-yippe-su-nueva-montana-rusa-nota-118966 |newspaper=[[La Crónica del Quindío]] |date=22 March 2018 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two main areas: by the main entrance are the buildings housing the museum and exhibitions detailing the history, culture and process of growing and producing coffee in the region; and in the valley beyond is an [[amusement park]] with [[Amusement ride|rides]] and shows. The two areas are linked by two [[gondola lift]]s and a [[chairlift]]: it is also possible to walk between the two areas via an ecological trail that passes through a plantation of many varieties of [[Coffea|coffee bushes]].

As well as amusement rides the park also offers other attractions such as [[animatronics]] shows, a global coffee garden, food stalls based on [[coffee]] and traditional Colombian architecture. In 2009 the park received its five millionth visitor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parquenacionaldelcafe.com/newpage/detallesnoticiasi.php?codigon=11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527081023/http://www.parquenacionaldelcafe.com/newpage/detallesnoticiasi.php?codigon=11 |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }} Official website of the Parque Nacional del Café&lt;/ref&gt; and has grown to become one of Colombia's top tourist attractions, with more than one million visitors in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Colombia destacado por su inversión económica en parques de diversiones |url=http://caracol.com.co/radio/2018/05/15/nacional/1526404052_912093.html |website=[[Caracol Radio]] |date=15 May 2018 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea for a coffee museum came after Diego Arango Mora and his wife Margarita visited the Sugar Museum in nearby [[Valle del Cauca Department]]. Margarita remarked that if the country had a museum dedicated to sugar, it should also have one dedicated to Colombia's best known export. Arango, a member of the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindío, agreed and contacted Jorge Cárdenas Gutiérrez, the head of the [[National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia]], who was also receptive to the idea. When Arango was elected to chair the National Congress of Coffee Growers in 1982, he  proposed the creation of the museum, but was told by the secretary of the Congress that he did not have the quorum to pass the proposal.&lt;ref name="Cronica20150302"&gt;{{cite news |first=Miguel Ángel |last=Rojas Arias |title=Revelamos 23 microhistorias del Parque Nacional del Café (parte I) |url=http://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-revelamos_23_microhistorias_del_parque_nacional_del_caf_parte_i-seccion-la_regin-nota-85641 |newspaper=La Crónica del Quindío |date=2 March 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following years, Arango continued to work toward the creation of the museum, despite lack of financial support from banks unwilling to lend money for an enterprise they saw as non-profitable, and opposition from delegates from three other departments of Colombia who lobbied for the museum to be constructed in their departments, as well from other towns within the department of Quindío itself who objected to Arango's choice of Montenegro as the planned site for the museum.&lt;ref name="Cronica20150302" /&gt;

The museum was finally constructed and opened on 24 February 1995, and drew 250,000 visitors in its first year. However, visitor surveys showed that it was mainly those of 40 years of age who enjoyed the park, while younger visitors and children indicated they would not return. Arango took the decision to add an amusement park to the museum in order to attract the younger crowds.&lt;ref name="Cronica20150302" /&gt; The first attractions were the gondola lift and the steam railway, followed by the roller coaster and other rides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Miguel Ángel |last=Rojas Arias |title=Un terremoto y muchas intrigas casi matan al parque del Café |url=http://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-un_terremoto_y_muchas_intrigas_casi_matan_al_parque_del_caf-seccion-la_general-nota-85654 |newspaper=La Crónica del Quindío |date=3 March 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Two dancers.jpg|thumb|[[Dance]] is a type of performance art practiced all over the world.]]
{{Performing arts}}
'''Performing arts''' are a form of [[art]] in which artists use their voices, bodies or inanimate objects to convey artistic expression. It is different from [[visual arts]], which is when artists use paint, canvas or various materials to create physical or static [[works of art|art objects]]. Performing arts include a range of disciplines which are performed in front of a live audience.

[[Theatre]], [[music]], [[dance]] and [[object manipulation]], and other kinds of [[performance]]s are present in all human cultures. The [[history of music]] and [[history of dance|dance]] date to [[pre-historic times]] whereas [[circus skills]] date to at least [[Ancient Egypt]]. Many performing arts are performed professionally. Performance can be in purpose built buildings, such as theatres and opera houses, on open air stages at festivals, on stages in tents such as circuses and on the street.

Live performances before an audience are a form of [[entertainment]]. The development of [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] and [[video]] recording has allowed for private consumption of the performing arts.

The performing arts often aim to express one's emotions and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliver|first=Sophie Anne|title= Trauma, Bodies, and Performance Art: Towards an Embodied Ethics of Seeing |journal=EBSCOhost |date=February 2010|volume=24|pages=119–129|doi=10.1080/10304310903362775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performers==
Artists who participate in performing arts in front of an audience are called performers. Examples of these include [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[circus|circus artists]], [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as [[songwriting]], [[choreography]] and [[stagecraft]].

{{anchor|Triple threat}}A performer who excels in acting, singing, and dancing is commonly referred to as a '''''triple threat'''''.&lt;ref name="romano"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Tricia|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/03/30/natalie-portman-black-swan-and-the-death-of-the-hollywood-triple-threat.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=3 April 2015|title=Natalie Portman, Black Swan, and the Death of the 'Triple Threat'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known examples of historical triple threat artists include [[Gene Kelly]], [[Fred Astaire]], and [[Judy Garland]].&lt;ref name="romano" /&gt;

Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]], such as with [[costume]]s and [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], [[stage lighting]], and sound.

==Types==
Performing arts may include [[dance]], [[music]], [[opera]], [[theatre]] and [[musical theatre]], [[Magic (illusion)|magic]], [[illusion]], [[mime]], [[spoken word]], [[puppetry]], [[circus arts]], [[performance art]].

There is also a specialized form of [[fine art]], in which the artists ''perform'' their work live to an audience. This is called [[performance art]]. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of [[Theatrical property|props]]. Dance was often referred to as a ''plastic art'' during the [[Modern dance]] era.&lt;ref name="dance"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackrell|first1=Judith R. |title= dance |journal= Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|date= May 19, 2017|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Types-of-dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt;

===Theatre===
{{main|Theatre}}
Theatre is the branch of performing arts; concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience, using a combination of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle. Any one or more of these elements is performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style of plays. Theatre takes such forms as [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[Musical theatre|musicals]], [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[illusion]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[kabuki]], [[Mummers Play|mummers' plays]], [[improvisational theatre]], [[stand-up comedy]], [[pantomime]], and non-conventional or contemporary forms like [[postmodern theatre]], [[postdramatic theatre]], or [[performance art]].

===Dance===
{{main|Dance}}
[[File:NatalieBöckNussknacker.jpg|thumb|A [[ballerina]] [[en pointe]].]]
In the context of performing arts, [[dance]] generally refers to human [[Motion (physics)|movement]], typically rhythmic and to music, used as a form of audience entertainment in a [[performance]] setting. Definitions of what constitutes [[dance]] are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]] [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]].&lt;ref name="mackrell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mackrell|first1=Judith|title=Dance|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/150714/dance|website=britannica.com|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one another modern form of dance that emerged in 19th- 20th century with the name of Free-Dance style. This form of dance was structured to create a harmonious personality which included features such as physical and spiritual freedom. [[Isadora Duncan]] was the first female dancer who argued about “woman of future” and developed novel vector of choreography using [[Nietzsche]]’s idea of “supreme mind in free mind”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nana|first1=Loria|title= Philosophical Context of Contemporary Choreographic Space|journal= EBSCOhost |date=June 30, 2015|volume=11|pages=64–67|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=111021227&amp;site=ehost-live. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers into something that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves. These two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful impulse and dance as a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are the two most important connecting ideas running through any consideration of the subject. In dance, the connection between the two concepts is stronger than in some other arts, and neither can exist without the other.&lt;ref name="mackrell" /&gt;

[[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who practices this art is called a choreographer.

===Music===
{{main|Music}}
Music is an art form which combines [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[rhythm]], and [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic]] in order to create sound. It can be performed using a variety of instruments and styles and is divided into genres such as [[Folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Pop music|pop]], and [[Rock music|rock]], etc. As an art form, music can occur in live or recorded formats, and can be [[Rehearsal|planned]] or [[Musical improvisation|improvised.]]
[[File:Bildhuggarkonst, Sofokles, Nordisk familjebok.png|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Sophocles]], as depicted in the [[Nordisk familjebok]].]] As music is a protean art, it easily co-ordinates with words for songs as physical movements do in dance. Moreover, it has a capability of shaping human behaviors as it impacts our emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epperson|first1=Gordan |title= music |journal= Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|date= April 11, 2016|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/music }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== &lt;!-- "History of the perming arts" redirects to here --&gt;

===History of Western performing arts===
{{main|Western art history}}{{See also|Antitheatricality}}
Starting in the 6th century BC, the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]] of performing art began in [[Greece]], ushered in by the tragic poets such as [[Sophocles]]. These poets wrote plays which, in some cases, incorporated dance (see [[Euripides]]). The [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]] began the widespread use of [[comedy]].

However, by the 6th century AD, Western performing arts had been largely ended, as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] began. Between the 9th century and 14th century, performing art in the West was limited to religious historical enactments and [[morality play]]s, organized by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] in celebration of holy days and other important events.

====Renaissance====
{{main|Renaissance}}

In the 15th century performing arts, along with the arts in general, saw a revival as the Renaissance began in [[Italy]] and spread throughout [[Europe]] plays, some of which incorporated dance, which were performed and [[Domenico da Piacenza]] credited with the first use of the term ''ballo'' (in ''De Arte Saltandi et Choreas Ducendi'') instead of ''danza'' (dance) for his ''baletti'' or ''balli''. The term eventually became ''[[Ballet]]''. The first Ballet ''per se'' is thought to be [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]]'s [[Ballet Comique de la Reine]] (1581).
[[File:Jan Miel – Actors from the Commedia dell’Arte on a Wagon in a Town Square.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[Commedia dell'arte]] troupe on a wagon'', by [[Jan Miel]], 1640]]

By the mid-16th century [[Commedia Dell'arte]] became popular in Europe, introducing the use of [[improvisation]]. This period also introduced the [[Elizabethan masque]], featuring music, dance and elaborate costumes as well as professional theatrical companies in [[England]]. [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays in the late 16th century developed from this new class of professional performance.

In 1597, the first [[opera]], [[Dafne]] was performed and throughout the 17th century, opera would rapidly become the entertainment of choice for the [[aristocracy]] in most of Europe, and eventually for large numbers of people living in cities and towns throughout Europe.

====Modern Era====

The introduction of the [[proscenium arch]] in Italy during the 17th century established the traditional theatre form that persists to this day. Meanwhile, in England, the [[Puritans]] forbade acting, bringing a halt to performing arts that lasted until 1660. After that, women began to appear in both [[French language|French]] and English plays. The French introduced a formal dance instruction in the late 17th century.

It is also during this time that the first plays were performed in the [[American Colonies]].

During the 18th century, the introduction of the popular [[comic opera|opera buffa]] brought opera to the masses as an accessible form of performance. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' are landmarks of the late 18th century opera.

At the turn of the 19th century, [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and the [[Romantic movement]] ushered in a new era that led first to the spectacles of [[grand opera]] and then to the musical dramas of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and the [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] (total work of art) of the operas of [[Richard Wagner]] leading directly to the music of the 20th century.

The 19th century was a period of growth for the performing arts for all social classes, technical advances such as the introduction of [[Gas lighting|gaslight]] to theatres, [[burlesque]], minstrel dancing, and variety theatre. In ballet, women make great progress in the previously male-dominated art.

[[File:Isadora Duncan (grayscale).jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Isadora Duncan]], one of the developers of [[free dance]].]]
[[Modern dance]] began in the late 19th century and early 20th century in response to the restrictions of traditional ballet.

[[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Stanislavski System|"System"]] revolutionized acting in the early 20th century, and continues to have a major influence on actors of stage and screen to the current day. Both [[impressionism]] and modern realism were introduced to the stage during this period.

The arrival of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] (1909–1929) revolutionized ballet and the performing arts generally throughout the Western world, most importantly through Diaghilev's emphasis on collaboration, which brought choreographers, dancers, set designers/artists, composers and musicians together to revitalize and revolutionize ballet. It is extremely complex.

With the invention of the [[film|motion picture]] in the late 19th century by [[Thomas Edison]] and the growth of the [[Cinema of the United States|motion picture industry in Hollywood]] in the early 20th century, film became a dominant performance medium throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.

[[Rhythm and blues]], a cultural phenomenon of black America, became to prominence in the early 20th century; influencing a range of later popular music styles internationally.

In the 1930s [[Jean Rosenthal]] introduced what would become modern [[stage lighting]], changing the nature of the stage as the [[Broadway musical]] became a phenomenon in the United States.

====Post-War performance====
Post-World War II performing arts were highlighted by the resurgence of both ballet and opera in the Western world.

[[File:Street Theatre Show, La Chaux-de-Fonds.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Modern street theatre performance in La Chaux-de-Fonds]]
[[Postmodernism]] in performing arts dominated the 1960s to large extent.

===History of Eastern performing arts===

====Middle East====
The earliest recorded theatrical event dates back to 2000 BC with the [[passion plays]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. This story of the god [[Osiris]] was performed annually at festivals throughout the civilization, marking the known beginning of a long relationship between theatre and religion.

The most popular forms of [[theater]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] were [[puppet]] theatre (which included hand puppets, [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live [[passion play]]s known as ''ta'ziya'', where actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic [[Play (theatre)|plays]] revolved around the ''[[Shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Live secular plays were known as ''akhraja'', recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Moreh |first=Shmuel |authorlink=Shmuel Moreh |contribution=Live Theater in Medieval Islam |title=Studies in Islamic History and Civilization |editor-last=David Ayalon |editor-first=[[Moshe Sharon]] |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |year=1986 |isbn=965-264-014-X |pages=565–601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
In [[Iran]] there are other forms of theatrical events such as ''Naghali'' (story telling), ''ٰRu-Howzi'', ''[[Siah-Bazi]]'', ''Parde-Khani, ''''[[Mareke giri]]''.

====India and Pakistan====
{{main|Theatre in India|Theatre in Pakistan|Sanskrit drama}}

Folk theatre and dramatics can be traced to the religious ritualism of the [[Vedic period|Vedic peoples]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]]. This folk theatre of the misty past was mixed with dance, food, ritualism, plus a depiction of events from daily life. The last element made it the origin of the classical theatre of later times. Many historians, notably D. D. Kosambi, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, Adya Rangacharaya, etc. have referred to the prevalence of ritualism amongst [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes in which some members of the tribe acted as if they were wild animals and some others were the hunters. Those who acted as mammals like goats, buffaloes, reindeer, monkeys, etc. were chased by those playing the role of hunters.

[[Bharata Muni]] (fl. 5th–2nd century BC) was an ancient Indian writer best known for writing the ''[[Natya Shastra of Bharata]]'', a theoretical treatise on Indian performing arts, including [[theatre]], [[dance]], [[acting]], and [[music]], which has been compared to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. Bharata is often known as the father of Indian theatrical arts. His ''Natya Shastra'' seems to be the first attempt to develop the technique or rather art, of drama in a systematic manner. The Natya Shastra tells us not only what is to be portrayed in a drama, but how the portrayal is to be done. Drama, as Bharata Muni says, is the imitation of men and their doings (''loka-vritti''). As men and their doings have to be respected on the stage, so drama in Sanskrit is also known by the term ''roopaka'', which means portrayal.

The ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' can be considered the first recognized plays that originated in India. These epics provided the inspiration to the earliest Indian dramatists and they do it even today. Indian dramatists such as [[Bhāsa]] in the 2nd century BC wrote plays that were heavily inspired by the ''Ramayana'' and ''Mahabharata''.

[[Kālidāsa]] in the 1st century BC, is arguably considered to be ancient [[India]]'s greatest dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram]]'' (''Mālavikā and Agnimitra''), ''[[Vikramōrvaśīyam]]'' (''Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi''), and ''[[The Recognition of Sakuntala|Abhijñānaśākuntala]]'' (''The Recognition of Shakuntala''). The last was inspired by a story in the ''Mahabharata'' and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. In comparison to Bhāsa, who drew heavily from the epics, Kālidāsa can be considered an original [[playwright]].

The next great Indian dramatist was [[Bhavabhuti]] (c. 7th century). He is said to have written the following three plays: ''Malati-Madhava'', ''[[Mahaviracharita]]'' and ''Uttar Ramacharita''. Among these three, the last two cover between them, the entire epic of ''Ramayana''. The powerful Indian emperor [[Harsha]] (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy ''[[Ratnavali]]'', ''[[Priyadarsika]]'', and the [[Buddhist]] drama ''[[Nagananda]]''. Many other dramatists followed during the [[Middle Ages]].

There were many performing art forms in the southern part of India, Kerala is such a state with different such art forms like [[Koodiyattam]], [[Nangyarkoothu]], [[Kathakali]], [[Chakyar koothu]], [[Thirayattam]] and there were many prominent artists like [[Ramanchakyar|Painkulam Raman Chakyar]] and others.

====China====
{{main|Chinese theatre}}

There are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as 1500 BC during the [[Shang Dynasty]]; they often involved music, clowning and acrobatic displays.

The Tang dynasty is sometimes known as "The Age of 1000 Entertainments". During this era, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang China|Emperor Xuanzong]] formed an acting school known as the Children of the [[Pear Garden]] to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical.

During the Han Dynasty, [[shadow puppetry]] first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Cantonese southern and Pekingese northern. The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather that created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather usually taken from the belly of a donkey. They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods that controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the 11th century before becoming a tool of the government.

In the [[Song dynasty]], there were many popular plays involving [[acrobatic]]s and [[music]]. These developed in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] into a more sophisticated form with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, the best known of which is Beijing Opera, which is still popular today.

====Thailand====
{{further|Ramakien}}
[[File:WatPhraKeaw Ramayana Chariot.JPG|thumb|[[Hanuman]] on his chariot, a scene from the [[Ramakien]] in [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Bangkok]]]]

In [[Thailand]], it has been a tradition from the Middle Ages to stage plays based on plots drawn from Indian epics. In particular, the theatrical version of Thailand's national epic ''[[Ramakien]]'', a version of the Indian ''[[Ramayana]]'', remains popular in Thailand even today.

====Cambodia====
In [[Cambodia]], at the ancient capital [[Angkor Wat]], stories from the Indian epics ''Ramayana'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' have been carved on the walls of temples and palaces. Similar reliefs are found at [[Borobudur]] in [[Indonesia]].

====Japan====
{{main|Noh|Bunraku|Kabuki|Butoh}}

During the 14th century, there were small companies of actors in Japan who performed short, sometimes vulgar comedies. A director of one of these companies, Kan'ami (1333–1384), had a son, [[Zeami Motokiyo]] (1363–1443) who was considered one of the finest child actors in Japan. When Kan'ami's company performed for [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] (1358–1408), the Shogun of Japan, he implored Zeami to have a court education for his arts. After Zeami succeeded his father, he continued to perform and adapt his style into what is today [[Noh]]. A mixture of [[pantomime]] and vocal acrobatics, this style has fascinated the Japanese for hundreds of years.

Japan, after a long period of civil wars and political disarray, was unified and at peace primarily due to shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu (1600–1668). However, alarmed at increasing Christian growth, he cut off contact from Japan to Europe and China and outlawed Christianity. When peace did come, a flourish of cultural influence and growing merchant class demanded its own entertainment. The first form of theatre to flourish was Ningyō jōruri (commonly referred to as [[Bunraku]]). The founder of and main contributor to Ningyō jōruri, [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653–1725), turned his form of theatre into a true art form. Ningyō jōruri is a highly stylized form of theatre using puppets, today about 1/3d the size of a human. The men who control the puppets train their entire lives to become master puppeteers, when they can then operate the puppet's head and right arm and choose to show their faces during the performance. The other puppeteers, controlling the less important limbs of the puppet, cover themselves and their faces in a black suit, to imply their invisibility. The dialogue is handled by a single person, who uses varied tones of voice and speaking manners to simulate different characters. Chikamatsu wrote thousands of plays during his lifetime, most of which are still used today.

Kabuki began shortly after Bunraku, legend has it by an actress named Okuni, who lived around the end of the 16th century. Most of Kabuki's material came from Nõ and Bunraku, and its erratic dance-type movements are also an effect of Bunraku. However, Kabuki is less formal and more distant than Nõ, yet very popular among the Japanese public. Actors are trained in many varied things including dancing, singing, pantomime, and even acrobatics. Kabuki was first performed by young girls, then by young boys, and by the end of the 16th century, Kabuki companies consisted of all men. The men who portrayed women on stage were specifically trained to elicit the essence of a woman in their subtle movements and gestures.

==Heart rate during performances==
During different types of performances, the heart rate varies significantly. For example, studies have been done that show that [[heart rate]] varies throughout the different stages of a speech, which include leading up to a speaking role (the highest heart rate occurs during this stage), during the speaking role, and after the [[speaking]] role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=Sandra|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and Size of Audience on Heart-Rate Changes During Short Impromptu Speeches|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1980|volume=46|pages=123–130|doi=10.2466/pr0.1980.46.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar changes in heart rate also occur during [[acting]], relating to [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. The high heart rates can be attributed to the stress caused by anticipation. During a [[performance]] with an [[audience]], the actor experiences high levels of stress throughout the performance, as it pushes the [[actor]]s mentally. However, this stress helps the actor have a stronger performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Konijn|first1=Elly|title=Psychology and Performing Arts|date=1991|publisher=Sweets and Zeitlinger|isbn=9026511191|pages=59–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar changes in heart rate occur for [[musician]]s during their performance. Though their heart rate is highest while they are musically performing, their heart rate is higher during the pre-performance phase, than during the post-performance phase, which is attributed to the stress caused by [[anticipation]]. The anticipation leading up to a performance, causes heart rate to increase, while the relief after a performance, causes the heart rate to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Studer|first1=Regina Katharina|title=Psychophysiological Activation During Preparation, Performance, and Recovery in High- and Low-Anxious Music Students|journal=Apple Psychophyiol Biofeedback|date=January 30, 2014|volume=39|pages=45–57|doi=10.1007/s10484-014-9240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''plot device''', or '''plot mechanism''', {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} is any [[narrative technique|technique]] in a [[narrative]] used to move the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Pfeil|title=Another Tale to Tell: Politics and Narrative in Postmodern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18mRgWs-ptEC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-992-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the [[suspension of disbelief]]. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Examples of stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the [[Indiana Jones]] film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he is trying to retrieve the [[Ark of the Covenant]]; in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Jones is on a search for the [[Holy Grail]]. This plot device is also used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The City of Brass]]," in which a group of travelers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition journeys across the [[Sahara]] to find a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=148–9 &amp; 217–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books in the [[Harry Potter]] series orient around a certain object. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry believes there is a magical stone in [[Hogwarts]] with special powers. [[Lord Voldemort]] needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.

The [[One Ring]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] puts it: "Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

=== The MacGuffin ===
{{main|MacGuffin}}
A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by [[film director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]], referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=MacGuffin+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=MacGuffin%20definition&amp;f=false | title = A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense | isbn = 9780810863897 | last1 = McDevitt | first1 = Jim | last2 = Juan | first2 = Eric San | date = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, "In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/MacGuffin

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from [[The Lord of the Rings]]), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as ''plot coupons'' (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to "collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a [[dénouement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Mark | edition = illustrated | year = 2007 | title = Designing character-based console games | publisher = | page = 69 | isbn = 1584505214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]]|title=The Well-tempered Plot Device|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html}}''In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deus ex machina ===
{{main|Deus ex machina}}
The term ''deus ex machina'' is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina |title=deus ex machina |work=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase "[[deus]] ex machina" has its origins in the conventions of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy, and refers to situations in which a [[mechane]] (crane) was used to lower actors playing a [[god]] or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]] is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions.{{which | date = July 2013}} In the end, though, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a ''deus ex machina'' is [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D7eOal3UhFcC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Deus+ex+machina%22+gandalf+the+hobbit | title = Tolkien's Art: A Mythology for England | isbn = 0813138094 | last1 = Chance | first1 = Jane | date = 2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Shoulder angel ===
{{main|Shoulder angel}}
A shoulder angel is a plot device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyYGbs_QLioC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Shoulder+angel%22+fiction | title = Hatch's Plotbank | date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see [[Left-handedness#Negative associations of language|Negative associations of left-handedness in language]]). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] in [[Psychoanalysis]], with the person in the center of the dispute being the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] between the [[super-ego]] Angel and the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] Devil.

=== Red herring ===
{{main|Red herring}}
The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in [[whodunit]]s, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.

=== Plot voucher ===
{{See also|Chekhov's gun}}

A ''plot voucher'', as defined by Nick Lowe,&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

'''Real time''' within the media is a method where events are portrayed at the same rate at which the characters experience them. For example, if a movie told in real time is two hours long, then the plot of that movie covers two hours of fictional time. If a daily real-time comic strip runs for six years, then the characters will be six years older at the end of the strip than they were at the beginning. This technique can be enforced with varying levels of precision. In some stories, every minute of screen time is a minute of fictional time. In other stories, such as the daily comic strip ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', each day's strip does not necessarily correspond to a new day of fictional time, but each year of the strip does correspond to one year of fictional time.

Real time fiction dates back to the climactic structure of classical [[Greek drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://department.monm.edu/cata/rankin/classes/cata171/lectures/chapter15.htm  "Dramatic Structure: Climactic, Episodic, and Other Forms", Monmouth College, IL]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==
Often, use of [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screens]] or [[picture-in-picture]]s are used to show events occurring at the same time, or the context in which various [[subplot]]s are affecting each other. Examples include the television series ''[[24 (television)|24]]'' and films ''[[Timecode (film)|Timecode]]'' and ''[[Phone Booth (film)|Phone Booth]]''. On-screen clocks are often used to remind the audience of the real-time presentation.

==Video games==
In a real-time computer game or simulation, events in the game occur at the same rate as the events which are being depicted. For instance, in a real-time combat game, in one hour of play the game depicts one hour of combat.

*''[[Titanic: Adventure Out of Time]]

==Comic books and strips==
In [[comic books]], the use of real time is made more complicated by the fact that most serial comics are released on a monthly basis and are traditionally 20 to 30 pages long, making it difficult to tell a story set in real time without overlooking important events from one month to the next. Another explanation is the prevalence of the [[super-hero]] genre in American comics, and the [[iconic]] status attached to such characters : it is often considered that such mythological, sometimes godlike heroes cannot age in real time without losing the characteristics that make them special. Hence the more common use of [[floating timeline]]s in [[Marvel Comics]] or [[DC Comics]]. Exceptions include [[Marvel Comics]]' [[New Universe]] line of books, [[Erik Larsen]]'s long-running ''[[Savage Dragon]]'' ongoing series, [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s ''[[Superman &amp; Batman: Generations]]'' (three non-canon miniseries exploring the notion of "what if Superman and Batman could age?"), and [[Ben Dunn]]'s ''[[Ninja High School]]''.

Comic strips which feature characters aging in real-time include:

* ''[[Ninja High School]]''
* ''[[Hellblazer]]'' John Constantine's events take place within an "active continuity".
* ''[[Superman &amp; Batman: Generations]]''
* ''[[Savage Dragon]]''
* ''[[New Universe]]'' (Marvel Comics imprint, 1986–1989)
* ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' A weekly comic book series by [[DC Comics]]
* ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' (Characters have aged in real-time since the series started in 1977)
* ''[[Gasoline Alley]]'' (Characters have grown up, aged and died in real time since the 1920s)
* ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'' (for its first 28 years of existence)
* ''[[Doonesbury]]'' (Characters age in real-time and interact with real history)
* ''[[Constantine (comics)|Constantine]]''

==Novels==
In the [[Inspector Rebus]] series of detective novels (17 as of 2010) by the Scottish writer [[Ian Rankin]], characters age in step with the publication date. Rebus is stated to have been born in 1947; in the 2007 novel ''[[Exit Music]]'' he reached 60, and retired.

The [[Mandie]] series of children's mystery novels by [[Lois Gladys Leppard]] are exactly one hundred years from the present real time and ended by the eighteenth year (or one hundred and eighteenth year) of the main protagonist in 2006 at the reader's end of childhood and adolescence.

In ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' the entire story takes place in real time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5966">[[File:Nazimova A doll's house.jpg|thumb|Scene from ''A Doll's House'', a 1922 silent film starring Alla Nazimova and Alan Hale, Sr. The author of the original play, [[Henrik Ibsen]], was an influential exponent of realism in the theatre.]]'''Realism''' in the [[theatre]] was a general [[Art movement|movement]] that began in the [[Nineteenth-century theatre|19th-century theatre]], around the 1870s, and remained present through much of the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]]. It developed a set of dramatic and theatrical [[Dramatic convention|conventions]] with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of [[Realism (arts)|a broader artistic movement]], it includes [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]] and [[Socialist realism]].

Russia's first professional playwright, [[Aleksey Pisemsky]], along with [[Leo Tolstoy]] (in his ''[[The Power of Darkness]]'' of 1886), began a tradition of psychological realism in Russia. A new type of acting was required to replace the declamatory conventions of the [[well-made play]] with a technique capable of conveying the speech and movements found in the domestic situations of [[everyday life]]. This need was supplied by the innovations of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]], founded by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]].&lt;ref name=HartnollFound2003&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Hartnoll, Phyllis |editor2=Found, Peter |title=The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre| year=2003| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0-19-282574-7 | pages=341, 409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the subtle expression of emotion in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' through everyday small-talk had initially gone unappreciated in a more traditionally conventional production in St Petersburg, a new staging by the Moscow Art Theatre brought the play and its author, as well as the company, immediate success.&lt;ref name=Esslin-2003&gt;Esslin (2003), pp. 353-356&lt;/ref&gt; A logical development was to take the revolt against theatrical artifice a step further in the direction of naturalism, and Stanislavski, especially in his production of [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''[[The Lower Depths]]'', helped this movement achieve international recognition.&lt;ref name=HartnollFound2003/&gt; The Moscow Art Theatre's ground-breaking productions of plays by Chekhov, such as ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', in turn influenced [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]. Stanislavski went on to develop his 'system', a form of [[actor training]] that is particularly well-suited to psychological realism.

19th-century realism is closely connected to the development of modern drama, which, as Martin Harrison explains, "is usually said to have begun in the early 1870s" with the "middle-period" work of the Norwegian dramatist [[Henrik Ibsen]]. Ibsen's realistic drama in prose has been "enormously influential."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison (1998), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[opera]], ''[[verismo]]'' refers to a post-Romantic Italian tradition that sought to incorporate the Naturalism of Émile Zola and Henrik Ibsen. It included realistic – sometimes sordid or violent – depictions of contemporary everyday life, especially the life of the lower classes. 

== Added to Realism ==
3D details were added by 1800. By 1850 settings, costumes and details became historically accurate and had more logic to the plays.

==Stanislavski's distinction==
As part of a strategic argument in his day, Stanislavski used the term "psychological realism" to distinguish his [[Stanislavski's system|'system']] of acting from his own [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalistic]] early stagings of the plays of [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Maxim Gorky]], and others. Jean Benedetti argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Naturalism, for him, implied the indiscriminate reproduction of the surface of life. Realism, on the other hand, while taking its material from the real world and from direct observation, selected only those elements which revealed the relationships and tendencies under the surface. The rest was discarded.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (2005), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As used in critical literature today, however, the term Naturalism has a broader scope than that, within which all of Stanislavski's work falls. In this broader sense, Naturalism or "psychological realism" is distinct both from [[Socialist realism]] and the critical realism developed by the [[epic theatre]] of [[Bertolt Brecht]].

A '''revivalist artist''' or '''revivalist band''' is a musical group, singer, or musician dedicated to reviving interest in a musical genre from an earlier era.

Such performers are usually dedicated enthusiasts of a particular musical genre – often a style that is no longer in vogue – and act as evangelists to spread awareness and appreciation of that music to new audiences. Most such acts do this by live performances at a variety of venues.

Unlike [[tribute act]]s who are usually dedicated to recreating material associated with just one primary artist (such as [[Elvis Presley]] or [[The Beatles]]) as a nostalgic entertainment, revivalist artists tend to draw on material from a wide range of artists and writers from the chosen musical genre.

Unlike [[cover band]]s who are primarily populist entertainers playing [[cover versions]] of popular hit songs to satisfy audience enjoyment of familiar music, revivalist artists usually see themselves as performers with a musical mission to revive a cherished genre. They often draw from a much broader repertoire of music than just the obvious hit songs of an era.  Sometimes the mission includes drawing the audience's attention to forgotten or overlooked songs from the genre as well as the better-known hits.

Most revivalist artists focus on performing material only from the original era that they are reviving. They replenish their repertoire by digging deeper in the catalogue of music from their chosen genre.  Some artists eventually aspire to write new material in a similar style and become known for their own compositions.

==List of notable revivalist artists==

* [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] - performed historic and regional American music in his natural baritone, in addition to novelty songs sung falsetto

[[File:The Three Bears - Project Gutenberg eText 17034.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Story of the Three Bears|The Three Bears]]]]

The '''rule of three''' is a [[writing]] principle that suggests that a [[wiktionary:trio|trio]] of events or characters is more humorous, satisfying, or effective than other numbers in execution of the story and engaging the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Use the "Rule of Three" to Create Engaging Content - Copyblogger|url = http://www.copyblogger.com/rule-of-three/|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reader or audience of this form of text is also thereby more likely to remember the information conveyed. This is because having three entities combines both brevity and rhythm with having the smallest amount of information to create a pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the mysterious ‘Rule of Three’? {{!}} Copywriters of Distinction|url = http://rule-of-three.co.uk/what-is-the-rule-of-three-copywriting/|website = rule-of-three.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonathan crossfield"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Writing: The power of three|url = http://www.jonathancrossfield.com/blog/2009/06/writing-the-power-of-three.html|website = www.jonathancrossfield.com|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes the author or speaker appear knowledgeable while being both simple and catchy.

Slogans, film titles and a variety of other things have been structured in threes, a tradition that grew out of oral storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.toastmasters.org/~/media/258B5612D2D547DBA5C95D1890972E70.ashx|title = Toastmasters, November 2013|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Toastmaster|last = |first = |page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Three Little Pigs]], [[Three Billy Goats Gruff]], and the [[Three Musketeers]]. Similarly, adjectives are often grouped in threes to emphasize an idea.

The [[Latin]] phrase ''"omne trium perfectum"'' (everything that comes in threes is perfect, or, every set of three is complete) conveys the same idea as the rule of three.

== Meaning ==
The rule of three can refer to a collection of three words, phrases, sentences, lines, paragraphs/stanzas, chapters/sections of writing and even whole books.&lt;ref name="Jonathan crossfield" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Do You Use The Rhetorical "Rule of Three"?|url = https://atcounseltable.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/do-you-use-the-rhetorical-rule-of-three/|website = At Counsel Table|accessdate = 2015-06-05|first = Alex|last = Craigie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three elements together are known as a '''triad'''.&lt;ref name="sixminutes dlugan"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Use the Rule of Three in Your Speeches|url = http://sixminutes.dlugan.com/rule-of-three-speeches-public-speaking/#more-440|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique may be used not just in prose but [[poetry]], oral storytelling, films and [[advertising]]. In photography, the [[rule of thirds]] produces a similar effect by dividing an image into three vertically and horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rule of Thirds - Digital Photography School|url = http://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Isocolon|tricolon]] is a more specific use of the rule of three where three words or phrases are equal in length and grammatical form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = One, Two, Three: What Is a Tricolon?|url = http://grammar.about.com/od/rhetoricstyle/a/tricolon3.htm|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hendiatris]] is a figure of speech where three successive words are used to express a single central idea.&lt;ref name="sixminutes dlugan"/&gt; As a slogan or motto, this is known as a '''tripartite motto'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ODLT dictionary definition of Tripartite motto|url = http://www.odlt.org/ballast/tripartite_motto.html|website = www.odlt.org|accessdate = 2015-06-05|first = Blair|last = Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Slogans and catchphrases ==
Many advertising campaigns and public information slogans use the technique to create a catchy, memorable way of displaying information. In marketing theory, American advertising and sales pioneer St. Elmo Lewis laid out his three chief copywriting principles, which he felt were crucial for effective advertising:

''"The mission of an advertisement is to attract a reader so that he will look at the advertisement and start to read it; then to interest him, so that he will continue to read it; then to convince him, so that when he has read it he will believe it. If an advertisement contains these three qualities of success, it is a successful advertisement."''{{Citation needed|date = September 2016}}

Better-known examples include:
* [[Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness]] – Rights outlined in ''[[The Declaration of Independence]]''
* [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Slogan of the French Republic|url = http://www.france.fr/en/institutions-and-values/slogan-french-republic.html|accessdate = 2015-06-01|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150512230857/http://www.france.fr/en/institutions-and-values/slogan-french-republic.html|archivedate = 2015-05-12|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; – The slogan of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] predating 1790

==Comedy==
In comedy, it is also called a ''comic triple''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Rule of Three and the Comic Triple {{!}} Critique Circle|url = http://www.critiquecircle.com/blog.asp?blogID=132|website = Critique Circle|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third element is often used to create an effect of surprise with an audience, especially if it differs from the first two.&lt;ref name="Jonathan crossfield" /&gt; For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals—such as [[an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]]; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead—where the surprise or punchline of the joke comes from the third character.

==Fairy tales==
{{cleanup list|date=August 2012}}
In [[storytelling]], authors often create triplets or structures in three parts. In its simplest form, this is merely ''beginning, middle, and end'', from [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]. [[Syd Field]] wrote a popular handbook of [[screenwriting]], in which he touted the advantages of [[three-act structure]] over the more traditional [[Act (drama)|five-act structure]] used by [[William Shakespeare]] and many other famous playwrights.

[[File:Franz Jüttner Schneewittchen 4.jpg|thumb|[[Snow White]] receives three visits from her wicked stepmother]]

[[Vladimir Propp]], in his ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', concluded that any of the elements in a folktale could be negated twice so that it would repeat thrice.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, Vladimir. ''Morphology of the Folk Tale''. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1968, p. 74, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is common not only in the Russian tales he studied but throughout [[Folklore|folk tales]] and [[fairy tale]]s: most commonly, perhaps, in that the [[youngest son]] is usually the third, although fairy tales often display the rule of three in the most blatant form. A small sample of the latter includes:
* [[Rumpelstiltskin]] spins thrice for the heroine and lets her guess his name thrice over a period of three days.
* In ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'', the heroine receives three gifts while she is searching for her lost husband; when she finds where he is prisoner, she must use them to thrice bribe her way to the hero (the first two times she was unable to tell her story because he lay in a drugged sleep).
* In ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', Brother is transformed into a deer when he drinks from the third stream that their wicked stepmother enchanted, and when Sister is killed by the same stepmother, she visits her child's room thrice, being caught and restored the third time.
* In ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', a woman says she will bear the king three marvelous children; when they reappear, their envious aunts attempt to kill them by sending them on three quests, after the three marvelous things of the title.
* In ''[[The Silent Princess]]'', a prince breaks a peasant woman's pitcher thrice, and is cursed; when he finds the title princess, he must persuade her to speak thrice.
* In ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love for Three Oranges]]'', the hero picks three magical oranges, and only with the third is he able to keep the woman who springs out of it.

==Literature==
* In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', [[Jacob Marley|Marley]]'s Ghost tells [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] he will receive visits from three spirits: [[The Ghost of Christmas Past]], [[The Ghost of Christmas Present]], and finally [[The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], to which Scrooge says, "Spirit, I fear you most of all."
* In the musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', [[Tevye]] must give his three eldest daughters away, one after another. Each match progressively challenges his faith, as represented by a monologue in which he argues with himself using the phrase "on the other hand" to play the [[devil's advocate]] and convince himself to side with his daughters. This is subverted with the youngest daughter who wishes to marry a [[Gentile]], for which Tevye concludes that "No, there is no other hand."
* In [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar]]'', [[Mark Antony]] starts his speech by using the rule of three: [[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears]], to which the commoners start to listen.

==Rhetoric and public speaking==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}

The use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory. Max Atkinson, in his book on oratory entitled ''Our Masters' Voices'',&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, J. Maxwell. ''Our Masters' Voices: The Language and Body Language of Politics''. London: Methuen, 1984. {{ISBN|0-416-37690-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives interesting examples of how public speakers use three-part phrases to generate what he calls 'claptraps', evoking audience applause.

[[Martin Luther King Jr.]], the civil rights activist and preacher, was known for his uses of tripling and the rule of three throughout his many influential speeches. For example, the speech "Non-Violence and Racial Justice" contained a binary opposition made up of the rule of three: "insult, injustice and exploitation", followed a few lines later by "justice, good will, and brotherhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Nonviolence and Racial Justice |url = http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/6-Feb-1957_NonviolenceAndRacialJustice.pdf|website = www.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, segregationist Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] inveighed: "segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever" during his [[George Wallace's 1963 Inaugural Address|1963 inaugural address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Inaugural Address (1963) The "Segregation Now, Segregation Forever" Speech |author=Governor George Wallace of Alabama |url = http://web.utk.edu/~mfitzge1/docs/374/wallace_seg63.pdf|website = web.utk.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal of the three-fold pattern is also illustrated by the transformation of [[Winston Churchill]]'s reference to "[[blood, toil, tears and sweat]]" (echoing [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) in popular recollection to "blood, sweat and tears".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat|url = http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/92-blood-toil-tears-and-sweat|website = www.winstonchurchill.org|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Presentation Skills 3. The Rule of Three|url = http://www.presentationmagazine.com/presentation-skills-3-the-rule-of-three-7283.htm|website = www.presentationmagazine.com|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Thomas Hobbes' ''Leviathan'' describes the importance of community, without which life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". This has been reduced to the commonly heard triad "nasty, brutish and short".

The [[Welsh Triads]] and [[Triads of Ireland|Irish Triads]] suggest the use of three's was also a mnemonic device—easy-to-learn verses that were pointers to other information also committed to memory by Druids.

==Law==
A common feature of legal documents which give property or grant rights as drafted by legal professionals perpetuates old English practice in which the rule of three echoes the intended Act by the varying restatement of the act in triplicate.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}} For example, in a Will or Trust instrument the phrase "I give, devise and bequeath ..."

Usually (in court) a common example is quoted: "tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = N.D.R.Ct. 6.10 Courtroom Oaths|url = http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/rules/ndroc/rule6.10.htm|website = www.ndcourts.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9292">A '''shtick''' ({{lang-yi|'''שטיק'''}}, the closely related German word ''Stück'' sounds similar, yet it is not used in the same way as the English "thing") is a comic theme or [[gimmick]] derived from the [[Yiddish]] word ''shtik'' (שטיק), meaning "piece" (in stand-up comedy a near equivalent term is a "bit"). The English word for "piece" or "thing" is sometimes used in a similar context. Another variant is "bits of business" or just "bits". ''Shtick'' may refer to an adopted persona, usually for comedy performances, that is maintained consistently (though not necessarily exclusively) across the performer's career. In this usage, the recurring personalities adopted by Laurel and Hardy through all of their many comedy films (although they often played characters with different names and occupations) would qualify as their shtick. A comedian might maintain several different shticks of this sort, particularly if appearing in a variety show encouraging development of multiple characters, such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. 

In common usage, the word ''shtick'' has also come to mean any talent, style, habit, or other eccentricity for which a person is particularly well-known, even if not intended for comedic purposes. For example, a person who is known locally for an ability to eat dozens of hot dogs quickly might say that it was his shtick. Among [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], "shtick" can also refer to [[Jewish wedding#Special dances|wedding shtick]], in which wedding guests entertain the bride and groom through dancing, costumes, juggling, and silliness.

Because of its roots in show business, ''shtick'' has taken on connotation of a contrived and often used act. For this reason, journalists and commentators often apply the word disparagingly to stock replies from politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, Michael D. ''[http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/07/the_white_stripes_and_their_on.html  The White Stripes and Their One-Note Shtick]'', ''[http://nymag.com/  New York Magazine]'', July 18, 2007. Retrieved January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
*[[Jack Benny]]'s character on his radio program was notoriously both stingy and a bad violin player, as well as being perpetually 39 years old.  In real life, Benny was known as a competent [[violin]]ist and lavish tipper, and kept celebrating his 39th birthday each year publicly because "there's nothing funny about 40".
*Three of the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]], [[Chico Marx|Chico]] and [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]], had well-honed shticks by the time they started making movies.
**Groucho, with his stooped walk, greasepaint moustache, [[lascivious]] eyebrow raising, and his cigar;
**Chico, with his fake [[Italian language|Italian]] [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], his "shooting the keys" style of piano playing, and borderline moronic behavior; and
**Harpo, with his [[Mime artist|pantomime]] routines, the [[Magic satchel#In films|seemingly bottomless pockets]] of his [[trench coat]], and his ability to play the [[harp]].
** The fourth performing brother, [[Zeppo Marx|Zeppo]], never developed a shtick and was a straight man in their movies — though some have argued that blandness and "normality" was indeed his shtick.
*[[W.C. Fields]] nurtured a character that was not far from himself in real life, being misanthropic, misogynistic, and a hard drinker, as well as the unique bellow of his voice and his famous bulbous nose.
*Many of the performers over the course of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s long broadcast history have developed shticks that were popular enough to be developed into feature films. The earliest of these was ''[[The Blues Brothers]]'', the dark-suited alter egos of [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]], which spawned two movies and several actual blues albums. Of the movies that followed in later years, some met with similar success (such as [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]' ''[[Wayne's World]]''), while others are regarded as critical and commercial disasters ([[Julia Sweeney]]'s ''[[It's Pat]]''!).
*[[Henny Youngman]]'s standard line "Take my wife&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; please!" was part of his schtick. It consisted of several [[One-liner joke|one-liners]] delivered in rapid-fire sequence.
*[[Johnny Carson]]'s many shticks include his role as "[[Carnac the Magnificent]]", an [[India]]n [[fortune teller]] who could divine answers to questions sealed in envelopes and "kept in a [[Hermetic seal|hermetically sealed]] [[mayonnaise]] jar on the front porch of [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]] since noon today". His signature imaginary golf swing at the end of his [[monologue]] would also qualify.
*[[Chris Berman]]'s shtick in his [[ESPN]] commentary was his tendency to give additional [[nickname]]s to players based on their last names (often intended as [[pun]]s or [[popular culture|pop culture]] references). Berman was also known to often say a football player "could&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; go&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; all&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; way" on long [[touchdown]] plays (parodying [[Howard Cosell]]'s delivery).
*Comedian [[George Carlin]] created a famously banned shtick, "[[Filthy Words]]", a/k/a "Seven dirty words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/filthywords.html |title=George Carlin, Filthy Words |website=Exploring Constitutional Conflicts |quote=The following is a verbatim transcript of "Filthy Words" (the George Carlin monologue at issue in the Supreme Court case of FCC v. Pacifica Foundation) prepared by the Federal Communications Commission... |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Andrew Dice Clay]]'s shtick in his comedy routines is his crude, [[misogynist]] themed humor, and sometimes vulgar reinterpretations of [[nursery rhymes]].
*[[Rodney Dangerfield]]'s shtick was centered around his famous [[catchphrase]], "I don't get no respect," accompanied by his characteristic facial gesture and yanking or straightening his scarlet necktie.
*[[Stephen Colbert]] has referred to [[Stephen Colbert (character)|his character]] as a shtick.
*[[Andy Kaufman]] was a particularly rigorous practitioner of shtick. Kaufman almost never appeared in public, other than as one of his shtick characters, such as "Foreign Man" or [[Tony Clifton]]. When he did appear as himself, he still acted out some shtick routine, with one notable example being a long-running [[professional wrestling]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#F|feud]] with [[Jerry Lawler]].
*[[The Rubberbandits]] are Irish comedians who wear plastic bags over their faces as shtick.
*[[Yakov Smirnoff]]'s shtick, at the height of his career, involved comparisons between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], punctuated by the catchprase "What a country!".
*[[Lewis Black]]'s shtick is the crescendo of rage upon which his routines are built; another is bewailing the rise in his blood pressure due to the presumed strain of these outbursts.
*[[Sam Kinison]]'s shtick was his increasingly emotional, high-stress vocal delivery, often leading to actual shouting or screaming, to the point where his voice became hoarse.
*[[Bob Newhart]]'s shtick is his long phone calls with imaginary or historical persons. Hearing only Newhart's [[deadpan]] comments, the audience is left to infer what the other person is saying.&lt;ref name=NewhartNYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Zinoman |first=Jason |title=No Real Hurry to Tell the Joke: Bob Newhart, Master of the One-Sided Conversation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/arts/television/bob-newhart-master-of-the-one-sided-conversation.html |website=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=30 October 2014 |date=May 26, 2014 |quote=Mr. Newhart became famous through stand-up routines that were one-sided telephone conversations in which his comic partner was neither seen nor heard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*All original members of [[The Wiggles]] were known for having schticks. [[Jeff Fatt]]'s was [[narcolepsy|falling asleep at odd times]], leading the other Wiggles and the audience to call out the [[catchphrase]] "[[Wake up Jeff|Wake Up Jeff!]]", [[Anthony Field]]'s was eating too much food, [[Greg Page (musician)|Greg Page]]'s was doing [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] tricks, and [[Murray Cook]]'s was an obsession with playing the [[guitar]].
*[[Penn and Teller]]'s shtick focuses mainly on which part of the duo does the talking; Penn provides the only on-stage narration and is the only public voice of the act, whereas Teller never speaks on stage or on camera. In on-camera interviews, Teller remains in shadow, and in rare circumstances when Teller speaks on-stage, his face is obscured.
*[[Gilbert Gottfried]]'s stage persona, with his perpetually high-pitched squeaky voice and pinched face, is a shtick that has been maintained through almost all of his public appearances and television and film roles.
*[[Larry the Cable Guy]]'s stage persona, developed during his days as a member of a morning radio zoo crew, is considered a shtick. Despite his public appearances as a hillbilly with a deep Southern accent, propensity for wearing sleeveless flannel shirts and his signature "Git-R-Done!" catchphrase, the comedian, whose real name is Daniel Whitney, is a native of Nebraska.

A '''supporting character''' is a [[fictional character|character]] in a [[narrative]] that is not the focus of the primary [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]], but appears or is mentioned in the story enough to be more than just a minor character or a [[cameo appearance]]. Sometimes, supporting characters may develop a complex [[back-story]] of their own, but this is usually in relation to the main character, rather than entirely independently. In television, supporting characters may appear in more than half of the episodes per season.

In some cases, especially in ongoing material such as comic books and television series, supporting characters themselves may become main characters in a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] if they are sufficiently popular with fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=THR|title=6 Characters Who Became the Stars of Their Own Spinoff Films|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/minions-5-character-spinoff-films-808201|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tickle Me Elmo''' is a children's [[plush toy]] from Tyco Preschool, a division of [[Tyco Toys]], of the [[The Muppets|Muppet]] character [[Elmo]] from the children's television show, [[Sesame Street]]. When squeezed, Elmo shakes, vibrates, and recites his trademark giggle, "Uh-ha-ha-ha-hee-hee!".

The toy was first produced in the United States in 1996 and slowly became a [[fad|fad toy]]. Some instances of violence were reported over the limited supply amidst heavy consumer demand. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' reported that the toy which retailed for $28.99 according to its [[MSRP]], had been advertised in newspapers and on the Internet, with sellers asking up to $1,500 by the end of 1997.&lt;ref name=People/&gt;

== Development ==
"Tickles The Chimp", the precursor to Tickle Me Elmo, was invented by Greg Hyman and Ron Dubren, who were known in the toy indusry for having had invented Alphie the Robot (a children's learning computer) several years prior.&lt;ref name="chimp"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-12-10/news/9612100178_1_elmo-tickle-sesame-street-character | title=Toy Creator Unwraps Story Of Success | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=December 10, 1996 | accessdate=30 July 2014 | author=Black, Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 it was presented to Tyco Preschool as "Tickles The Chimp," which was a toy monkey with a computer chip which laughed when tickled. At the time Tyco didn't have rights to make ''Sesame Street'' plush, but did have ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' plush rights so it was worked on for several months as Tickle Me [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], they also made Tickle Me versions of baby [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Tweety]], they successfully sold it at WB Studio Store in California. They are on Ebay and Amazon too. A short time later, Tyco lost rights to do ''Looney Tunes'' but gained the rights to ''Sesame Street,'' thus starting Tickle Me Elmo.  The invention was originally introduced under [[Cabbage Patch Kids|Cabbage Patch]] at [[Hasbro]] Industries.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Neil Friedman, who was then president of Tyco Preschool, recalled years later that, "When you played with [Tickle Me Elmo] for the first time, it brought a smile to everyone's face. It was a magical surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwood|first=Chelsea|year=2009|title=Child's Play: Mattel's Neil Friedman Has Built a Career out of Toying Around—And Making Kids Smile|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-203927063|others={{subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}|journal=[[Success (magazine)|Success]]|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1996 Elmo craze==
Tickle Me Elmo was released in July 1996, with a supply of 400,000 units.&lt;!---&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt;---&gt; The dolls sold well and remained widely available in stores until the  [[Black Friday (shopping)|day after Thanksgiving]], when they suddenly sold out.&lt;!---&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt;---&gt; With the [[Economics of Christmas|Christmas shopping season]] approaching, Tyco Preschool ordered 600,000 more dolls from their suppliers.&lt;ref name="desperate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baca|first=Maria Elena|date=10 December 1996|title=Desperate shoppers not laughing at Tickle Me Elmo|newspaper=Star Tribune|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62644967.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion was helped by [[Rosie O'Donnell]], who had shown the toy on [[The Rosie O'Donnell Show|her popular TV show]] in early October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cummins|first=H.

The scarcity of the new toy provoked a "shopping frenzy".&lt;ref name="frenzy"/&gt; Two women were arrested in [[Chicago]] for fighting over the doll,&lt;ref name="desperate"/&gt; while in [[New York City|New York]] some people ran after delivery trucks hoping to get their hands on Elmo before it reached stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Riddell|first=Mary|date=20 December 1996|title=Spend!

==Further Tickle Me toys==
In early 1997, Tyco released new "Tickle Me" toys based on other characters from ''[[Sesame Street]]'' – first ''Tickle Me Ernie'' and ''Tickle Me Big Bird'', then ''Tickle Me Cookie Monster'' – but despite good sales, none of these toys achieved as much fame as Tickle Me Elmo.&lt;ref name="hot toy"/&gt; With the re-release of Tickle Me Elmo, ''Mini Tickle Me Cookie Monster'' and ''Mini Tickle Me Ernie'' were also put on the market.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The "Surprise Edition" of Tickle Me Elmo, issued fall 2001, was an elaborate contest. Five of the "Surprise Edition" Elmos stopped laughing on January 9, 2002, and instead announced to the people squeezing them that they had won a prize. The grand prize was $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Katie|date=11 October 2001|title=Elmo's Worth More Than a Tickle|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|url=https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,47368,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TMX===
In 2006 for the tenth anniversary of Tickle Me Elmo, [[Fisher-Price]] released a new Elmo doll called ''TMX'', meaning "Tickle Me (Elmo) Ten" or "Tickle Me eXtreme".  The toy, which was designed by Bruce Lund of Lund and Co. Invention ([[River Forest, Illinois]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jedlowski|first=Jill|date=17 January 2007|title=Toy Story: TMX Elmo Creator Talks Business|newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-157884899.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first announced at the [[American International Toy Fair]]. Rather than simply vibrating like the original, the TMX rolls around on the floor, laughing and smashing his fist on the ground, begging for the tickler to stop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4x-VW_rCSE "Tickle Me Elmo X TMX Elmo"] (on Youtube).&lt;/ref&gt;

The full look of the doll was not revealed until it debuted live on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and arrived on store shelves on September 19, 2006. Toy experts said that the delay was unprecedented, with only a few people in the media allowed to preview the product, and only after signing [[confidentiality agreement]]s. The packaging was designed so that the doll could not be seen without purchasing it. The box includes a preview flap, but upon opening, only the doll's eyes are visible. It requires six AA batteries, and costs approximately $40. In a promotional clip, Jim Silver, co-publisher of ''Toy Wishes'' magazine said, "The first reaction I had was, 'Where are the wires?' Because I didn't think anything like that could move on its own.".&lt;ref name="top secret"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Olivia|date=1 February 2006|title=Meet 'Top Secret Elmo'|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/2006-02-01-tickle-me-elmo_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Image:Tmx-elmo.jpg|TMX Elmo--&gt;
Toy analyst Chris Byrne told ''[[USA Today]]'', "This is a quantum leap forward, another breakthrough in the preschool plush category." Byrne believed sales would be high, but the reaction would not be as unprecedented. "The culture has moved beyond that, the whole hot-toy phenomenon." He cited the fact there has not been such a craze since [[Furby]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="top secret"/&gt; However, some members of the media expected a large response.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} [[Toys "R" Us]] stores and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] had a pre-sale program for the doll, the first included elaborate in-store displays with a digital countdown to the doll's launch. Amazon took more presale orders than it could fulfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kotecki Vest|first=Erin|date=22 September 2006|title=Elmo Suckers Me to the Dark Side|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/erin-kotecki-vest/elmo-suckers-me-to-the-da_b_30043.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the original Tickle Me Elmo doll, demand for the new toy gave rise to some extreme acts. One person in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] was allegedly threatened with a gun to hand over a TMX toy. This was parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which said the man "was subdued by the new 'Gimmie a Reason [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tickle pickle: Your Elmo or your life! |date=25 September 2006 |publisher=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/09/25/2006-09-25_tickle_pickle_your_elmo_or_your_life.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061727/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2006/09/25/2006-09-25_tickle_pickle_your_elmo_or_your_life.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMX and other toys helped Mattel's earnings for the third quarter of the 2006 [[financial year]] to grow by six percent and beat the expectations of [[financial analyst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=16 October 2006|title=Mattel Posts 6 Percent Rise in Profit|newspaper=AP Online|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1Y1-99173190.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|date=17 October 2006|title=Mattel Tops Expectations|newspaper=[[Cincinnati Post]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152989624.html|others={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMX also helped increase sales of other Elmo toys.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In January 2007, Mattel announced it would release ''TMX Friends'', featuring Elmo, [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]] and [[Cookie Monster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kavilanz|first=Parija B.|date=29 January 2007|title=Following T.M.X.

===eXtra Special Edition===
For the Christmas 2007 season, [[Fisher-Price]] released a version with hidden surprises.  [[Mattel]] has provided a website with rhyming clues that can help find the special messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmxspecialedition.com/ Fisher Price T.M.X. Special Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===LOL Elmo===
[[Playskool]] released the toy again as ''LOL Elmo''. Not a single image of the toy was revealed until the American International Toy Fair 2012; in the Hasbro showroom's [[Sesame Street]] section, there is a sign printed "Laughter Unleashed! Fall 2012".  Above it was a video of kids giggling. The toy was released in September. It is also known as Tickle Time Elmo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
===Tickle Me Elmo (2017)===

[[Playskool]] made a new version of this toy once again but they made it part of their Playskool Friends lineup. Its behavior is like the 1996 version but has more phrases like "Elmo is one ticklish monster". This toy released in August 2017. It can be found at Walmart, Books A Million, Best Buy, Target, Toys R Us before it closed and more. It can still be found

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7634">The word ''' Titling''', in the performing arts (opera, drama, audiovisual productions), defines the work of linguistic mediation encompassing [[subtitling]] and [[surtitling]].

==History==
Subtitling developed starting from 1917, during the silent film era, whereas surtitling has been used in the live performing arts since 1983 (at the dawning of digital systems).&lt;br /&gt;
With the appearance of new information systems, which opened the door to [[multilingual titling]] ([[DVD]] was launched on the market in 1986) terminological debate started, too.&lt;br /&gt;
In the audiovisual system, even when more than one language was used, subtitles maintained their position unchanged for many years. The newest software technologies for mobile devices, which came out as an alternative to subtitling in cinemas, or the possibilities opened up by head-mounted displays, such as subtitle glasses, have made a revision of the technical terminology necessary also in the field of those performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices.&lt;br /&gt;
Even more so, in the live performing arts, the presence of multilingual options on custom individual devices ([[Santa Fe Opera]], 1998)&lt;ref name="(Santa Fe Opera, 1998)"&gt;[[Figaro Systems]] introduced in 1998 at Santa Fe Opera a custom multilingual display system recalling the aircraft video display units; this system has been lately adopted, through different companies, by some of the most prominent international theatres, such as Copenhagen, Milan, Moscow, Muscat, New York, Oslo.&lt;/ref&gt; or on mobile consumer devices (Teatro del [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]], 2011) &lt;ref name="(Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, 2011)"&gt;OperaVoice, in the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino Theatre’s season 2011-2012, developed a wireless multilingual transmission system which is to use mobile consumer devices owned by the audience (smartphones and tablets), and is also interfaceable with projected surtitles.&lt;/ref&gt; or on hybrid solutions ([[Royal Opera House Muscat]], 2012),&lt;ref name="(Royal Opera House Muscat, 2012)"&gt;[[Radio Marconi]], in 2011-2012, realized for the Royal Opera House Muscat the most advanced system of custom multilingual interactive displays integrated to surtitles on LED panel.&lt;/ref&gt; makes the spatial connotation of the term "sur-titles" inappropriate.

==Terminology==
In both cases (performing arts that are reproducible on electronic devices and live performing arts), for a scientific approach the term "titling", broader and all-embracing, is preferable to define the work of linguistic mediation, without specifying whether the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles).&lt;ref name=" not specifying if the visualization is to be above (sur-titles) or below (sub-titles)"&gt;This is also recommended in: FREDDI M. e LURAGHI S., ''Titling for the Opera House: a Test Case for Universals of Translations? '' in INCALCATERRA McLOUGHLIN L., eds., ''Audiovisual Translation'', Peter Lang, Bern-Berlin-New York 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toastmaster''' is a general term, prevalent in the [[United States]] in the middle 20th century, referring to a person in charge of the proceedings of a [[public speaking]] event. The toastmaster is typically charged with organization of the event, arranging the order of speakers, introducing one or more of the speakers, and keeping the event on schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/toastmaster|title=toastmaster {{!}} Definition of toastmaster in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such meetings typically include civic events, [[service organization]] meetings, and banquets of various purpose.  In many meetings, a toastmaster typically addresses the audience from behind a [[dais]] or from a [[podium]].{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} At stage entertainment events, especially ones broadcast on live [[television]], the toastmaster often takes the form of a [[master of ceremonies]], introducing the entertainment acts.{{or|date=June 2018}} {{citation needed span|The term has fallen out of use to a large degree.|date=June 2018}}

James Toole, father of actor [[John Lawrence Toole]] was possibly the first professional Toastmaster during the 1840's in London&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallalieu|first=Huon|date=18 May 2016|title=Raise a Toast|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.slv.vic.gov.au/docview/1791987622?accountid=13905|journal=Country Life|volume=|pages=126-127|access-date=4 June 2018|subscription=Yes|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are many allusions to him in the press of the day. His obituary noted his "stentorian voice, and the ability with which he kept very large companies in order"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1847|title=Obituary|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=e2odAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;dq=james+Toole+toastmaster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V89PiNF9oJ&amp;sig=mhAIPKFe0qs58Q39A47V5fDqcK4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsiuCglrnbAhXLvbwKHcAGBgQQ6AEIbzAR#v=onepage&amp;q=james%20Toole%20toastmaster&amp;f=false|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|volume=181|pages=327-328|access-date=4 June 2018|via=Google books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Kingsmith was the first to wear the red coat now associated with London society of Toastmasters, as he wanted to be distinguished from waitstaff and footmen. He was the public announcer at the 1908 London Olympic games,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-17688625|title=Stylish start for the 1908 Games|last=Mower|first=Jane|date=27 April 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presided over court functions at St. James's Palace, ceremonies at the House of Commons and Royal Albert Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16840785|title=Famous Toastmaster Dead.|last=|first=|date=15 February 1932|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=4 June 2018|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely known person associated with this role was [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]], known in his lifetime as "Toastmaster General of the United States" (parodying the title [[Postmaster General of the United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/25/obituaries/george-jessel-comedian-and-toastmaster-dies-at-83.html|title=George Jessel, Comedian and Toastmaster, dies at 83|last=|first=|date=25 May 1981|work=New York TImes|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many{{Weasel-inline|date=June 2018}} service organizations and businesses, the role of toastmaster was a permanently assigned role, but often rotating among members. Toastmasters were largely expected to keep the event from becoming boring, and a cottage industry arose in the middle century  to cater to the desire of businessmen and other leaders to overcome the [[fear of public speaking]]. Would-be toastmasters were typically counseled to use light [[humor]], and to have [[anecdote]]s and [[epigram]]s handily memorized. [[Toastmasters International]] is an organization dedicated to helping people in public speaking and in fulfilling the role of toastmaster.{{or|date=June 2018}}

Such was the importance of a toastmaster remaining sober in order to conduct events, he may have had a special cup, called the toastmaster's glass which, although of the same size and shape as others at the event, in fact was of much lower capacity due to an almost solid interior. Several such glasses are now displayed at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/toastmasters-glass|title=Toastmaster's glass|last=|first=|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Toy theater''', also called '''paper theater''' and '''model theater''' (also spelt '''theatre''', see [[British and American spelling differences|spelling differences]]), is a form of miniature theater dating back to the early 19th century in Europe. Toy theaters were often printed on [[paperboard]] sheets and sold as kits at the [[concession stand]] of an [[opera house]], [[Theater (structure)|playhouse]], or [[vaudeville|vaudeville theater]]. Toy theaters were assembled at home and performed for family members and guests, sometimes with live musical accompaniment. Toy theater saw a drastic decline in popularity with a shift towards [[realism (theatre)|realism]] on the European stage in the late 19th century, and again  with the arrival of [[television]] after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell, John. "A Short Entertaining History of Toy Theater." Cambridge: Great Small Works, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Toy theater has seen a resurgence in recent years among many [[puppeteer]]s, [[author]]s and [[filmmaker]]s and there are numerous international toy theater festivals throughout the Americas and Europe.

==History==
===Late 18th and early 19th century===
The original toy theaters were mass-produced replicas of popular plays, sold as kits that people assembled at home, including stage, scenery, characters and costumes. They were printed on paperboard, available at English playhouses and commercial libraries for "a penny plain or two pence coloured." Hobbyists often went to great pains to not only hand-color their stages, but to embellish their toy theater personae with bits of cloth and tinsel. Just as the toy-sized stages diminished a play’s scale, their corresponding scripts tended to abridge the text, paring it down to key characters and lines for a shorter, less complicated presentation.

In the first half of the 19th century more than 300 of London’s most popular plays saw issue as toy theaters. Publishers sent artists to the playhouses of [[Georgian era|Georgian]] and early-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] London to record the scenery, costumes and dramatic attitudes of the greatest successes of the day. The theatre management often provided these artists with a free seat, as the toy theatre sheets were excellent free advertising.

===Late 19th and early 20th century===
Stage theater of the early 19th century had been based more on spectacle than on depth of plot or character, and these characteristics lent themselves effectively to the format of toy theater. Toward the end of the 19th century, European popular drama had shifted its preference to the trend of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], marking a dramaturgical swing toward psychological complexity, character motivation and settings utilizing ordinary three-dimensional scenic elements. This trend in stage theater did not make an easy conversion to its toy counterpart, and with the fanciful dramas of 50 years prior being out of fashion, the toy theaters that remained in print fell into obsolescence. 

Despite its fall in popularity, toy theater remained in the realm of influential artists who championed its resurgence. In 1884 British author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] wrote an essay in tribute of toy theater’s tiny grandeur entitled “Penny Plain, Twopence Coloured” in which he extolled the virtues of the dramas supplied by [[Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop|Pollock's]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spitalfieldslife.com/2009/12/17/penny-plain-tuppence-coloured/  Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop on the Spitalfields Life website - 17 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://craftsmanship.net/the-rise-and-fall-of-toy-theatre/ The Rise and Fall of Toy Theatre - Craftsmanship Magazine - 6 December 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Other children’s authors like [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]] also dabbled in toy theater, as did [[Oscar Wilde]]. The brothers [[Jack Butler Yeats|Jack]] and [[William Butler Yeats]] both used toy theaters as mock-ups for their work in art and stagecraft. In the 20th century toy theater became a tool for the [[avant-garde]], messed with by [[Futurism|Futurist]] founder [[F.T. Marienetti]] as well as [[Pablo Picasso]]. Film directors like [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Orson Welles]] would use toy theaters as staging grounds for their cinematic masterpieces, and [[Laurence Olivier]] even made a toy theater of his film version of ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'', mass-produced with a little paper cutout of himself in the starring role.  But after its second wave boom, toy theater fell into a second recession, replaced in the 1950s, by a different box in people’s sitting rooms that needed no live operator and whose sets, characters, stories and musical numbers were beamed in electronically from miles away to be projected on the glass of a cathode ray tube: [[television]].

===Late 20th and early 21st century===
[[File:GeniZepelin05.JPG|thumb|Ainé Adriana Martelli performing Gení y el Zepelin at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]
Toy theater has been enjoying a revival in recent decades. Collectors and traditionalists perform restored versions of Victorian plays while experimental puppeteers push the form’s limits, adapting the works of [[Isaac Babel]] and [[Italo Calvino]], as well as that of unsung storytellers, friends, neighbors, relatives, and themselves. Contemporary toy theater may utilize any available technology and cover any subject, and numerous international toy theater festivals occur regularly throughout the Americas and Europe, attracting many well-known actors, musicians and authors to their stages.

==Construction and format==
[[Mass-produced]] toy theaters are usually sold as printed sheets, either in black and white to be colored as desired, or as full-color images of the [[proscenium]], scenery, sets, props and characters. The sheets are pasted onto thin [[Paperboard|cardboard]], cut out, and then assembled for the purposes of the reenacting of a play. Figures are attached to small sticks, wires, or configurations of strings that allow them to move about the set. Some toy theaters and figures are enhanced with moving parts and special effects, and it is common for performances to include live or pre-recorded sound effects and music.

'''Victorian burlesque''', sometimes known as '''travesty''' or '''extravaganza''',&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'',  "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; is a genre of theatrical entertainment that was popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England and in the New York theatre of the mid 19th century. It is a form of [[parody music|parody]] in which a well-known opera or piece of classical theatre or ballet is adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, usually risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and often quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work. Victorian burlesque is one of several forms of [[burlesque]].

Like [[ballad opera]], burlesques featured musical scores drawing on a wide range of music, from popular contemporary songs to operatic arias, although later burlesques, from the 1880s, sometimes featured original scores.  Dance played an important part, and great attention was paid to the staging, costumes and other spectacular elements of stagecraft, as many of the pieces were staged as [[extravaganza]]s.  Many of the male roles were played by actresses as [[breeches role]]s, purposely to show off their physical charms, and some of the older female roles were taken by male actors.

Originally short, one-act pieces, burlesques were later full-length shows, occupying most or all of an evening's programme. Authors who wrote burlesques included [[J. R. Planché]], [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].

==History==
Burlesque theatre became popular around the beginning of the [[Victorian era]]. The word "burlesque" is derived from the Italian ''burla'', which means "ridicule or mockery".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which defines the word as "That species of literary composition, or of dramatic representation, which aims at exciting laughter by caricature of the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects; a literary or dramatic work of this kind."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Victorian burlesque was "related to and in part derived from [[pantomime]] and may be considered an extension of the introductory section of pantomime with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another antecedent was [[ballad opera]], in which new words were fitted to existing tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1831 Royal Olympic.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Olympic Theatre]], for which Planché wrote ''Olympic Revels'']]
[[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  In these pieces, comedy stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the grand classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the everyday modern activities portrayed by the actors. For example, ''Olympic Revels'' opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing [[whist]].&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, the words of the songs were written to popular music, as had been done earlier in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.  Later in the Victorian era, burlesque mixed [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the large-scale burlesque spectacles were known as [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[H. J. Byron]]'s 1863 ''Il trovatore'' parody, which was labelled "a burlesque extravaganza": see Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), p. 42, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English style of burlesque was successfully launched in New York in the 1840s by the manager and comedian William Mitchell, who had opened his Olympic Theatre in December 1839. Like the London prototypes, his burlesques included characters with nonsensical names such as Wunsuponatyme and The King of Neverminditsnamia, and made fun of all kinds of music currently being presented in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike pantomime, which aimed at all ages and classes, burlesque was aimed at a narrower, highly literate audience;&lt;ref name=tls/&gt; some writers, such as the Brough brothers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Barnabas Brough]] and his brother [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]] wrote successful burlesques, sometimes jointly and sometimes alone. Their burlesques include ''The Enchanted Isle'' (1848), ''Medea'' (1856), ''Masaniello'' (1857), ''The Sphinx'' (1849) and ''The Last Edition of Ivanhoe'' (1850). See Dereli, Cynthia. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3577 "Brough, Robert Barnabas (1828–1860)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at a conservative middle class audience, and [[H. J. Byron]]'s success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes.&lt;ref name=tls&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]'' received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly.  ''Our Lady of the Cameleon'' by [[Leicester Silk Buckingham]] and ''Our Traviata'' by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of ''Il trovatore'', two of them by H. J. Byron: ''Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer'' (1863) and ''Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto'' (1880).&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin,  Roberta Montemorra.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By the 1880s, almost every truly popular opera had become the subject of a burlesque. Generally appearing after an opera's premiere or following a successful revival, they usually enjoyed local production runs, often for a month or longer. The popularity of stage burlesque in general and operatic burlesque in particular seems to have stemmed from the many ways in which it entertained a diverse group, and the manner in which it fed and fed on the circus-like or carnivalesque atmosphere of public Victorian London.&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote five opera burlesques early in his career, beginning with ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866), the most successful of which was ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1870s, [[Lydia Thompson]]'s burlesque troupe, with [[Willie Edouin]], became famous for their burlesques, by such authors as [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]], both in Britain and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, W. J., rev. J. Gilliland.

The Shakespeare scholar [[Stanley Wells]] notes that although parodies of Shakespeare had appeared even in Shakespeare's lifetime, the heyday of Shakespearean burlesque was the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Stanley. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2867735 "Shakespearian Burlesques",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 16, No. 1 (Winter, 1965), pp. 49–61, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells observes that the typical Victorian Shakespeare burlesque "takes a Shakespeare play as its point of departure and creates from it a mainly comic entertainment, often in ways that bear no relation to the original play."&lt;ref name=Wells55&gt;Wells, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells gives, as an example of the puns in the texts, the following: Macbeth and Banquo make their first entrance under an umbrella.  The witches greet them with "Hail! hail! hail!": Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=Wells55/&gt;  Musically, Shakespearean burlesques were as varied as the others of the genre.  An 1859 burlesque of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' contained 23 musical numbers, some from opera, such as the serenade from ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', and some from traditional airs and popular songs of the day including "[[Buffalo Gals]]", and "Nix my Dolly".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs,  Henry E., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2869557 "The Bard Debunked",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 31, No. 2 (Summer, 1980), pp. 294–96, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faustupto.jpg|right|thumb|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]'']]
The dialogue for burlesques was generally written in rhyming couplets, or, less often, in other verse forms, such as blank verse; it was notable for its bad [[pun]]s.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  For example, in ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), a couplet reads:
:Mephistopheles: "Along the Riviera dudes her praises sing."
:Walerlie: "Oh, did you Riviera such a thing?"&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, Mark.  [http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/lightopera001.html "History of British musical theatre",] ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'', New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962, pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Grove'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]] ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  Some contemporary critics took a sterner view; in an 1885 article, the critic Thomas Heyward praised Planché ("fanciful and elegant") and Gilbert ("witty, never vulgar"), but wrote of the genre as a whole, "the flashy, 'leggy', burlesque, with its 'slangy' songs, loutish 'breakdowns', vulgar jests, paltry puns and witless grimacing at all that is graceful and poetic is simply odious. … Burlesque, insensate, spiritless and undiscriminating, demoralizes both the audience and the players. It debases the public taste."&lt;ref&gt;Heyward, Thomas, "Burlesque: Its Uses and Abuses", ''Tinsley's Magazine'', November 1885,  p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert expressed his own views on the worth of burlesque:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The question whether burlesque has a claim to rank as art is, I think, one of degree. Bad burlesque is as far removed from true art as is a bad picture. But burlesque in its higher development calls for high intellectual power on the part of its professors. [[Aristophanes]], [[Rabelais]], [[George Cruikshank|Geo Cruikshank]], the authors of the ''[[Rejected Addresses]]'', [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], Planché were all in their respective lines professors of true burlesque.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S., Letter to Blanche Reives, ''quoted'' in "Modern Burlesque", ''The Orchestra'', November 1880, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1859 [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]] burlesque ''Hi-A-Wa-Tha'', the American playwright Charles Walcot encapsulated the character of burlesque in the epilogue, addressed to the audience by [[Mrs. John Wood]] as Minnehaha:
:Ye who love extravaganza,
:Love to laugh at all things funny,
:Love the bold anachronism.
:And the work of paste and scissors,
:And "the unities" destruction,
:Nigger airs, old glees, and catches,
:Interspersed with gems of Op'ra,
:Jokes and puns, good, bad, and so-so, –
:Come and see this mutilation,
:This disgraceful Hiawatha, Mongrel, doggerel Hiawatha!&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Hewitt, Barnard. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3204686  "Mrs. John Wood and the Lost Art of Burlesque Acting",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (May, 1961), pp. 82–85, Johns Hopkins University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, ten years later, Gilbert gave an English viewpoint on burlesque, in his epilogue to ''[[The Pretty Druidess]]'':
:So for burlesque I plead. Forgive our rhymes;
:Forgive the jokes you've heard five thousand times;
:Forgive each breakdown, cellar-flap, and clog,&lt;ref&gt;Three types of dance popular in burlesque&lt;/ref&gt;
:Our low-bred songs – our slangy dialogue;
:And, above all – oh, ye with double barrel –
:Forgive the scantiness of our apparel! &lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender reversal and female sexuality==
[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|American burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben Hur]]'', c. 1900.]]
Actresses in burlesque would often play [[breeches role]]s, which were male roles played by women; likewise, men eventually began to play older female roles.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Edith. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30222456 "Classical Mythology in the Victorian Popular Culture"], ''International Journal of the Classic Tradition'', 1999, vol. 5, issue 3, pp. 336–366, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  These reversals allowed viewers to distance themselves from the morality of the play, focusing more on joy and entertainment than catharsis, a definitive shift away from neoclassical ideas.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

The depiction of female sexuality in Victorian burlesque was an example of the connection between women as performers and women as sexual objects in Victorian culture.&lt;ref name="Buszek"&gt;Buszek, Maria-Elena.  [http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=394dd17c-6070-4982-a2c4-2e5723826ac7%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=115 "Representing 'Awarishness': Burlesque, Feminist Transgression, and the 19th-Century Pin-up"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Drama Review'', 1999, vol. 43, issue 4, pp. 141–162, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of theatre the participation of women on stage has been questioned.  Victorian culture viewed paid female performance as being closely associated with prostitution, “a profession in which most women in the theatre dabbled, if not took on as a primary source of income.”&lt;ref name=Buszek /&gt;

==Gaiety Theatre==
[[Image:Florence St. John.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
Burlesque became the specialty of London's [[Royal Strand Theatre]] and [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson, Erroll, "Lost London Playhouses", ''The Stage'', 28 June 1923, p. 21, one of a series of articles later published in a 1925 book of same name.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize. [[Nellie Farren]] starred as the Gaiety Theatre's "principal boy" from 1868, and [[John D'Auban]] choreographed the burlesques there from 1868 to 1891.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward O'Connor Terry]] joined the theatre in 1876. Early Gaiety burlesques included ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868, by Gilbert), ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877), ''Blue Beard'' (1882), ''Ariel'' (1883, by [[F. C. Burnand]]) and ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' (1883).

Beginning in the 1880s, when comedian-writer [[Fred Leslie]] joined the Gaiety, composers like [[Meyer Lutz]] and [[Osmond Carr]] contributed original music to the burlesques, which were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These later Gaiety burlesques starred Farren and Leslie.  They often included Leslie's [[libretti]], written under his pseudonym, "A. C. Torr",&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. 'The spark that lit the bonfire', in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and were usually given an original score by Lutz: ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), ''Pretty Esmeralda'' (1887), ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'' (1887),&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 14 and 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mazeppa'' and ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888).  ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1889) made fun of the play ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;  The title was a pun, and the worse the pun, the more Victorian audiences were amused.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Donald J., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825187 "The Uses of Victorian Laughter",] ''Victorian Studies'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (December 1966), pp. 145–76,  Indiana University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Gaiety burlesques were ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |title=Programme for ''Carmen up to Data'' |access-date=10 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210092757/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |archive-date=10 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891), and ''Don Juan'' (1892, with lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=4 January 2008 }} accessed 01 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1890s, Farren retired, Leslie died, and musical burlesque went out of fashion in London, as the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

From her retirement, Nellie Farren endorsed this judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wing Bowl''' was an annual eating contest founded in 1993 by [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] talk-radio hosts [[Angelo Cataldi]] and [[Al Morganti]].  The contest was first broadcast on [[WTEL (AM)|WIP]].   

About 150 people attended Wing Bowl I (held in a hotel) in 1993 to see a competition between two contestants. The event pits [[competitive eater]]s in a [[Buffalo wing]] eating contest. The Wing Bowl is traditionally held on the Friday before the [[Super Bowl]]. The event, which began as a radio promotion, has grown to encompass television, the Internet, and a contest for women who are termed "the Wingettes."

Since 2000, the event was held at Philadelphia's [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]], where it is still broadcast live on 94-WIP-FM. There are currently no television deals to broadcast the event live; however, a replay is usually shown on [[WPSG|CW 57]], [[Comcast SportsNet]], or one of the other local stations within the following week. The Wing Bowl drew crowds of over 20,000. 

The final Wing Bowl, Wing Bowl XXVI was held on February 2, 2018 and the winner was [[Molly Schuyler]], who devoured a record 501 wings in a half hour.

==Background==
Wing Bowl was the brainchild of WIP radio host Al Morganti, who came up with the idea when it became apparent the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] were not going to make the Super Bowl anytime soon. It is also suggested that Morganti was fed up with the Buffalo Bills going to the Super Bowl and not winning. The first Wing Bowl was held in the lobby of the [[Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts|Wyndham]] Franklin Plaza Hotel in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]]. Carmen Cordero walked away with the inaugural title, receiving a [[hibachi]] as his prize.

Since then, media coverage has grown to the point where every one of the major Philadelphia television stations has covered the event. The [[WPVI-TV|ABC 6]], [[KYW-TV|CBS Channel 3]] and [[WTXF-TV|Fox 29]] affiliates all aired live reports from the event during their morning news. Features on the event have appeared in the ''[[Courier-Post]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and ''[[Philadelphia Daily News|Daily News]]'' as well as a host of newspapers in the surrounding counties. The event has been featured on ESPN and the syndicated television shows ''[[Real TV]]'' and ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]''. Segments on Wing Bowl have appeared on TV newscasts in cities throughout the country. Several Wing Bowl contestants, including "El Wingador," competed in Fox's "[[Glutton Bowl]]" in the spring of 2002. The 2007 Wing Bowl was carried on [[Comcast Cable]]'s [[Video on demand|On Demand]] channel.

Then [[Mayor of Philadelphia]] and future [[Governor of Pennsylvania]] [[Ed Rendell]] attended Wing Bowls II, III, IV and VI, where he presented the winner with a "[[Liberty Bell]]" trophy. Other celebrities who have appeared include retired heavyweight boxer [[Randall "Tex" Cobb]], former [[Philadelphia 76ers|76ers]] President [[Pat Croce]], former [[Philadelphia Phillies|Phillies]] manager [[Larry Bowa]], [[U.S. Senator]] [[Arlen Specter]], and others. Major-league [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] [[Eric Gregg]] served as the "Commissioner" of Wing Bowl from its second year until his death from a [[stroke]] on 5 June 2006. From December 2006 to 2013, [[Pat Croce]] was the second commissioner. [[Jon Dorenbos]] has been the third commissioner since 2014.

==Qualifications==
(As per Wing Bowl Commissioner [[Jon Dorenbos]])
Entry into Wing Bowl can be gained in two ways, the first of which is successfully performing an "eating stunt" on air during ''The Morning Show'' at the 94 WIP studios in [[Center City, Philadelphia]], with Al Morganti as judge. Stunts have included eating 20 cups of cooked [[oatmeal]], eating {{convert|3.75|lb|kg}} of [[creamed spinach]] with {{convert|3.75|lb|kg}} of [[hot sauce]], and eating five [[Big Mac]]s. The stunt must be completed within a time limit negotiated between the contestant and Morganti. Morganti, known to be a tough judge, has disallowed stunts that involved what he considers "cheating", such as dipping bread into a beverage to make it easier to swallow, or breaking up a food item into constituent parts for easier chewing (such as separating hot dogs from their buns). He is also tough on contestants who suggest a stunt involving liquid consumption; ''The Morning Show'' hosts prefer eating stunts over drinking stunts. If a person offers to perform a drinking stunt, it must be compelling to the hosts, such as Wing Bowl XIV champion [[Joey Chestnut]]'s offer to drink {{convert|1|gal|l}} of [[milk]]. The hosts deemed it not difficult enough, but, fortunately for Chestnut, former champion Bill "El Wingador" Simmons was present and declared the stunt to have a high level of difficulty, upon which the hosts accepted his offer, with a five-minute time limit to complete the challenge.

The other way to gain entry to Wing Bowl is to win a "Wingoff."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/gallery?Dato=20100108&amp;Kategori=NEWS01&amp;Lopenr=1080801&amp;Ref=PH "Wing Bowl Wingoff At PJ Whelihan's In Haddonfield"].

Portal to gallery of photographs (45) related to Wing Bowl. ''Courier-Post''. January 15, 2009. Accessed January 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a 10-minute eating contest held at a Philadelphia or [[South Jersey]] bar hosted by former Philadelphia Eagle and WIP Host Hugh Douglas and WIP Personality Marc Farzetta. The "Wingoffs" began in 2005 when 610 WIP decided to spoof the [[Philadelphia Big 5|Big 5 Philadelphia]] area universities basketball teams. The winner of these "Wingoffs" gain automatic entry into the Wing Bowl.

==Cancellation==
WIP announced on October 30, 2018 that event was being canceled after 26 years because the time for doing so felt right after the Eagles won [[Super Bowl LII]]. According to WIP program director Spike Eskin, "When Wing Bowl started ... a large part of it was the lead-up to the Super Bowl never involved the Eagles. We just wanted to get to the promised land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berkery|first=Sheri|url=https://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/local/south-jersey/2018/10/30/wing-bowl-wip-ends-competitive-eating-competition-philadelphia/1816859002/|title=WIP ends controversial Wing Bowl's long run in Philadelphia|date=October 30, 2018|newspaper=Courier-Post|access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bryan|first=Cleve|url=https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2018/10/30/94wip-ends-wing-bowl-after-26-years/|title=‘I Think It Ran Its Course’: 94WIP Ends Wing Bowl After 26 Years|date=October 30, 2018|work=[[CBS Philly]]|access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
