In 2013, BankTech published a survey taken by AccuSystems that surveyed 80 community banks.  The survey found that only 12% of banks are using paperless systems for issuing loans.&lt;ref name="BankTech Survey"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Benefits of Loan Document Imaging and Digital Loan Portfolio Management|url=http://www.banktech.com/whitepaper/Payments-Cards/Imaging/the-benefits-of-loan-document-imaging-and-digital-wp1315340739?articleID=191703375|website=BankTech|publisher=Bank Systems &amp; Technology|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study is often used when discussing paperless systems in the US's banking industry.&lt;ref name="Xcel Pueblo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="US Bank" /&gt;

'''Axess''' (アクセス国際ネットワーク) is a [[Computer reservations system]] based in Japan which provides its services in the Japanese market. It originated as the IT department of [[Japan Airlines]] called Jalinfotech. In 1991 it was established as an independent company it began to be marketed to travel agencies in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axess.co.jp/eng/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Axess partnered with [[Sabre Holdings]] in order to provide travel agencies in Japan with booking and ticketing capabilities for a wider range of international airlines.

On April 23 2012 Travelport, the business services provider to the global travel industry, announced a long-term agreement with AXESS International Network, the leading Japanese GDS owned by Japan Airlines (JAL).  Under the new agreement, AXESS will be hosted by Travelport in its Atlanta data center as a partition of the Travelport global distribution system.  The new upgraded AXESS GDS system, which will provide enhanced functionality to connected travel agency users, will be implemented by 2013.

By adopting Travelport's technology infrastructure, the AXESS GDS system will be enhanced with improved connectivity to airlines and a significant increase in the range of fares, shopping, hotel and car rental capabilities available for use by Japanese travel agencies and corporations. 

AXESS confirmed it had selected Travelport as its partner due to the two companies' mutual alignment on strategic thinking and saw the agreement as a significant step forward in reinforcing AXESS's position as the GDS of choice in the Japanese travel industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8155">'''Binding Corporate Rules''' or "BCRs" were developed by the [[European Union]] [[Article 29 Working Party]] to allow multinational [[corporation]]s, international organizations, and groups of companies to make intra-organizational transfers of personal data across borders in compliance with EU [[Data Protection Directive|Data Protection Law]]. The BCRs were developed as an alternative to the U.S. Department of Commerce EU [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|Safe Harbor]] (which was for US organizations only, but has been declared invalid and replaced by the [https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S Privacy Shield Frameworks]) and the [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en EU Model Contract Clauses].

BCRs are required to be approved by the [[national data protection authority|data protection authority]] in each EU Member State (such as the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] in the United Kingdom, [http://WWW.cnil.fr CNIL] in France, [http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/index-ides-idphp.php AEPD]  in Spain, etc.) in which the organization will rely on the BCRs. The EU has developed a mutual recognition process under which BCRs approved by one member state's data protection authority (known as the "lead" authority) and two other "co-lead" authorities, may be approved by the other relevant member states who may make comments and ask for amendments. Other members states, not part of mutual recognition process, will be also involved by the lead authority and will apply their own independent review process within a limited time-frame. The overall process for BCR acceptance takes usually between 6 and 9 months. This time frame does not include the required Data Protection setup, which should be already implemented within the company in order to comply with the current directive and its local implementation.

BCRs typically form stringent, intra-corporate global privacy policies, set of practices, processes and guidelines that satisfy EU standards and may be available as an alternative means of authorizing transfers of personal data (e.g., customer databases, HR information, etc.) outside of Europe.

BCRs should be seen as a framework for having different elements (internal legal agreement, policies, training, audit, etc.) providing compliance with EU data protection regulations and effective privacy and data protection.

It has to be noticed that, while originally designed for providing legal ground to international transfers, BCRs became de facto a corporation demonstration of its capacity to comply "at large" with personal data processing requirements. A corporation having BCRs applies this framework independently of international transfers and should be seen as part of the "Corporate Governance" or "Data Governance"

The Article 29 Working Party issued several guidance documents on BCR content, acceptance criteria and submission process.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/workinggroup/index_en.htm, ''see'' in particular documents WP 133, WP 153, WP 154, WP 155 at http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/workinggroup/wpdocs/2008_en.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

BCRs by themselves do not "authorize" all transfers automatically for all EU member states. Most of member states still require a formal "transfer notification" which is normally granted if the BCRs have been accepted by the relevant country.

The following companies have obtained authorizations for BCRs:&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, List of companies for which the EU BCR cooperation procedure is closed,http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=613841&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business activity monitoring''' ('''BAM''') is [[software]] that aids in monitoring of business activities, key performance indicators, business / operational exceptions and business risks, as those activities are implemented in [[computer system]]s.

The term was originally coined by analysts at [[Gartner|Gartner, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/resources/105500/105562/105562.pdf Gartner overview of BAM, Definition (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the aggregation, analysis, and presentation of real-time information about activities inside organizations and involving customers and partners. A business activity can either be a [[business process]] that is orchestrated by [[business process management]] (BPM) software, or a business process that is a series of activities spanning multiple systems and applications. BAM is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a real-time summary of business activities to operations managers and upper management.

==Goals and benefits==
The goals of business activity monitoring is to provide real time information about the status and results of various operations, processes, and transactions. The main benefits of BAM are to enable an enterprise to make better informed [[business decision]]s, quickly address problem areas, and re-position organizations to take full advantage of emerging opportunities.

==Key features==
One of the most visible features of BAM solutions is the presentation of information on [[Dashboard (management information systems)|dashboards]] containing the [[key performance indicator]]s (KPIs) used to provide assurance and visibility of activity and performance. This information is used by technical and business operations to provide visibility, measurement, and assurance of key business activities. It is also exploited by [[event correlation]] to detect and warn of impending problems.

Although BAM systems usually use a computer dashboard display to present data, BAM is distinct from the dashboards used by [[business intelligence]] (BI) insofar as events are processed in real-time or near real-time and pushed to the dashboard in BAM systems, whereas BI dashboards refresh at predetermined intervals by polling or querying databases. Depending on the refresh interval selected, BAM and BI dashboards can be similar or vary considerably.

Some BAM solutions additionally provide trouble notification functions, which allows them to interact automatically with the [[issue tracking system]]. For example, whole groups of people can be sent e-mails, voice or text messages, according to the nature of the problem. Automated [[problem solving]], where feasible, can correct and restart failed processes.

==Deployment effort==
In nearly all BAM deployments extensive tailoring to specific enterprises is required. Many BAM solutions seek to reduce extensive customization and may offer templates that are written to solve common problems in specific sectors, for example banking, manufacturing, and stockbroking. Due to the high degree of system integration required for initial deployment, many enterprises use experts that specialize in BAM to implement solutions.

BAM is now considered{{who|date=January 2016}} a critical component of [[Operational Intelligence]] (OI) solutions to deliver visibility into business operations. Multiple sources of data can be combined from different organizational silos to provide a common operating picture that uses current information. Wherever real-time insight has the greatest value, OI solutions can be applied to deliver the needed information.

==Processing events==
All BAM solutions process events. While most of the first BAM solutions were closely linked to BPM solutions and therefore processed events emitted as the process was being orchestrated, this had the disadvantage of requiring enterprises to invest in BPM before being able to acquire and use BAM. The newer generation of BAM solutions are based on [[complex event processing]] (CEP) technology, and can process high volumes of underlying technical events to derive higher level business events, therefore reducing the dependency on BPM, and providing BAM to a wider audience of customers.

==Examples==
A bank might be interested in minimizing the amount of money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.

Another example involves a mobile telecommunications company interested in detecting a situation whereby new customers are not set up promptly and correctly on their network and within the various CRM and billing solutions. Low-level technical events such as messages passing from one application to another over a middleware system, or transactions detected within a database logfile, are processed by a CEP engine. All events relating to an individual customer are correlated in order to detect an anomalous situation whereby an individual customer has not been promptly or correctly provisioned, or set up. An alert can be generated to notify technical operations or to notify business operations, and the failed provisioning step may be restarted automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">{{citations|date=January 2018}}'''Business mathematics''' is [[mathematics]] used by [[Commerce|commercial]] enterprises to record and manage [[business operations]]. Commercial organizations use mathematics in [[accounting]], [[inventory management]], [[marketing]], sales [[forecasting]], and [[financial analysis]].  

Mathematics typically used in commerce includes [[elementary arithmetic]], elementary [[algebra]], [[statistics]] and [[probability]].  Business management can be done more effectively in some cases by use of more advanced mathematics such as [[calculus]], [[Matrix_(mathematics)#Basic_operations|matrix algebra]] and [[linear programming]].

==High school==
''Business mathematics, '' sometimes called ''commercial math''  or ''consumer math'', is a group of practical subjects used in [[commerce]] and everyday life. In schools, these subjects are often taught to students who are not planning a university education.  In the United States, they are typically offered in [[high schools]] and in schools that grant [[associate's degrees]]; elsewhere they may be included under [[Business studies]].  The emphasis in these courses is on computational skills and their practical application, with practical application being predominant. 

A (U.S.) business math course might include a review of [[elementary arithmetic]], including [[fractions]], [[decimals]], and [[percentages]]. Elementary [[algebra]] is often included as well, in the context of solving practical business problems. The practical applications typically include [[checking accounts]], [[discounts and allowances|price discounts]], [[markup (business)|markups and Markup]], [[payroll]] calculations, [[interest|simple and compound interest]], [[credit (finance)|consumer and business credit]], and [[mortgages]] and [[revenues]].

==University level==
===Undergraduate===
"Business Mathematics" comprises mathematics courses taken at an [[undergraduate]] level by [[Business education#Undergraduate education|business students]]. The two most common here are ''Business Calculus'' and ''[[Business Statistics]]''.  Programs often also cover matrix operations as above, and may include a separate module on [[time value of money|interest calculations]].

These courses are usually focused on problems from the business world, and the syllabus is adjusted correspondingly. Thus for example, whereas in a regular calculus course students would study [[trigonometric functions]], courses here would not typically cover this area. Correspondingly, these courses typically do not go into the same depth as standard courses in the mathematics or science fields.  (Although see [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration]] and [[Bachelor of Business Science]].) 

Note that [[Bachelor of Economics|economics majors]], especially those planning to pursue  [[Master of Economics|graduate study in the field]], are encouraged to instead take regular calculus, as well as [[linear algebra]] and other advanced math courses, especially [[real analysis]]. Some programs (instead) include a module in "mathematics for economists", providing a bridge between the above "Business Mathematics" courses and [[mathematical economics]] and [[econometrics]].
[[Operations management]] (and [[management accounting]]) may similarly include supplementary coursework in relevant quantitative techniques, generally linear programming as above, as well as other optimization methods.

===Postgraduate===
[[Business_education#Postgraduate_education|At the postgraduate level]], ''generalist'' management and finance programs include quantitative topics which are foundational for the study in question - often exempting students with an appropriate background. These are usually "interest mathematics" and statistics, both at the above level. [[MBA]] programs often also include basic [[operations research]] (linear programming, as above) with the emphasis on practice, and may combine the topics as "quantitative analysis"; [[master of science in finance|MSF programs]] may similarly cover applied [[econometrics]].

More technical [[masters degree|Masters]] in these areas, such as those in [[management science]] and [[Master of Quantitative Finance|quantitative finance]], will entail a deeper, more theoretical study of operations research and econometrics, and extend to further advanced topics such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[stochastic calculus]]. These programs do not include "Business mathematics" ''per se''.

Where [[mathematical economics]] is not required, [[Master of Economics|graduate economics programs]] often include "quantitative techniques", which covers (applied) [[linear algebra]] and [[multivariate calculus]], and may include the above topics; regardless, econometrics is usually a separate course, and is dealt with in depth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11513">The concept of '''business process orientation''' (BPO) is based upon the work of Deming (Walton, 1996), Porter (1985), Davenport and Short (1990), Hammer (1993, 1996 and 1999), Grover et al. (1995), and Coombs and Hull (1996).  This body of work suggests that firms could enhance their overall performance by adopting a “process view” of the [[organization]].  Although many firms have adopted the BPO concept, little to no empirical data existed substantiating its effectiveness in facilitating improved [[business]] performance.  McCormack (2000) conducted an empirical study to explore the relationship between BPO and enhanced business performance. The research results showed that BPO is critical in reducing conflict and encouraging greater connectedness within an organization, while improving business performance. Moreover, companies with strong measures of BPO showed better overall business performance. The research also showed that high BPO levels within organizations led to a more positive [[corporate climate]], illustrated through better organizational connectedness and less internal conflict. Another empirical study by Kohlbacher (2009) reveals that BPO is positively associated with customer satisfaction, product quality, delivery speed and time-to-market speed.&lt;ref name="SMS"&gt;Kohlbacher, M. (2009): The Effects of Process Orientation on Customer Satisfaction, Product Quality and Time-Based Performance. Paper presented at the 29th International Conference of the Strategic Management Society, Washington DC, October 11–14, [http://dc.strategicmanagement.net Conference Website].&lt;/ref&gt;

For a central concept, one that has become something of a [[Holy Grail]] for 1990s managers, BPO has remained remarkably hard to pin down.  Its champions argue that it is a new approach to management that replaces the rigid hierarchies of the past ("I report to my boss") with structures that are much flatter, more cooperative, more process-oriented  ("I report to my customer.").  Many of us have had experience with both types of organization and we know intuitively what BPO feels like.  Yet, if you're like me, you want a more solid foundation on which to make decisions and recommendations{{Fact|date=February 2014}}.

Most of the literature on business process orientation has been in the popular press and lacks a research or empirical focus. Although empirical evidence is lacking, several models have emerged during the last few years that have been presented as the high performance, process oriented organization needed in today and tomorrow’s world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cleven A, Mettler T, Rohner P, Winter R |title=Healthcare quality innovation and performance through process orientation: Evidence from general hospitals in Switzerland |journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change |volume=113 |issue=Part B |pages=386–395 |year=2016 |doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.07.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Deming, Porter, Davenport, Short, Hammer, Byrne, Imai, Drucker, Rummler-Brache and Melan have all defined what they view as the new model of the organization.  According to each model’s proponent, the “building” of this model requires a new approach and a new way of thinking about the organization which will result in dramatic business performance improvements.  This “new way of thinking” or “viewing” your organization has been generally described as business process orientation.

Process centering or building an organization with a business process orientation has led to many reported successes.  [[Texas Instruments]], [[Progressive Insurance]] and [[American Standard Companies]] have all been reported, albeit anecdotally, as receiving improved business performance from building a process orientation within an organization (Hammer 1996).

Process orientation, and its relationship to improved cross-functional interaction, was introduced almost fifteen years ago by [[Michael Porter]].  He introduced the concept of interoperability across the value chain as a major issue within firms (Porter 1985).  W. Edwards Deming also contributed with the “Deming Flow Diagram” depicting the connections across the firm from the customer to the supplier as a process that could be measured and improved like any other process (Walton 1986).  [[Thomas H. Davenport|Thomas Davenport]] and James Short (1990) described a process orientation within an organization as a key component in the “New Industrial Engineering: Information Technology and Business Process Redesign.”

[[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] also presented the business process orientation concept as an essential ingredient of a successful “reengineering” effort.  Hammer coined this term to describe the development of a customer focused, strategic business process based organization enabled by rethinking the assumptions in a process oriented way and utilizing information technology as a key enabler (Hammer, 1993).   Hammer offers reengineering as a strategy to overcome the problematic cross-functional activities that are presenting major performance issues to firms and cites many examples of successes and failures in his series of books and articles.  Hallmark and Wal-Mart are often put forward as success stories and IBM and GM as the failures.

Culture is a major theme in the examples cited.  A  “business process culture” is a culture that is cross-functional, customer oriented along with process and system thinking.  This can be expanded by Davenport’s definition of process orientation as consisting of elements of structure, focus, measurement, ownership and customers (Davenport 1993).  Davenport also stressed commitment to process improvement that directly benefits the customer and business process information oriented systems as a major component of this culture

Finally, Hammer (Hammer 1993, 1995, 1996, 1999) described “process thinking” as cross-functional and outcome oriented.  He also used four categories to describe the components of an organization.  These are:

#Business Processes
#Jobs and Structures
#Management and Measurement Systems
#Values and Beliefs

==The Definition of BPO==

To establish a more solid foundation, I would like to propose a definition and an approach to measuring BPO.  The BPO concept has sufficient practitioners and researchers and has been implemented in enough companies that we now have the information we need to develop a testable statistical model. The trick, of course, is getting at that broad range of experience and boiling it down in scientifically acceptable ways to a point where practitioners can use it easily in the field.

Our approach to building this foundation began with an extensive literature review, interviews with experts both in the U.S. and Europe and testing with experienced practitioners and experts to determine the key definition and variables within BPO.  Using various statistical techniques (domain sampling, coefficient alpha testing, and factor analysis), we both determined the validity of various BPO variables and condensed those variables into a simpler composite list (survey instrument) that offered easy use in measuring BPO within an organization (McCormack 1999).

Our research found that the practitioners and experts said a Business Process Oriented Organization comes down to this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An organization that emphasizes process as opposed to hierarchies, a process oriented way of thinking, outcomes and customers."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We also found that BPO also breaks into three elements:

*Process Management and Measurement – measures that include aspects of the process like output quality, cycle time, process cost and variability compared to the traditional accounting measures.
*Process Jobs – "product development process owner" rather than "research manager".
*Process View – thorough documentation from top to bottom and beginning to end of a process.

Recent research extends the elements of McCormack (1999) and concludes that the concept of BPO consists of the following components:&lt;ref name="BPMJ2011"&gt;Kohlbacher, M. and Gruenwald S. (2011): Process orientation: conceptualization and measurement. Business Process Management Journal 17(2), pp. 267-283.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Design and documentation of business processes
*Management commitment towards process orientation
*Process ownership (see [[process owner]])
*Process performance measurement
*Corporate culture in line with the process approach &lt;ref name="BPD2011"&gt;Kohlbacher, M., Gruenwald, S. and Kreuzer, E.

'''Business war gaming''' (Corporate war gaming) or business wargaming is an adaptation of the art of simulating moves and counter-moves in a commercial setting. Unlike [[Military simulation|military war games]], or [[Wargaming|fantasy war games]] which can be set hundreds of years in the past,  business war games are usually set in the present and are a relatively recent development, but they are growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9257879 "Shall We Play a Game?"] ''[[The Economist]]'', June 2, 2007, p. 72)&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for running a business [[wargaming|war game]] is that it is a tool of particular value when the competitive environment is undergoing a process of change, as it allows decision makers to consider proactively how different players can react to the change, and to each other. The benefit of teams role playing competitors and developing more robust strategies is especially notable, and can be inferred from a quote such as the one below from Richard Clark, CEO of [[Merck and Co.]], who in an interview to [[USA Today]] said: "''I am a strong believer in if you’re going to develop a vision or a strategic plan for the future of a company that you have to engage the organization in doing that…it can’t be just the CEO or top 10 executives sitting in a sterile conference room.''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/drugs/2006-02-26-merck-cover-usat_x.htm USA Today, "Merck CEO sets sight on change", February 27, 2006, p. B1]&lt;/ref&gt;".

At the Paul Merage School Of Business at [[University of California, Irvine]] the final exam for the [[competitive intelligence]] class is a war game in which the students role play various companies to try to win in the marketplace. Each year student teams have developed strategies - some of which have actually happened in the market place indicating that a war game is a very powerful predictive tool for businesss when planned properly.

== Methodologies ==

=== Market level ===
Currently there are three schools of thought about business [[wargaming|war game]], depending on the underlying philosophy of their creators: "Business is War" war games, "Business is a Game" war games, and "Business is Business" war games. The three types have accordingly, different strengths and weaknesses, and are useful for different applications throughout business.

==== "Business is War" ====
Sometimes abbreviated as 'BIW' war games, 'Business is War' games are a direct adaptation from the military [[wargaming|war games]], and envision competitors as the "enemy" and the goal as "victory" in a market "battle". These games are based on mathematical modeling of contestable markets, including [[chaos theory]], random variable generation ([[Monte Carlo simulations]]), and [[econometric model]]ing of demand and supply conditions. Participants’ generated moves are fed into computer program which generates optimal solutions in the mathematical space. Not surprisingly these games come with a high price tag, and are advocated by large consulting firms which tend to work with the US military establishment.

==== "Business is a Game" ====
'BIG' war games regard business transactions as a game between participants with potentially conflicting goals. BIG advocates apply [[game theory]], a branch of mathematics to business situations with the goal of finding an equilibrium, or "stable" solution (so called [[Nash equilibrium]]) whereby no one can further improve on the outcome. The solution can be computed over a large space of all possible (hypothetical) moves of the players. A leading proponent of this type of war games is Niall Fraser, a game theorist and the founder of a consultancy called [[Open Options]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, N.M. and K.W. Hipel (1984). Conflict Analysis: Models and Resolutions. New York: North-Holland&lt;/ref&gt; A variant on BIG is computer simulations’ games using simultaneous equations to solve for demand and supply equilibrium (not a game theory solution). Participants input numerical values for decisions on a wide range of business investments (in production, sales force, advertising, etc.), and receive a computer output of the equilibrium results.

==== "Business is Business"  ====
Also referred to as 'BIB' regard business as neither a war nor a game.&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben. "Neither a War Nor a Game", CI Magazine, 9(6), Nov.-Dec. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The goals and tactics of war are incompatible with business goals; competitors do not aim to defeat each other but to satisfy customers’ preferences better than others. Government precludes total victories and cooperation is as prevalent as competition. Similarly, BIB criticizes "Business is Game" thinking on the ground that hypothetical or generic moves are irrelevant or trivial, stable solutions are not a substitute for specific, real life practical and innovative strategies for management, and computer/mathematical simulations do not approach the complexity of competitive dynamics in real markets. Instead, BIB advocates using state-of-the-art [[competitor analysis]] techniques and real life [[competitive intelligence]] to generate an in-depth profiling of competitors through role playing. The goal of BIB is predicting most likely moves by most significant competitors or other third parties (customers, regulators) so that strategy can be pressure–tested in the most realistic setting. The creator of BIB games is [[Benjamin Gilad]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben (2008). Business War Games. NJ: [[Career Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; A variation combines BIB war gaming with computer simulations. This approach, used by Mark Chussil, founder of Advanced Competitive Strategies, uses simulations to estimate the likely outcomes from moves made by a business, its competitors, and other relevant actors, across multiple scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatifyourstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/ACS-Business-War-Gaming-Bibliography-1-12.pdf|title=ACS Business War Gaming Bibliography|last=Chussil|first=Mark|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach allows for both competitive dynamics and quantitative analysis, at the cost of additional time to set up the war game.

=== Negotiation level ===
In contrast to the often larger “Business is War”, “Business is a Game” and “Business is Business” war games, which all primarily deal with market level issues, Negotiation War Games are smaller in scope and only deal with business related negotiations. Even though the US military have long referred to the practice of ”War Gaming a negotiation”, the term ”Negotiation War Game” was first coined by Soren Malmborg in 2010.

==== Negotiation War Games (aka. NWG) ====

A "NWG" is a Business War Game conducted at negotiation level. I.e. A structured framework for conducting a preparatory Negotiation Simulation&lt;ref&gt;Shell, G. Richard (2006). "Bargaining for Advantage". Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; on a specific, upcoming negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Henry S. (2001). “Game, set, match: winning the negotiations game”. ALM Publishing/ALM Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Stuart (2010). ” Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World”. Crown Business&lt;/ref&gt;

A Negotiation War Game is most often divided into three steps:
1/ Gather Intelligence
2/ Simulate Upcoming Negotiation
3/ Debrief and calibrate negotiation strategy.

By adding Competitive Intelligence to the simulation, Negotiation War Gaming differentiates itself from normal mock negotiations and other training exercises. The act of gathering and including Competitive Intelligence on the forthcoming negotiation and its parties, lets participants in the Negotiation War Game gain an in-depth understanding of the negotiation itself and the negotiation parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Playing_war_games_to_win_2757&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of doing a Negotiation War Game is threefold; 
1/ Predicting your opponents' next move 
2/ Revealing opportunities, threats and issues 
3/ Developing and testing a calibrated negotiation strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Ghauri, Pervez N., Jean-Claude Usunier (2003). “International business negotiations”. Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Stuart (2010). ” Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World”. Crown Business&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==== Role-Play ====

Even though software applications can play an important role in the facilitation of a Role-Play Negotiation War Game, the method is inherently focused on role-play simulation. War Games can be used to prepare for virtually all two or three party negotiations. By gathering Competitive Intelligence on the actual negotiation (as well as the individuals involved) an accurate simulation can be created. A client’s employees will then become involved in the actual War Game by acting partly as the company itself, partly as the other negotiating party. Through a series of structured simulations, a tailor-made strategy can then be developed and calibrated.

Role-Play Negotiation War Games are especially effective when preparing for Sales- and Procurement negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holdenadvisors.com/news/1112.html&lt;/ref&gt; Through more than 30 years of business usage and scientific research, the method has been shown to generate significantly better negotiation outcomes compared to other popular methods. (Please see Application section below for references).In 2010, 64,7% of young US Sales-Managers Role-Played their upcoming negotiations, making "Pure Role-Play" Negotiation War Gaming one of the most used negotiation preparation techniques in North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmaglobal.org/MMJ-Archive/Spring2010/47035-1MMA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
A leading proponent and provider of these types of War Games is Outcome Simulations ApS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outcomesimulations.com&lt;/ref&gt; led by Soren Malmborg.&lt;ref&gt;"Krigsspil kan hjælpe erhvervschefer". Dagbladet Børsen 26.11.2010&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, Outcome's Negotiation War Gaming method is taught in MBA courses on negotiation at [[Columbia Business School]] and [[NYU Stern School of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;http://m.business.dk/?article=25236318-Ivaerksaetter-vil-saelge-%C2%BBkrigsspil%C2%AB-til-amerikanerne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/46460/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== BIW ===
Given the high budget requirements and long preparations time, BIW games are more appropriate for big companies' big decisions and large budgets, such as corporate games, involving top executives with considerable staff and consultant support. Corporate games are played over major portfolio decisions such as diversification and/or divestiture moves of the parent company (i.e., which acquisitions to go for, which business to get rid of), and over longer term horizons. BIW games are less appropriate for business units,  or ''business'' strategy decisions, as their high price tag and extensive time required from top executives are no match for small scale games with more tailored application and flexible format.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff, David. "War Games Help Businesses Prepare For Anything". Wall Street Journal (Eastern edition), Newswire: Dow Jones,5/3/02&lt;/ref&gt; To fully understand the difference between corporate games played over corporate strategy (portfolio management) and business games played over business strategy (competitive strategy), read Michael Porter’s articles.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Michael E. ["From Competitive Advantage to Corporate Strategy". ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', May–June, 1987 pp. 43-59 and "What is Strategy", ''Harvard Business Review'', Nov-Dec. 1996, pp. 61-78&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BIG ===
Game theory and computer simulation games are appropriate for planning and decision support in industries in relatively stable state, known distributions of outcomes, and predictable competitors, as they are best suited for finding equilibrium solutions among a relatively large set of known variables (payoffs and moves). On the other hand, BIG games are handicapped in rapidly changing industries, markets where surprise moves by new players is a possibility, situations requiring innovative and creative approaches, and in decisions calling for specific practical ideas rather than more generic moves (such as raise, stay or lower prices by x%). Decision makers looking at war gaming should also be minded of game theory’s own lack of empirical support, as people seem to irrationally follow behaviors that do not result in their best outcome.

=== BIB ===
Business war games employing role-playing and competitor analytical techniques are most beneficial in business strategy at the business unit, market, brands, product and project levels. BIB games have been applied with great success to new product launches, offensive and defensive moves against specific competitors (whose response is analyzed using the advanced competitor analysis techniques), in organizational development’s (training the next generation executive cadre) "competitive landscape" games, and in brand revival and new market entry situations. According to participants, BIB games provide touch reality-based challenge to strategies and plans that helps companies cope with uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; They are less useful in conglomerate strategy as they apply to business strategy and not across unrelated industries. BIB are also more culture sensitive, and should be applied with caution in cultures where honest discussion of blindspots is less than appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Gilad (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The methodological superiority of BIB games over other techniques received strong empirical support from a meta study on the effectivenes of predictions of competitive outcomes using "role playing".&lt;ref&gt;Kesten C. Green, “Game theory, simulated interaction, and unaided judgment for forecasting decisions in conflicts: Further evidence”, International Journal of Forecasting 21 (2005) 463– 472&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NWG (Pure Role-Play) ===
"Pure Role-Play" Negotiation War Games have shown to generate significantly better predictions of negotiation outcomes compared to other popular methods.&lt;ref&gt;Green, K. C. (2005), “Game theory, simulated interaction, and unaided judgment for forecasting decisions in conflicts,” International Journal of Forecasting, 21, 463-472&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure Role-Play" Negotiation War Games have also been shown to ensure significantly lower prices in procurement negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Robert J. (1991),“Simulated Negotiations: A Measure of their Effectiveness on Negotiated Outcome”. Naval Postgraduate School&lt;/ref&gt; and greater writedowns in auditor vs. client negotiations concerning obsolete inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Trotman, Ken T. (2005),“Auditor negotiations: An examination of the efficacy of intervention methods”.The Accounting Review, Vol. 80, No. 1. pp. 349-367&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure Role-Play" War Games have been used extensively in business negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Stuart (2010). ” Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World”. Crown Business&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure Role-Play" War Games are furthermore often used in politics. Negotiation War Gaming was used to prepare President Ronald Reagan for his negotiations with Gorbachev in Reykevik and Geneva in 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Matlock, J.F. Jr. (2004). Reagan and Gorbachev: How the cold war ended. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential candidate John Kerry used a Negotiation War Game to prepare for his first TV-duel with George W. Bush in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Wilgoren, J. &amp; Stevenson, R.W.  (2004). The 2004 campaign: Strategy; day after debate, campaigns assess the performances. The New York Times, October 2, Later edition – final, Section A, p. 10 column 1&lt;/ref&gt; Both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney used the method prior to the 2012 presidential TV-duels. The NTC (National Training Center, Fort Irwin. Ca.) recommend that all U.S. and Canadian Army officers be trained in the method before deployment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/PUB792.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Board Games ===
Board games can be used for business war games. In this case, they are [[wargaming|war games]] for civilians applied with a [[marketing warfare]] analogy to a market situation.&lt;ref&gt;Goria, S. [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00584200/fr/ Information display from board wargame for marketing strategy identification], International Competitive Intelligence Conference: Delivering excellence in Competitive Intelligence thinking and practice in a challenging environment, Bad Nauheim, Germany, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, these authors talk about [[creative competitive intelligence]].

== The war metaphor ==
To some, the war metaphor implicit in "business war game" is an accurate or useful depiction of business and competitive strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/55076/business-war|title=Business As War|last=Fuller|first=Mark B.|date=October 31, 1993|website=|publisher=Fast Company|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/shark-tank-investor-kevin-oleary-2015-2|title='Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary explains why business is war|last=Feloni|first=Richard|date=February 5, 2015|website=Business Insider|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others find the war metaphor potentially counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatifyourstrategy.com/2010/08/18/the-war-game-metaphor/|title=The War (Game) Metaphor|last=Chussil|first=Mark|date=August 18, 2010|website=|publisher=Advanced Competitive Strategies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/debunking-the-myth-that-business-is-war/|title=Debunking the Myth that Business is 'War'|last=Heffernan|first=Margaret|date=January 24, 2011|website=|publisher=CBS Moneywatch|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies play up the war metaphor simply to encourage out-of-the-box thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/27580/business-war-so-lets-have-war-game|title=Business is War - So Let's Have a War Game|last=Diamond|first=David|date=December 31, 1996|website=|publisher=Fast Company|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others downplay it with terms such as "strategy game."

'''Canned responses''' are predetermined responses to common questions.

In fields such as [[technical support]], canned responses to [[frequently asked question]]s may be quick and convenient for both the customer and the technical adviser. In text-based technical support systems, the [[operator (profession)|operator]] may insert a canned response triggered by keystrokes or from a drop-down menu, rather than typing the same answer repeatedly or pasting from some other resource. For example, if a support representative at an [[Internet service provider|ISP]]'s technical support team is asked to explain how to add an [[email attachment|attachment to an email]], rather than typing in all the details, the support representative may choose the response from a drop down menu, and it gets inserted into the response. The representative is more productive this way, and the user receives a more carefully crafted answer. Some programs have built-in functions which allow canned responses, and other software is available which can insert canned responses into any other application.

Canned responses, however, can have disadvantages. Sloppy or pressured support people could end up using canned responses as a quick fix when they actually do not really resolve the customer's problem or are only tangentially relevant to the user's problem.

'''Collaborative leadership''' is a management practice which is focused on leadership skills across functional and organizational boundaries.

==Term Exploration==
The phrase collaborative leadership first appeared in the mid-1990s in response to the twin trends of growth in [[strategic alliance]]s between private corporations, and the formation of long-term [[public private partnership]] contracts to rebuild [[public infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Kurt Lewin was first to apply cooperative system in scientific method in 1947 about individual nutrition in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Abdolhamid, A. (2016). School principals’ collaborative leadership style and relation it to teachers’ self-efficacy. International Journal of Research Studies in Education, Vol 5, Iss 3, Pp 3-12 (2016), (3), 3. doi:10.5861/ijrse.2015.1218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1994 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article "Collaborative Advantage", [[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]] addressed leaders who recognize that critical business relationships exist "that cannot be controlled by formal systems but require (a) dense web of interpersonal connections".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rosabeth Moss Kanter on the Frontiers of Management|first=Rosabeth Moss |last=Kanter|journal=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|year=2003|isbn=1-59139-323-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book published that same year, Chrislip and Larson looked at the attributes of great civic leaders in communities across the US and found some similar attributes. "Collaboration needs a different kind of leadership; it needs leaders who can safeguard the process, facilitate interaction and patiently deal with high levels of frustration"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Collaborative Leadership Fieldbook - A guide for citizens and civic leaders|first=David|last=Chrislip|publisher=Josey Bass|year=2002|isbn=0-7879-5719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2013, ''Harvard Business Review''&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;{{cite web | url=https://hbr.org/2013/02/why-the-world-needs-tri-sector.html | title=Why the World Needs Tri-Sector Leaders | work=Harvard Business Review | date=February 13, 2013 | accessdate=July 22, 2016 | author=Nick Lovegrove|author2=Matthew Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; authors [[Nick Lovegrove]] and Matthew Thomas (co-founders of The InterSector Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersector.com/ The InterSector Project]&lt;/ref&gt;), explore the complex relationship between the business, government and social sectors as it relates to said sectors role in addressing society's most pressing challenges; issues such as managing resource constraints, controlling health care costs, training the twenty-first-century workforce, developing and implementing smart-grid and intelligent-urbanization technologies, and stabilizing financial systems to foster sustainable economic growth.  Their research suggests that the future of collaborative leadership depends on the ability of leaders to engage and collaborate with the business, government and social sectors (see below for the distinguishing characteristics of such leaders).&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

Hank Rubin author and founder of the Institute for Collaborative Leadership has written "A collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome." In his book ''Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools,'' Rubin asks "Who is a collaborative leader?" and answers "You are a collaborative leader once you have accepted responsibility for building - or helping to ensure the success of - a heterogeneous team to accomplish a shared purpose . Your tools are (1) the purposeful exercise of your behavior, communication, and organizational resources in order to affect the perspective, beliefs, and behaviors of another person (generally a collaborative partner) to influence that person's relationship with you and your collaborative enterprise and (2) the structure and climate of an environment that supports the collaborative relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools|last1=Rubin|first1=Hank|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-6544-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin and Brock distinguish collaborative leadership from collective impact, defining the latter as "...(beginning) when we, as a community, agree to a set of shared outcomes and then, individually, return to our home organizations and work with our staffs, boards, and volunteers to figure out what we - individually and organizationally - can best do to achieve those shared goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/opinion/guest-column/2017/03/01/rochester-monroe-anti-poverty-effort-more-than-collaboration/98603876/|title=Rochester-Monroe anti-poverty effort more than collaboration|last=Brock {{!}} Rubin|first=Leonard {{!}} Hank|date=March 5, 2017|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative leadership is how we align and integrate across organizations.

David Archer and Alex Cameron, in their 2008 book ''Collaborative Leadership: How to succeed in an interconnected world'', identify the basic objective of the collaborative leader as the delivery of results across boundaries between different organisations. They say "Getting value from difference is at the heart of the collaborative leader's task... they have to learn to share control, and to trust a partner to deliver, even though that partner may operate very differently from themselves."&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative leadership – how to succeed in and interconnected world|first1=David|last1=Archer|first2=Alex|last2=Cameron|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7506-8705-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing further exploration, in his 2015 book ''Enabling Collaboration – Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships'' {{ISBN|9780986079337}}, Martin Echavarria argues that Collaborative Leadership is  the result of individual collaborative leadership capability, as well as group leadership. In this respect, he argues that individuals can support and contribute to collaboration and do so from a leadership point of view; but at the group level, where collaboration can be behaviorally experienced. Echavarria cites the work of [[Enrique Pichon-Rivière]], who developed the Operative Group method for working with groups, [[Wilfred Bion]] an influential British psychoanalyst, [[Kurt Lewin]] and others and describes the Operative Partnership Methodology for coaching teams to collaborate (an issue which is addressed vis-a-vis strategic alliances in said publication.&lt;ref&gt;Echavarria, Martin, (2015).

==Characteristics of collaborative leaders==
There have been a number of research projects and reviews of key lessons learned for collaborative leaders.

Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas, writing for the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'',&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt; interviewed over 100 leaders who possess a demonstrated ability to engage and collaborate across the business, government and social sectors.  The authors identified six major, distinguishing characteristics:&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

# Balanced motivations. A desire to create public value no matter where they work, combining their motivations to wield influence (often in government), have social impact (often in nonprofits) and generate wealth (often in business)
# Transferable skills. A set of distinctive skills valued across sectors, such as quantitative analytics, strategic planning and stakeholder management
# Contextual intelligence. A deep empathy of the differences within and between sectors, especially those of language, culture and key performance indicators
# Integrated networks. A set of relationships across sectors to draw on when advancing their careers, building top teams, or convening decision-makers on a particular issue
# Prepared mind. A willingness to pursue an unconventional career that zigzags across sectors, and the financial readiness to take potential pay cuts from time to time
# Intellectual thread. Holistic subject matter expertise on a particular intersector issue by understanding it from the perspective of each sector

[[Madeline Carter]], writing for the [[Center for Effective Public Policy]] as part of a research project funded by the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[State Justice Institute]], defines five qualities of a collaborative leader:&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Madeline M. (2006). ''[http://www.collaborativejustice.org/docs/The%20Importance%20of%20Collaborative%20Leadership.pdf The Importance of Collaborative Leadership in Achieving Effective Criminal Justice Outcomes]''. Center for Effective Public Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Willingness to take risks
# Eager listeners
# Passion for the cause
# Optimistic about the future
# Able to share knowledge, power and credit

Archer and Cameron list ten key lessons for successful collaborative leaders:&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

*Find the ''personal'' motive for collaborating
*Find ways of simplifying complex situations for your people
*Prepare for how you are going to handle conflict well in advance
*Recognize that there are some people or organisations you just can't partner with
*Have the courage to act for the long term
*Actively manage the tension between focusing on delivery and on building relationships
*Invest in strong personal relationships at all levels
*Inject energy, passion and drive into your leadership style
*Have the confidence to share the credit generously
*Continually develop your interpersonal skills, in particular: empathy, patience, tenacity, holding difficult conversations, and coalition building.

Rod Newing writing in a ''[[Financial Times]]'' supplement special report says "If a collaboration is to be effective, each party must recognise and respect the different culture of the other". And traditional development paths don't prepare leaders well for this "traditional management development, is based on giving potential managers a team of people and a set of resources to control – and success is rewarded with more people and more resources to control. By contrast, collaboration requires managers to achieve success through people and resources outside their control and for this they have had no preparation".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Steven Wilson mentions in “Collaborative leadership: it’s good to talk,” four major key leadership traits that all highly collaborative leaders share:
* Focus on authentic leadership; placing the goals of the organization ahead of their own self-interest and following through on their commitments
* Relentlessly pursue transparent decision making clear how their decisions are made and who is accountable for the outcomes
* View resources as instruments of action; realizing shared goals through the flexible use of shared resources
* Clarify the relationship between decisions, rights, accountability and rewards; taking time to establish decision paths and a common vocabulary that everyone can comprehend for successful collaborations
Chantale Mailhot, Stephanie Gagnon, Anne Langley and Louis-Felix Binitte did a research project to examine the qualities of distributing leadership and the effects diversity has on groups. They found that "coupling of leaders and objects helped to maintain the worldview of the different groups involved at different levels in the research project, while directing them towards project objectives".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In retrospect, the differences of each individual increases innovation due to the variety of minds at work. With everyone having their own qualities and prior experiences, the integration between them in a leadership role contributes to the overall experience. In this study, the case was made that collaborative leadership has many benefits and is more practical than just one person solely having the role as the leader.

The best thing a collaborative leader can do is to lead by example. They have to ‘walk the talk’, and be seen to model the right behaviors. Leaders must show a willingness take risks, continually question their own ideas, and reward others for their clear communication and valuable insights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=50202a11-e515-462e-b046-643cdfe41aa7@sessionmgr103&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=114|title=Collaborative leadership: it's good to talk.: ".Start Your Research"|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The need for collaborative leadership is being recognised in more and more areas;
#[[Public Private Partnership]]s
#Global [[Supply Chain]]s
#Civic collaboration to solve complex community problems
#On-line collaboration – [[Linux]], [[Wikipedia]] etc.
#Political collaboration to tackle global issues such as the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008|credit crunch]], [[Global warming|climate change]] and terrorism
#The Government-  According to Heather Getha-Taylor and Ricardo S. Morse as part of their article, collaborative leadership has an impact on the roles of local government officials. It is said that public administration is shifting to a more collaborative leadership oriented field, because it helps with the set of skills necessary for the jobs.&lt;ref&gt;GETHA-TAYLOR, H., &amp; MORSE, R. S. (2013). COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS: EXPLORING COMPETENCIES AND PROGRAM IMPACT. Public Administration Quarterly, (1). 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Education- According to Abdolhamid Arbabi and Vali Mehdinezhad collaborative leadership adds to cooperation which allows for adaptability and consistency. It “increases organizational commitment and decreases employee resistance to changes.” There is a significant correlation between the teachers self-efficiency and the principles style of collaborative leadership. According to Gialamas, Pelonis, and Medeiros collaborative leadership allows for leaders to work together. It allows for a better adaptability to change which in turn allows for “growth and development.”&lt;ref&gt;Arbabi, A., &amp; Mehdinezhad, V. (2015). The relationship between the school principals' collaborative leadership style and teachers' self-efficacy. ''Palestrica Of The Third Millennium Civilization &amp; Sport'', ''16''(2), 125-131.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Health Services- According to Markle-Reid, Dykeman, Ploeg, Stradiotto, Andrews, Bonomo, &amp; Stradiotto, collaborative leadership in the Health area will allow for a more widespread set of skills required to help the patients. An example brought up is the idea that the elderly do not receive the help they require because of the fact that the people do not know how to react in the given case. They know what to do, but when confronted by the situation they do not know how to act. Collaborative leadership will allow for the skills necessary as well as a uniform set of actions they must follow.&lt;ref&gt;Markle-Reid, M., Dykeman, C., Ploeg, J., Stradiotto, C. K., Andrews, A., Bonomo, S., &amp; ... Kelly Stradiotto, C. (2017). Collaborative leadership and the implementation of community-based fall prevention initiatives: a multiple case study of public health practice within community groups. ''BMC Health Services Research'', ''17''1-12. doi:10.1186/s12913-017-2089-3&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[Ipsos MORI]] research report published in 2007 found that relationship management and collaborative leadership were the top two qualities or capabilities that Directors of organisations involved in large business partnerships would have liked to have had more access to when setting up or running a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socia.co.uk/knowledge/Research.aspx|title=Business Partnerships Survey|year=2007|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''common fund''' is a form of [[collective investment scheme]] based upon contractual law rather than being enacted through a [[Trust law|trust]], [[corporation]] or [[insurance policy]].

The model for this type of arrangement is the [[Fonds commun de placement]] common in [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]].  The [[common contractual fund]] in [[Ireland]] is another prominent example.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13128">A '''copyright transfer agreement''' is a legal document containing provisions for the conveyance of full or partial [[copyright]] from the rights owner to another party. It is similar to [[contract]]s signed between [[author]]s and [[publisher]]s but does not normally involve the payment of remuneration or [[royalties]].&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gadd | first1 = E. | last2 = Oppenheim | first2 = C. | last3 = Probets | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1087/095315103322422053 | title = RoMEO studies 4: An analysis of journal publishers' copyright agreements | journal = Learned Publishing | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 293 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such agreements are a key element of [[Subscription business model|subscription]]-based [[academic publishing]],&lt;ref name=Friedman1982&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Friedman | first1 = B.

== History ==
Copyright transfer agreements became common in the publishing business after the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] in the United States and similar legislation in other countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1107/S0021889878012753 | title = Transfer of Copyright | journal = Journal of Applied Crystallography | volume = 11 | pages = 63–64 | year = 1978 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; redefined copyright as accruing to the author from the moment of creation (rather than publication) of a work.&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998/&gt; This required publishers to acquire copyrights from the author in order to sell the works or access to it, and written statements signed by the rights owner became necessary in order for the copyright transfer to be considered valid.&lt;ref name=Friedman1982/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#204 Section 204] of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
{{Quotation|The situation in which authors hold the copyright usually involves considerable effort in the form of correspondence and record keeping and often leads to unnecessary delays. Although this may appear to be trivial for a few requests, a good scholarly journal publishing exciting papers can expect several hundred requests per year; a task of this magnitude can become onerous. On the other hand, if the Journal holds the copyright, requests, value judgements, and permissions can be handled expeditiously to the satisfaction of all concerned.|J. Lagowski (1982)&lt;ref name=Lagowski1982/&gt;}}

Granting publishers the permission to copy, display and distribute the work is necessary for publishers to act as such, and copyright transfer agreements across a wide range of publishers have such provisions.&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gaeta | first1 = T. J. | title = Authorship: "Law" and Order | doi = 10.1111/j.1553-2712.1999.tb00393.x | journal = Academic Emergency Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–301 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10230981| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reach of copyright transfer agreements can go well beyond that, and "[s]ome publishers require that, to the extent possible, copyright be transferred to them."&lt;ref name=Friedman1982/&gt; This means that no one, including the authors, can reuse text, tables, or figures in other publications without first getting permission from the new copyright owner.&lt;ref name="understand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berquist | first1 = T.

Copyright transfer agreements also ask that the authors confirm to actually own the copyright for all the materials pertaining to a given act of publishing, and that the item for which the copyright is to be transferred has not been previously published and is not under consideration to be published elsewhere,&lt;ref name="understand"/&gt; to limit the frequency of [[duplicate publication]] and [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = I. S. | last2 = Spector | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1088/1748-6041/7/1/010201 | title = Coping with copying and conflicts (of interest) | journal = Biomedical Materials | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 010201 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22287538| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Critics have said that the copyright transfer agreement in commercial scholarly publishing is "as much about ensuring long–term asset management as it is about providing service to the academic community" because the practice seems to grant favor to the publisher in a way that does not obviously benefit the authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willinsky|first=John|title=Copyright Contradictions in Scholarly Publishing|journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|date=4 November 2002|volume=7|issue=11|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1006/927|accessdate=20 February 2012|doi=10.5210/fm.v7i11.1006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright transfer agreements often conflict with [[self-archiving]] practices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gadd | first1 = E. | last2 = Oppenheim | first2 = C. | last3 = Probets | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1108/00220410310698239 | title = RoMEO studies 1: The impact of copyright ownership on academic author self-archiving | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 243 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or appear to do so due to ambiguous language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = A. | title = Self-archiving and the Copyright Transfer Agreements of ISI-ranked library and information science journals | doi = 10.1002/asi.20494 | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 286 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3767615587113113566&amp;q=Storix&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,29 Johnson v. Storix] upheld a copyright transfer involving no written assignment. In that case, the Author, Anthony Johnson sold software as a sole proprietor and incorporated his company in 2003 as Storix, Inc. Eight years later he gave 60% share of the corporation to his employees, who later removed him from the company and claimed ownership of the copyrights. The court upheld a  jury decision that Johnson had made an oral agreement to transfer the copyright to the corporation upon its formation based on an annual report he wrote and signed a year later stating that he had transferred “all assets” from his sole proprietorship. The jury rejected Johnson's claim he intended only to transfer the license to sell the software, and further decided that Johnson became a work for hire upon forming the corporation, thereby also forfeiting all rights to his derivative works. This is the first case in which a document, not itself a contract or agreement and containing no reference to the copyrights, was considered a “note or memorandum” of copyright transfer, and the first time a sole owner of a company was designated a work for hire for copyright ownership purposes. This serves as a lesson that a “writing” required by the Copyright Act need not necessarily be “clear”, but may contain ambiguous language which can be interpreted by course of dealing by third parties to the alleged transaction.  

== Other models ==
Copyright transfer agreements are one way to govern permissions based on copyright. Since the advent of digital publishing, various commentators have pointed out the benefits of author-retained copyright,&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilbanks2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilbanks | first1 = J. | authorlink = John Wilbanks| title = Another reason for opening access to research | doi = 10.1136/sbmj.39063.730660.F7 | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7582 | pages = 1306–1308 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17185718 | pmc =1761190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishers have started to implement it&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Watt | first1 = F. M. | last2 = Sever | first2 = R. | title = Non-profit publishing: Open access and the end of copyright transfer | doi = 10.1242/jcs.00873 | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 117 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 1 | year = 2004 | pmid =  14657267| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; using license agreements, wherein the author of the work retains copyright and gives the publisher the permission (exclusive or not) to reproduce and distribute the work. A third model is the so-called "browse-wrap" or "click-wrap" license model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burk|first=Dan L.|title=Intellectual Property in the Context of e-Science |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2007|volume=12|issue=2|url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol12/issue2/burk.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is becoming more and more popular in the form of the [[Creative Commons]] licenses: it allows anyone (including the publisher) to reproduce and distribute the work, with some possible restrictions. Creative Commons licenses are used by many [[open access journal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molloy | first1 = J. C. | title = The Open Knowledge Foundation: Open Data Means Better Science | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = e1001195 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22162946 | pmc = 3232214 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author addenda ==
Copyright transfer agreements are usually prepared by the publisher, and some print journals include a copy of the statement in every issue they published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00348410 | title = Forthcoming papers | journal = Applied Physics A: Solids and Surfaces | volume = 59 | pages = A5–A5 | year = 1994 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If authors wish to deviate from the default phrasing&amp;nbsp;– ''e.g.'', if they want to retain copyright or would not like to grant the publisher an exclusive right to publish&amp;nbsp;– they can specify desired modifications, either by editing the document directly or by attaching an [[addendum#In contracts|addendum]] to a copy of the default version. Publisher policies on the acceptance of such addenda vary, though. Some institutions offer instructions and assistance for staff in creating such addenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author rights: using the SPARC Author Addendum to secure your rights as the author of a journal article|url=http://www.sparc.arl.org/resources/authors/addendum|work=SPARC|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amend a Publishing Agreement|url=https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/authors/amend|work=Harvard University Library|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change would be regarded as objectionable if it took place in a single step or short period. 

The phrase was coined by American scientist, [[Jared Diamond]], in his 2005 book, [[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]].  He had previously alluded to this theory while attempting to explain why in the course of long-term [[environmental degradation]], [[Easter Island]] natives would, seemingly irrationally, chop down the last tree:&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;{{cite web |last1=Diamond |first1=Jared |authorlink1=Jared Diamond |title=Easter's End |url= http://discovermagazine.com/1995/aug/eastersend543|publisher=Discover magazine |access-date=2014-08-03 |date=1995-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"I suspect, though, that the disaster happened not with a bang but with a whimper. After all, there are those hundreds of abandoned statues to consider. The forest the islanders depended on for rollers and rope didn't simply disappear one day--it vanished slowly, over decades."|sign=|source=}}

In his book, Diamond also refers to creeping normality as landscape amnesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fogg|first=Graham E.|last2=LaBolle|first2=Eric M. | name-list-format = vanc |date=14 March 2006|title=Motivation of synthesis, with an example on groundwater quality sustainability |journal=Water Resources Research|volume=42|pages=W03S05|via=Google Scholar | doi = 10.1029/2005WR004372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Other uses==
Creeping normality has been used to explain a number of different phenomenon, including the ones listed below: 

=== Obese and overweight maternity patients ===
The term has also been used several times in conjunction with the increase of maternity patients who present as [[Obesity|obese]] and [[overweight]]. In their research article, authors Wilkinson, Poad, and Stapleton suggest that as the number of clinically obese or overweight pregnant women increase, the negative stigmatization with being so decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson SA, Poad D, Stapleton H | title = Maternal overweight and obesity: a survey of clinicians' characteristics and attitudes, and their responses to their pregnant clients | journal = BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth | volume = 13 | pages = 117 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23692981 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2393-13-117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmeid, et al, states that as doctors see more women of an unhealthy weight, they are less likely to advise healthy weight gain goals during [[pregnancy]], out of fear of [[Social stigma of obesity|fat-shaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmied VA, Duff M, Dahlen HG, Mills AE, Kolt GS | title = 'Not waving but drowning': a study of the experiences and concerns of midwives and other health professionals caring for obese childbearing women | journal = Midwifery | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 424–30 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 20381222 | doi = 10.1016/j.midw.2010.02.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mills A, Schmied VA, Dahlen HG | title = 'Get alongside us', women's experiences of being overweight and pregnant in Sydney, Australia | journal = Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–21 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 22168548 | doi = 10.1111/j.1740-8709.2011.00386.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the shift in society to accept women of all body types has been so slow, physicians may not be aware that they are not addressing the [[Gestational age|gestational]] weight gain as soon as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller M, Hearn L, van der Pligt P, Wilcox J, Campbell KJ | title = Preventing maternal and early childhood obesity: the fetal flaw in Australian perinatal care | journal = Australian Journal of Primary Health | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–7 | date = 2014-06-06 | pmid = 24176286 | doi = 10.1071/PY13080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous survey was conducted from January to April, 2010, of obstetrics and gynecology residents. Of those surveyed, only "7.6 percent selected correct BMI ranges for each category, and only 5.8 percent selected correct gestational weight gain ranges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore Simas TA, Waring ME, Sullivan GM, Liao X, Rosal MC, Hardy JR, Berry RE | title = Institute of medicine 2009 gestational weight gain guideline knowledge: survey of obstetrics/gynecology and family medicine residents of the United States | journal = Birth | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 237–46 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24344704 | pmc = 3974574 | doi = 10.1111/birt.12061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Family Businesses ===
Antheaume and Barbelivien described the creeping normality that destroys businesses, causing them to not see the subtle, negative shifts in the community around them. The authors state that owners of [[Family business|family businesses]] are more likely to notice the small changes than a large [[corporation]], however "detecting a problem is no guarantee of the ability to solve it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283300199_Why_do_family_businesses_die_An_investigation_through_the_work_of_an_ethnologist_and_geographer_on_the_collapse_of_human_societies |title=Why do family businesses die? An investigation through the work of an ethnologist and geographer on the collapse of human societies| vauthors = Antheaume N, Barbelivien D | website=Research Gate }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Cybercrime ===
In his thesis, Chon states that the increase in [[cybercrime]] fits the pattern for creeping normality. The number of websites involved in "[[Security hacker|hacking]] and cybercrime activities"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Chon K | date=June 2016|title=Cybercrime precursors: Towards a model of offender resources|url=|journal=Australian National University|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has increased at a slow and steady pace, mostly below society's awareness. 

=== IPS-Nathan Lecture Series ===
Peter Ho referred to creeping normality in his four-part [[Institute of Policy Studies (Singapore)|IPS]]-Nathan lecture series in spring of 2017. In regards to several issues that [[Singapore]] is facing, he claimed that "things get just a little bit worse each year than the year before, but not bad enough for anyone to notice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Challenges of Governance in a Complex World|last=Tan|first=Ariel|last2=Ho|first2=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Company Pte Limited|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is through [[climate change]], where he stated that the country did not realize an increase of flooding was caused by rising temperatures, and not poor drainage as first suspected.

'''CricHQ''' is a digital platform for sport which combines competition management and administration software with live scoring and statistics for [[cricket]] clubs.&lt;ref name=Hutching&gt;{{cite news|author=Hutching, Gerard|date=June 16, 2015|title=Singaporean firm invests US$10m in New Zealand cricket tech company|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/69450909/singaporean-firm-invests-us10m-in-new-zealand-cricket-tech-company|work=Stuff|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20170125/sports/bassarath-don8217t-run-from-progress|title=Bassarath: Don’t run from progress|last=|first=|date=|website=Trinidad Express|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, and was set up by CEO Simon Baker and former New Zealand cricketers [[Stephen Fleming]] and [[Brendon McCullum]]. It manages the administration of cricket test countries New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Zimbabwe. A number of other national governing bodies also use its services from club level upwards (see National Governing Bodies section below).&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite news|author=Harris, Catherine|date=October 30, 2015|title=NZ's CricHQ scores digital deals with Zimbabwe and South Africa|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/73511988/NZs-CricHQ-scores-digital-deals-with-Zimbabwe-and-South-Africa|work=Stuff|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company provides a range of digital services to cricket organisations that typically use paper-based administration and scoring. The services include instant updates for fans, performance insights for coaches and the ability to set up cricket-related social networks. It also makes it easier to register players, organise competition draws and analyse demographics of sport participants.

When the app was launched it was briefly one of the world's most downloaded sporting apps &lt;ref name=Rutherford&gt;{{cite news|author=Hamish, Rutherford|date=September 11, 2016|title=From unstable start-up, CricHQ bids for global domination of cricket scoring|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/83774547/from-unstable-startup-crichq-bids-for-global-domination-of-cricket-scoring|work=Fairfax|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then it has amassed over 1&amp;nbsp;million Facebook fans.&lt;ref name=LIN&gt;{{cite news|author=Tao, Lin|date=August 22, 2016|title=New academy launches to educate SMEs on social media|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/small-business/83294086/New-academy-launches-to-educate-SMEs-on-social-media|work=Fairfax|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has been described as "one of New Zealand’s largely unsung tech success stories" by one of New Zealand's leading technology journalists.&lt;ref name=KeallC&gt;{{cite news|author=Keall, Chris|date=September 2, 2016|title=Stephen Fleming and Brendon McCullum as software billionaires?|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/crichq-ck|work=NBR|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, CricHQ's then-Executive Chair, Mike Loftus, was invited to visit [[India]] with New Zealand's Prime Minister, [[John Key]], as part of a trade delegation.&lt;ref name=NicholasJones&gt;{{cite news|author=Jones, Nicholas|date=October 17, 2016|title=McCullum jets off with Key to open doors for cricket firm expansion in India|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11734371|work=NZHerald|accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, former [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] Chair and CEO [[Kevin Roberts (businessman)]] was appointed as Chair of CricHQ's board.&lt;ref name="HamishMcNicol"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/97988030/wellington-technology-company-crichq-placed-in-receivership-after-failing-to-attract-new-investment|title=Wellington technology company CricHQ placed in receivership|last=|first=|date=October 17, 2017|work=Fairfax|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, CricHQ was put in voluntary receivership by majority shareholders [[Tembusu Partners Private Limited|Tembusu Partners]] who appointed insolvency experts KordaMentha to sell the business. CricHQ was purchased by a group of private investors and continues to trade.

== Video content ==
In 2017, CricHQ acquired My Action Replay, a sportstech company based in [[Bristol]]. My Action Replay provides cameras and the capability for sports teams to [[Streaming media|livestream]] their games and to package up highlights to be hosted online. With CricHQ's customer base, the acquisition of My Action Replay could make CricHQ the largest broadcaster of cricket in the world.&lt;ref name=HMcNicol&gt;{{cite news|author=McNicol, Hamish|date=March 2, 2017|title=CricHQ wants to become world's largest cricket broadcaster after buying video business|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/89937880/crichq-wants-to-become-worlds-largest-cricket-broadcaster-after-buying-video-business|work=Fairfax|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investment ==
In June 2015 CricHQ raised US$10m from Singapore private equity firm [[Tembusu Partners Private Limited|Tembusu Partners]] to expand globally including a doubling of staff in India, the world's largest cricketing nation.&lt;ref name=GerardHutching&gt;{{cite news|author=Hutching, Gerard|date=June 16, 2015|title=Singaporean firm invests US$10m in New Zealand cricket tech company|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/69450909/singaporean-firm-invests-us10m-in-new-zealand-cricket-tech-company|work=Fairfax|accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 it was revealed that CricHQ was seeking further investment of US$10M and was in discussions with [[Investment Banking|investment bankers]] in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]]. It also stated that the company was valued at US$70M while forecast to make a loss of more than US$4m in the 2016/17 financial year.&lt;ref name=Rutherford2&gt;{{cite news|author=Rutherford, Hamish|date=September 20, 2016|title=Wellington's CricHQ seeks US$10 million from investors for expansion|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/84465086/wellingtons-crichq-seeks-us10-million-from-investors-for-expansion|work=Fairfax|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incoming Chair [[Kevin Roberts (businessman)]] revealed that he had invested a "seven figure" sum in the company in December 2016.&lt;ref name=HamishMcNicol/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2226">'''Critical process parameters''' (CPP) in pharmaceutical manufacturing are key variables affecting the production process. CPPs are attributes that are monitored to detect deviations in standardized production operations and product output quality or changes in [[Critical Quality Attributes]]. Those attributes with a higher impact on CQAs should be prioritized and held in a stricter state of control. The manufacturer should conduct test to set acceptable range limits of the determined CPPs and define acceptable process variable variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Determining Criticality-Process Parameters and Quality Attributes Part I: Criticality as a Continuum|url=http://www.biopharminternational.com/biopharm/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=830461&amp;pageID=1|publisher=biopharminternational|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operational conditions within this range are considered acceptable operational standards. Any deviation from the acceptable range will be indicative of issues within the process and the subsequent production of substandard products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Process Parameters and Critical Quality Attributes: Why Does the Selection Process Take so Long?|url=http://www.propharmagroup.com/blog/critical-process-parameters-and-critical-quality-attributes-why-does-selection-process-take-so|publisher=ProPharma Group|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data relating to CPP should be recorded, stored, and analyzed by the manufacturer. CPP variables and ranges should be reevaluated after careful analysis of historical CPP data. Identifying CPPs is done in stage one of [[Process Validation]]: [[Process design]] are an essential part of a manufacturing control strategy.

One method of defining CPPs is to look at the effect of certain production processes on critical quality attributes. Those production parameters which have a measurable effect on those quality attributes that have been identified as critical can be considered CPPs and must always be in a state of control.

==History==

Originally known as the Donor Assistance Database, the DAD was re-branded as the Development Assistance Database on August 2, 2005. The first Donor Assistance Database was a [[Personal Computer|PC]] system developed in the scope of the G7 Support Implementation Group project for &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnabz352.pdf|title=Business Toolkit for Russian Enterprises "Professional Associations Component"|date=1996-09-01|website=|publisher=Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu JLA Group Ltd.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Russia]] in 1996 to monitor aid assistance donated from the international community. The first Donor Assistance Database tracked 20,000 projects and over US $100 billion in Official Development Assistance delivered between 1991 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/ccsi/print/region/directry.htm|title=Directory of U.S. Technical Assistance Activities in Russia|date=1996-09-01|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DAD was then adapted as a tool for the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union to monitor development assistance from the international community. These first generation implementations include [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Tajikistan]].

Most of these implementations have taken place through a partnership between the software company Synergy International Systems, and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP). This partnership led to the signing of a Long Term Agreement in July, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sz.undp.org/content/dam/swaziland/docs/publications/UNDP_SZ_Poverty_DonorDatabaseStudy2012.pdf|title=Study to Establish a Donor database in the Kingdom of Swaziland|date=2012-09-01|website=|publisher=Government of Swaziland With Support from UNDP|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions and Capabilities&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
'''Online, offline and mobile collection of aid information''' – DAD’s customized data entry forms with validation control enable to submit and update aid information though web-based interface, in offline mode which is specifically for use in areas with limited or no Internet access as well as through smartphones and tablets.

'''Sector Profile''' – This functionality displays aggregate data related to particular sectors, including aid flows and projects in a given sector, donors involved, and results achieved. The Sector Profile can have all relevant information on sector portfolio performance, logistics etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20040413005218/en/Synergy-International-Systems-Provide-Donor-Assistance-Management|title=Synergy International Systems to Provide Donor Assistance Management for Iraqi Reconstruction Efforts|date=2004-04-13|website=|publisher=Business Wire|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E''''')'' – DAD enables to link aid projects with the government's policy priorities and national development strategies, and monitor progress in respect to targets/goals to track progress toward development results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalplanning.gov.ng/images/docs/DADNigeria/DAD%202nd%20Quarter%20report%202014.pdf|title=Development Assistance Database (DAD Nigeria) 2nd Quarter REPORT 2014|last=Henry Asor|date=2014-07-03|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data visualization and analytics''' – DAD offers a suite of web-based querying, analytics, visualization, and reporting tools - graphs, charts, tables, reports– for visualizing and interpreting aid information.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://info.undp.org/docs/pdc/Documents/UKR/Project%20Document_Support%20to%20better%20coordination%20and%20management%20of%20international%20aid%20assistance%20%20_DAD.pdf|title=Support to better coordination and management of international aid/assistance ( through establishment of the development assistance database DAD)|date=2012-03-29|website=|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Executive dashboard''' – This decision-support tool displays data snapshots of aid flows (pledges, commitments, disbursements, and expenditures) and enables simultaneous viewing of all analytical outputs.

'''Geographic Information System -''' DAD platform contains a Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping feature that allows to view geo-referenced data on project activities and results at various geographic levels and also to query or filter data on the web-based dynamic maps.

'''Aid Effectiveness Portal''' – DAD provides a range of knowledge sharing and collaboration tools to make aid information available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2010/04/22/new-online-portal-to-promote-efficient-use-of-aid-in-haitian-earthquake-recovery.html|title=New online portal to promote efficient use of aid in Haiti|date=2010-04-22|website=|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integration''' – DAD can interface with relevant external and internal data sources in order to automate data exchange to enable effective flow of information and prevent duplication of effort and silos of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidtransparency.net/reports/IATI-annual-report-2014.pdf|title=Annual Report 2014|date=|website=|publisher=International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DAD Rwanda is Rwanda’s official development aid (ODA) coordination system. It is used by the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MINECOFIN) to track and manage aid funds and development results across all major donors and NGOs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The system captures the national Donor Performance Assessment Framework (DPAF) mutual accountability framework, indicators and standard definitions and is used for annual Rwanda ODA Effectiveness reports. In 2010 an upgrade of the DAD resulted in establishing a new MTEF module with the view of systematically capturing forward-spending plans of Development Partners to feed into the MTEF process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/derec/unitedkingdom/11_EvaluationSupportPublicFinanceManagement%20ReformRwanda.pdf|title=Rwanda: Independent Evaluation of the Implementation of the PFM Reform Strategy 2008-2012|date=2012-11-01|website=|publisher=ECORYS Nederland BV|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAD Rwanda was also integrated with Rwanda’s SmartFMIS budgeting platform that resulted in more external funds flowing directly to Ministry of Planning for spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aidtransparency.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IATI-Country-Pilots.pdf|title=IATI Delivering at National Level|last=Ronald Nkusi, MINECOFIN, Rwanda|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparent governance has improved Rwanda’s Business Environment rankings and Rwanda’s data-driven model for aid management has been emulated by Burundi, Cameroon, Mauritania and Central African Republic.

=== Iraq ===
Launched in 2011 Iraq Development Management System (IDMS) is a web-based planning, budgeting and results tracking system used by the Iraq Ministry of Planning (MoP) to manage the entire cycle of government and donor-funded projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gcn.com/articles/2004/05/03/database-will-help-track-international-aid-in-iraq.aspx|title=Database will help track international aid in Iraq|last=Dawn S. Onley|date=2004-06-03|website=gcn.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IDMS covers 3000 projects with a total value of US$186 billion under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2010-2014. The system automates submission of new project proposals, annual and monthly budget preparation, advanced performance tracking, analysis, and reporting features. It uses both English and Arabic, and provides public access to data on key accountability metrics. IDMS was developed in partnership with UNDP, USAID-Tatweer, the EU and UNOPS.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Tsunami recovery systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacificdisaster.net/pdnadmin/data/original/ADB_2006_PN40157_REG_TAR.pdf|title=Support for Strengthening the Tsunami Development Assistance Database|date=2006-06-01|website=|publisher=Asian Development Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Following the devastating [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Asian tsunami]] with the support of UNDP, Development Assistance Database was established in tsunami affected countries - Sri Lanka, Maldives and Thailand and Indonesia, to track financial and technical assistance, as well as results related to tsunami recovery work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/site/adboecdanti-corruptioninitiative/partnerships/36771059.pdf|title=Knowledge commitment action against corruption in Asia and the Pacific|date=2006-01-01|website=|publisher=Asian Development Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DAD Sri Lanka''' – The Integrated National Development Information System (INDIS) was first introduced in Sri Lanka in 2005 following the devastating 2004 Asian tsunami to help the Government of Sri Lanka to track disaster needs, plan recovery programs and promote visibility and accountability in project spending and performance.&lt;ref name="Business Wire"/&gt; INDIS allowed reconstruction agencies to report their projects and share information on objectives, funding sources, implementation partners and project progress online, with the ultimate goal of facilitating efficient aid coordination.

'''DAD Indonesia''' - Synergy built the Recovery Aceh Nias (RAN) Database for the Government of Indonesia to support its coordination and management of the post-tsunami recovery effort. The RAN assisted the Government to align proposed projects with national reconstruction priorities, ensuring a coordinated plan for the delivery of aid. The RAN Database was the central tool for coordinating tsunami recovery activities and to date has tracked $3.7 billion in disbursements. Synergy was awarded the Innovative Government Technology Award in the Information Management category at the 2008 FutureGov Summit for the development of the Recovery Aceh Nias (RAN) Database installed for the BRR – Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency of the Government of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacificdisaster.net/pdnadmin/data/original/ADB_2009_PN40157_09REG_TACR.pdf|title=Regional: Support for Strengthening the Tsunami Development Assistance Database|last=Aidan Cox|date=2009-04-01|website=|publisher=Asian Development Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DAD Maldives''' - Synergy was contracted by the government of Maldives to implemented the Development Assistance Database (DAD) that was later linked with the National Recovery Reconstruction Plan (NRRP). This helped to implement a key tenet of the Paris Declaration by “aligning” projects with national priorities as outlined in the NRRP and add the accountability mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/countries/maldives/47865168.pdf|title=ASSESSMENT OF DEVELOPMENT RESULTS,EVALUATION OF UNDP CONTRIBUTI ON MALDIVES|date=2010-03-01|website=|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DAD Thailand''' - Synergy customized the DAD for the Thailand International Cooperation Agency located within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Launched in 2005, DAD Thailand, has significantly improved coordination and monitoring of the long-term international support to tsunami recovery in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/site/adboecdanti-corruptioninitiative/regionalseminars/35593179.pdf|title=Corruption, development and human rights – Fighting corruption as a means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals|last=Patrick Keuleers|date=|website=|publisher=UNDP Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacific – Bangkok|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DAD Community of Practice ==
The Development Assistance Database (DAD) Community of Practice (CoP) is a global forum of practitioners who share a common commitment to advancing development effectiveness through the application of DAD.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africa-platform.org/sites/default/files/resources/DAD%20CoP%202011%20Synthesis%20Report.pdf|title=Taking Stock of the DAD Community of Practice 2009-2011|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major event of the DAD CoP is a biennial conference that brings together participants representing governments, aid agencies, civil society organizations, think-tanks, and the private sector. The conference centers on a workshop that features case studies in implementing DAD to improve management of development data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/46080636.pdf|title=South Africa—Development in the Southern African region|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">The '''dignity of labour''' is the philosophy that all types of [[Job (role)|jobs]] are respected equally, and no occupation is considered superior and none of the jobs should be discriminated on any basis . Though one's occupation for his or her livelihood involves physical work or mental labour, it is held that the job carries dignity compared to the jobs that involve more intellect than body. Social reformers such as [[Basava]] and his contemporary Sharanas, as well as [[Mahatma Gandhi]], were prominent advocates of the dignity of labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Suryanarayanan |first=A.

The Dignity of Labour is one of the major themes in the [[Christian ethics]],&lt;ref name="Osborn1940"&gt;{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Andrew Rule|title=Christian Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r6BuAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 July 2016|year=1940|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|page=64|quote=This conception of the divine dignity of work is distinctive of Hebrew and Christian Ethics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, it is upheld by the [[Anglican Communion]],&lt;ref name="Norman2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Edward|title=An Anglican Catechism|date=1 May 2003|publisher=A&amp;C Black|language=English |isbn=9780826467003|page=146|quote=The Church upholds the dignity of labour, whether it is in productive or service work, or whether it is in the rearing of children and the maintenance of the home.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Catholic social teaching]], in [[Methodist]] principles,&lt;ref name="Bundy1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bundy|first=Colin|title=The Rise and Fall of the South African Peasantry|year=1979|publisher=University of California Press|language=English|isbn=9780520037540|page=39|quote=Methodist teaching, especially, favoured the creation of wage-earners and stressed the dignity of labour and desirability of manual skills.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Reformed]] theology.&lt;ref name="Ogier1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogier|first=Darryl Mark|title=Reformation and Society in Guernsey|year=1996|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|language=English|isbn=9780851156033|page=173|quote=Work discipline was engendered through such measures, and through the general (Calvinist-inspired) emphasis on the dignity of labour in one's calling.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman Catholicism, usually titled "The Dignity of work and the rights of workers" the affirmation of the Dignity of Human Labour is found in several Papal [[encyclical]]s, most notably [[Pope John Paul II]]'s ''[[Laborem Exercens]]'' published September 15, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/what-we-believe/catholic-social-teaching/the-dignity-of-work-and-the-rights-of-workers.cfm|title=The Dignity of Work and the Rights of Workers|website=www.usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was defined by [[David Teece]], Gary Pisano and Amy Shuen, in their 1997 paper ''Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management'', as "the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments".&lt;ref name="Teece et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last2 = Pisano|first2 = Gary|last3 = Shuen|first3 = Amy|date = August 1997|title = Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199708)18:7%3C509::AID-SMJ882%3E3.0.CO;2-Z/epdf|journal = [[Strategic Management Journal]]|volume = 18|issue = 7|pages = 509–533|last1 = Teece|first1 = David|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used in the plural form, '''dynamic capabilities''', emphasizing that the ability to react adequately and timely to external changes requires a combination of multiple capabilities.

== Overview ==
The phrase "dynamic capabilities" was introduced in a working paper by [[David Teece]], [[Gary Pisano]], and Amy Shuen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Teece |first1=David |last2=Pisano |first2=Gary |last3=Shuen |first3=Amy |title=Firm Capabilities, Resources, and the Concept of Strategy |date=1990 |publisher=Center for Research on Management |location=University of California, Berkeley |edition=CCC Working Paper 90–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;The final, peer-reviewed version was published in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teece |first1=David J. |last2=Pisano |first2=Gary |last3=Shuen |first3=Amy |title=Dynamic capabilities and strategic management |journal=Strategic Management Journal |date=August 1997 |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=509–533 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199708)18:7%3C509::AID-SMJ882%3E3.0.CO;2-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of dynamic capabilities is similar in some ways to the previously existing concept of operational capabilities; the latter pertains to the current operations of an organization, whereas the former, by contrast, refers to an organization's capacity to efficiently and responsively change these operations and develop its resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helfat|first1=Constance E. |last2=Finkelstein |first2=Sydney |last3=Mitchell |first3=Will |last4=Peteraf |first4=Margaret |last5=Singh |first5=Harbir |last6=Teece |first6=David |last7=Winter |first7=Sidney G. |title=Dynamic Capabilities: Understanding Strategic Change in Organizations |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781405182065 |url= https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=u0Tuh5vixLkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=%22Dynamic+Capabilities:+Understanding+strategic+change+in+organizations |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main assumption of this framework is that an organization's basic competencies should be used to create short-term competitive positions that can be developed into longer-term competitive advantage. Nelson and Winter, in their 1982 book ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'', link the growth of the concept of dynamic capabilities to the [[resource-based view]] of the firm and  the concept of "routines" in evolutionary theories of organization.&lt;ref name="Nelson1982"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard R. |last=Nelson |title=An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change |year=1982 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-27228-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douma and Scheuder describe it as a bridge between the economics-based strategy literature and evolutionary approaches to organizations.&lt;ref name="DoumaSchreuder2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douma |first1=Sytse |authorlink1=Sytse Douma |last2=Schreuder |first2=Hein |authorlink2=Hein Schreuder |title=Economic Approaches to Organizations |edition=Third |year=2002 |publisher=Financial Times Prentice Hall |isbn=9780273651994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resource-based view of the firm emphasizes sustainable competitive advantage; the dynamic capabilities view, on the other hand, focuses more on the issue of competitive survival in response to rapidly changing contemporary business conditions.  Strategy scholars Gregory Ludwig and Jon Pemberton, in one of the few empirical studies on the topic, called for clarification of the specific processes of dynamic capability building in particular industries to make the concept more useful to senior managers who set directions for their firms.&lt;ref name="Ludwig 2011 pp.215-236"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ludwig|first1=Gregory |last2=Pemberton |first2=Jon |title=A managerial perspective of dynamic capabilities in emerging markets: The case of the Russian steel industry |journal=Journal for East European Management Studies |issn=0949-6181 |year=2011 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=215–236 |jstor= 23281688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic capabilities theory concerns the development of strategies for senior managers of successful companies to adapt to radical discontinuous change, while maintaining minimum capability standards to ensure competitive survival.  For example, industries which have traditionally relied on a specific manufacturing process can't always change this process on short notice when a new technology arrives; when this happens, managers need to adapt their own routines to make the most of their existing resources while simultaneously planning for future process changes  as the resources depreciate.&lt;ref name="Ludwig 2011 pp.215-236"/&gt;

The New Dynamic Capabilities framework, posed by Amy Shuen in her analysis of Web 2.0, focuses on the firm's ability to quickly orchestrate and reconfigure externally sourced competences,ranging from Apple, Google Android, IBM Linux developer ecosystems to crowdsourced, crowdfunded open innovations such as the Obama08 mobile app—while leveraging internal resources such as platforms, know-how, user communities and digital, social and mobile networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shuen |first1=Amy |last2=Sieber |first2=Sandra |title=Orchestrating the New Dynamic Capabilities |journal=IESE Insight Review|date=2009 |issue=3 |pages=58–65 |url= http://www.ieseinsight.com/review/articulo.aspx?doc=5445&amp;seccion=6 |accessdate=7 December 2017 |doi=10.15581/002.art-1605}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shuen |first=Amy |title=Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide: Business thinking and strategies behind successful Web 2.0 implementations |year=2008 |publisher=O'Reilly Media |isbn=9780596553753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Dynamic Capabilities framework takes into account digital, information and network economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro |first1=Carl |last2=Varian |first2=Hal R. |title=Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard Business Review Press |isbn=9780875848631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fall of the transaction costs of involved in using specialized services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williamson |first=Oliver E. |title=Nobel Prize Lecture: Transaction Cost Economics: The Natural Progression |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2009/williamson-lecture.html |website=nobelprize.org |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Philip Cordes-Berszinn, though, more research is needed in order to measure the "capabilities" and to appropriately apply the ideas to practical management situations.&lt;ref name=berszinn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordes-Berszinn|first1=Philip|title=Dynamic Capabilities: How Organisational Structures Affect Knowledge Processes|date=November 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/dynamic-capabilities-philip-cordesberszinn/?K=9781137351272|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==
A detailed description of processes and theoretical roots is provided by Arndt, Pierce, and Teece (2017). Teece, Pisano, and Shuen proposed three dynamic capabilities as necessary for an organization to meet new challenges:  the ability of employees to learn quickly and to build new strategic assets; the integration of these new strategic assets, including capability, technology and customer feedback, into company processes; and lastly the transformation or reuse of existing assets which have depreciated.&lt;ref name="Teece et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenhardt and Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Eisenhardt|first1= Kathleen M.|last2= Martin|first2= Jeffrey A.|title=Dynamic capabilities:What are they? |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0266%28200010/11%2921:10/11%3C1105::AID-SMJ133%3E3.0.CO;2-E/abstract |journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume= 21 |issue=10/11 |pages=1105–1122 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=October 2000|doi=10.1002/1097-0266(200010/11)21:10/11&lt;1105::AID-SMJ133&gt;3.0.CO;2-E |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teece refers to successful implementation of these three stages as developing "corporate agility".&lt;ref name="dynamic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teece|first=David J.|title=Explicating Dynamic Capabilities: The Nature and Microfoundations of (Sustainable) Enterprise Performance |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.640/abstract |journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume= 28 |issue=13 |pages=1319–1350 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=August 2007 |doi=10.1002/smj.640 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
The first stage, learning, requires employees and managers to reorganize their routines to promote interactions that lead to successful solutions to particular problems, to recognize and avoid dysfunctional activity and  strategic blind spots, and to make appropriate use of alliance and acquisition to bring new strategic assets into the firm from external sources. A practical example of this is provided by Jean-Pierre Jeannet and [[Hein Schreuder]], in their book ''From Coal to Biotech'', which lays out how the Dutch company [[DSM (company)|DSM]] transformed itself twice using 'strategic learning cycles'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeannet |first1=Jean-Pierre |first2=Hein |last2=Schreuder |year=2015 |title=From Coal to Biotech: The transformation of DSM with business school support |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783662462980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New assets ===
In his 1988 book ''Managing Quality'', [[David A. Garvin]] states that quality performance depends on organisational routines for gathering and processing information, for linking customer experiences with engineering design choices and for coordinating factories and component suppliers.&lt;ref name="Garvin1988"&gt;{{cite book|first=David A. |last=Garvin |title=Managing Quality: The Strategic and Competitive Edge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K-LWY2qgSHwC|year=1988|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-02-911380-6|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly competitive advantage also requires the integration of external activities and technologies through alliances and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zahra |first1=Shaker A. |last2=Nielsen |first2=Anders P. |title=Sources of capabilities, integration and technology commercialization |journal=Strategic Management Journal |date=1 May 2002 |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=377–398 |doi=10.1002/smj.229 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.229/abstract |issn=1097-0266 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformation of existing assets ===
Economists Amit and Schoemaker pointed out in 1993 that success in fast changing markets depends on reconfiguring the firm’s asset structure to accomplish rapid internal and external transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khalid |first=Saba |title=Exploring Firm Level Market Knowledge Competence and Its Implications for the Speed and Success of Export Expansion: A Mixed Methodology Study from the Software Industry|date=2009|publisher=University of Vaasa|isbn=9789524762700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afJT6sXTyroC&amp;pg=PA25 |page=25|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firms must develop processes to make changes inexpensively while accomplishing reconfiguration and transformation ahead of the competition. This can be supported by decentralization, local autonomy and strategic alliances.

===Co-specialization ===
Another "dynamic capabilities" concept is co-specialization. For example, the physical assets, human resources and the intellectual property of a company, having developed together over time, are more valuable in combination than separately, and give a firm a sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douma |first1=Sytse |authorlink1=Sytse Douma |last2=Schreuder |first2=Hein |authorlink2=Hein Schreuder |title=Economic Approaches to Organisations |year=2013 |publisher=Pearson |isbn=9780273735298 |edition=Fifth |url= https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Approaches-Organisations-Sytse-Douma/dp/0273735292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5132">'''EnergyCAP''' is a family of [[energy management software|energy management]] and [[energy accounting software]] products, used for tracking, managing, processing, reporting, benchmarking, and analyzing utility bills and energy and sustainability information. EnergyCAP also interfaces with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] [[Energy Star]] Portfolio Manager. Multiple versions of EnergyCAP -- Enterprise, Express, and Professional -- are available to meet user functional requirements.

== History ==

EnergyCAP's history dates back to 1980. In response to a growing demand for energy management software when PCs were in their infancy, Steven D. Heinz founded OmniComp, Inc. in 1980 and launched the development of EnergyCAP predecessor FASER Energy Accounting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyeducation.com/NewsPress/tabid/63/newsid409/33/Default.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; FASER was first commercially released in 1982 for utility bill verification, tracking and reporting, and the calculation of the cost avoidance attributable to energy management activities (also called [[Measurement and Verification|Measurement &amp; Verification]]). The City of Denver also uses this software to track energy usage throughout their parks system. 

FASER became widely used by retail chains, government, universities, school districts and property managers. By the mid-1990s, FASER's thousands of users tracked an estimated five million bills a year valued at $2 billion. FASER and OmniComp were purchased by [[Enron|Enron Corporation]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/footprint/10K/Enron-1998-10-K-d.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Enron's bankruptcy in late 2001, Heinz acquired the energy information assets&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=178/pagename=alpha_list]&lt;/ref&gt; and launched Good Steward Software, which was renamed to EnergyCAP, Inc. in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/good-steward-software-announces-record-sales-in-2009-changes-name-to-energycap-inc-80720647.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The team developed a new line of energy efficiency software products called EnergyCAP. EnergyCAP, Inc. is a five-time [[Energy Star]] Partner of the Year.

== Software Versions ==

EnergyCAP Enterprise is software for large organizations with comprehensive energy information management needs. Users include Fortune 1,000 companies; universities; military; and city, county, and state governments. EnergyCAP Express is utility bill and energy management software for small to medium-sized organizations like colleges, towns, and small- to medium-sized businesses. EnergyCAP Professional is oriented toward measurement and verification of energy savings for certain qualifying organizations, most notably school districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools_directory/software.cfm/ID=413/pagename=alpha_list]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''energy industry''' is the totality of all of the [[industry|industries]] involved in the production and sale of [[energy]], including [[fuel]] extraction, manufacturing, [[oil refinery|refining]] and distribution. Modern society consumes large amounts of fuel, and the energy industry is a crucial part of the [[infrastructure]] and maintenance of society in almost all [[nation|countries]].

In particular, the energy industry comprises:
* the [[petroleum industry]], including [[oil companies]], petroleum refiners, fuel transport and end-user sales at [[gas station]]s
* the gas industry, including [[natural gas]] extraction, and [[coal gas]] manufacture, as well as distribution and sales
* the [[electrical power industry]], including [[electricity generation]], [[electric power distribution]] and sales
* the [[coal]] industry
* the [[nuclear power]] industry
* the [[renewable energy industry]], comprising [[alternative energy]] and [[sustainable energy]] companies, including those involved in [[hydroelectric power]], [[wind power]], and [[solar power]] generation, and the manufacture, distribution and sale of [[alternative fuel]]s
* traditional energy industry based on the collection and distribution of [[firewood]], the use of which, for cooking and heating, is particularly common in poorer countries

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The use of [[energy]] has been a key in the development of the [[society|human society]] by helping it to control and adapt to the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Managing the use of energy is inevitable in any functional society. In the [[industrialization|industrialized world]] the development of energy resources has  become essential for [[agriculture]], [[transport]]ation, [[sewage|waste collection]], [[information technology]], [[Telecommunication|communications]] that have become prerequisites of a developed society. The increasing use of energy since the [[Industrial Revolution]] has also brought with it a number of serious problems, some of which, such as [[global warming]], present potentially grave risks to the world.

In some industries, the word ''energy'' is used as a synonym of [[Energy development|energy resources]], which refer to substances like [[fuels]], [[petroleum]] products and [[electricity]] in general, because a significant portion of the energy contained in these resources can easily be extracted to serve a useful purpose. After a useful process has taken place, the total energy is conserved, but the ressource itself is not conserved, since a process usually transforms the energy into unusable forms (such as unnecessary or excess heat).

Ever since humanity discovered various energy resources available in nature, it has been inventing devices, known as machines, that make life more comfortable by using energy resources. Thus, although the primitive man knew the utility of fire to cook food, the invention of devices like gas burners and [[microwave ovens]] has increased the usage of energy for this purpose alone manyfold. The trend is the same in any other field of social activity, be it [[construction]] of social infrastructure, manufacturing of fabrics for covering; porting; [[printing]];  decorating, for example [[textiles]], [[air conditioning]]; [[communication]] of information or for moving people and goods ([[automobiles]]).

{{Main article|Energy economics}}
[[Energy development|Production]] and [[World energy resources and consumption|consumption]] of energy resources is very important to the global economy.  All economic activity requires energy resources, whether to [[manufacturing|manufacture]] goods, provide [[transport]]ation, run [[computer]]s and other [[machine]]s.

Widespread demand for energy may encourage competing energy [[public utility|utilities]] and the formation of [[retailing|retail]] [[energy market]]s. Note the presence of the "Energy Marketing and Customer Service" (EMACS) sub-sector.&lt;ref&gt;

Since the cost of energy has become a significant factor in the performance of economy of societies, management of energy resources has become very crucial. Energy management involves utilizing the available energy resources more effectively that is with minimum incremental costs. Many times it is possible to save expenditure on energy without incorporating fresh [[technology]] by simple [[management]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mepol.org/site180.php Energy Management :: MEPoL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325140222/http://www.mepol.org/site180.php |date=25 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often energy management is the practice of using energy more efficiently by eliminating energy wastage or to balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness with [[energy conservation]].

==Classifications==

===Government===
The [[United Nations]] developed the [[International Standard Industrial Classification]], which is a list of economic and social classifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/family1.asp United Nations economic and social classifications] Accessed 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no distinct classification for an energy industry, because the classification system is based on ''activities'', ''products'', and ''expenditures according to purpose''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regct.asp?Lg=1 United Nations Available Classifications] Accessed 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries in North America use the [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS). The NAICS sectors #21 and #22 (mining and utilities) might roughly define the energy industry in North America. This classification is used by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].

===Financial market===

The [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] used by [[Morgan Stanley]] define the energy industry as comprising companies primarily working with oil, gas, coal and consumable fuels, excluding companies working with certain industrial gases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscibarra.com/products/gics/structure.jsp MSCI-Barra GICS Tables] Accessed 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Add also to expand this section:  [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbenchmark.com/docs/ICB_StructureSheet_120104.pdf Industry Classification Benchmark for Dow Jones Indexes (United States) and FTSE Indexes (United Kingdom)] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
{{main article|Environmental impact of the energy industry}}
Government encouragement in the form of [[subsidy|subsidies]] and [[tax]] [[incentive]]s for [[energy conservation|energy-conservation]] efforts has increasingly fostered the view of conservation as a major function of the energy industry: saving an amount of energy provides economic benefits almost identical to generating that same amount of energy. This is compounded by the fact that the economics of delivering energy tend to be priced for capacity as opposed to average usage. One of the purposes of a [[smart grid]] infrastructure is to smooth out demand so that capacity and demand curves align more closely.
Some parts of the energy industry generate considerable [[pollution]], including toxic and [[greenhouse gas]]es from fuel combustion, [[nuclear waste]] from the generation of nuclear power, and [[oil spillage]]s as a result of  petroleum extraction. Government regulations to internalize these [[externality|externalities]] form an increasing part of doing [[business]], and the trading of [[carbon credit]]s and [[pollution credit]]s on the free market may also result in energy-saving and pollution-control measures becoming even more important to energy providers.

Consumption of energy resources, (e.g. turning on a light) requires resources and has an effect on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Many electric power plants burn coal, oil or natural gas in order to generate electricity for energy needs. While burning these fossil fuels produces a readily available and instantaneous supply of electricity, it also generates air pollutants including carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), sulfur dioxide and trioxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxides ([[NOx]]). Carbon dioxide is an important [[greenhouse gas]] which is thought to be responsible for some fraction of the rapid increase in [[climate change]] seen especially in the temperature records in the 20th century, as compared with tens of thousands of years worth of temperature records which can be read from ice cores taken in Arctic regions. Burning fossil fuels for electricity generation also releases trace metals such as beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, mercury, nickel, and silver into the environment, which also act as pollutants.

The large-scale use of [[renewable energy]] technologies would "greatly mitigate or eliminate a wide range of environmental and human health impacts of energy use".&lt;ref name=WWS2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z. |author2=Delucchi, Mark A. |year=2010 |work=Energy policy }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuli Aye|title=Energie vergelijken switchen Energieleverancier top 10|url=https://www.hotswitch.nl/|website=Energie vergelijken|accessdate=28 October 2016|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy technologies include [[biofuels]], [[solar heating and cooling]], [[hydroelectric power]], [[solar power]], and [[wind power]].  [[Energy conservation]] and the [[Efficient energy use|efficient use of energy]] would also help.

In addition, it is argued that there is also the potential to develop a more [[efficient energy use|efficient energy]] sector. This can be done by:&lt;ref&gt;[[European Movement for Efficient Energy]] 2011. Energy efficient solutions for the conservation of energy. Retrieved: 11 October 2011 18:52&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fuel switching in the power sector from [[coal]] to [[natural gas]];
* Power plant optimisation and other measures to improve the efficiency of existing [[combined cycle gas turbine|CCGT]] power plants;
* [[Combined heat and power]] (CHP), from micro-scale residential to large-scale industrial;
* [[Waste heat recovery]]
[[Best available technology]] (BAT) offers supply-side efficiency levels far higher than global averages. The relative benefits of gas compared to coal are influenced by the development of increasingly [[efficient energy use|efficient energy]] production methods. According to an impact assessment carried out for the [[European Commission]], the levels of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of coal-fired plants built have now increased to 46-49% efficiency rates, as compared to coals plants built before the 1990s (32-40%).&lt;ref name=EC1&gt;[[European Commission]] 2011. [http://eme2.eu/cust/documentrequest.aspx?DocID=152 Impact Assessment Accompanying the document Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy efficiency and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC]. p. 106 Retrieved 11 October 2011 19:01&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time gas can reach 58-59% efficiency levels with the best available technology.&lt;ref name=EC1/&gt; Meanwhile, [[combined heat and power]] can offer efficiency rates of 80-90%.&lt;ref name=EC1/&gt;

==Politics==
Since now energy plays an essential role in [[industrial society|industrial societies]], the ownership and control of energy resources plays an increasing role in [[politics]]. At the national level, governments seek to influence the sharing (distribution) of energy resources among various sections of the society through pricing mechanisms; or even who owns resources within their borders. They may also seek to influence the use of energy by individuals and business in an attempt to tackle [[environmental issues]].

The most recent international political controversy regarding energy resources is in the context of the [[Iraq War]]s. Some political analysts maintain that the hidden reason for both 1991 and 2003 wars can be traced to [[strategy|strategic]] control of international energy resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepeakist.com/oil-and-empire-the-backstory-to-the-invasion-of-iraq/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419104405/http://www.thepeakist.com/oil-and-empire-the-backstory-to-the-invasion-of-iraq/ |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}} Oil and Empire - the backstory to the invasion of Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Others counter this analysis with the numbers related to its economics. According to the latter group of analysts, U.S. has spent about $336 billion in Iraq&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=182 The War in Iraq Costs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051012210605/http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=182 |date=12 October 2005 }}, A running total of the U.S. taxpayer cost to date of the Iraq War.

===Policy===
{{main|Energy policy}}
Energy policy is the manner in which a given entity (often governmental) has decided to address issues of [[energy development]] including [[energy production]], [[Resource distribution|distribution]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].  The attributes of energy policy may include [[legislation]], international treaties, incentives to investment, guidelines for [[energy conservation]], [[tax]]ation and other public policy techniques.

===Security===
{{main|Energy security}}
Energy security is the intersection of [[national security]] and the availability of [[natural resource]]s for [[energy]] consumption. Access to cheap [[energy]] has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of energy supplies among countries has led to significant vulnerabilities. Threats to energy security include the political instability of several energy producing countries, the manipulation of energy supplies, the competition over energy sources, attacks on supply infrastructure, as well as accidents, natural disasters, the funding to foreign dictators, rising terrorism, and dominant countries reliance to the foreign oil supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=142&amp;pubtype=5 |title=Power plays: Energy and Australia's security |publisher=Aspi.org.au |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811072715/http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=142&amp;pubtype=5 |archivedate=11 August 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited supplies, uneven distribution, and rising costs of [[fossil fuels]], such as oil and gas, create a need to change to more [[sustainable energy]] sources in the foreseeable future. With as much dependence that the U.S. currently has for oil and with the peaking limits of oil production; economies and societies will begin to feel the decline in the resource that we have become dependent upon. Energy security has become one of the leading issues in the world today as oil and other resources have become as vital to the world's people. However, with oil production rates decreasing and oil production peak nearing the world has come to protect what resources we have left in the world. With new advancements in renewable resources less pressure has been put on companies that produce the world's oil, these resources are, geothermal, solar power, wind power and hydro-electric. Although these are not all the current and possible future options for the world to turn to as the oil depletes the most important issue is protecting these vital resources from future threats. These new resources will become more useful as the price of exporting and importing oil will increase due to increase of demand.

==Development==
{{main article|Energy development}}
Producing energy to sustain human needs is an essential social activity, and a great deal of effort goes into the activity. While most of such effort is limited towards increasing the production of [[electric power generation|electricity]] and [[oil exploration|oil]], newer ways of producing usable energy resources from the available energy resources are being explored. One such effort is to explore means of producing [[hydrogen fuel]] from water. Though hydrogen use is environmentally friendly, its production requires energy and existing technologies to make it, are not very efficient. Research is underway to explore [[enzymatic]] decomposition of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.vt.edu/energy/reshydro.html|title=Virginia Tech Deans' Task Force on Energy Security and Sustainability|publisher=|access-date=6 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408155812/http://www.research.vt.edu/energy/reshydro.html|archive-date=8 April 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of conventional energy resources are also being used in new ways. [[Coal|Coal gasification and liquefaction]] are recent technologies that are becoming attractive after the realization that [[oil reserves]], at present consumption rates, may be rather short lived. See [[alternative fuels]].

Energy is the subject of significant research activities globally. For example, the [[UK Energy Research Centre]] is the focal point for UK energy research while the European Union has many technology programmes as well as a platform for engaging social science and humanities within energy research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglia.ac.uk/global-sustainability-institute-gsi/research/consumption-and-change/shape-energy|title=H2020 SHAPE-Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
All societies require materials and food to be transported over ''distances'', generally against some ''force'' of friction. Since application of force over distance requires the presence of a source of usable energy, such sources are of great worth in society.

While energy resources are an essential ingredient for all modes of [[transportation]] in society, the transportation of energy resources is becoming equally important. Energy resources are frequently located far from the place where they are consumed. Therefore, their transportation is always in question. Some energy resources like liquid or gaseous fuels are transported using tankers or [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], while electricity transportation invariably requires a network of [[transmission grid|grid cables]]. The transportation of energy, whether by tanker, pipeline, or transmission line, poses challenges for scientists and engineers, policy makers, and economists to make it more risk-free and efficient.

==Crisis==
{{main article|Energy crisis}}
[[File:Oil Prices Since 1861.svg|right|thumb|Oil prices from 1861 to 2007]]
Economic and political instability can lead to an [[energy crisis]]. Notable oil crises are the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[1979 oil crisis]]. The advent of [[peak oil]], the point in time when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached, will likely precipitate another energy crisis.

== Mergers and Acquisitions ==
Between 1985 and 2018 there have been around 69,932 deals in the energy sector. This cumulates to an overall value of 9,578 bil USD. The most active year was 2010 with about 3.761 deals. In terms of value 2007 was the strongest year (684 bil. USD), which was followed by a steep decline until 2009 (-55,8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Business History Association''' (EBHA) is an [[Academic|academic association]] devoted to [[business history]] in Europe. It holds annual congresses (called conferences until 2013) and a bi-annual doctoral summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EBHA Summer School|url=http://www.ebha.org/?seite=summer%20school|website=www.ebha.org|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is registered as a [[Scottish charity]]. Its constitution states its objectives as "''to advance the education of the public concerning all aspects of the history of business and management in Europe and in the environment in which they operate and to promote research into all such aspects''".
Its aim is the organization of conferences and seminars, the publication of a newsletter and other materials, the encouragement of research in all aspects of business history, and specifically the promotion of collaborative projects based in several European countries such as The Performance of European Business in the 20th Century project per instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Performance of European Business in the 20th Century|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/BHU/research/performanceEB.aspx|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The association was established to enhance inter-European contacts and promote extra-European links among business historians, to encourage the exchange of business history graduate students and to promote teaching and interest in all such aspects.

== History of the association ==

The discussions to establish a European Business History Association followed in the wake of the successful foundation of the [[Association of Business Historians]] in Britain . Informal talks between [[Hans Pohl]] ([[University of Bonn]]), Geoffrey Jones (then at the [[University of Reading]]), and Tony Slaven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Glasgow story|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2159&amp;type=P|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[University of Glasgow]]) resulted in an invited meeting of representatives from a number of European countries in October 1993. This meeting was hosted and chaired by Tony Slaven at the Centre for Business History in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for business history in Scotland|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/research/economicsocialhistory/businesshistory/aboutus/|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants were not representative in any objective sense, but were those known to the organisers. They were [[Rolv Petter Amdam]] (BI Norwegian Business School, Norway), Michael Bibikov (Russia), Per Boje (Denmark), Hans Pohl (Germany), Keetie Sluyterman ([[University of Utrecht]], Netherlands), Mary Rose, Geoff Jones and Tony Slaven (UK). That meeting reviewed models for an EBHA, objectives, and necessary steps to shape and establish a new association. Subsequent meetings chaired by Tony Slaven followed rapidly in Bonn in February 1994 and in Rotterdam in June 1994. By this time the initial group had been joined by [[François Crouzet]] (France), Ulf Olsson (Sweden), and [[Even Lange]] (Norway). The meeting in Rotterdam at [[Erasmus University]] in June 1994 established the first draft of objectives, the conditions of membership, the structure to be adopted for office bearers and members of council, and election procedures. The Erasmus meeting also decided that it was necessary to take the proposals to a wider forum to gain support for the creation of a European Business History Association; it was also decided to establish a steering committee to plan a first conference.

The Business History Conference held at [[Erasmus University]] in October 1994 was taken as the opportunity to present the proposals to a large representative group of business historians drawn from many European countries. Tony Slaven acted as spokesman for the steering group and presented proposals to a general meeting at the Erasmus conference. The conference gave its support to the proposals and to the existing planning group to act as a steering committee to bring the European Business History Association into being. The first newsletter was planned for October 1995 and an inaugural conference was planned for August/September 1996. The working group was established as an interim council of the proposed EBHA for a period of two years from October 1995. Further planning meetings of the interim council took place in the University of Reading in March 1995 and Matthias Kipping was adopted as the first editor of the EBHA Newsletter. At that meeting in Reading it was agreed to hold the inaugural conference in August 1996 to be hosted by Ulf Olsson in the [[University of Gothenburg]]. A subsequent meeting in London in July 1996 was held to discuss potential collaboration with Manfred Pohl representing the new established Centre for European Business History based in Frankfurt. At that time, however, it was agreed to develop the interests of the new groups independently.

== Membership ==

'''
Membership is open to any individual interested in business history.
EBHA has over 200 members drawn from 29 different European and non-European countries.

== The Alliance of Centres for Business History in Europe ==

At the EBHA congress in Uppsala (2013), Centres for Business History and Business History Groups at European Universities and Business Schools have created a network in order to
(1.) improve communication and exchange between the large research groups in Business History;
(2.) improve cooperation and institutional support in research and teaching;
(3) improve PhD education in Business History.
The Alliance is a network under the umbrella of the EBHA and it is open to all European research environments in Business History with at least four [[Tenured|tenured positions]] within the respective University/Business School. These centres/groups are facing common challenges within their University/Business School, and they provide environments allowing for collaboration beyond conventional academic networking.
The Alliance meets annually in connection to the EBHA Congress.

* Copenhagen, Denmark: Centre for Business History, [[Copenhagen Business School]]

The Centre for Business History was established in 1999 with the objective to strengthen the historical dimension in CBS research and teaching. Today, it consists of eight professors and five PhD and postdoc researchers that share a keen interest in the way history contributes to a better understanding of society and business.

* Glasgow, UK: Centre for Business History in Scotland

The Centre for Business History in Scotland (CBHS), inaugurated in 1987, is Scotland’s only research unit in the discipline and counts as full members 13 business historians engaged in teaching and research. The prime objective of the CBH is to encourage, facilitate and conduct research in all aspects of business history, with particular emphasis on corporate governance, innovation and organisational change.

* Milan, Italy: Bocconi Business History group

The Bocconi Business History group is based at [[Bocconi University]], Milan (www.unibocconi.it), in the Department of Policy Analysis and Public Management. The group consists of tenured and non tenured scholars doing research in various fields of business history. The group is active in the organization of conferences and seminars both at national and international level. Broadly speaking, the research interests of its members include topics as entrepreneurship, history of fashion and creative industries, international business, family business and State-owned enterprises.

* Oslo, Norway: Centre for Business History

Centre for Business History (CBH) at BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo was established in 1989 and, with a staff of 14 historians and 1 research coordinator, constitutes the largest group of economic and business historians in Norway. The Centre is a part of the Department of Innovation and Economic Organization at BI. CBH aims to improve the understanding of business institutions, interactions between companies and society as well as the dynamics of economic development. The research includes economic, political, social and cultural perspectives.

The main part of the research is commissioned work, organised in a way which shall secure the academic freedom of the researcher, through standardised contracts and also with book committees commenting on the manuscripts.

* Reading, UK: Centre for International Business History (CIBH), [[Henley Business School]] at the University of Reading

Established in 1997 and part of Henley Business School at the University of Reading, the Centre for International Business History (CIBH) is the largest business history centre in the United Kingdom. CIBH strives to promote the study of the evolution of business and management in an international and comparative context. The Centre’s nine members mainly focus on various aspects of international business history, particularly on topics related to retailing, consumer goods industries, entrepreneurship, intellectual property, industrial finance, small firms, creative industries, and industrial clusters/districts. CIBH staff play active roles in various national and international business and economic history associations and are active participants at the main international conferences in these areas.

* Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Business History @ Erasmus [University of Rotterdam]

Business History @ Erasmus brings together researchers with an interest in the history of business. The platform is an initiative by the School of History, Culture &amp; Communication and the Rotterdam School of Management, both at Erasmus University Rotterdam, in the Netherlands.

* Uppsala, Sweden: Uppsala Centre for Business History (UCBH)

Uppsala Centre for Business History (UCBH) is organizationally and economically associated with the Department of Economic History at Uppsala University.
A large part of the research focuses on questions about the establishment and development of organizations and markets, primarily within the banking and financial sector of the economy. The dynamic interaction between organizations and institutions, both formal and informal, is considered an important factor in the analysis of development.

* Utrecht, The Netherlands: Business History at Utrecht University

Business History at Utrecht University focuses on the historical development of companies and entrepreneurs in their institutional context. As part of Economic and Social History (ESH) business history links to the central debate on the question why some countries are poor and others are rich. What is the role of business in economic growth and prosperity? Business History at UU is therefore closely related to the Centre for Global Economic History, the platform of the UU for pioneering research into the long term evolution of the world economy and its components. Business history is also an important part of the Commissioned Research group, which conducts research for third parties. This research often focuses on individual companies or sectors in their relationship to society. From these two perspectives business historians in Utrecht find their strength in the interaction between the scientific debate and individual case studies.

* York, UK: Centre for the evolution of Global Business and Institutions (CEGBI)

The Centre for Evolution of Global Business and Institutions (CEGBI) was inaugurated in 2009 with the aim of contributing with research to the understanding of how businesses and institutions around the world evolve, and also of helping to inform current management and policy issues. CEGBI’s main areas of research are international business history; global marketing; and governance, entrepreneurship and social enterprise. Distinctive features of CEGBI’s research include its interdisciplinarity and methodologies. It engages with topics of interest to business and management, economics, history, sociology, and law.

==Conferences==
The inaugural conference in Gothenburg in August 1996 attracted over 230 participants by which time the initial paid up membership of the new EBHA was 214 members. First nominations and elections for council added [[Franco Amatori]] ([[Bocconi University]]) , Albert Carreras ([[Pompeu Fabra University]]), [[Wilfried Feldenkirchen]], Ritta Hjerppe ([[Helsinki School of Economics]]), and Matthias Kipping to the first formally elected council. Tony Slaven was adopted as first President of EBHA with Geoff Jones as the first Secretary/Treasurer. It was decided in 1998 to hold an annual conference beginning with that held at Terni. Since then the association has met annually.

A number of organisations issue template format opinions to indicate issues which are intended to be covered by such opinions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.citysolicitors.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=162&amp;Itemid=471| title=Draft Foreign Legal Opinion on Transactions Relating to Property In England and Wales| publisher=City of London Law Society| accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or standard form checklists for contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/5-238-3952 |title=Contents of a foreign legal opinion on security: checklist| publisher=Thompson Reuters (Practical Law)| accessdate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The original purpose of foreign legal opinion is grounded in the historical doctrine of ''[[ultra vires]]''.  The concern was that when doing business with a [[corporation]] formed in a foreign country, proper due diligence required that a legal opinion be sought to ensure that the relevant foreign company had the necessary [[Capacity (law)#Business entities|capacity and power]] to enter into the transaction, and that it would be binding upon it.&lt;ref&gt;''Banco de Bilbao v Sancha''; ''Banco de Bilbao v Rey'' [1938] 2 KB 176, CA&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time opinions expanded to cover related aspects of foreign law, such as whether payments might be subject to [[Foreign exchange controls|exchange controls]] or [[Usury#Usury law|usury laws]], whether it was necessary for any of the other parties to hold any licences or permits under the [[Regulation|regulatory laws]] of the foreign country, whether there would be adverse [[tax]] consequences under the laws of the foreign country, whether foreign judgments were recognised and enforced in that country other collateral matters.

During the 1970s and 1980s with the expansions in cross-border lender by financial institutions, [[bank]]s became increasingly concerned to ensure that foreign companies to whom they lent money provided a foreign legal opinion certifying the legal validity of the [[loan agreement|loan transaction]] and the enforceability of the banks' rights (including any [[security interest]]s).&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;  In time these requires came to be reflected in the [[Basel Accords|Basel capital adequacy requirements]] for banks, resulting in different, more favourable, capital weighting for loans supported by opinions.

==Format==

Foreign legal opinions are now highly standardised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Loans, Bonds, Guarantees, Legal Opinions |author=Philip R. Wood |url=https://books.google.vg/books?id=Lu3Hkc348loC&amp;pg=PT487&amp;lpg=PT487&amp;dq=foreign+legal+opinions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MB--J7F85y&amp;sig=IUV2jlMhQps6a29eoZVpnU9Nzac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cGXyU_GzLq3KsQSqhYHQDw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=foreign%20legal%20opinions&amp;f=false |at=26-094|isbn=1847032087}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically such opinions will confirm the jurisdiction which they relate to, confirm the documents that they reviewed, list certain assumptions of fact, and then set out various opinion statements.  After the opinion statements, they will typically make certain standard, generally applicable qualifications.

The opinion will ordinarily state the conclusions of law, but will not provide reasoning.  This reflects the role of the foreign law opinion as a risk assessment tool.  The opinion is normally issued in the format of an unqualified favourable statement of the effectiveness of the transaction (hedged in by appropriate assumptions of fact and general qualifications of law).&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;  Where there are areas of legal uncertainty, or issues which require clarification and analysis, the foreign legal opinion will often remain in the standardised format, but will be supplemented with a second, reasoned, opinion.  In cross border transactions the negotiation and discussion of the format of the foreign law opinions elucidates areas of legal stress or risk in relation to the proposed transaction and foreign legal systems.&lt;ref name=gruson/&gt;

Standard assumptions normally include assuming that documents and records reviewed by the law firm giving the opinion are accurate, that all copies they review are true copies, and that no provision of any other law (i.e. the laws of any country other than the country on whose laws the opinion is being given) adversely affects the opinion being expressed.  In certain countries it is also standard to assume the genuineness of signatures and [[company seal|seals]], but in other countries the foreign law firm may be expected to verify the accuracy of such signatures.

The substantive opinion statements a foreign legal opinion will make will ordinarily include:
# that the relevant obligations be recognised as constituting valid and binding obligations of the foreign party;
# which person or organ has power on behalf of the foreign entity to enter into the transaction;
# the proper method of execution of documents by the foreign party;
# that the transaction does not breach the constitutional documents of the foreign entity, or the laws of the foreign country (and, sometimes, any agreements which are binding upon the foreign entity and its assets);
# that no approvals or licences are required in the foreign country in relation to the transaction;
# that the transaction documents are not subject to stamp duty or registration requirements in the foreign country;
# that no withholding or other taxes apply to the transaction in the foreign country;
# that the foreign entity does not have [[sovereign immunity]] under the laws of the foreign country;
# that there are no exchange control regulations in the foreign country which would affect the transaction;
# that the foreign entity is in good standing, and is not subject to winding-up or dissolution;
# to what extent judgments or [[arbitral award]]s from another country would be recognised and enforced in the foreign country (without re-examination of the merits);
# the efficacy of [[choice of law clause]]s and [[jurisdiction clause]]s in the foreign jurisdiction;
# whether any terms of the transaction contravene [[public policy]] in the foreign country; and
# whether any of the other parties to the transaction (other than the foreign entity) would be treated as carrying on business or subject to tax in the foreign country by entering into the transaction.

Standard qualifications are usually matters of general law which it is impractical to advise upon in the abstract, but which might undermine the effectiveness of the enforceability of the transaction.  For example most opinions will indicate that if the foreign party goes into bankruptcy that will limit the ability to enforce obligations against it.  Similarly, rights may be lost when statutory [[limitation period]]s expire.  In certain countries enforcement of obligations may be subject to obligations of good faith and fair dealing, and the foreign legal opinion will normally point this out by way of qualification.

==Conflicts of laws==
The foreign legal opinion will typically express opinions on various issues which might not ordinarily be governed by the laws of the foreign country under its own [[conflict of laws]] system.  Because a cross border transaction might end up being considered by the courts of any of a number of countries, the addressee(s) of the opinion will wish to be assured that all relevant issues, if determined by that foreign law, would likely be resolved satisfactorily.  The courts of a third country may apply different choice of law rules to determine the ''[[lex causae]]'' of a particular issue to the courts of the foreign country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3377">{{Insolvency}}
In company law, '''fraudulent trading''' is doing business with intent to defraud [[creditor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 213 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Where during the course of a [[Liquidation|winding-up]], it appears to the liquidator that fraudulent trading has occurred, the liquidator may apply to the court for an order any persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of such business are to be made liable to make such contributions (if any) to the company's assets as the court thinks proper.

Conceptually, fraudulent trading is similar to a [[fraudulent conveyance]],&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but the key distinction is that an application to have a transaction set aside as a fraudulent conveyance usually requires to the third party beneficiary to disgorge the benefit of the conveyance to undo the loss to the company's assets, whereas a court order in relation to fraudulent trading it is the responsible parties (usually the [[board of directors|directors]]) who must make up the loss and the third party beneficiaries will usually retain the benefit. However, it is legally possible for a single transaction to be simultaneously fraudulent trading and a fraudulent conveyance, and to be the subject on concurrent applications. Some legal systems permit a director who makes a contribution to the company's assets pursuant to an order for fraudulent trading to [[subrogation|subrogated]] to any claim that the company might have with respect to a fraudulent conveyance.

In practice, applications for orders in respect of fraudulent trading are rare because of the high [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] associated with [[fraud]]. Usually, even where fraudulent trading is suspected, an application is made with respect to an allegation of "[[wrongful trading]]" (or "insolvent trading") where the burden of proof is lower. Where applications are brought for fraudulent trading, it is usually because when the trading occurred, the company was not insolvent at that time (insolvency at the time of the trading is normally a requirement to establish wrongful trading, but not fraudulent trading).

The effect of a successful application for fraudulent trading varies between different legal systems. In some countries, the assets contributed by the directors are treated as general assets which may be taken by any [[secured creditor]]s who may have a [[security interest]] which attaches to all the company's assets (characteristically, a [[floating charge]]). However, some countries have "ring-fenced" payments made for fraudulent trading so that they are made available to the pool of assets for [[unsecured creditor]]s.

Fraudulent trading is entirely separate and distinct from "[[insider trading]]", which focuses purely upon the abuse of inside information in relation to financial markets for personal financial gain, and is wholly unrelated to creditor's rights or insolvency law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6321">'''Galileo''' is a [[computer reservations system]] (CRS) owned by [[Travelport]]. As of 2000 it had a 26.4% share of worldwide CRS airline bookings.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Transportation]]: [http://www.dot.gov/affairs/Computer%20Reservations%20System.htm Computer Reservations System (CRS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527000044/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/Computer%20Reservations%20System.htm |date=2008-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to airline reservations, the Galileo CRS is also used to book [[train]] travel, [[cruise ship|cruise]]s, [[car]] rental, and [[hotel]] rooms.

The Galileo system was moved from Denver, Colorado, to the [[Worldspan]] datacenter in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 28, 2008, following the 2007 merger of Travelport and Worldspan (although they now share the same datacenter, they continue to be run as separate systems). 

Galileo is subject to the [[Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II|Capps II]] and its successor [[Secure Flight]] program for the selection of passengers with a risk profile.

Galileo is a member of the [[International Air Transport Association]], of the [[OpenTravel Alliance]] and of [[SITA (IT company)|SITA]].

==History==
Galileo traces its roots back to 1971 when [[United Airlines]] created its first computerized central reservation system under the name Apollo. During the 1980s and early 1990s, a significant proportion of airline tickets were sold by travel agents.  Flights by the airline owning the reservation system had preferential display on the computer screen.  Due to the high market penetration of the Sabre and Apollo systems, owned by American Airlines and United Airlines, respectively, Worldspan and Galileo were created by other airline groups in an attempt to gain market share in the computer reservation system market and, by inference, the commercial airline market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D81E38F933A25754C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=United Air In Venture In Europe | first=Agis | last=Salpukas | date=July 10, 1987 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Galileo was formed in 1987 by nine European carriers -- [[British Airways]], [[KLM Royal Dutch Airlines]], [[Alitalia]], [[Swissair]], [[Austrian Airlines]], [[Olympic Airlines|Olympic]], [[Sabena]], [[Air Portugal]] and [[Aer Lingus]].&lt;ref name="baltimoresun1992"&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-03-04/business/1992064009_1_american-airlines-apollo-carriers Two top airline reservations systems to be merged - Baltimore Sun]. Articles.baltimoresun.com (1992-03-04). Retrieved on 2013-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response and to prevent possible government intervention, United Airlines spun off its Apollo reservation system, which was then controlled by Covia.  Galileo International was born when Covia acquired Europe's Galileo and merged it with the Apollo system in 1992.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun1992"/&gt;

The Apollo reservation system was used by United Airlines until March 3, 2012, when it switched to SHARES, a system used by its former Continental Airlines subsidiary. Apollo is still used by Galileo International (now part of [[Travelport]] GDS) travel agency customers in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and [[Japan]].

Galileo UK{{Clarifyme|What is Galileo UK?|date=October 2013}} was originally created from [[Travicom]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IbTT1yIfsYIC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=travicom+galileo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5_wk3mA2Fw&amp;sig=C6mHjBtvkosKXTLk64ZBXTxqPaQ Dictionary of Travel and Tourism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Books.Google.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cards.org/ Travicom and Galileo User Group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GCmHf1FDZlQC&amp;pg=PT128&amp;lpg=PT128&amp;dq=travicom+galileo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6f7wmUFjg2&amp;sig=aQ8rcmVCBBXtSdxznOzMFVmuzvY Leisure Marketing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Books.Google.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1987/1987%20-%201976.html Flight Global&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Flithglobal.com&lt;/ref&gt;  which was the world's first multi-access reservations system using the technology developed by [[Videcom international|Videcom]]. [[Travicom]] was a company launched by [[Videcom international|Videcom]], [[British Airways]], [[British Caledonian]] and CCL in 1976 which in 1988 became Galileo UK.

===Developments===
*[[Travel Agent]]s now{{When|date=February 2011}} also book [[Amtrak|Amtrak Rail]] on the system and issue the tickets directly.
*[[Southwest Airlines]] has entered into a marketing agreement with Apollo/Galileo and travel agents are now able to book reservations on Southwest. These direct connects offer the possibility to sell ancillary services and to differentiate oneself from the competition.&lt;ref&gt; Strauss, Michael (2010): Value Creation in Travel Distribution, https://www.amazon.com/dp/0557612462 &lt;/ref&gt;
*The development team at Travelport has developed an online search tool called ASK Travelport where registered users can go and find out the answers to their frequently asked questions and queries.

==History==

Gerson Lehrman Group was founded by [[Yale Law School]] graduates [[Mark Gerson]] and Thomas Lehrman in 1998. Alexander Saint-Amand, a former Bloomberg reporter, joined GLG shortly after, and served as CEO until 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transforming Professional Learning|url=http://www.leadersmag.com/issues/2014.4_Oct/New_York_City/LEADERS-Alexander-Saint-Amand-GLG.html|website=Leaders Mag|access-date=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=3367944&amp;privcapId=134597205|title=Terms of Service Violation|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GLG, initially funded by friends and family, was formed as a [[publishing house]] to produce industry guidebooks for institutional investors. However, the founders discovered that their clients wanted to talk directly to experts in casual conversations, rather than reading formal written reports. Accordingly, in 1999, GLG abandoned its publishing business and began offering subscriptions to its network of experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investing; It's Not What They Know, but Whom|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/23/business/investing-it-s-not-what-they-know-but-whom.html?pagewanted=all|website=The New York Times|date=December 23, 2001|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This business came to be called an [[expert network]].

GLG’s first customers were investors, and most of their growth from 1999 to 2005 was within the investment community. In 2006, they began working with big strategy consultancies and with companies in life sciences, chemicals and industrials, and technology. By 2010, [[The Wall Street Journal]] had described GLG as "dominating the U.S. expert networking industry".&lt;ref name=wsj2&gt;{{cite web|title=Talent holds key to growth in Asia for Gerson Lehrman boss|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703580904575130931563106648|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the design space, GLG is a pioneer of [[Activity Based Working|activity based working]] office design, which does away with seating assignments for workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More New York Companies Experiment With Innovative Office Space|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-new-york-companies-experiment-with-innovative-office-space-1404694528|website=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 7, 2014|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, GLG named Paul Todd as its new CEO. Todd was previously the head of [[eBay]]'s EMEA business since 2015.&lt;ref name=int&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerson Lehrman Recruits New Technology CEO from eBay|url=http://www.integrity-research.com/glg-recruits-new-technology-ceo-ebay/|website=Integrity Research Associates|date=March 27, 2018|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/meet-the-leader-paul-todd/|title=Two Minutes with our European Chief Paul Todd|date=2015-08-03|website=www.ebayinc.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonprofit activities==

In 2006, GLG worked with [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to provide new primary data and analysis relevant for any other recovery plans in the rebuilding of Louisiana following [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rebuilding after Katrina and Rita |url=https://www.swtlaw.com/sites/swtlawcom/files/779-RebuildingAfterKatrina.pdf|website=Schulten Ward Turner &amp; Weiss, LLP|date=April 12, 2006|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLG has also done other philanthropy work with smaller charities.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye-Care Charity Gets Free Fund-Raising Insights|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Eye-Care-Charity-Gets-Free/226491|website=The Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=November 11, 2011|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GLG now operates a global Social Impact Fellowship, an initiative that provides learning resources and expertise to a select group of nonprofits and social enterprises, at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About GLG Social Impact|url=http://glgsocialimpact.com/|website=GLG Social Impact|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This Woman's Novel Approach to Poverty Relief is a Game-Changer|url=http://nationswell.com/glg-social-impact-fellow-sherry-riva|website=Nation Swell|date=January 30, 2017|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutional partnerships==

As the use of alternative research providers within the financial industry has grown, brokerages themselves have been partnering with firms like GLG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerson Lehrman and Morgan Stanley Alphawise Tie Up|url=http://www.integrity-research.com/gerson-lehrman-and-morgan-stanley-alphawise-tie-up/|website=Integrity Research Associates|date=March 27, 2008|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 10, 2008, the company announced a deal with [[Credit Suisse]], whereby analysts from the financial services giant would be able to tap into GLG’s experts as part of their research process.  About 300 Credit Suisse analysts became members of the GLG expert network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credit Suisse in alliance with consultancy firm|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7b41e986-7eca-11dd-b1af-000077b07658|website=Financial Times|date=September 10, 2008|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Gerson Lehrman Group announced a partnership with [[Frost &amp; Sullivan]], making the company's 800+ market researchers available to consult with GLG clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerson Lehrman Group Announces Addition of Frost &amp; Sullivan to the Council Partners Program|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gerson-lehrman-group-announces-addition-of-frost--sullivan-to-the-council-partners-program-61927502.html|website=GLG Press Release|date=April 23, 2009|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, GLG announced that it has partnered with [[Amba Research]], a leading financial services [[knowledge process outsourcing]] (KPO) firm that provides equity and credit research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amba partners with Gerson Lehrman Group|url=http://www.ambaresearch.com/amba-partners-gerson-lehrman-group/|website=Amba Press Release|date=July 27, 2009|access-date=October 13, 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719202222/http://www.ambaresearch.com/amba-partners-gerson-lehrman-group/|archivedate=July 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2010, GLG and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] announced a partnership that enables clients of the Bloomberg Professional platform to access the GLG expert network through the Bloomberg platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloomberg Professional Offers Access to Global Industry Experts|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100708005324/en/Bloomberg-Professional-Offers-Access-Global-Industry-Experts|website=Bloomberg, GLG Press Release|date=July 8, 2010|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, GLG partnered with and acquired a minority stake in Ushi, a leading China-based business [[social networking]] provider, and the largest competitor of [[LinkedIn]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GLG Invests in Chinese Social Media Startup|url=http://www.integrity-research.com/glg-invests-in-chinese-social-media-startup/|website=Integrity Research Associates|date=November 8, 2011|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ushi, China’s Answer To LinkedIn, Raises $3 Million From GLG, Others|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/13/ushi-chinas-answer-to-linkedin-raises-3-million-from-glg |website=TechCrunch|date=October 13, 2011|access-date=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

The expert network business model has drawn scrutiny for concerns relating to adherence to disclosure rules and [[insider trading]] within the investment industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmdutton.com/PDF_Files/mayhew-interview_0605.pdf Dutton Associates Online Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;  During 2005, for example, doctors who served as paid consultants to investment firms as a result of their role in an expert network generated a “fair share of controversy”.&lt;ref&gt;Marcy Tolkoff, April 21, 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4876">The '''International Young Publisher of the Year''' is a British Council award programme, which has been developed with the support of the [[London Book Fair]]. It is targeted at [[publishing|publishers]] aged 25 to 35 from emerging economies. The winner receives a free exhibition stand at the next London Book Fair and a financial award. The winner then goes on to develop a publishing project between the UK and their country.

The final of the international competition with eight to ten participants is held every year to coincide with the London Book Fair. Finalists are selected in national competitions organised locally by the British Council's overseas offices.

The finalists take part in an industry tour, which familiarises them with the dynamics of the UK publishing sector and introduces them to leading players in the industry. The finalists develop a network between themselves and with their peers in the UK sector. The finalists are also asked to select works from their country, which they then present at a [[book pitch]] to an expert jury and the general public.

All the finalists have now formed an alumni network which pioneers the importance of [[social network|business networking]] internationally for young entrepreneurs in the publishing business.

In 2007, the award was renamed International Young Publishing Entrepreneur, as part of a rebranding which coincided with the launch of the final awards in the programme. The British Council's Young Creative Entrepreneur programme now has nine international awards: communications, design, fashion, interactive, music, performing arts, publishing, screen and visual arts.

==IYPY 2004==
Among finalists from [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]], [[India]], [[Lithuania]], [[Mexico]], [[Nigeria]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Poland]], the inaugural IYPY finalists went on a tour of the UK publishing industry to [[London]], [[Cambridge]], [[Tiptree]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Aberystwyth]] and [[Hay-on-Wye]]. Mexican publisher Eduardo Rabasa of [[Editorial Sexto Piso]] was chosen as the inaugural winner. The award was presented by Jude Kelly, OBE, a British Council board member.

==IYPY 2005==
Finalists of the 2005 edition came from Argentina, [[Bulgaria]], [[Latvia]], [[Lebanon]], Poland, [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]] and [[Turkey]], and Maria Deskur of [[Muchomor|Muchomor Publishers]] from Poland was chosen as the winner. Maria used her award to publish the teenage novel [[Operation Red Jericho]] by the British author [[Joshua Mowll]] in Polish. The award was presented by Lord Heseltine, of Haymarket Publishing.

==IYPY 2006==
In 2006 ten creative young publishers, from Argentina, [[Colombia]], [[Jordan]], Lebanon, Lithuania, Mexico, [[Oman]], [[Slovenia]], South Africa and Thailand, came to the UK to present their work to an international jury chaired by Simon Winder, Publishing Director at [[Penguin Press]]. Joanna El-Mir from Lebanese children's publisher was chosen as the winner. The award was presented by Alistair Burtenshaw, the Director of London Book Fair.

==IYPY 2007==
The 2007 event had finalists from Argentina, [[Egypt]], [[Hungary]], India, [[Malta]], Romania, Slovenia, South Africa and [[Syria]], and [[S. Anand]] of [[Navayana (publishing house)|Navayana Publishing]] in [[Chennai]], India was chosen as the winner. Anand leads the first independent imprint in India to deal exclusively with the issues of caste inequalities and identity politics. The event was preceded by a meeting of finalists from the previous editions, to officially form the IYPY alumni network. The award was presented by Liz Calder, Publishing Director of Bloomsbury.

==IYPE 2008==
The 2008 event had finalists from Argentina, Egypt, India, Lebanon, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, UAE and Yemen.For the first time, the award went to a book retailer, Nashwan Al-Maghafi, the Managing Director of Yemen Bookshop, a business that he established in 1995 when he was 19. The award was presented by Cherie Booth QC, the wife of the former British Prime Minister and a longstanding supporter of the programme.

==History==
Nien-Ling Wacker founded Compulink Management Center Inc., a custom software development company, in 1974. By the early 1980s, Wacker had identified an emerging need among her clients for an electronic document repository that would provide both secure storage and instant retrieval by any word or phrase in the document.

The concept for a [[Personal computer|PC]]-based [[document management]] system began in 1981 when a client, a large Japanese auto manufacturer, required litigation support for a large volume of documents.{{citation needed
|date=July 2017}}  At the time, paralegals had to wade through thousands of pages of depositions, entering [[Index term|keyword]]s into a database.  Attorneys were limited to searching on keywords to find relevant testimony.&lt;ref name="AIIM"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.aiim.org/article-docrep.asp?ID=25296
|last=Duhon
|first=Bryant
|publisher=AIIM e-doc magazine
|title=One-on-One With Nien-Ling Wacker
|date=November 12, 2002
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nien-Ling Wacker realized that if a [[full-text index]] of every page were available, the search capabilities would be greatly enhanced, and the amount of physical labor required to index the documents would decrease substantially.  With the release of [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]] drives that cost "only" $200 for 200MB of diskspace, the conceived system could be made cost effective.&lt;ref name="AIIM" /&gt;

The first version of Laserfiche was released in 1987, becoming the first [[DOS]]-based [[document imaging]] system in the world.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news

===Timeline===
{{news release|section|date=June 2016}}

In 2002, Laserfiche 6 marked the company’s first foray into MSSQL{{Clarify|date=November 2013}}-based document management. That year, the company also introduced Quick Fields,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Fields|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/Quick-Fields|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an automated document processing module, and WebLink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weblink|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/WebLink|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided read-only, Web-based access to documents stored in Laserfiche.

In 2004, Laserfiche 7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Plans Continued Growth with Release of Version 7|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2004/08/31/laserfiche-plans-continued-growth-with-run-smarter-market-positioning-and-release-of-its-version-7|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; marked the company’s first offering for Oracle users.

In early 2008, the company released Laserfiche 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Next Generation Laserfiche 8|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2008/01/14/next-generation-laserfiche-8-optimizes-infrastructure-integrating-content-with-business-processes|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a re-written workflow engine and integration with Microsoft SharePoint. In August 2008, the company launched Laserfiche Rio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Rio|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2008/08/08/rio|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an enterprise content management offering with unlimited servers, named user licensing and bundled functionality including content management, business process management and a thin-client interface called Web Access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Access|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/Web-Access|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Laserfiche opened an international office in Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Hong Kong|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2009/10/26/laserfiche-opens-new-international-office-in-hong-kong|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a separate company Laserfiche International.

In 2010, Laserfiche filed a lawsuit against [[SAP AG|SAP]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche files lawsuit against SAP|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2010/10/25/laserfiche-files-lawsuit-against-sap-for-trademark-infringement|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for trademark infringement over the disputed trademark phrase "Run Smarter". In 2011, Laserfiche announced that the litigation had been settled amicably and involved a license of the “Run Smarter” trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche &amp; SAP Lawsuit Resolution|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2011/09/20/laserfiche-resolves-trademark-infringement-lawsuit-against-sap|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Laserfiche released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche iOS|url=http://thejournal.com/articles/2011/07/07/laserfiche-brings-document-management-to-the-iphone.aspx|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laserfiche Mobile for iPhone, an app that allows users to capture images with the phone's built-in camera, store them in the Laserfiche repository and include them in digital workflows. Later that year, Laserfiche was listed as a Champion in Info-Tech Research Group’s Enterprise Content Management (ECM) for Process Workers Vendor Landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Identified as champion by Info-Tech Research Group|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2011/12/28/laserfiche-identified-as-a-champion-by-info-tech-research-group|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Info-Tech, “Laserfiche is a stalwart that is exploiting the new capabilities of emerging technology.

'''Latigent LLC''' was an international provider of [[Business Intelligence]], Enterprise RSS, and [[Call Center]] Reporting and Analytics software.

==History==
Latigent, LLC of [[Chicago, IL]], was founded in 2002, as a privately held and funded company, by Chris Crosby and Jason Kolb, two veterans of the contact center industry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Both founders believed that there was a more efficient way of using the information typically gathered in the contact center to better serve the customer and more profitably serve the enterprise.  As a result, the Latigent BlueVue performance management product was born and introduced to the market in 2003.

In December 2005, Latigent released BlueVue II, a Business Information (BI) suite.  Besides reporting functionality and complete data warehousing capabilities, BlueVue II also offered data integration capabilities for performance management.

On September 27, 2007 [[Cisco Systems]] announced a definitive agreement to acquire Latigent LLC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/corp_092707.html Announced A Definitive Agreement to Acquire Latigent LLC]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[comprehensive exam|comprehensive exit exam]]. The MFT-MBA aims to assess skills, knowledge, and reasoning ability within the domain of standard MBA curriculum.&lt;ref name="Test Description"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/mft_mba_flyer.pdf |title=MFT MBA Flyer |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS) and has been used in the MBA programs of over 300 U.S. universities.&lt;ref name="2013 4FMF Data Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |title=2013 Major Field Test Comparative Data Guide: Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MBA) |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194137/http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |archivedate=January 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Most MBA programs require an exit exam to gauge students' comprehensive competency in the field of business management.&lt;ref name="Study Guide"&gt;{{cite book| last =Phelan| first =James| title =The Major Field Test (MFT) for MBA Study Guide| publisher =Practical Application Publications| date =2014| location =Charleston, SC| isbn =0-9779773-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MFT-MBA began being offered in 2002. It was developed nationally by leading educators to assess the skills of graduating MBA students.&lt;ref name="Hays Post"&gt;{{cite news| last = Hays Post staff| title = FHSU MBA students bring in top scores on national MFT exam| newspaper = Hays Post| location = Fort Hays| publisher = Hays Post| date = May 16, 2015| url = http://www.hayspost.com/2015/05/16/fhsu-mba-students-bring-in-top-scores-on-national-mft-exam/| accessdate = October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a tool to compare business programs across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Ingle| first = John | title = Midwestern State University on affordable list| newspaper = Times Record News| location = Witchita Falls| publisher = Journal Media Group| date = August 28, 2014| url = http://www.timesrecordnews.com/business/msu-on-affordable-list_23258473| accessdate = October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETS issues an updated test every 3–4 years in attempt to ensure high content validity.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt; The most recent test forms are 4BMF (February 2005 - June 2009), 4FMF (September 2009 - June 2013), and 4JMF (September 2013 – present).&lt;ref name="2009 4BMF Scoring Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/MFT/pdf/MFT%20PDFs%202007/MBA4BMF.pdf |title=MBA 4BMF |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706064126/https://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/MFT/pdf/MFT%20PDFs%202007/MBA4BMF.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2013 4FMF Data Guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2015 4JMF Data Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |title=2015 Major Field Test Comparative Data Guide: Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MBA) |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The MFT-MBA is based on MBA core curriculum.  Unlike tests that are not aligned to anything but their own curriculum, the MFT-MBA emphasizes content validity.   In order to display [[normative|normativity]] and ensure a consensus of what best reflects core curriculum, the content is constructed using results of a national curriculum survey.  According to ETS, content experts from a diverse representation of higher education institutions (including Major Field Test users and nonusers) participate in this survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/mft/about/content/ |title=Test Content Overview |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basing the exam on core curriculum makes it a level playing field exam, giving it meaningful results and enabling it to measure reasoning ability.&lt;ref name="Honors Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.t10mba.com/admission |title=Membership Admission Requirements |publisher=T10 |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt;

The test contains 124 [[multiple-choice]] questions. There are approximately 32 [[management]] questions, 31 [[marketing]] questions, 33 [[finance]] questions, and 28 [[management accounting|managerial accounting]] questions.  Half of the questions require the strategic integration of two or more subject areas.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt;  In addition to factual knowledge, the test evaluates the student's abilities to interpret materials, understand relationships, and analyze and solve problems.&lt;ref name="Hays Post" /&gt; 

The Major Field Test for MBA can only be taken once.&lt;ref name="Study Guide" /&gt; The amount of time allotted for taking the test is three hours.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt; It is taken on a computer.  All exams are given at proctored facilities. Test takers are provided with scratch paper and pencils, but calculators are not permitted. All test questions present four answer options to choose from, only one of which is correct.&lt;ref name="Study Guide" /&gt;

A national scoring guide is issued annually. Scores range from 220-300.  According to ETS, the overall scaled score on the MFT-MBA measures [[critical thinking]] and [[reason]]ing within the domain of standard MBA curriculum.&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt; The chart on the right provides a scoring summary at approximately every 10th percentile.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7267">'''Management fad''' is a term used to characterize a change in philosophy or operations implemented by a business or institution.

The term is [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and tends to be used in a [[pejorative]] sense, as it implies that such a change is being implemented (often '''''by''''' [[management]] '''''on''''' its [[employee]]s, with little or no input from them) solely because it is (at the time) "popular" within managerial circles, and not necessarily due to any real need for organizational change.  The term further implies that once the underlying philosophy is no longer "popular", it will be replaced by the newest "popular" idea, in the same manner and for the same reason as the previous idea.

Several authors have argued that new management ideas should be subject to greater critical analysis, and for the need for greater conceptual awareness of new ideas by managers.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Clayton M. and Michael E. Raynor, "Why Hard-Nosed Executives Should Care About Management Theory," ''Harvard Business Review'', Vol. 81, No. 9, Sept. 2003, pp. 66-74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors Leonard J. Ponzi and Michael Koenig believe that a key determinant of whether any management idea is a "management fad" is the number and timing of published articles on the idea.  In their research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://informationr.net/ir/8-1/paper145.html Ponzi, Leonard J. and Michael Koenig, "Knowledge Management: Another Management Fad?," ''Information Research'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Oct. 2002, paper no. 145.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ponzi and Koenig argue that once an idea has been discussed for around 3–5 years, if after this time the number of articles on the idea in a given year decreases significantly (similar to the right-hand side of a bell curve), then the idea is most likely a "management fad".

==Common characteristics==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
Management fads are often characterized by the following:
*New [[jargon]] for existing business processes.
*External [[consultants]] who specialize in the implementation of the fad.
*A ''[[certification]]'' or ''appraisal'' process performed by an external agency for a fee.
*Amending the [[job title]]s of existing employees to include references to the fad.
*Claims of a measurable business improvement via measurement of a [[metric system|metric]] (e.g. [[key performance indicator]]) that is defined by the fad itself.
*An internal sponsoring department or individual that gains influence due to the fad's implementation.
*Big words and complex phrases ([[puffery]]).

==Examples==
The following [[management theory|management theories]] and practices appeared on a list of management fashions and fads compiled by [[Adrian Furnham]],&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, Adrian, ''Management and Myths: Challenging Business Fads, Fallacies and Fashions'', Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, U.K., 2004, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; who arranged them in rough chronological order by their date of appearance, 1950s to 1990s:

*[[Matrix management]]
*[[Theory Z]]
*[[The One Minute Manager|One-minute management]]
*[[Management by wandering around]]
*[[Total quality management]]
*[[Business process reengineering]]
*[[Delayering]]
*[[Empowerment]]
*[[360-degree feedback]]
*[[Business process reengineering|Re-engineering]]
*[[Teamwork]]

Other theories and practices which observers have tagged as fads include:

* the tendency to replace every occurrence of "data" in compound managerial terminology with "information", see e.g. [[information integration]] vs. [[data integration]]
* [[Knowledge management]]&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;[http://Informationr.net/ir/8-1/paper144.html Wilson, T.D., "The Nonsense of 'Knowledge Management'," ''Information Research'', Vol. 8, No. 1, Oct. 2002, paper no. 144.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15796">[[Management]] consists of the planning, prioritizing, and organizing work efforts to accomplish objectives within a business organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=103937&amp;xtid=44682|title=Management Styles Explained|last=|first=|date=|website=Films on Demand|publisher=Films Media Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''management style''' is the particular way managers go about accomplishing these objectives. It encompasses the way they make decisions, how they plan and organize work, and how they exercise authority.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.managers.org.uk/~/media/Files/PDF/Checklists/CHK-256-Understanding-management-and-leadership-styles.pdf|title=Understanding Management and Leadership Styles|last=|first=|date=|website=Chartered Management Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management styles vary by company, level of management, and even from person to person. A good manager is one that can adjust their management style to suit different environments and employees. An individual’s management style is shaped by many different factors including internal and external business environments, and how one views the role of work in the lives of employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Factors that shape the management style ==

=== Internal factors ===
Internal company factors that determine a management style include, but are not limited to, policies, priorities, and corporate culture, staff skill levels and motivation, and management structures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In order to be effective a manager’s style and outlook must fit into the businesses [[organizational culture]]. Their style must adhere to the policies and procedures set forth by the organization, and they must be able to achieve company objectives. They are responsible for controlling an effective work team and must uphold organizational beliefs within that team. A manager who cannot do this would likely be deemed ineffective and removed from the position.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Staff skill levels and motivation greatly affect management styles as it is necessary for a manager to accomplish objectives while maintaining a content and effective work team. Less skilled or motivated employees would require a style that is more controlling and fosters consistent supervision to ensure productivity. Highly motivated or skilled employees require less supervision and direction as they are typically more technically skilled than management and have the ability, and desire, to make more autonomous decisions. These employees would benefit from a management style that is less controlling or hands-off.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Hierarchical organization|Hierarchical management structures]] call for decision to be made solely by upper management, and within the scope of a manager’s position in the hierarchy. These types of organizations require more controlling management styles in order to meet objectives and get things done as specified. Fatter structures with more [[decentralized decision-making]] benefit from management styles that encourage team communication and employee’s contribution with regard to decision-making.

=== External factors ===
External factors affecting management styles are those that are outside of the control of the organization. These include, but are not limited to consumers, suppliers, competitors, the economy, and the law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some examples of these factors are a competitor who offers a more autonomous environment for skilled employees and control the job pool; the economy for a specific manufactured good results in a spike in demand causing a production crisis; the laws for a specific industry change and require employees who have extensive knowledge and certification causing the company employees talent and motivation to change.

=== Theory X and Theory Y ===
Douglas McGregor introduced Theory X and Theory Y in 1957.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gannon I, Bougszak II|first=Dave I, Anna II|date=2013|title=Douglas Mcgregor's Theory X and Theory Y.|url=|journal=CRIS - Bulletin of the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinary Study|volume=|pages=85–93|via=De Gruyter Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; This psychological concept proposed that how one viewed human relationships to those of an enterprise determined their style of management.

Theory X proposes that people inherently lack the motivation and desire for responsibility and need to be closely supervised, directed, and tightly controlled in order to achieve team objectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Without it, workers may become unwilling to work. This is considered the more conventional theory and results in management styles that have high degrees of control over employees.

Theory Y conversely suggests that it is human nature to be motivated by objectives and gain satisfaction through the completion of work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those who believe in Theory Y believe that it is the responsibility of management to foster environments where employees can develop potential and utilize their skills to achieve objectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This perspective leads to management styles that give the workers more decision making control and provide less supervision.

== Types of management styles ==
All management styles can be categorized by three major types: Autocratic, Democratic, and Laissez-Faire, with Autocratic being the most controlling and Laissez-Faire being the least controlling.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

=== Autocratic ===
Autocratic management is the most controlling of the management styles. Variations of this style are authoritative, persuasive, and paternalistic. Autocratic managers make all of the decisions in the workplace. Communication with this type of management is one way, top-down to the employees. Employee ideas and contributions are not encouraged or necessary.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=103937&amp;xtid=128526|title=Leadership and Management: Introduction and Case Study|last=|first=|date=|website=Films on Demand|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roles and tasks are clearly defined, and workers are expected to follow these directions without question while being consistently checked and supervised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This type of style is particularly useful in organizations with hierarchical structures where management makes all of the decisions based on positioning in the hierarchy. Employees that benefit from this style of management include those who are new, unskilled, or unmotivated, as they need the supervision and clear direction. Managers can benefit greatly from using this style in times of crises or serious time constraints.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=103937&amp;xtid=49852|title=Management Styles: Authoritarian and Delegative—Training Point Issues in Management #2|last=|first=|date=|website=Films on Demand|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantages of the autocratic management style are little uncertainty, clearly defined roles and expectations for employees, and the speed of decision-making.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All decisions are made by the manager and employees are expected to be compliant leaving little room for variation or confusion. Decision-making speed is ideal and is not slowed by conflicting thought or agendas.

Disadvantages include lack of staff input with ideas are not encouraged or shared. This can lead to job dissatisfaction, absenteeism, and employee turnover. Because managers make all of the decisions, the employees is not inclined to act autonomously and may become too dependent on the manager. Not all employees want or need supervision, and as a result can become resentful and unhappy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Too many dissatisfied employees and the separation of power with an autocratic management style can lead to an ‘us vs them’ mentality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Authoritative style ====
With this management style there is little trust or confidence in employees. This manager dictates orders to employees and expect that they do exactly as required. These employees are unskilled. This requires constant teaching and coaching of the staff as well as consistent supervision.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Persuasive style ====
Using this management style, the manager still makes all decisions for employees but then convinces employees that these decisions were made in the best interest of the team. The only real difference here is that it can establish a higher level of trust between management and staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Paternalistic or Exploitative/Authoritative style ====
The manager still makes all of the decisions in this style of management and treats the employees in a condescending or paternalistic way.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The decisions are made in the best interest of the employees and the manager explains these decision and the importance of them to the employees. These employees may feel well taken care of and looked after by the paternalistic manager but may become resentful of not being taken seriously. This style breeds highly dependent employees.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=103937&amp;xtid=49851|title=Management Styles: Paternalistic and Collaborative—Training Point Issues in Management #1|last=|first=|date=|website=Films on Demand|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democratic ===
The democratic management style involves managers reaching decisions with the input of the employees but being responsible for making the final decision.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are many variations of this style of management including consultative, participative, and collaborative styles. Employee ideas and contributions are encouraged, but not necessary. Communication is both top-down and bottom-up and makes for a cohesive team.

This type of style is versatile with the advantages being more diverse perspectives involved in decision making. As employees are being taken into account before the manager makes decisions, the employees feel valued which increases motivation and productivity.

Disadvantages of the democratic management style are the time it takes to make a decision due to the gathering of ideas and opinions. There is also the potential conflict of different viewpoints playing a role in the decision making and as a result, employees can feel less valued if their input is not taken, leading to decreased morale and productivity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Consultative style ====
With this management style trust and confidence is place in the employees and management actively seeks out their opinions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Participative style ====
Similar to consultative, management trusts the employees, but trusts them completely and not only seeks out their opinions and ideas, but they act on them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They work together to make decisions as a group and the staff is highly involved. As a result the employees feel valued, and show increased motivation and productivity. However a drawback to this style is that some employees do not want to be involved in decision making and can come to resent a manager with this style &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Collaborative style ====
Managers with the collaborative style communicated extensively with employees and make decisions by the majority. The manager believes that involving everyone and making the team take ownership will result in the best decisions made. The main disadvantage of this style is that it is time-consuming, and sometimes the majority decision is not the best decision for the business entity, in which case, the manager should take control of the final choice.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Laissez-faire ===
The laissez-faire management style involves little or no interference from management. The staff do not need supervision and are highly skilled which allows management to take the hand’s off approach and leave the problem solving, and decision making to the staff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Variations of this style include the delegative style and what is referred to as bossless environments or self-managed teams.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=David|date=1991|title=Managing the bossless team: Lessons in distributed leadership|url=|journal=Organizational Dynamics|volume=20|issue=1|pages=31–47|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of style works best in organizations with flatter decentralized management. Typically, the staff is highly skilled, more so than the management, and is trusted with setting the bar for innovation and setting the objectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The advantages of the Laissez faire are increased innovation and creativity through the autonomy of expert staff.  Some examples of this type of employee are be teachers, creatives, and designers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Disadvantages include the risk of low productivity by unsupervised staff, loss of direction due to the hands-off style of management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Delegative style ====
A delegative management style allows employees to take full responsibility of their work areas. The manager assigns tasks with little or no direction and expects the staff to achieve results of their own accord. The manager retains responsibility for meeting objectives. The major drawbacks of this style are lack of uniformity among team members and uncoordinated efforts toward productivity. Also because little direction and guidance is given the team can lack direction and focus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Bossless or self-managed teams ==
Although self managed teams (SMT) and bossless environments are not management styles, they are a style of management chosen by an organization.  Like the Laissez-Faire management style, employees in these environments are highly skilled and motivated, but take it a step further as they are also highly educated, self directed, and know a great deal more about the work than management. SMT’s can report directly to directors or can have managers who follow the delegative, or participative style,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; but these teams require more [[leadership]] than management to remain productive.

== Management by walking around (MBWA) ==
[[Management by wandering around|Management by walking around]] is not an actual management style, it is more of a practice, but still it is labeled as such. Managers who practice MBWA place importance on rich levels of interpersonal communication. They believe that managers have a tendency to become separated from staff and should focus efforts on understanding employees’ work and being visible and accessible. Managers walk around the premises checking with employees and on the status of ongoing projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1996|title=Management by walking around|url=http://libproxy.umassd.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.umassd.edu/docview/211186639?accountid=14573|journal=Management Matters|publisher=CCH Canadian Limited|volume=|issue=16|pages=|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice can be helpful in maintaining contact with employees and offering guidance as well as mitigating problems, however MBWA may also lower productivity levels by distracting employees.

[[File:Gambling table - Zensar (3630410644).jpg|thumb|The gamble of outsourcing - as demonstrated at an outsourcing summit in London in 2009]]
'''''Outsourcing''''' is "an agreement in which one company hires another company to be responsible for an existing internal activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Ian|last2=Anagnostou|first2=Angela|title=The impact of outsourcing on the transaction costs and boundaries of manufacturing|journal=International Journal of Production Economics|volume=88|issue=1|pages=61–71|doi=10.1016/s0925-5273(03)00183-x|year=2004|citeseerx=10.1.1.468.9139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often involves the [[contract]]ing of a [[business process]] (e.g., payroll processing, claims processing), operational, and/or non-core functions, such as manufacturing, [[facility management]], [[call center]] support). The term "outsourcing" came from "outside resourcing" and dates back to at least 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | outsourcing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OED | outsource}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one [[firm]] to another. Outsourcing is also the practice of [[Privatization|handing over control of public services to private enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, Dave, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/afscme-public-interest-privatization_n_3530817.html "Public Interest Group Challenges Privatization Of Local, State Government Services"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211181510/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/01/afscme-public-interest-privatization_n_3530817.html |date=2013-12-11 }}, The Huffington Post, July 1, 2013. Retrieved 2013-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting,&lt;ref name="Hira, Ron 2008"&gt;Hira, Ron, and Anil Hira. Outsourcing America: What's behind Our National Crisis and How We Can Reclaim American Jobs. New York: AMACOM, 2008. Print # 67-96.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes includes [[offshoring]] (relocating a business function to a distant country)&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Paul. ''What's This India Business?: Offshoring, Outsourcing, and the Global Services Revolution''. London: Nicholas Brealey International, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[nearshoring]] (transferring a business process to a nearby country). Outsourcing is often confused with offshoring, however, they can be distinguished: a company can outsource (work with a service provider) and not offshore to a distant country. For example, in 2003 [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] outsourced their facilities' management support, but it did not involve offshoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2012/07/09/11898/5-facts-about-overseas-outsourcing/|title=5 Facts About Overseas Outsourcing|date=2012-07-09|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial savings from lower international labor rates can provide a major motivation for outsourcing or offshoring. There can be tremendous savings from lower international labor rates when offshoring.

In contrast, [[insourcing]] entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via [[vertical integration]]. However, a business can provide a contract service to another organization without necessarily insourcing that business process.

==Overview==
Two organizations may enter into a contractual agreement involving an [[Financial transaction|exchange]] of [[Service (economics)|services]], expertise, and [[payments]]. Outsourcing is said to help firms to perform well in their core competencies, fuel innovation, and mitigate a shortage of skill or expertise in the areas where they want to outsource.&lt;ref&gt;Overby, S (2007) [http://www.cio.com/article/40380/ABC_An_Introduction_to_Outsourcing ABC: An Introduction to Outsourcing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630130752/http://www.cio.com/article/40380/ABC_An_Introduction_to_Outsourcing |date=2007-06-30 }}. CIO.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, businesses increasingly outsourced to suppliers outside their own country, sometimes referred to as offshoring or [[offshore outsourcing]]. Several related terms have emerged to refer to various aspects of the complex relationship between economic [[organizations]] or [[Business networking|networks]], such as [[nearshoring]], [[crowdsourcing]], [[multisourcing]],&lt;ref&gt;(Q4 2006)[http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=mandatory-multisourcing-discipline&amp;page=ss-viewresearch Mandatory Multisourcing Discipline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142453/http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=mandatory-multisourcing-discipline&amp;page=ss-viewresearch |date=2007-09-28 }} Business Trends Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061108_738883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business Mandatory Multisourcing Discipline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119082031/http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061108_738883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business |date=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[strategic alliances]]/[[strategic partnerships]], strategic outsourcing.,&lt;ref&gt;see Holcomb &amp; Hitt, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vested outsourcing]].

Outsourcing can offer greater budget flexibility and control. Outsourcing allows organizations to pay for the services and business functions they need, when they need them. It also reduces the need to hire and train specialized staff, brings in fresh [[engineering]] expertise, and can reduce capital, operating expenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olive|first=B|title=Outsourcing Growing, Despite Controversy|journal=Power|year=2004|pages=148(4), 19–20.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and risk.

"Do what you do best and outsource the rest" has become an internationally recognized business tagline first "coined and developed"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haus|first1=Marian|title=Best 10 Peter Drucker quotes|url=http://pmseed.com/best-10-peter-drucker-quotes/|website=pmseed|publisher=pmseed|accessdate=26 April 2015|date=2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416043146/http://pmseed.com/best-10-peter-drucker-quotes/|archivedate=16 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s by the "legendary management consultant" [[Peter Drucker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitasek|first1=Kate|title=A New way to Outsource|journal=Forbes|date=1 June 2011|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/01/vested-outsourcing-microsoft-intel-leadership-managing-kate-vitasek.html|accessdate=26 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132447/http://www.forbes.com/2010/06/01/vested-outsourcing-microsoft-intel-leadership-managing-kate-vitasek.html|archivedate=15 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The slogan was primarily used to advocate outsourcing as a viable business strategy. It has been said that Mr. Drucker began explaining the concept of "Outsourcing" as early as 1989 in his ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' article entitled "Sell the Mailroom."&lt;ref&gt;Drucker Peter F, (1989) "Sell the Mailroom," ''Wall Street Journal'', accessible at {{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113202230063197204 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522111235/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113202230063197204 |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Drucker's perspective, a company should only seek to subcontract in those areas in which it demonstrated no special ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wartzman|first1=Rick|title=The Drucker Difference:  Insourcing and Outsourcing: the Right Mix|journal=Bloomberg Business|date=5 February 2010|url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|accessdate=6 May 2015|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522173550/http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|archivedate=22 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The business strategy outlined by his slogan recommended that companies should take advantage of a specialist provider's knowledge and economies of scale to improve performance and achieve the service needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Gwynne|title=Warehouse Management: A Complete Guide To Improving Efficiency and Minimizing Costs In the Modern Warehouse|date=2014|publisher=Kogan Page Limited|location=Walnut Street Suite 1100 Philadelphia PA 19102|isbn=978 0 7494 6934 4|page=316|edition=Second|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oimhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=Do+what+you+do+best+and+outsource+the+rest+drucker+drucker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rE56Ap5bc9&amp;sig=g4gAp2w9iinUOujS7uJnJFDqqHI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Iac7VZH3DsKWNvDYgKgI&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Do%20what%20you%20do%20best%20and%20outsource%20the%20rest%20drucker%20drucker&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924053857/https://books.google.com/books?id=oimhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA316&amp;lpg=PA316&amp;dq=Do+what+you+do+best+and+outsource+the+rest+drucker+drucker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rE56Ap5bc9&amp;sig=g4gAp2w9iinUOujS7uJnJFDqqHI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Iac7VZH3DsKWNvDYgKgI&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Do%20what%20you%20do%20best%20and%20outsource%20the%20rest%20drucker%20drucker&amp;f=false|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 by way of recognition, Peter Drucker posthumously received a significant honor, when he was inducted into the Outsourcing Hall of Fame for his outstanding work in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wartzman|first1=Rick|title=Insourcing and Outsourcing: the Right Mix|journal=Bloomberg Business|date=February 2010|url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|accessdate=26 April 2015|publisher=Bloomberg Business.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522173550/http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/feb2010/ca2010024_507452.htm|archivedate=22 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outsourcing models ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2018}}
A serial report published in the 2010s looking at outsourcing models in [[clinical development]] described seven distinct models: Preferred Provider, Fee-for-Service, Functional Service Provider (FSP), Hybrid Full Service/FSP, In-Sourced, Compound/Program-based, and Sole-Source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Miseta|first=Ed|date=August 20, 2018|title=Clinical Outsourcing Models: Still A Lot Of Churn And Uncertainty|url=https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/clinical-outsourcing-models-still-a-lot-of-churn-and-uncertainty-0001|department=From the Editor|magazine=Clinical Leader|type=Interview of Andrew Schafer|publisher=VertMarkets, Inc.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for outsourcing===
Companies primarily outsource to reduce certain costs, which may include peripheral or "non-core" business expenses,&lt;ref&gt;Forey, Gail, and Jane Lockwood. Globalization, Communication and the Workplace: Talking across the World. New York: Continuum, 2011. Electronic Book #21-26.&lt;/ref&gt; high taxes, high energy costs, excessive government regulation or mandates, and production or labor costs. The incentive to outsource may be greater for U.S. companies due to unusually high corporate taxes and mandated benefits like [[social security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and safety protection ([[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations).&lt;ref&gt;Buchholz, Todd G. Bringing the Jobs Home: How the Left Created the Outsourcing Crisis&amp;nbsp;— and How We Can Fix It. New York: Sentinel, 2004. Print 97-118.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it appears U.S. companies do not outsource to reduce executive or managerial costs. For instance, [[executive pay in the United States]] in 2007 was more than 400 times more than average workers—a gap 20 times bigger than it was in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Albert R. "Letter From Washington: As U.S. rich-poor gap grows, so does public outcry" NY Times 2/18/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons include:
*Reducing and controlling operating costs.
*Improving company focus.
*Gaining access to world-class capabilities.
*Freeing internal resources for other purposes. 
*Streamlining or increasing efficiency for time-consuming functions. 
*Maximizing use of external resources.

===White-collar outsourcing===
Outsourcing of [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] work has grown rapidly since the early 21st century, despite a focus on manufacturing outsourcing. The [[digital workplace|digital workforce]] of countries like [[India]] and [[China]] are only paid a fraction of what would be [[minimum wage]] in the US. On average, [[software engineers]] are getting paid between 250,000 and 1,500,000 rupees (US$4,000 to US$23,000) in India as opposed to $40,000–$100,000 in countries such as the [[US]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/203549187 Gillis, A. (2001, Digital sweatshops. This, 34, 6-6.]&lt;/ref&gt; Outsourcing has also expanded to include many different countries; [[Costa Rica]] has become a big source for outsourcing work as it offers the advantage of a highly educated labor force, a large bilingual population, stable democratic government, shares similar time zones with the United States, and it takes only a few hours to travel between Costa Rica and the US. Companies such as Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble, HP, Gensler, Amazon and Bank of America have big operations in Costa Rica.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the recent years there has been an exponential growth in white collar work with service providers emerging in a wide range of activities, from banking and legal services to companies like Resources US,&lt;ref name="Resources US"&gt;[http://www.resourcesus.net Resources US pioneer in outsourcing services to US architecture firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611173821/http://www.resourcesus.net/ |date=2016-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a pioneer in outsourcing services for architecture firms in United States. Unlike outsourced manufacturing, outsourced white collar work, offers workers the flexibility to choose their working hours, and which companies to work for. With many individuals [[telecommuting]] from home, the companies that require this type of work do not need to allocate additional funds for setting up of office space, management salary, and employee benefits as these individuals are [[independent contractor|contracted workers]].&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Ross, J; Irani, L; Silberman, M.S.; Zaldivar, A; Tomlinson, B (2010).

==Implications==

===For business===

====Management processes====
Globalization and complex [[supply chains]], along with greater physical distance between higher management and the production-floor employees often requires a change in management methodologies, as inspection and feedback may not be as direct and frequent as in internal processes. This often requires the assimilation of new communication methods such as [[voice over IP]], [[instant messaging]], and [[Issue tracking]] systems, new [[time management]] methods such as [[Comparison of time tracking software|time tracking software]], and new cost- and schedule-assessment tools such as [[Comparison of development estimation software|cost estimation software]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Communications and customer service====
In the area of [[call center]] outsourcing, organizations that are not experienced in working with outsourced call centers may suffer from lower end-user-experience as a result of outsourcing. This is exacerbated when outsourcing is combined with offshoring in regions where the first language and culture are different.&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620105537/http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf |date=2010-06-20 }}. Cultural Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, foreign [[call center]] agents may speak with different [[linguistics|linguistic]] features such as [[Accent (dialect)|accents]], word use and phraseology, which may impede comprehension. The visual cues that are missing in a  [[telephone call]] may lead to misunderstandings and difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Alster, N (2005) [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/4390954/c_2984406/?f=archives Customer Disservice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702092211/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/4390954/c_2984406/?f=archives |date=2007-07-02 }} www.CFO.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Governance====
In 1979, Nobel laureate [[Oliver E. Williamson]] wrote that the governance structure is the "framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided." Adding further that "because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction."&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: {{cite web |url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919093134/http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3/ |archivedate=2016-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Tennessee researchers have been studying complex outsourcing relationships since 2003. Emerging thinking regarding strategic outsourcing is focusing on creating a contract structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex business arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, ﬂexible, and credible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate, et. al.|title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230112684|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Also see [[relational contract]], [[governance]], [[Vested outsourcing]].)

====Security====
Before outsourcing, an organization is responsible for the actions of their entire staff, sometimes a substantial liability. When these same people are transferred to an outsource service provider, they may not even change desks. But their legal status changes. They are no longer directly employed by (and responsible to) the organization. This creates legal, security and compliance issues that are often addressed through the contract between the client and the suppliers. This is one of the most complex areas of outsourcing and sometimes involves a specialist third-party adviser.

Fraud is a specific security issue as well as criminal activity, whether it is by employees or the supplier staff. However, it can be disputed that fraud is more likely when outsourcing is involved. For example, in April 2005, a high-profile case involved the theft of $350,000 from four [[Citibank]] customers when call-center workers acquired the passwords to customer accounts and transferred the money to their own accounts opened under fictitious names. Citibank did not find out about the problem until the American customers noticed discrepancies with their accounts and notified the bank.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro, J (2005) [http://www.infoworld.com/article/2668975/application-development/indian-call-center-workers-charged-with-citibank-fraud.html Indian call center workers charged with Citibank fraud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042721/http://www.infoworld.com/article/2668975/application-development/indian-call-center-workers-charged-with-citibank-fraud.html |date=2015-09-24 }}. www.infoworld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insourcing===
Outsourcing has gone through many iterations and reinventions. Some outsourcing contracts have been partially or fully reversed, citing an inability to execute strategy, lost transparency &amp; control, onerous contractual models, a lack of competition, recurring costs, hidden costs, and so on. Companies shifting to [[insourcing]] often cite the desire to increase control, compliance and to gain competitive differentiation through vertical integration or the development of shared services, commonly called a [[center of excellence]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Further, the label ''outsourcing'' has been found to be used for too many different kinds of exchanges often in confusing ways. For example, global software development, which often involves people working in different countries, cannot simply be called outsourcing. The outsourcing-based market model fails to explain why these development projects are jointly developed, and not simply bought and sold in the marketplace. Recently, a study has identified an additional system of governance, termed algocracy, which appears to govern global software projects alongside bureaucratic and market-based mechanisms. The study&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Aneesh|Aneesh]], A. Global Labor: Algocratic Modes of Organization, Sociological Theory 27:4 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes code-based governance system from bureaucracy and the market, and underscores the prominent features of each organizational form in terms of its ruling mechanism: bureaucracy (legal-rational), the market (price), and algocracy (programming or algorithm). So, global software development projects, though not insourced, are not outsourced either. They are in-between, in a process that is sometimes termed "remote in-sourcing."&lt;ref&gt;BPM Watch: {{cite web |url=http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303212216/http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/in-sourcing-a-closer-look-at-an-emerging-outsourcing-trend/ |archivedate=2013-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects are developed together where a common software platform allows different teams around the world to work on the same project together.

===Standpoint of labor===
From the standpoint of labor, outsourcing may represent a new threat, contributing to worker insecurity, and is reflective of the general process of [[globalization]] and [[Polarization (economics)|economic polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] (2006). "Feeling No Pain." ''New York Times'', March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2009, [[Jeff Immelt]], the CEO of [[General Electric]], called for the United States to increase its manufacturing base employment to 20% of the workforce, commenting that the U.S. has outsourced too much and can no longer rely on consumer spending to drive demand.&lt;ref name=Immelt&gt;Bailey, David and Soyoung Kim (June 26, 2009).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/8578904 GE's Immelt says U.S. economy needs industrial renewal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611181851/http://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/8578904 |date=2015-06-11 }}.''UK Guardian.''. Retrieved on June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standpoint of government===
Western governments may attempt to compensate workers affected by outsourcing through various forms of legislation. In Europe, the [[Acquired Rights Directive]] attempts to address the issue. The Directive is implemented differently in different nations. In the United States, the [[Trade Adjustment Assistance]] Act is meant to provide compensation for workers directly affected by international trade agreements. Whether or not these policies provide the security and fair compensation they promise is debatable.

====Policy-making strategy====
A main feature of outsourcing influencing policy-making is the unpredictability it generates regarding the future of any particular sector or skill-group. The uncertainty of future conditions influences governance approaches to different aspects of long-term policies.

=====Competitiveness strategy=====
Economic growth requires change, therefore a governance disposed to helping social and economic structures adapt to the changing environment will facilitate growth and a stable transition to new economic structures&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbludning(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; until the economic structures become detrimental to the social, political and cultural structures.

In [[Developing country|developing countries]], policies that embrace the global phenomenon of outsourcing are a logical response to the ongoing movement towards "open markets" and "trade liberalization." Outsourcing, when interpreted as a trade phenomenon, complements trade liberalization strategies not only by promoting technological spillovers and capital inflows but also by offsetting the increasing levels of unemployment which result from opening up domestic markets. As prices adjust to those in the global market they no longer reflect domestic productivity, driving lower-productivity firms in the previously protected sectors out of business. Economic theorists argue that the resulting unemployment is only temporary as workers readjust and are eventually incorporated into the country's most productive sectors, namely those which enjoy a competitive edge over other players in the international market. Nonetheless, rapid liberalization of markets in developing countries has not maximized the productivity potential of the region. In the Global South, where technological development is drastically lower than in the North, the redeployment of human and capital resources into new export markets has not come at the cost of necessarily low-productivity sectors but rather underdeveloped ones. In other words, many of the previously protected sectors were not competitive yet on a global scale, not because they naturally lacked the comparative advantage, but because industry efficiency had not yet been reached.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005"&gt;Stiglitz, J. And Charlton, A., (2005). "Trade can be Good for Development," Ch. 2 in Fair Trade for All, Oxford University Press, Oxford, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases where liberalization stunts the growth of potential industries, unemployment is a reflection of many underemployed resources.

Outsourcing fills in the gap of receding protected national industries, improving employment and living standards. Among other economic externalities, outsourcing promotes capital inflows and infrastructure. In Mexico, wage convergence was faster in cities where outsourcing first took hold through [[maquiladora]]s, along the [[Mexico–United States border]]. Studies suggest that for every 10% increase in US wages, northern cities in Mexico which are most influenced by outsourcing would experience wage rises of 2.5%, about 0.69% higher than in inner cities.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, G. (2003), "What Has Happened to Wages in Mexico Since NAFTA", NBER Working Paper Series, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption and reduced tax revenues after the signing of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] have limited the economic resources available to the Mexican government, thus explaining the difference in investment policies between Mexico and China.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005" /&gt; Conversely, one of the successes of Asian countries in the twentieth century has been their promotion of higher rates of saving and investment. Studies suggest that the increase in capital input fueled the ‘Asian miracle’ rather than improvements in productivity and industrial efficiency. Though the previous conclusion suggests production conditions in the region remained static, the situation in East Asia experienced rapid transformations. Not only were national educational rates raised drastically, but there was also an increase in patenting and research and development expenditures. Rising levels of education, urbanization and even of patenting illustrate the active role of the government in advancing education as well as encouraging research and development.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, P., Obtsfeld, M. And Melitz, M., (2012) "East Asia: Success and Crisis", in International Economics: Theory and Policy, Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Education strategy=====
Jobs become outsourced not based on the skill-level group it represents, but rather based on a variety of other factors including transportation cost of ideas, wage and labour productivity edge.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"/&gt; Because of the overall uncertainty regarding the future dynamics of outsourcing it is not possible to predict the nature of labour demand in different regions. To better prepare the domestic workforce to future industry demands, therefore, national education programs ought to focus on flexibility and diversity of skills rather than on any specific task-oriented skills. Emphasis should go on preparing students both to succeed in non-habitual tasks and to adapt to changes in labour demands in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Blinder, A. (2006), "Offshoring: The Next Industrial Revolution?" Foreign Affairs, 85:2, 113.128&lt;/ref&gt; A specific goal that ought to be adopted is teaching students how to learn rather than teach them particular skills. This strategy would help students adapt to changing skill requirements in the future thus reducing friction from structural unemployment.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006"/&gt;

=====Welfare state strategy=====
The uncertainty regarding the domestic productivity edge renders caution a key element of governance to ensure a sustainable regional developmenloyed{{Neologism inline|date=May 2017}} re-enter the work force and smoothly transition into high-demand labour opportunities, potentially through re-training programs, the government{{Who|date=May 2017}} should also address the socioeconomic struggle and other welfare concerns of displaced employees.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbludning(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative welfare effects of outsourcing have gathered substantial public attention. The possibility of outsourcing has internationalized labour markets which used to be local, opening up jobs which were traditionally non-traded to international competition. The resulting combination of lower wages and unemployment for certain jobs has driven the perceived ‘losers’ to engage in heated political debate.

Labour unions in the European Union have succeeded in pushing through protectionist policies in favour or lower-skilled groups throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including the Common Agricultural Policy on farming.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt; Interest groups opposing outsourcing have been more active to voice their disapproval because the negative outcomes of the phenomenon are more concentrated on specific groups of people, namely those losing jobs to external competition, whereas the benefits from it become dissipated among the population at large. Overall lower prices and greater quality and variety of goods in domestic markets are some of the benefits of exploiting a country's comparative advantage through outsourcing.

Unlike the alleged ‘losers’ from outsourcing, those affected positively by it lack the motivation to organize to voice their support. There has been a wave of protectionism{{When|date=May 2017}} concerned with deep changes in the social structure allegedly imposed on the global system through globalization and outsourcing. The activists{{Who|date=May 2017}} see a readjustment of class systems and highlight an increased fracture in societies between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ as different groups adjust to increasingly or decreasingly advantageous positions in the system of outsourcing. Opponents of outsourcing have also denounced it as a threat to local cultural integrity.

The argument on cultural disintegration points to the standardization of practices and norms as multinational corporations become involved with industries in regions culturally different from those in the country of origin. The alleged diffusion of culture has raised concern over the endurance of cultural norms and values, sociopolitical institutions and frameworks, or even cultural preferences and traditions in a context of increasing foreign presence.&lt;ref&gt;Rodrik, D., (2007), "Globalization for Whom", Ch. 9 in One Economics Many Recipes, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased uncertainty regarding future socioeconomic security ought to be met with policies promoting equality and a fair redistribution of economic gains for a government to maintain its voters’ favour. Because of overall unpredictability, governments will likely need to reassure civilians that the burden of employment jobs resulting from outsourcing will be shared among taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt;

The fluctuations in employment levels are determined by the types of jobs which can be profitably outsourced or offshored. Domestic jobs become offshored or outsourced when lower productivity in other regions is compensated by lower wages, making outsourcing profitable even despite the added costs of transportation. The overall cost-effectiveness of the spatial unbundling of the industrial process thus depends on the cost of transporting specific services or ideas given the available technology. Because of these technological advancements such as the telecommunications revolution, air shipping or the Internet have deeply accelerated outsourcing and may continue to boost this process.

The future results of technological ingenuity and innovation are unknown, as are its potential impacts employment levels on any given task or job across regions.&lt;ref name="Baldwin 2006" /&gt; In the [[Global South]], policies attracting multinational corporations can help increase employment levels and promote growth. Governments that pursue these policies facilitate welfare protection given the context of increased unemployment in industries which cannot compete with the international market due to trade liberalization policies.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz, J. And Charlton 2005" /&gt;

=====Industrial policy=====
Outsourcing results from an internationalization of labor markets as more tasks become tradable. According to leading economist Greg Mankiw, the labour market functions under the same forces as the market of goods, with the underlying implication that the greater the number of tasks available to being moved, the better for efficiency under the gains from trade. With technological progress, more tasks can be offshored at different stages of the overall corporate process.&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, G. and Swagel, P. (2005). "The Politics and Economics of Offshore Outsourcing," working paper for the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Environmental policy=====
There are widespread claims that outsourcing has pushed environmental standards down in developing regions as countries compete to attract foreign projects and investment. Similar to lower wages, lower health and environmental regulations contribute to giving a country a comparative advantage over another due to lower production costs. The controversy this raises, however, is that unlike wages, lower health or environmental standards does benefit the new employees joining the workforce.
Import competition has caused a de facto ‘race-to-the-bottom’ where countries lower environmental regulations to secure a competitive edge for their industries relative to other countries. As Mexico competes with China over Canadian and American markets, its national Commission for Environmental Cooperation has not been active in enacting or enforcing regulations to prevent environmental damage from increasingly industrialized Export Processing Zones. Similarly, since the signing of NAFTA heavy industries have increasingly moved to the US which has a comparative advantage due to its abundant presence of capital and well-developed technology. A further example of environmental de-regulation with the objective of protecting trade incentives have been the numerous exemptions to carbon taxes in European countries during the 1990s. The evidence suggests that even if outsourcing has promoted lower environmental protection, there are no intrinsic geographic implications that the Global South has been more negatively affected than the North. o Although outsourcing can influence environmental de-regulatory trends, the added cost of preventing pollution does not majorly determine trade flows or industrialization.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. (2007), "Trade and the Environment: What do we do now", Ch. 39 in Handbook on International Trade Policy, ed. Kerr, W and Gaosford, J., Edward Elgar Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization and socio-economic implications===
{{Main|Globalization}}

====Global inequality and development====

=====Industrialization=====
Outsourcing has contributed to further levelling of global inequalities as it has led to general trends of industrialization in the Global South and deindustrialization in the Global North.

Even though outsourcing has promoted a movement of industrial sites from the Global North to Global South regions, it has not been the only reason for the concurrent deindustrialization and industrialization of the North and South respectively. Deindustrialization in more economically and technologically developed regions has also been affected by increased industrial productivity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006). "Globalisation: the great unbundling(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in industrial efficiency which characterized development in developed countries has occurred as a result of labor-saving technological improvements. Although these improvements do not directly reduce employment levels but rather increase output per unit of work, they can indirectly diminish the amount of labor required for fixed levels of output.&lt;ref&gt;Easterly, W. (2002), "Solow's Surprise: Investment is not the Key to Growth", Ch. 3 in The Elusive Quest for Growth, The MIT Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a trending shift in demand towards non-tradable services such as those in the health-care or government sectors has further accelerated deindustrialization in the Global North. Since these tasks cannot be outsourced, the demand for them needs to be met domestically abiding by the local market price. Consequently, a shift in the labor force towards fulfilling these profitable services has mostly taken place at the expense of industry since the agricultural sector in the early industrializing Global North had already been maximizing its labour capacity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite the variety of domestic and international factors affecting deindustrialization in the Global North, those concerning the external influence of the global market have been the most influential ones since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Rowthorn, R. and Coutts, K. ( 2004), "Deindustrialization and the balance of payments in advanced economies," UNCTAD Discussion Paper No.170&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent industrialization process outsourcing has encouraged in the Global South has taken place at a much faster pace than it did during its beginnings in the North, given that the well-developed technology was already developed, and merely spread to further regions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Growth and income=====
The almost simultaneous industrialization of the developing Global South and deindustrialization of the more developed Global North resulted in an international convergence of incomes.

Outsourcing has been characterized by rapid rates of growth and industrialization in the Global South. Conversely, the Global North has experienced a moderate slowdown in growth. Patterns of global industrialization and deindustrialization are explained by a combination of models in economic geography and economic growth. Models in economic geography illustrate that decreasing communication costs reduce the spatial clustering of industrial development. The lower cost to the spread of ideas improved coordination and communication within corporations across greater geographic distances. This process originated roughly after the international chaos of the World Wars, as a consequence of advancements in information technology during the 1960s. Further adaptations to technological progress, particularly the spread of the internet and liberalization of the telecommunications industry, permitted an acceleration of the movement of ideas and consequently of outsourcing since about the 1980s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Urbanization=====
The pace of urbanization in the Global North decreased considerably relative to its high levels following the Industrial Revolution. Rates of urban growth have been higher in the Global South.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Richard. (2006), "Globalisation: the great unbundling(s)," Chapter 1, in Globalization Challenges for Europe, Secretariat of the Economic Council, Finnish Prime Minister's Office, Helsinki, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade====
Outsourcing emerged with a new wave of globalization marked by high volumes of trade and capital flows. The increased movement of capital and goods contrasted starkly with the barriers and protectionism prevalent throughout the World Wars and the Great Depression during the Interwar Years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Migration====
The level of migration has remained relatively low, particularly compared to the mass migratory trends which characterized the Industrial Revolution roughly between 1850 and 1914.,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; probably because labor markets are not free now. Countries now have discrimination labor laws, only allow people with citizenship cards live and work free in their territories, even getting a citizenship card is difficult for some one not born in their territory. Free labor markets, discrimination based with a person skills would help reduce outsourcing problems, letting people freely follow their jobs in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Howard|title=Cultural Communities in a Global Labor Market: Immigration Restrictions as Residential Segregation|year=2007|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Law School|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Domestic inequality====
Outsourcing in the Global North led to a rising divergence in domestic employment levels in different tasks within a given industry, making tackling unemployment more difficult for governments as job losses ceased to be primarily sectoral.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==By country==

===United States===
"Outsourcing" has become a continuing political issue in the United States, having been conflated with offshoring, during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]]. The political debate centered on outsourcing's consequences for the domestic U.S. workforce. [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] U.S. presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] criticized U.S. firms that outsource jobs abroad or that incorporate overseas in [[tax haven]]s to avoid paying their "fair share" of [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. taxes]] during his 2004 campaign, calling such firms "[[Benedict Arnold]] corporations".

Criticism of outsourcing, from the perspective of [[U.S. citizen]]s, generally revolves around the costs associated with transferring control of the labor process to an external entity in another country. A [[Zogby International]] poll conducted in August 2004 found that 71% of American voters believed that "outsourcing jobs overseas" hurt the economy while another 62% believed that the U.S. government should impose some legislative action against companies that transfer domestic jobs overseas, possibly in the form of increased taxes on companies that outsource.&lt;ref&gt;Zogby International survey results online at [http://www.zogby.com/news/2004/09/22/majority-of-americans-71-say-outsourcing-jobs-overseas-bad-for-us-economy-china-viewed-as-greatest-e/ zogby.com]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prediction (form 2010) claims that, by 2014, more than 1.3 million positions will disappear because of "the accelerated movement of work to India ..." and some other countries willing to accept outsourced jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Bonasia, J. (2010, December 03). Offshoring, for good or ill, comes of age putting India on the map competitive world markets demand outsourcing, but it does drain domestic jobs. Investor's Business Daily. A04.&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama promoted an act titled '[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3364 Bring Jobs Home Act]' that would help reshore jobs by giving incentives such as a tax cut or a 20 percent tax credit for moving operations back to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Documents and Publications. (2012, May 16). Brown outlines "Bring Jogs Home Act" aim at encouraging business to bring hobs back to the U.S. 2012 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The same bill was reintroduced in the [[113th United States Congress]] as the [[Bring Jobs Home Act (S. 2569; 113th Congress)]].&lt;ref name=PoliticoBorrowedTime&gt;{{cite news|last1=Everett|first1=Burgess|title=Borrowed time: Tale of a Walsh bill|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/john-walsh-bring-jobs-home-act-bill-109307.html|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=Politico|date=23 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724223856/http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/john-walsh-bring-jobs-home-act-bill-109307.html|archivedate=24 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2569sum&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 2569 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2569|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=25 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728161506/https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2569|archivedate=28 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor advocates accuse [[union busting]] as one possible cause of outsourcing. They argue that as unions are disadvantaged by union busting legislation, workers lose bargaining power and it becomes easier for corporations to fire them and ship their job overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://act.americanrightsatwork.org/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=576

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another rationale is the high corporate income tax rate in the U.S. relative to other OECD nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1466.html |title=U.S. Lagging Behind OECD Corporate Tax Trends |publisher=The Tax Foundation |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706032603/http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1466.html |archivedate=2009-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Tamny |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODZjNjI4ZTNjZmNiOGMxYjAwOTg1ZGI0NmFiOWFjZjI= |title=John Tamny on Hillary Clinton Economics on NRO Financial |publisher=Article.nationalreview.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109171714/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODZjNjI4ZTNjZmNiOGMxYjAwOTg1ZGI0NmFiOWFjZjI= |archivedate=2009-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=June 2018}} and the practice of taxing revenues earned outside of U.S. jurisdiction, a very uncommon practice. However, outsourcing is not solely a U.S. phenomenon as corporations in various nations with low tax rates outsource as well, which means that high taxation can only partially, if at all, explain US outsourcing. For example, the amount of corporate outsourcing in 1950 would be considerably lower than today,{{when|date=June 2018}} yet the tax rate was actually higher in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.cbpp.org/files/10-16-03tax.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also suggested that lowering the corporate income tax and ending the double-taxation of foreign-derived revenue (taxed once in the nation where the revenue was raised, and once from the U.S.) will alleviate corporate outsourcing and make the U.S. more attractive to foreign companies. However, while the US has a high official tax rate, the actual taxes paid by US corporations may be considerably lower due to the use of tax loopholes, tax havens, and "gaming the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/high-corporate-tax-rate-is-misleading-22463/ |title=High Corporate Tax Rate Is Misleading at |publisher=Smartmoney.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210200332/http://www.smartmoney.com/investing/economy/high-corporate-tax-rate-is-misleading-22463/ |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than avoiding taxes, outsourcing may be mostly driven by the desire to lower labor costs (see standpoint of labor above). [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] has also been cited as a factor for corporate flight from U.S. jurisdiction.

===European Union===
Where outsourcing involves the transfer of an undertaking, it is subject to Council Directive 77/187 of 14 February 1977, on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (as amended by Directive 98/50/EC of 29 June 1998; consolidated in Directive 2001/23 of 12 March 2001). Under that directive, rights acquired by employees with the former employer are to be safeguarded when they, together with the undertaking in which they are employed, are transferred to another employer, i.e., the contractor. An example of a case involving such contracting-out was the decision of the European Court of Justice in Christel Schmidt v. Spar- und Leihkasse der früheren Ämter Bordesholm, Kiel und Cronshagen, Case C-392/92 [1994]. Although subsequent decisions have disputed whether a particular contracting-out exercise constituted a transfer of an undertaking (see, for example, [[Süzen v Zehnacker Gebaeudereingung GmbH|Ayse Süzen v. Zehnacker Gebäudereinigung GmbH Krankenhausservice]], Case C-13/95 [1997]), in principle, employees of an enterprise outsourcing part of its activities in which they are employed may benefit from the protection offered by the directive.

Seeking to implement the cost-cutting solutions, many Western European firms have been transferring tech projects eastward. For example, Deutsche Bank has some of its software developed in Ukraine, Siemens possess R&amp;D center in Romania. Europe Outsourcing has produced outstanding results and henceforward they are increasing them in numbers.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Despite unfavorable economic conditions from 2007 to 2009, the outsourcing services market continued to flourish in Central and Eastern European. In 2008 when the inflow of investment in Western Europe was down by 48%, it fell by only 9% in Central and Eastern Europe. In [[Poland]] alone, during 2009, the year following the global economic downturn, approximately 10,000 jobs were created in [[business process outsourcing]] (BPO).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Co-sourcing==
'''Co-sourcing''' is a business practice where a service is performed by staff from inside an organization and also by an external service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=80237620 | title='Co-Sourcing' and More | publisher=hreonline.com | date=March 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=McIlvaine, Andrew R. | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513092203/http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=80237620 | archivedate=May 13, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/6502924 | title=Out With 'Outsourcing' And In With 'Co-Sourcing' | publisher=informationweek.com | date=September 2, 2002 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=Khirallah, Diane Rezendes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a service performed in concert with a [[customer|client]]'s existing internal [[audit]] department. The scope of work may focus on one or more aspects of the [[internal audit]] function. Co-sourcing can serve to minimize sourcing risks, increase transparency, clarity and lend toward better control over the processes outsourced.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary: {{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/co-sourcing.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819235940/http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/co-sourcing.html |archivedate=2016-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of co-sourcing services are supplementing the in-house internal audit staff with specialized skills such as information [[risk management]] or integrity services, providing routine assistance to in-house auditing for operations and control evaluations in peak period activity and conducting special projects such as fraud investigation or plant investment appraisals. Another example of co-sourcing is outsourcing part of [[software development]] or [[software maintenance]] activities to an external [[organization]], while keeping part of the development in-house. Other internal business activities such as [[Human Resources|HR]] and administrative tasks can also be co-sourced by [[Professional Employer Organization|employee leasing]] companies.

===Identity management co-sourcing===
It is an approach to enterprise [[identity management]] in which the identity service interacts directly or through some technical footprint with an organization's [[Information Technology]] (IT) identity back-end infrastructure: [[directory service|directories]], [[database]]s, and other identity repositories. The organization and the external service provider typically have a shared responsibility for building, hosting and operating the identity service. The balance of this responsibility can vary depending on the service levels required, and span from an all on-premises deployment, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated within the organization's [[IT infrastructure]] and managed on-premises by the external service provider. This contrasts with an "all in-the-cloud" service scenario, where the identity service is built, hosted and operated by the service provider in an externally hosted, [[cloud computing]] infrastructure.

==Counterwave outsourcing==
Some firms have reversed the decision to outsource because the results were not entirely as expected. The circumstances which allow firms to unbundle the different tasks or stages of its manufacturing process into different locations have not been fully determined. Though the nature of the tasks plays a role determining their interconnectedness, other factors such as innovation in the manufacturing process or advances in transport and communication technology also affect the need for direct contact among employees. As the process which ties tasks together within firms remains unclear, there is a degree of uncertainty about which tasks need to remain geographically clustered together. In many cases firms took risks experimenting with outsourcing while lacking a firm understanding of the relationship among internal tasks and its spatial implications.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Despite saving money, companies have often faced unexpected drawbacks from outsourcing, such as miscommunication or lower quality of intermediate products, which end up delaying the overall production process. Another reason for a decrease in outsourcing is that many jobs that were subcontracted abroad have been replaced by technological advances.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

According to a Deloitte Consulting survey carried out in 2005, a quarter of the companies which had outsourced tasks reversed their strategy. Many big companies like Lenovo considered turning around outsourcing strategies of outsourcing.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring|title=Here, There and Everywhere|publisher=''[[The Economist]] [London] n.d.: n. pag.|date=17 January 2013|accessdate=19 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118202607/http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21569572-after-decades-sending-work-across-world-companies-are-rethinking-their-offshoring|archivedate=18 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion in the US and other Western powers opposing outsourcing was particularly strengthened by the drastic increase in unemployment as a result of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In the first decade from 2000 to 2010, the US experienced a net loss of 687,000 jobs due to outsourcing, primarily in the computers and electronics sector. Public disenchantment with outsourcing has not only stirred political responses, as seen in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 US presidential campaigns]], but it has also made companies more reluctant to outsource or offshore jobs.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

A 2016 Deloitte survey suggested that companies are no longer reluctant to outsource.&lt;ref&gt;"Outsourcing accelerates forward," (2016) Deloitte 2016 Global Outsourcing Survey accessed 18 August 2016 at {{cite web |url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-cons-sdt-gos-exec-summary-2016.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112100552/https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-cons-sdt-gos-exec-summary-2016.pdf |archivedate=2017-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deloitte's survey identified three trends: 
*Companies are broadening their approach to outsourcing as they begin to view it as more than a simple cost-cutting play
*Organizations are "redefining the ways they enter into outsourcing relationships and manage the ensuing risks."  
*Organizations are changing the way they are managing their relationships with outsourcing providers to "maximize the value of those relationships."

'''Partner relationship management (PRM)''' is a system of methodologies, strategies, [[software]], and [[web-based]] capabilities that help a [[vendor]] to manage [[Business partner|partner relationships]]. The general purpose of PRM is to enable vendors to better manage their partners through the introduction of reliable systems, processes and procedures for interacting with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svcawards.com/files/Forrester%20Wave%20PRM%20Q4%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/sales-focused-partner-relationship-management-prm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/partner-relationship-management&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based PRM systems typically include a [[Content Management System]], a partner and customer contact database, and the notion of a partner portal which allows partners to log in and interact with a [[vendor]]'s sales opportunity database and obtain product, pricing, and training information. There are a number of solution providers who offer PRM software companies who rely heavily on a PRM solution to stay relevant in their respective industries.

Vendors who implement a PRM solution are typically motivated by a need to reduce the financial overhead and establish new partnerships to drive channel revenue and scale.  Partners may also be integrators or managed service providers.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.compubase.net/Partners-Resellers-ISVs-MSPs-Integrators-lists-for-business_a272.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] systems, which are tailored toward getting an end customer to purchase from you, a PRM system is focused on getting a partner to sell on your behalf.  As a result, they commonly offer web-based self-service tools, information, and resources to partner resellers. Tools often include:
* [[Market development funds|MDF]] Request Programs
* Training, [[Certification]], and [[Accreditation]] Automation
* [[Qualified prospect|Deal]] Registration Programs
* Indirect [[Sales process|Sales Pipeline]] Reporting
* Joint [[Business Plan]]ning
* [[Bounty (reward)|Reward]] and [[Loyalty Program]]s
* [[Digital library|Content Library]]

==Trends==

Gartner reports that PRM solutions have mainly been adopted by companies in the hardware technology, software technology, telecommunication, and manufacturing industries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRM application market has expanded significantly in the last 10 years, with vendors offering improved end-to-end and point solutions for the management of channel sales partners.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Path Analysis Graphic.png|400px|thumb|A path analysis graph]] --&gt;
'''Path analysis''', is the analysis of a path, which is a portrayal of a chain of consecutive events that a given user or cohort performs during a set period of time while using a website, online game, or eCommerce platform. As a subset of [[behavioral analytics]], path analysis is a way to understand user behavior in order to gain actionable insights into the data. Path analysis provides a visual portrayal of every event a user or cohort performs as part of a path during a set period of time.

While it is possible to track a user’s path through the site, and even show that path as a visual representation, the real question is how to gain these actionable insights. If path analysis simply outputs a "pretty"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thayer|first=Shelby|title=Why Do We Care About Path Analysis?|url=http://www.trendingupward.net/2008/09/ditch-path-analysis/|work=Trending Upward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  graph, while it may look nice, it does not provide anything concrete to act upon.

==Examples==
In order to get the most out of path analysis the first step would be to determine what needs to be analyzed and what are the goals of the analysis. A company might be trying to figure out why their site is running slow, are certain types of users interested in certain pages or products, or if their user interface is set up in a logical way.

Now that the goal has been set there are a few ways of performing the analysis. If a large percentage of a certain cohort, people between the ages of 18-25, logs into an online game, creates a profile and then spends the next 10 minutes wandering around the menu page, then it may be that the user interface is not logical. By seeing this group of users following the path that they did a developer will be able to analyze the data and realize that after creating a profile, the “play game” button does not appear. Thus, path analysis was able to provide actionable data for the company to act on and fix an error.

In eCommerce, path analysis can help customize a shopping experience to each user. By looking at what products other customers in a certain cohort looked at before buying one, a company can suggest “items you may also like” to the next customer and increase the chances of them making a purchase. Also, path analysis can help solve performance issues on a platform. For example, a company looks at a path and realizes that their site freezes up after a certain combinations of events. By analyzing the path and the progression of events that led to the error, the company can pinpoint the error and fix it.

==Evolution==

Historically path analysis fell under the broad category of [[website analytics]], and related only to the analysis of paths through websites. Path analysis in [[website analytics]] is a process of determining a sequence of pages visited in a visitor session prior to some desired event, such as the visitor purchasing an item or requesting a newsletter.  The precise order of pages visited may or may not be important and may or may not be specified.  In practice, this analysis is done in aggregate, ranking the paths (sequences of pages) visited prior to the desired event, by descending frequency of use.  The idea is to determine what features of the website encourage the desired result.  "Fallout analysis," a subset of path analysis, looks at "black holes" on the site, or paths that lead to a dead end most frequently, paths or features that confuse or lose potential customers.

With the advent of big data along with web-based applications, online games, and eCommerce platforms, path analysis has come to include much more than just web path analysis. Understanding how users move through an app, game, or other web platform are all part of modern-day path analysis.

== Understanding visitors ==
In the real world when you visit a shop the shelves and products are not placed in a random order. The shop owner carefully analyzes the visitors and path they walk through the shop, especially when they are selecting or buying products. Next the shop owner will reorder the shelves and products to optimize sales by putting everything in the most logical order for the visitors. In a supermarket this will typically result in the wine shelf next to a variety of cookies, chips, nuts, etc. Simply because people drink wine and eat nuts with it.

In most web sites there is a same logic that can be applied. Visitors who have questions about a product will go to the product information or support section of a web site. From there they make a logical step to the frequently asked questions page if they have a specific question. A web site owner also wants to analyze visitor behavior. For example, if a web site offers products for sale, the owner wants to convert as many visitors to a completed purchase. If there is a sign-up form with multiple pages, web site owners want to guide visitors to the final sign-up page.

Path analysis answers typical questions like: &lt;br /&gt;
''Where do most visitors go after they enter my home page?''&lt;br /&gt;
''Is there a strong visitor relation between product A and product B on my web site?''. &lt;br /&gt;
Questions that can't be answered by page hits and unique visitors statistics.

== Funnels and goals ==

Google Analytics provides a path function with funnels and goals. A predetermined path of web site pages is specified and every visitor walking the path is a goal. This approach is very helpful when analyzing how many visitors reach a certain destination page, called an end point analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis Tools|url=https://www.google.com/analytics/features/analysis-tools.html|publisher=Google Analytics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using maps ==

The paths visitors walk in a web site can lead to an endless number of unique paths. As a result, there is no point in analyzing each path, but to look for the strongest paths. These strongest paths are typically shown in a graphical map or in text like: Page A --&gt; Page B --&gt; Page D --&gt; Exit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">'''Privatier''' ([{{IPA|pʀiˈvaˈtjeː}}], also spelled '''Privatus''', with the feminine forms '''Privata''' or '''Privatière''', meaning "private person") is a French word that was used from the 19th century in [[Germany]] and some other countries as a title by members of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] families of substantial financial means in lieu of another professional title. Much like [[wikt:rentier|rentier]], it denoted someone who did not have to work to make a living, and who lived off their assets of some size, e.g. [[interest]], [[Profit (economics)|profits]] from [[investor|investments]], [[real estate]] and [[current asset]]s. Sometimes, the title was used by affluent businessmen after they had wholly or largely retired from their former activity. For example, in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', the character Alois Permaneder, a former merchant, uses this title after his marriage to Tony Buddenbrook, after receiving a substantial [[dowry]] from her wealthy family, at which point he retires from business.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mann]]: ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', part 6, chapter 8, Frankfurt 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Purchase Order Request Form.jpg|thumb|An example of a purchase order request from a [[travel agent]].]]
A '''purchase order''' ('''PO''') is a [[Trade|commercial]] document and first official offer issued by a [[buyer]] to a [[vendor (supply chain)|seller]], indicating types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services. It is used to control the purchasing of products and services from external suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | pages = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchase orders can be an essential part of [[enterprise resource planning]] system orders.

The issue of a purchase order does not itself form a [[contract]]. If no prior contract exists, then it is the [[Offer and acceptance#Acceptance|acceptance]] of the order by the seller that forms a [[contract]] between the buyer and seller.

== Overview ==
Companies use purchase orders for several reasons. Purchase orders allow buyers to clearly and explicitly communicate their intentions to sellers. They may also help a purchasing agent to manage incoming orders and pending orders. Sellers are also protected by POs in case of a buyer's refusal to pay for goods or services.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.loyno.edu/purchasing/purchase-order-benefits|title=Purchase Order Benefits|publisher=[[Loyola University New Orleans]]|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purchase orders provide benefits in that they streamline the purchasing process to a standard procedure. Commercial lenders or [[financial institution]]s may provide financial assistance on the basis of purchase orders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are various [[trade finance]] facilities that almost every financial institution allows business people to use against purchase orders such as:

# Before shipment credit facility
# Post shipment credit facility
# Trade finance facility
# Foreign bill purchase credit facility
# Bill retirement credit facility
# Order confirmation
# Followup

The purpose of purchase orders is to procure materials for direct consumption or for stock, procure services, cover customer requirements using external resources, or procure a material that is needed in plants from an internal source (Long distance intra-plant stock transfers). They may also place once-only procurement transactions and optimize purchasing by taking full advantage of negotiated conditions or for optimal utilisation of existing transport capacities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Creating a purchase order is typically the first step of the [[Purchase-to-pay|purchase to pay process]] in an [[ERP system]]. Purchase orders may require a [[Stock keeping unit|SKU code]]. Within an ERP system, a purchase order can be created manually, and may require confirmation or changes via editing. Within an ERP system (such as in [[SAP SE|SAP]]), manually creating a purchase order within the system may look something like "Logistics -&gt; Materials Management -&gt; Purchasing -&gt; Purchasing Order -&gt; Create" and providing a Transaction Code. This document type will be chosen from the screen. A vendor code lookup may need to be selected for a purchase order steps, as well as things like organization group and company code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.sap.com/2015/08/14/sap-erp-user-manual-of-purchase-order/|title=SAP ERP User Manual of Purchase Order {{!}} SAP Blogs|website=blogs.sap.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal ==
Although a typical purchase order may not contain contract language (in fact most contain little more than a list of the goods or services the buyer desires to purchase, along with price, payment terms, and shipping instructions), the purchase order is a specially regarded instrument regulated by the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] or other similar law which establishes a purchase order as a contract by its nature. Yet despite the nature of the purchase order as a contract, it is common to accompany the acceptance of a purchase order with a legal document such as the terms &amp; conditions of sale, which establish specific or additional legal conditions of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requisition Order and Purchase Order|url=https://www.digitalpurchaseorder.com/requisition-order-and-purchase-order/|publisher=DPO|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Federal Acquisition Regulation]] states that purchase orders should generally be issued on a fixed-price basis, but provision is also made for unpriced purchase orders to be issued where "it is impractical to obtain pricing in advance of issuance of the purchase order".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/html/Subpart%2013_3.html FAR - Subpart 13.3—Simplified Acquisition Methods], accessed 15 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formats ==

===Electronic purchase orders===
Many purchase orders are no longer paper-based, but rather transmitted electronically over the [[Internet]]. It is common for electronic purchase orders to be used to buy goods or services of any type online.

There are lots of names/terms for Electronic Purchase Orders. It is sometimes known as: E-Procurement, E-Purchasing, E-Purchase Requisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zaharasoftware.com/procurment-purchase-order-software/|title=Procurement Vs Purchasing - Why you need Purchase Order Software|date=28 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms are normally all referring to Electronic Purchase Orders.

===''Non-electronic purchase orders''===
''The record of purchase order in most business firms are still on paper and thus there is a need for proper purchase order format. Many users wish to have professional formatting for purchase orders for several reasons. A company may wish to have a strong understanding of purchase transactions or to know the basic requirements of purchase order. It may also make it part of business documentation, which makes the process easier while keeping record of all transactions and to have good impression on the client or customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aztemplates.org/purchase-order-template.html/|title=MS Word Format for Purchase Order|date=28 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sales''' are activities related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a given time period.

The ''seller'' or the provider of the [[Goods and services|goods or services]] complete a sale in response to an [[takeover|acquisition]], [[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]],&lt;ref&gt;Part III, effects of the contract, Rule 5. ''Sale of Goods Act 1979''. [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[purchase order|requisition]] or a direct interaction with the ''buyer'' at the [[point of sale]]. There is a passing of title (property or ownership) of the [[Commodity|item]], and the settlement of a [[price]], in which agreement is reached on a price for which transfer of ownership of the item will occur. The ''seller'', not the [[Purchasing|purchaser]] generally executes the sale and it may be completed prior to the obligation of [[payment]]. In the case of indirect interaction, a person who sells goods or service on behalf of the owner is known as a '''salesman''' or '''saleswoman''' or '''salesperson''', but this often refers to someone selling goods in a store/shop, in which case other terms are also common, including ''[[salesclerk]]'', ''shop assistant'', and ''retail clerk''.

In common law countries, sales are governed generally by the [[common law]] and [[commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s. In the [[United States]], the laws governing sales of goods are somewhat uniform to the extent that most jurisdictions have [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], albeit with some non-uniform variations.

==Definition==
A person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of value is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer or prospect.  Buying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same "coin" or transaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to consummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied rules and identifiable stages. It is implied that the selling process will proceed fairly and ethically so that the parties end up nearly equally rewarded. The stages of selling, and buying, involve getting acquainted, assessing each party's need for the other's item of value, and determining if the values to be exchanged are equivalent or nearly so, or, in buyer's terms, "worth the price". Sometimes, sellers have to use their own experiences when selling products with appropriate discounts.&lt;ref name=seller&gt;{{cite journal |title=Buyer Success and Failure in Bargaining and Its Consequences |first=C. |last=Putthiwanit |first2=S.-H. |last2=Ho |journal=Australian Journal of Business and Management Research  |volume=1 |issue=5 |year=2011 |pages=83–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a management viewpoint it is thought of as a part of [[marketing]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kotler, ''Principles of Marketing,'' Prentice -Hall, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; although the skills required are different. Sales often form a separate grouping in a corporate structure, employing separate specialist operatives known as ''salespersons'' (singular: ''salesperson''). Selling is considered by many to be a sort of [[persuasion|persuad]]ing "art". Contrary to popular belief, the methodological approach of selling refers to a ''systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, by which a salesman relates his or her offering of a product or service in return enabling the buyer to achieve their goal in an economic way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=Greening |first=Jack |title=Selling Without Confrontation |publisher= The Haworth Press, Inc. |year=1993 |pages=23 |isbn=1-56024-326-0 }} Page image [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1560243260&amp;id=O8y4P3tGcEIC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;ots=FBSfQrSxig&amp;dq=methodical+sales+approach&amp;sig=gYaUSDYLWTuMBe_KFzfFOoEYdEY]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2018 survey of salespeople, selling has become more difficult in recent years due to changes in technology and general access to prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marcwayshak.com/sales-statistics/|title=18 Sales Statistics You Need to Know About Right Now! [INFOGRAPHIC]|work=Sales Speaker Marc Wayshak|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[sales process]] refers to a systematic process of repetitive and measurable milestones, the definition of the selling is somewhat ambiguous due to the close nature of [[advertising]], [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[public relations]], and [[direct marketing]].

Selling is the profession-wide term, much like [[marketing]] defines a profession. Recently, attempts have been made to clearly understand who is in the sales profession, and who is not. There are many articles looking at [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]]s, and even [[public relations]] as ways to create a unique [[Financial transaction|transaction]].

Two common terms used to describe a salesperson are "Farmer" and "Hunter". The reality is that most professional salespeople have a little of both. A hunter is often associated with aggressive personalities who use aggressive sales technique. In terms of sales methodology, a hunter refers to a person whose focus is on bringing in and closing deals. This process is called "sales capturing". An example is a commodity sale such as a long distance salesperson, shoe salesperson and to a degree a car salesperson. Their job is to find and convert buyers. A sales farmer is someone who creates sales demand through activities that directly influence and alter the buying process.

Many believe that the focus of selling is on the human agents involved in the exchange between buyer and seller. Effective selling also requires a [[Systems thinking|systems approach]], at minimum involving roles that sell, enable selling, and develop sales capabilities.  Selling also involves [[salesperson|salespeople]] who possess a specific set of [[selling method|sales skills]] and the knowledge required to facilitate the exchange of value between buyers and sellers that is unique from marketing, advertising, etc.

Within these three tenets, the following definition of professional selling is offered by the [[American Society for Training and Development]] (ASTD):
{{cquote|The holistic business system required to effectively develop, manage, enable, and execute a mutually beneficial, interpersonal exchange of goods or services for equitable value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) | work=Sales Competency Project | url=http://www.astd.org/sdp | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921095003/http://www.astd.org/sdp | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-09-21 | date= | accessdate=2017-03-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Team selling]] is one way to influence sales. Team selling is "a group of people representing the sales department and other functional areas in the firm, such as finance, production, and research and development". (Spiro) Team selling came about in the 1990s through [[total quality management]] (TQM). TQM occurs when companies work to improve their customer satisfaction by constantly improving all of their operations.

=== Relationships with marketing ===
{{Marketing}}
[[Marketing]] and sales differ greatly but generally have the same goal. Selling is the final stage in marketing which puts the plan into effect, which also includes pricing, promotion, place, and product (the 4 P's). A marketing department in an organization has the goals of increasing the desirability and value to the customer and increasing the number and engagement of interactions between potential customers and the organization. Achieving this goal may involve the sales team using promotional techniques such as [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], [[publicity]], and [[public relations]], creating new [[sales channels]], or creating new products ([[new product development]]), among other things. It can also include bringing the potential customer to visit the organization's website(s) for more information, or to contact the organization for more information, or to interact with the organization via social media such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[blog]]s. Social values also play a major role in consumer decision processes. Marketing is the whole of the work on persuasion made for the whole of the target people. Sales are the persuasion and effort that from one person to one person (B2C), one person makes to the corporation (B2B) in the face or in the phone or in the digital environment, to make a living resource enter the company.

The field of [[sales process engineering]] views "sales" as the output of a larger system, not just as the output of one department. The larger system includes many functional areas within an organization. From this perspective, "sales" and "marketing" (among others, such as "[[customer service]]") label for a number of processes whose inputs and outputs supply one another to varying degrees. In this context, improving an "output" (such as sales) involves studying and improving the broader sales process, as in any system, since the component functional areas interact and are interdependent.&lt;ref name="Selden"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Paul H. Selden|date=December 1998|title=Sales Process Engineering: An Emerging Quality Application|journal=Quality Progress| pages = 59–63}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many large corporations structure their marketing departments so they are directly integrated with all lines of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How To Organize Your Marketing Department In The Digital Age|url = http://www.cmo.com/articles/2015/2/12/organizing-for-digital-cwtk.html|website = www.cmo.com|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They create multiple teams with a singular focus and the managers of these teams must coordinate efforts in order to drive profits and business success. For example, an "inbound" focused campaign seeks to drive more customers "through the door", giving the sales department a better chance of selling their product to the consumer. A good marketing program would address any potential downsides as well.

The sales department would aim to improve the interaction between the customer and the sales facility or mechanism (example, website) or salesperson. As Sales is the forefront of any organization, this would always need to take place before any other business process may begin. Sales management would break down the selling process and then increase the effectiveness of the discrete processes as well as the interaction between processes. For example, in many out-bound sales environments, the typical process includes outbound calling, the sales pitch, handling objections, opportunity identification, and the close. Each step of the process has sales-related issues, skills, and training needs, as well as marketing solutions to improve each discrete step, as well as the whole process. In many cases becoming a salesperson is a default career as not many people aspire to be a salesman but rather fall into the job due to circumstances. It can be highly rewarding as you receive remuneration in the form of a salary and also commission.

One further common complication of marketing involves the inability to measure results for a lot of marketing initiatives. In essence, many marketing and advertising executives often lose sight of the objective of sales/revenue/profit, as they focus on establishing a creative/innovative program, without concern for the [[top line|top]] or [[bottom line]]s – a fundamental pitfall of marketing for marketing's sake.

Many companies find it challenging to get marketing and sales on the same page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ending The War Between Sales And Marketing|url=http://hbr.org/web/special-collections/insight/marketing-that-works/end-the-war-between-sales-and-marketing|website=hbr.org|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=16 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125522/http://hbr.org/web/special-collections/insight/marketing-that-works/end-the-war-between-sales-and-marketing|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two departments, although different in nature, handle very similar concepts and have to work together for sales to be successful. Building a good relationship between the two that encourages communication can be the key to success – even in a [[down economy]].

===Industrial marketing===
The idea that marketing can potentially eliminate the need for salespeople depends entirely on context.  For example, this may be possible in some [[business-to-consumer|B2C]] situations; however, for many [[business-to-business|B2B]] transactions (for example, those involving industrial organizations) this is mostly impossible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Another dimension is the value of the goods being sold. [[Fast moving consumer goods|Fast-moving consumer-goods]] (FMCG) require no sales people at the [[point of sale]] to get them to jump off the supermarket shelf and into the customer's trolley. However, the purchase of large mining equipment worth millions of dollars will require a salesperson to manage the sales process – particularly in the face of competitors. [[Small and medium businesses]] selling such large ticket items to a geographically-disperse client base use [[manufacturers' representative]]s to provide this highly personal service while avoiding the large expense of a captive sales force.

===Sales and marketing alignment and integration===
Another area of discussion involves the need for alignment and integration of corporate sales and marketing functions. According to a report from the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council, only 40 percent of companies have formal programs, systems or processes in place to align and integrate the two critical functions.

Traditionally, these two functions, as referenced above, have operated separately, left in siloed areas of tactical responsibility. Glen Petersen's book ''The [[Profit maximization|Profit Maximization]] Paradox''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; sees the changes in the competitive landscape between the 1950s and the time of writing as so dramatic that the complexity of choice, price, and opportunities for the customer forced this seemingly simple and integrated relationship between sales and marketing to change forever. Petersen goes on to highlight that salespeople spend approximately 40 percent of their time preparing customer-facing deliverables while leveraging less than 50 percent of the materials created by marketing, adding to perceptions that marketing is out of touch with the customer and that sales is resistant to [[messaging]] and [[Marketing strategy|strategy]].

== Types ==
There are two types of sales: [[direct selling]] and [[indirect selling]].

* [[Business-to-business]] – Business-to-business ("B2B") sales are likely to be larger in terms of volume, economic value and complexity than business-to-consumer ("B2C") sales. Often the complexity involves one business working closely with the other to define problems, to finding solutions, to supporting after-sale operation. Because of this complexity, there is a need to manage the relationships between the buying and selling organisations, for example using Peter Cheverton's relationship models&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Key Account Management 4th Edition|last = Peter|first = Cheverton|publisher = Kogan Page|year = 2008|isbn = 978 0 7494 5277 3|location = |pages = 90–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stakeholder map by Anderson, Bryson and Crosby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://cep.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/10-02-03-BRY.pdf|title = What To Do When Stakeholders Matter: A Guide to Stakeholder Identification and Analysis Techniques|last = John|first = Bryson|date = 10 Feb 2003|journal = London School of Economics and Political Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sales agents ===
Agents in the sales process can represent either of two parties in the sales process; for example:

# Sales broker, seller agency, seller agent, [[Manufacturers' representative|seller representative]]: This is a traditional role where the salesman represents a person or company on the selling end of a deal.
# Buyers broker or Buyer brokerage: This is where the salesman represents the consumer making the purchase. This is most often applied in large transactions.
# Disclosed dual agent: This is where the salesman represents both parties in the sale and acts as a [[Mediation|mediator]] for the transaction. The role of the salesman here is to oversee that both parties receive an honest and fair deal, and is responsible to both.
# Transaction broker: This is where the salesperson represents neither party but handles the transaction only. The seller owes no responsibility to either party getting a fair or honest deal, just that all of the papers are handled properly.
# Sales outsourcing involves direct branded representation where the sales representatives are recruited, hired, and managed by an external entity but hold quotas, represent themselves as the brand of the client, and report all activities (through their own [[sales management]] channels) back to the client. It is akin to a virtual extension of a sales force (see [[sales outsourcing]]).
# Sales managers aim to implement various sales strategies and management techniques in order to facilitate improved [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] and increased sales volume. They are also responsible for coordinating the sales and marketing department as well as oversight concerning the [[Justice|fair]] and [[honesty|honest]] execution of the sales process by their agents.
# Salesperson: The primary function of professional salespeople is to generate and close business resulting in revenue. The salesperson will accomplish their primary function through a variety of means including phone calls, email, social media, networking, and [[cold calling]].  The primary objective of the successful salesperson is to find the consumers to sell to.  Sales are often referred to as a "numbers game" because a general law of averages and pattern of successful closing of business will emerge through heightened sales activity. These activities include but are not limited to: locating prospects, fostering relationships with prospects, building trust with future clients, identifying and filling needs of consumers, and therefore turning prospective customers into actual ones. Many tools are used by successful salespeople, the most important of which is questioning which can be defined as a series of questions and resulting answers allowing the salesperson to understand a customer's goals and requirements relevant to the product.  The creation of value or [[perceived value]] is the result of taking the information gathered, analyzing the goals and needs of the prospective customer and leveraging the products or services the salesperson's firm represents or sells in a way that most effectively achieves the prospective client's goals or suits their needs.  Effective salespeople will package their offering and present their proposed solution in a way that leads the prospective customer to the conclusion that they acquire the solution, resulting in revenue and profit for the salesperson and the organization they represent.
# Internet Sales Professionals: These people are primarily responsible for ensuring immediate response to the leads generated via social media, website or email campaigns.

==={{anchord|Inside sales}} vs. {{anchord|outside sales}}===
In the United States, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] defines outside sales representatives as "employees [who] sell their employer's products, services, or facilities to customers away from their employer's place(s) of business, in general, either at the customer's place of business or by selling door-to-door at the customer's home" while defining those who work "from the employer's location" as inside sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/overtime/s1.htm |title=elaws - FLSA Overtime Security Advisor |publisher=[[United States Department of Labor]] |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25 |archivedate=2011-05-25 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ywTnhanX?url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/overtime/s1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside sales generally involves attempting to [[closing (sales)|close business]] primarily over the phone via [[telemarketing]], while outside sales (or "field" sales) will usually involve initial phone work to book sales calls at the potential buyer's location to attempt to close the deal in person. Some companies have an inside sales department that works with outside representatives and book their appointments for them. Inside sales sometimes refers to [[upselling]] to existing customers.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The '''software industry''' includes businesses  for [[software development|development]], [[software maintenance|maintenance]] and [[software publisher|publication]] of [[software]] that are using different business models, mainly either "license/maintenance based" (on-premises) or "[[Cloud computing|Cloud]] based" (such as [[SaaS]], [[PaaS]], [[IaaS]], MaaS, AaaS, etc.). The industry also includes [[software service]]s, such as [[training]], [[software documentation|documentation]], [[consultancy|consulting]] and [[data recovery]].

==History==
The word "software" was coined as a prank as early as 1953, but did not appear in print until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Paul Niquette |title= Softword: Provenance for the Word 'Software'  |year= 1995 |url= http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/tocsoft.html }} adapted from ''Sophisticated: The Magazine'' {{ISBN|1-58922-233-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this time, computers were programmed either by customers, or the few commercial computer vendors of the time, such as [[UNIVAC]] and [[IBM]]. The first company founded to provide software products and services was [[Computer Usage Company]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recollections of the first software company |author= Elmer C. Kubie |journal= [[Annals of the History of Computing]] |volume= 16 |issue= 2 |publisher= [[IEEE Computer Society]]  |date= Summer 1994 |pages= 65–71 |doi= 10.1109/85.279238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass-produced quantities. Universities, government, and business customers created a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers. Some were distributed freely between users of a particular machine for no charge. Others were done on a commercial basis, and other firms such as [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (founded in 1959) started to grow. Other influential or typical software companies begun in the early 1960s included [[Advanced Computer Techniques]], [[Automatic Data Processing]], [[Applied Data Research]], and [[Informatics General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry | first=Martin | last=Campbell-Kelly | authorlink=Martin Campbell-Kelly | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Computer Establishment | first=Katharine Davis | last=Fishman | publisher= McGraw-Hill Book Company | location=New York | year=1981 | type=paperback 1982 | page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer/[[Computer hardware|hardware]] makers started bundling [[operating systems]], [[systems software]] and programming environments with their machines.

When [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) brought a relatively low-priced [[microcomputer]] to market, it brought computing within the reach of many more companies and universities worldwide, and it spawned great innovation in terms of new, powerful programming languages and methodologies. New software was built for microcomputers, so other manufacturers including IBM, followed DEC's example quickly, resulting in the [[IBM AS/400]] amongst others.

The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the [[personal computer]] ("PC") in the mid-1970s, which brought desktop computing to the office worker for the first time. In the following years, it also created a growing market for games, applications, and utilities. [[DOS]], [[Microsoft]]'s first [[operating system]] product, was the dominant operating system at the time.

In the early years of the 21st century, another successful [[business model]] has arisen for hosted software, called [[software-as-a-service]], or SaaS; this was at least the third time{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} this model had been attempted. From the point of view of producers of some [[proprietary software]], SaaS reduces the concerns about [[Software copyright|unauthorized copying]], since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition no [[client software]] is loaded onto the end user's PC.

==Size of the industry==
According to industry analyst [[Gartner]], the size of the worldwide software industry in 2013 was US$407.3 billion, an increase of 4.8% over 2012. As in past years, the largest four software vendors were [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[IBM]], and [[SAP SE|SAP]] respectively.

|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2696317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mergers and acquisitions==
The software industry has been subject to a high degree of consolidation over the past couple of decades. Between 1995 and 2018 around 37,039 [[mergers and acquisitions]] have been announced with a total known value of US$ 1,166 bil. USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest number and value of deals was set in 2000 during the high times of the [[dot-com bubble]] with 2,674 transactions valued at 105. bil. USD. In 2017, 2,547 deals were announced valued at $111 billion. Approaches to successfully acquire and integrate software companies are available. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Popp |first=Karl Michael |title=Mergers and Acquisitions in the Software Industry - foundations of due diligence |year=2013 |publisher=Books on demand |location=Norderstedt |isbn=978-3-7322-4381-5 |url=http://mergerduediligence.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainopreneurship''' (entrepreneurship and innovation for sustainability) is a concept that has emerged from the earlier concepts [[social entrepreneurship]] and [[ecopreneurship]], via sustainability entrepreneurship. The concept means to use creative business organizing to solve problems related to sustainability to create social and environmental sustainability as a [[strategic objective]] and purpose, at the same time respecting the boundaries set in order to maintain the life support systems in the process. In other words, it is a "business with a cause" – where the [[global issues|world problems]] are turned into [[business opportunities]] by deployment of sustainability innovations. 

==Definition==

The definition first introduced in a conference article in 2006:&lt;ref name="ftn0"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2006) Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause. in Science Sustainable Development – Starting Points and Critical Reflections, Uppsala: VHU – Föreningen Vetenskap för Hållbar Utveckling (Swedish Society for Sustainable Development), pp. 21-30. {{ISBN|91-631-9222-5}}. [http://www.vhu.se/site/The-Swedish-Research-Association-for-Sustainable-Development.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Deployment of sustainability innovations: Entrepreneurship and innovation for sustainability. 
# Short for sustainability intra-/entrepreneurship. 
# To focus on one or more (world/social/sustainability-related) problem(s), find/identify and/or invent a solution to the problem(s) and bring the innovation to the market by creating an efficient organization. With the (new alt. deep transformation of an old) mission/cause-oriented sustainability business adding ecological/economical/social values and gains, with a bias towards the intangible – through dematerialization/resocialization. The value added at the same time preserving, restoring and/or ultimately enhancing the underlying utilized capital stock, in order to maintain the capacity to fulfil the needs of present and coming generations of stakeholders.

==Conceptual development==

The business world has been nominated as a premier force for creating a sustainable world,&lt;ref name="ftn1"&gt;Hart, S. L. (2005) Capitalism at the Crossroads: the Unlimited Business Opportunities in Solving the World's Most Difficult Problems. Philadelphia: Wharton School Publishing., p 3-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn2"&gt;Prahalad, C. K. (2004) The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid – Eradicating Poverty Through Profits, Philadelphia: Wharton School Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; especially when acting as a source of innovation and creativity – e. g. as Robinson (2004:378)&lt;ref name="ftn3"&gt;Robinson, J. (2004)'' ''Squaring the Circle? Some thoughts on the idea of Sustainable Development, ''Ecological Economics,'' 48:4, pp. 369-384.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it:

:''"In addition to integrating across fields, sustainability must also be integrated across sectors or interests. It is clear that governments alone have neither the will nor the capability to accomplish sustainability on their own. The private sector, as the chief engine of economic activity on the planet, and '''a major source for creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship,''' must be involved in trying to achieve sustainability."'' 

Sustainopreneurship is a candidate to be the accentuating factor to give even more leverage to forces emerging from world of business activities to contribute to sustainability. The concept of sustainopreneurship was first introduced as a term in 2000&lt;ref name="ftn4"&gt;Schaltegger, S. (2000) Vom Bionier zum Sustainopreneur, Presentation at Rio Impuls Management Forum 2000, Home Page of conference {{cite web |url=http://www.rio.ch/Pages/archiv/2000rmf.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001904/http://www.rio.ch/Pages/archiv/2000rmf.html |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}, presentation accessible at {{cite web |url=http://www.rio.ch/Pages/rmf2000/referate/Schaltegger.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707002241/http://www.rio.ch/Pages/rmf2000/referate/Schaltegger.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}, (accessed 2007-04-16).&lt;/ref&gt; where it was predominantly related to the proactive change management approaches associated with process adjustment with increased respect to the environment. The phenomenon developed with publications in 2003,&lt;ref name="ftn5"&gt;Hockerts, K. (2003) Sustainability Innovation: Ecological and Social Entrepreneurship and the Managing of Antagonistic Assets'', ''PhD Dissertation, University of St. Gallen, Schweiz.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn6"&gt;Gerlach, A. (2003a) Sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation, Centre for Sustainability Management, University of Lueneburg, Conference Proceedings of Conference Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management 2003 in Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn7"&gt;Gerlach, A. (2003b) Innovativität und Sustainability Intrapreneurship,'' ''Paper presented at Sustainable Management in Action '03, University of St. Gallen, Schweiz.&lt;/ref&gt; and further evolved and was tentatively defined in 2006 by Anders Abrahamsson.&lt;ref name="ftn8"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2006), Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; This tentative definition was empirically tested in his Master thesis,&lt;ref name="ftn11"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007a) Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause: Conceptualizing Entrepreneurship for Sustainability. [Master Thesis in Business Administration.] Växjö: Reports from Växjö University: Business administration and economics. http://www.diva-portal.org/vxu/abstract.xsql?dbid=1254, (accessed 2007-05-25).&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where the enactive research process&lt;ref name="ftn9"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2002) Enacting Entrepreneurship – Using Auto-Ethnography to Study Organization Creation, Paper presented the conference ''Ethnographic Organizational Studies'', University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, September 19-21, 2002. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005) Entreprenörskapets väsen, Lund: Studentlitteratur.&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that the definition stood the test contrasting it towards the auto-ethnographical empirical material. A paper to identify future research challenges was made beyond this in 2007,&lt;ref name="ftn12"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007b), Researching Sustainopreneurship – conditions, concepts, approaches, arenas and questions. An invitation to authentic sustainability business forces. Paper presented at the 13th International Sustainable Development Research Conference, Mälardalens Högskola, Västerås, 10-12 June, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and developed further with a book chapter published in September 2008.&lt;ref name="ftn13"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2008), Sustainopreneurship – Business with a Cause. The Promise of Creative Organizing for Sustainability. In "Bridging the Functional and Territorial Views on Regional Entrepreneurship and Development", eds. Bengt Johannisson and Åsa Lindholm-Dahlstrand. Örebro: FSF (Swedish Foundation for Small Business Research). {{ISBN|91-89301-27-7}}. [http://www.fsf.se/publikation/lista/2008_6.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the entrepreneurial discourse has opened up to move beyond a strictly economic phenomenon, rather than being perceived primarily as a social process at large.&lt;ref name="ftn17"&gt;Steyaert, C., Katz, J. (2004) Reclaiming the space of entrepreneurship in society: geographical, discursive and social dimensions, Entrepreneurship and Business Development 2004:3, pp. 179-196, special issue on Social Entrepreneurship.&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding the conceptual formation were two traces of social entrepreneurship and eco-preneurship, dealing primarily with the social and ecological dimensions of sustainability. Primary associations with [[social entrepreneurship]] have also been establishing not-for-profit venturing and charities to innovatively address and solve social problems, whereas [[ecopreneurship]] has been primarily focused on solving environmental problems.&lt;ref name="ftn7"/&gt; See [[Principles of ecopreneurship]].

Both these traces of conceptual development are taken beyond, merge and integrate into the suggested conceptual construct at hand, where distinctions are made from both of these concepts – sustainopreneurial processes taking place institutionally through for-profit organizing, but not with profit as its main driving force. Sustainopreneurial venturing is done in a holistic manner that meets both ecological and social challenges simultaneously with regard to both purpose and process. 

=== Three main dimensions ===

The definition of sustainopreneurship needs to be highlighted by three distinguishing dimensions with all three being simultaneously present in the applied (inter)action it reflects. The first is oriented towards "why" – its purpose and motive. The second and third are reflecting two "how"-related dimensions – its process. 

'''1. Sustainopreneurship consciously sets out to find and/or create innovations to solve sustainability-related problems'''

:The conscious mission that guides the action, especially in the nascent '-preneurial' stage before venturing forms and formalizes into an institutionalized business entity, is to deliberately find practical and innovative solutions to problems related to the sustainability agenda. This is the main key to distinguish this category of entrepreneurial activity and behaviour labelled sustainopreneurship from generic entrepreneurial activity: the cause-oriented intention that places the core motive, purpose and driving-force of the business activities. To identify and further grasp what is meant by sustainability problems, central sources in the global sustainable development discourse are identified, which guide us to what is meant practically and operationally by ''sustainability in action.'' The outcome of diverse sources are summarized in this list of ''"sustainability-related problems",'' determined by the political action plan documented in ''Agenda 21'',&lt;ref name="ftn14"&gt;''UN, Conference on Environment and Development (1992a) Main Documents, download page, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/docs_unced.htm; including Agenda 21, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/agenda21/index.htm, (accessed 2007-04-16).''&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Millennium Declaration'' defining the ''[[Millennium Development Goals]],&lt;ref name="ftn15"&gt;''UN, Millennium Development Goals (2000) Homepage, http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals, (accessed 2007-04-16).''&lt;/ref&gt; both agreed at the ''Millennium Summit'' in New York 2000, and the ''WSSD Plan of Implementation'' decided upon at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg 2002.&lt;ref name="ftn16"&gt;UN, World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002b) Homepage, http://www.johannesburgsummit.org, with WSSD Plan of Implementation, TOC with access to the full document, http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/WSSD_POI_PD/English/POIToc.htm, (accessed 2007-04-16).&lt;/ref&gt; This list, derived and synthesized from these sources, lines up areas with associated problems to solve, goals to reach and values to create:

* [[Poverty]]
* [[Water and sanitation]]
* [[Public health|Health]]
* Education/[[illiteracy]]
* [[Sustainable production]] and consumption patterns
*  [[climate and energy|Climate change and energy systems]]
* Chemicals
* [[Urbanization]]
* Ecosystems, [[biological diversity]] and [[land use]]
* Utilization of sea resources
* Food and agriculture
* [[Trade justice]]
* [[Social stability]], democracy and good governance
* [[Peace]] and security


'''2. Sustainopreneurship means to get solutions to the market through creative organizing''' 

:The line-up above could make one easily depressed. But, a fundamental attitude to acquire and maintain when this list of sustainability-related problems is compiled and then considered is to avoid falling into disempowerment and despair. It is of core importance to take the agenda as entrepreneurial ''challenges'' – to view problems as ''possibilities'', obstacles as ''opportunities'', and resistance as a ''resource'', whatever the nature of the resistance. If the solution is generated by creativity, it is equally important to take it to the market in a creative and innovative way. In this dimension there is nothing that really differs from the generic entrepreneurial description I subscribe to, but this comes natural since sustainopreneurship is a conceptual extension and development from the social phenomenon named entrepreneurship, and thus inherits one of its perceived key dimensions, 'entrepreneurship as creative organizing'.&lt;ref name="ftn19"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005), Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The market is used as well, not society primarily, since it implies business establishment – a sustainability business that still knows its place and role in the holarchy mentioned earlier. Bringing something to the market at the same time brings it to society and our shared physical environment.

'''3. Sustainopreneurship in process adds sustainability value with respect for life support systems '''

:The awareness that the (economic) market is an embedded sub-system in the "socio-sphere" that is in turn a part of the 'bio-sphere' is made explicit. This awareness naturally and self-evidently makes the sustainopreneurial team maximize harmony with life support systems in the process. With joy and pride the epitome of the generic definition of "sustainable development" lives in business venturing. In short – living the generic definition of sustainable development as defined by WCED,&lt;ref name="ftn18"&gt;UN, World Commission on Environment and Development (1987) Our Common Future, Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to the needs of present and future stakeholders, keeping the holistic world-view and making it guide everyday (inter)action. 

===Sustainable vs. sustainability entrepreneurship===
With these dimensions clarified and distinctions made a common conceptual vagueness or lack of clarity needs to be addressed, where a strong need to distinguish clearly between sustainable, vs. ''sustainability'' entrepreneurship is identified. From this point of view, a very important distinction with the concept formed is claimed – ''sustainability'' entrepreneurship as in the concept ''sustainopreneurship; ''the use of entrepreneurial activity in a ''determined action orientation towards solving a sustainability-related problem'' with (creative) business organizing as a ''means'' to solve the problem(s) – '''business with a cause''': to turn business activity from a part of the problem to a part of the solution.'' Sustainable'' entrepreneurship is just a generic entrepreneurial process that takes into consideration the boundaries set by sustainability, and does not address where to and why, the destination, the purpose or the aim of the venture. The strategic intent and the business idea in itself are not related to sustainability ''per se,'' sustainability just being an "attachment" to the entrepreneurial process. The second and third dimensions are represented, but not the first. ''Sustainability'' entrepreneurship, in contrast, takes as its root of existence and strategic aim to solve a sustainability-related problem. This means that all three dimensions are simultaneously present: to take a sustainability innovation to the market through creative organizing with respect for life-supporting systems in the process.

== Future development ==

Given its recent date, there is a need for future research, as mentioned above.&lt;ref name="ftn12"&gt;Abrahamsson, A. (2007b), Researching Sustainopreneurship – conditions, concepts, approaches, arenas and questions. An invitation to authentic sustainability business forces. Paper presented at the 13th International Sustainable Development Research Conference, Mälardalens Högskola, Västerås, 10-12 June, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn13"/&gt; Main findings here are that conceptually, a deeper analysis is needed to be conducted with a nuanced and detailed taxonomy and framework created of sustainability innovations, the core of sustainopreneurship, primarily by cataloging and categorizing case stories. It is also needed to make a more detailed description to relate sustainopreneurship to other concepts in the wider, general idea-sphere of the "business case of sustainability", in the contemporary plethora of "buzz-words", approaches, methods and acronyms that already exists – and in this context also to motivate why this concept adds value. 

It has been recommended, though, to keep the research applied, to identify obstacles and institutional barriers, and how to overcome them; i. e. facilitating factors for sustainopreneurship, researching prospective tools, enablers and approaches. Appropriate areas and domains for sustainopreneurship applied are recommended to be digested. Research methods recommended are [[Enactive Research]]&lt;ref name="ftn9"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2002) Enacting Entrepreneurship – Using Auto-Ethnography to Study Organization Creation, Paper presented the conference ''Ethnographic Organizational Studies'', University of St. Gallen, Switzerland, September 19-21, 2002. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftn10"&gt;Johannisson, B. (2005) Entreprenörskapets väsen, Lund: Studentlitteratur.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Open Space Technology]], since they add instant value among stakeholders, and in themselves naturally builds arenas where sustainopreneurship evolves and proliferates. For progress, beyond these "how"-related pointers, the key is to single out "the big questions", getting answers through collaborative, collective dialogue and conversation, with an explicit interaction and results orientation. Issues and topics have been formulated and outlined, where it is of striking importance with an intention to attract authentic forces potentially hearing this call of exploring the phenomenon further, with the purpose to collapse the degrees of separation in between the stakeholders of the sustainopreneurial concept – in idea, reflective practice and applied interaction to generate collective and collaborative wisdom for a deeper understanding of the concept. An association with this purpose is in its interim stages, ÆREAS(i).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4267">'''TREX''' is a search engine in the [[NetWeaver|SAP NetWeaver]] integrated technology platform produced by [[SAP SE]] using [[columnar storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/abadi-column-stores.pdf|doi=10.1561/1900000024|title=The Design and Implementation of Modern Column-Oriented Database Systems|author1=Daniel Abadi|author2=Peter Boncz|author3=Stavros Harizopoulos|author4=Stratos Idreos|author5=Samuel Madden|journal=Foundations and Trends in Databases|volume=5|issue=3|year=2012|pages=197–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TREX engine is a standalone component that can be used in a range of system environments but is used primarily as an integral part of SAP products such as Enterprise Portal, Knowledge Warehouse, and '''Business Intelligence (BI, formerly [[SAP Business Information Warehouse]]).''' In SAP NetWeaver BI, the TREX engine powers the BI Accelerator, which is a plug-in appliance for enhancing the performance of [[online analytical processing]]. The name "TREX" stands for '''Text Retrieval and information EXtraction''', but it is not a registered trademark of SAP and is not used in marketing collateral.

==Search functions==

TREX supports various kinds of text search, including exact search, boolean search, wildcard search, linguistic search (grammatical variants are normalized for the index search) and fuzzy search (input strings that differ by a few letters from an index term are normalized for the index search). Result sets are ranked using term frequency-inverse document frequency ([[tf-idf]]) weighting, and results can include snippets with the search terms highlighted.

TREX supports text mining and classification using a [[vector space model]]. Groups of documents can be classified using query based classification, example based classification, or a combination of these plus keyword management.

TREX supports structured data search not only for document metadata but also for mass business data and data in SAP [[Business Objects]]. Indexes for structured data are implemented compactly using [[data compression]] and the data can be aggregated in linear time, to enable large volumes of data to be processed entirely in memory.

Recent developments include:
* A join engine to join structured data from different fields in business objects
* A fast update capability to write a delta index beside a main index and to merge them offline while a second delta index takes updates
* A [[data mining]] feature pack for advanced mathematical analysis

==History==

The first code for the engine was written in 1998 and TREX became an SAP component in 2000. The SAP NetWeaver BI Accelerator was first rolled out in 2005. As of Q1 2013, the current release of TREX is SAP NW 7.1.

== Security ==
A security vulnerability in TREX was first identified and fixed in 2015 (see SAP Security Note [https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2234226 2234226])[https://www.scmagazineuk.com/bugs-in-sap-hana-allowed-remote-code-execution/article/530856/]. The vulnerability occurred due to lack of authentication in TREXnet, an internal communication protocol. The aforementioned patch fixed the problem by removing some critical functionality.

Later on, ERPScan head of threat intelligence Mathieu Geli continued to look into the vulnerability and found that the vulnerability was still exploitable [https://erpscan.com/press-center/press-release/critical-vulnerability-affects-sap-hana-dozen-sap-applications/]. Moreover, in case of successful attack, the vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to get full control over the server without authorization [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/13/sap_trex_patch/]. The vulnerability has been finally patched via SAP Security Note 2419592.

'''Telligent, A Verint Company''' is an enterprise collaboration and community software business founded in 2004 by [[Robert_M_Howard|Rob Howard]]. The company changed its name to Zimbra, Inc in September 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/press_releases/archive/2013/09/25/zimbra-unveils-integrated-team-culture-and-vision-for-people-centered-collaboration-at-user-group-conference.aspx |last=Henry |first=Tiffany |title=Zimbra Unveils Integrated Team, Culture and Vision for People-Centered Collaboration at User Group Conference |publisher=Telligent |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; after completing the acquisition of [[Zimbra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realstorygroup.com/Blog/2577-Telligent-acquires-Zimbra-Does-social-software-want-to-be-email-when-it-grows-up |last=Kompella |first=Kashyap |title=Telligent acquires Zimbra - Does social software want to be email when it grows up? |publisher=Real Story Group |date=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[VMWare]]. In August 2015 Zimbra's Telligent business was acquired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.verint.com/customer-engagement/verint-acquires-telligent-and-extends-portfolio-into-communities |last=Stockford |first=Paul |title=Verint Acquires Telligent and Extends Portfolio into Communities |publisher=Saddletree Research |date=2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Verint Systems]], Inc. Verint continues to operate Telligent as an independent business unit. Also in August 2015 the remaining assets of Zimbra, Inc were acquired by Synacor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/social-business/zimbra-acquired-again-this-time-by-synacor/ |publisher=CMS Wire |last=Nicastro |first=Dom |title=Zimbra Acquired Again, This Time by Synacor |date=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Company history==
Telligent was founded by [[Robert_M_Howard|Rob Howard]] in 2004. Howard was previously a founding member of Microsoft's [[ASP.NET]] team and helped build and run the Microsoft ASP.NET community. 

Telligent introduced its first product, [[Telligent Community|Community Server]], in the fall of 2004. Community Server was an integrated community platform that brought together blogs, wikis, forums, user profiles, etc. Community Server was based on the work done by Rob Howard on the ASP.NET Forums, Jason Alexander on nGallery, and Scott Watermasysk on .Text.

Dell and MySpace both became Telligent customers in 2006. Dell started a blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/Direct2Dell/b/direct2dell/archive/2006/07/11/real-people-are-here-and-we-re-listening.aspx|title=Real People are Here and We're Listening|publisher=Lionel Menchaca|accessdate=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Telligent's platform in response to [[Jeff Jarvis]]' post about his dissatisfaction with a Dell laptop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/10/18/dell-hell-the-end/|title=Dell Hell:The end?|publisher=BuzzMachine|accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2007 Telligent introduced a [[social analytics]] tool called [[Telligent Analytics|Harvest Reporting Server]].

In 2008, [[Intel Capital]] became Telligent's first capital partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/capital/news/releases/080922.htm|title=Intel Capital to Acquire $20 Million Stake in Telligent |publisher=Intel|accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Patrick Brandt took over as CEO and Rob Howard became CTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/press_releases/archive/2009/05/19/patrick-brandt-joins-telligent-as-chief-executive-officer.aspx|title=Patrick Brandt Joins Telligent as Chief Executive Officer|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Brandt was previously CEO of Skywire Software, which was acquired by Oracle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2008_jun/skywire.html|title=Oracle Buys Skywire Software |publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for an undisclosed amount. Telligent also re-branded its product offering as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterprise-20/telligent-updates-and-rebrands-community-solutions-new-analytics-solution-004889.php|title=Telligent Updates and ReBrands Community Solutions, New Analytics Solution|publisher=CMS Wire|accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community Server became [[Telligent Community]], Harvest Reporting Server became [[Telligent Analytics]], and Community Server Evolution became Telligent Enterprise. Telligent also formally introduced the Telligent Evolution platform upon which Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise were based.

As part of the company re-positioning, Telligent discontinued development and support for Graffiti CMS and made it available as an open source project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/teamblog/archive/2009/12/11/graffiti-cms-is-now-open-source.aspx|title=Graffiti CMS is now open source|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telligent also discontinued BlogMailr, a free email-to-blog service.

In 2010 David Mitchell joined Telligent's board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/teamblog/archive/2010/07/07/telligent-welcomes-new-board-member.aspx|title=Telligent Welcomes New Board Member|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; David is currently CEO of [http://www.global360.com/ Global 360] and was previously CEO of WebMethods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/WebMethods-names-new-CEO,-chairman/2100-1012_3-5395279.html|title=WebMethods names new CEO, chairman|publisher=CNet News|accessdate=2004-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telligent additionally added Wendy Gibson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telligent.com/company/news/b/teamblog/archive/2010/10/07/announcing-chief-marketing-officer-wendy-gibson.aspx|title=Welcome Wendy Gibson as Telligent's CMO|publisher=Telligent|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Chief Marketing Officer.

On December 19, 2011, Telligent acquired Leverage Software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texastechpulse.com/telligent_buys_enterprise_social_networking_firm/s-0040067.html Telligent Buys Enterprise Social Networking Firm]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2013, Telligent acquired [[Zimbra]] from [[Vmware]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/vmware-divests-zimbra-nyse-vmw-1810955.htm Vmware Divests Zimbra]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2015, Telligent was acquired by [[Verint Systems]], Inc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.verint.com/news-events/press-releases-2015/verint-extends-customer-engagement-optimization-vision-adding-innovative-community-software |title=Verint Extends Customer Engagement Optimization Vision, Adding Innovative Community Software |publisher=Verint |date=2015-08-17}}{{cite web|url=http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-News/CRM-Across-the-Wire/Verint-Acquires-Telligent-105795.aspx |title=Verint Acquires Telligent |publisher=DestinationCRM.com |date=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Products==
Telligent's products are built on the [[Microsoft .NET]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server]] platform. They are primarily used as on-premises, white label software solutions.

===Telligent Community ===
[[Telligent Community]] (formerly Community Server), built on the Telligent Evolution platform, is Telligent's flagship product. It was first introduced in 2004 and the most recent version is 5.6 as of October 2010.

Telligent Community is designed to support external facing communities and the primary use cases are: digital marketing, support communities, and networking.

===Telligent Enterprise ===
Telligent Enterprise, built on the Telligent Evolution platform, was first introduced in 2008 in response to users of Telligent Community asking Telligent to provide an employee-focused solution. Telligent Enterprise version 2.6 was released October 2010.

Telligent Enterprise is designed to support enterprise 2.0 / internal communities, private business-to-business communities, and private networking communities. An emphasis on integration with enterprise email systems, such as Microsoft Exchange Server, and enterprise identity management systems, such as Microsoft Active Directory, are examples of how Telligent Enterprise differs from Telligent Community.

=== Telligent Analytics ===
Telligent introduced Telligent Analytics in 2007 as Harvest Reporting Server. Telligent Analytics is designed to analyze people and information created within the Telligent Evolution platform. This includes both Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise. It additionally includes any data created on applications that run on the Telligent Evolution platform.

The '''Wells Print Shop''' was located at 27 Cuna Street in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. It operated as part of the [[Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board]]'s 18th century museum village, San Agustín Antiguo, demonstrating the colonial printmaking process.&lt;mapframe latitude="29.8949" longitude="-81.3152" zoom="15" width="250" height="200" align="right"&gt;

== William Wells ==
[[William Charles Wells]] was born in 1757 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the son of a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] printer, publisher, and bookseller. He was formally trained as a doctor, receiving a degree in medicine from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1780. When the British left Charleston in 1782, William and his brother John moved to St. Augustine where they established a print shop. In St. Augustine the Wells brothers are most well known for publishing the ''East Florida Gazette'', the first newspaper in Florida. After the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]] returned Florida to the Spanish, William Wells went to England and practiced medicine for the rest of his life. He died in London in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1986|title=Two Noteworthy Acquisitions for the WHL in 1985-86|url=|journal=Waring Library Society Newsletter|volume=9|pages=3-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''East Florida Gazette'' ==
The Wells brothers' publication began on February 1, 1783 and lasted a little over one year, with the last issue published on March 22, 1784. London's Public Record Office only contains three issues of the newspaper, those from March 1, May 3, and May 17, 1783. The St. Augustine Historical Society resurrected the name "East Florida Gazette" with its newsletter, which is indexed on the Historical Society Research Library's online catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saintaugustinehistoricalsociety.org/research-library/|title=St. Augustine Historical Society - Research Library|website=www.saintaugustinehistoricalsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Wells Print Shop.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Wells Print Shop, 1971]]
The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board reconstructed the Wells Print Shop in 1968 on Cuna Street. The original Wells printing press owned by William and John was located on Treasury Lane. The all-wooden shop was constructed using board-and-[[batten]] building method, which the British settlers in St. Augustine preferred for its quick construction and ease of repair. The building is 220 square feet. 

Inside the print shop was a replica of the type of printing press used towards the end of the 18th century. The press was operated daily to demonstrate the printing process to visitors, but the Preservation Board also used it to make reproductions of historic St. Augustine maps and replicas of the ''East Florida Gazette,'' which were sold as souvenirs. 

Today the site once occupied by the Wells Print Shop operates as a jewelry store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myersjewelryandgifts.com/|title=Myers Jewelry and Gifts|website=www.myersjewelryandgifts.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
