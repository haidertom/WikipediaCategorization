'''3D city models''' are digital models of urban areas that represent terrain surfaces, sites, buildings, vegetation, infrastructure and landscape elements in three-dimensional scale as well as related objects (e.g., city furniture) belonging to urban areas. Their components are described and represented by corresponding two-dimensional and three-dimensional spatial data and geo-referenced data. 3D city models support presentation, exploration, analysis, and management tasks in a large number of different application domains. In particular, 3D city models allow "for visually integrating heterogeneous geoinformation within a single framework and, therefore, create and manage complex urban information spaces." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/fileadmin/hpi/FG_Doellner/publications/2006/DBB06/CORP2006_doellner.pdf  |title=J. Döllner, K. Baumann, H. Buchholz: ''Virtual 3D City Models as Foundation of Complex Urban Information Spaces''. 11th international conference on Urban Planning and Spatial Development in the Information Society (REAL CORP), (Manfred Schrenk, ed.), CORP – Competence Center of Urban and Regional Planning, pp. 107–112, 2006.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwDSj9Yo_38 |title=Example video for 3D city models as complex information spaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage of 3D City Models ==
To store 3D city models, both file-based and database approaches are used. There is no single, unique representation schema due to the heterogeneity and diversity of 3d city model contents.

=== Encoding of Components ===
Components of 3D city models are encoded by common file and exchange formats for 2D raster-based GIS data (e.g., [[GeoTIFF]]), 2D vector-based GIS data (e.g., [[AutoCAD DXF]]), 3D models (e.g., [[.3DS]], [[Object file|.OBJ]]), and 3D scenes (e.g., [[Collada]], [[Keyhole Markup Language]]) such as supported by [[Computer-aided design|CAD]], [[GIS]], and [[computer graphics]] tools and systems. All components of a 3D city model have to be transformed into a common [[geographic coordinate system]].

=== Databases ===
A database for 3D city models stores its components in a hierarchically structured, multi-scale way, which allows for a stable and reliable data management and facilitates complex GIS modeling and analysis tasks. For example, the 3D City Database is a free 3D geo database to store, represent, and manage virtual 3D city models on top of a standard spatial relational database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3dcitydb.org/3dcitydb/welcome/ |title=3D City DB Web Site www.3dcitydb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A database is required if 3D city models have to be continuously managed. 3D city model databases form a key element in 3D spatial data infrastructures that require support for storing, managing, maintenance, and distribution of 3D city model contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualcitysystems.de/en/products/virtualcitydatabase |title=virtual city database for 3D city and landscape models}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their implementation requires support of a multitude of formats (e.g., based on FME multi formats). As common application, geodata download portals can be set up for 3D city model contents (e.g., virtualcityWarehouse).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualcitysystems.de/en/products/virtualcitywarehouse.html |title=virtualcityWarehouse |access-date=2014-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531190348/http://virtualcitysystems.de/en/products/virtualcitywarehouse.html |archive-date=2014-05-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CityGML ===
The [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC) defines an explicit [[XML]]-based exchange format for 3D city models, [[CityGML]], which supports not only geometric descriptions of 3D city model components but also the specification of semantics and topology information.&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Kolbe: ''Representing and Exchanging 3D City Models with CityGML''. 3D Geo-Information Sciences, J. Lee, [[Sisi Zlatanova|S. Zlatanova]], W. Cartwright, G. Gartner, L. Meng, and M. P. Peterson, Eds. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2009, pp. 15–31&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of 3D City Models ==

=== Level of Detail ===
3D city models are typically constructed at various [[level of detail|levels of detail]] (LOD) to provide notions of multiple resolutions and at different levels of abstraction. Other metrics such as the level of spatio-semantic coherence and resolution of the texture can be considered a part of the LOD.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |title=Formalisation of the level of detail in 3D city modelling

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[CityGML]] defines five LODs for building models: 
* LOD 0: [[2.5D]] footprints
* LOD 1: Buildings represented by block models (usually extruded footprints)
* LOD 2: Building models with standard roof structures
* LOD 3: Detailed (architectural) building models
* LOD 4: LOD 3 building models supplemented with interior features.

There exist also approaches to generalize a given detailed 3D city model by means of automated generalization.&lt;ref&gt;T. Glander, J. Döllner: ''Techniques for Generalizing Building Geometry of Complex Virtual 3D City Models''. Advances in 3D Geoinformation Systems, (Peter van Oosterom and [[Sisi Zlatanova]] and Friso Penninga and Elfriede M. Fendel, ed.), Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography, Springer, pp. 381–400, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a hierarchical road network (e.g., [[OpenStreetMap]]) can be used to group 3D city model components into "cells"; each cell is abstracted by aggregating and merging contained components.

=== GIS Data ===
[[GIS]] data provide the base information to build a 3D city model such as by digital terrain models, road networks, land use maps, and related geo-referenced data. GIS data also includes cadastral data that can be converted into simple 3D models as, for example, in the case of extruded building footprints. Core components of 3D city models form [[digital terrain model]]s (DTM) represented, for example, by TINs or grids.

=== CAD Data ===
Typical sources of data for 3D city model also include [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] models of buildings, sites, and infrastructure elements. They provide a high level of detail, possible not required by 3D city model applications, but can be incorporated either by exporting their geometry or as encapsulated objects.

=== BIM Data ===
[[Building information modeling|Building information models]] represent another category of geo-spatial data that can be integrated into a 3D city model providing the highest level of detail for building components.

=== Integration at Visualization Level ===
Complex 3D city models typically are based on different sources of geodata such as geodata from GIS, building and site models from CAD and BIM. It is one of their core properties to establish a common reference frame for heterogeneous geo-spatial and geo-referenced data, i.e., the data need not to be merged or fusioned based on one common data model or schema. The integration is possible by sharing a common geo-coordinate system at the visualization level.&lt;ref&gt;J. Döllner, B. Hagedorn: ''Integrating Urban GIS, CAD, and BIM Data By Service-Based Virtual 3D City-Models''. Urban and Regional Data Management: UDMS 2007 Annual, (Massimo Rumor and Volker Coors and Elfriede M. Fendel and [[Sisi Zlatanova]], ed.), Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd., Stuttgart, Germany, pp. 157–170, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building Reconstruction ===
The simplest form of building model construction consist in extruding the footprint polygons of buildings, e.g., taken from the cadaster, by pre-compute average heights. In practice, 3D models of buildings of urban regions are generated based on capturing and analyzing 3D [[point cloud]]s (e.g., sampled by terrestrial or aerial [[3D scanning|laser scanning]]) or by photogrammetric approaches. To achieve a high percentage of geometrically and topologically correct 3D building models, digital terrain surfaces and 2D footprint polygons are required by automated building [[3D reconstruction|reconstruction]] tools such as BREC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualcitysystems.de/en/products/buildingreconstruction&lt;/ref&gt; One key challenge is to find building parts with their corresponding roof geometry. "Since fully automatic image understanding is very hard to solve, semi-automatic components are usually required to at least support the recognition of very complex buildings by a human operator."&lt;ref&gt;N. Haala, M. Kada: [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fatemeh_Sadeghi/post/Can_anyone_suggest_to_me_the_possible_methods_to_semantically_enrich_3D_city_model/attachment/59d632fbc49f478072ea1e47/AS%3A273638396235777%401442251886039/download/An+update+on+automatic+3D+building+reconstruction.pdf An update on automatic 3D building reconstruction]. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 65 (2010), 570–580.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical approaches are common for roof reconstruction based on airborne laser scanning point clouds.

Fully automated processes exist to generate LOD1 and LOD2 building models for large regions. For example, the Bavarian Office for Surveying and Spatial Information is responsible for about 8 million building models at LOD1 and LOD2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://virtualcitysystems.de/en/references.html#projects |title=Bavarian LOD2 Building Model Project |access-date=2014-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531173221/http://virtualcitysystems.de/en/references.html#projects |archive-date=2014-05-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visualization of 3D City Models ==
The [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] of 3D city models represents a core functionality required for interactive applications and systems based on 3D city models.

=== Real-Time Rendering of 3D City Models ===
Providing high quality visualization of massive 3D city models in a scalable, fast, and cost efficient manner is still a challenging task due to the complexity in terms of 3D geometry and [[texture mapping|textures]] of 3D city models. [[Real-time rendering]] provides a large number of specialized 3D rendering techniques for 3D city models. 
Examples of specialized real-time 3D rendering include:

* Real-time 3D rendering of [[multiperspectivity|multiperspective]] views on 3D city models.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT01QsZMYDE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/doellner/publications/year/2014/2390/PSTD2014.html Multiperspective Views for 3D City Models&lt;/ref&gt;

Real-time rendering algorithms and data structures are listed by the virtual terrain project.&lt;ref&gt;http://vterrain.org/LOD/Papers/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service-Based Rendering of 3D City Models ===
[[Service-oriented architecture]]s (SOA) for visualizing 3D city models offer a separation of concerns into management and rendering and their interactive provision by client applications. For SOA-based approaches, 3D portrayal services&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/3dpie&lt;/ref&gt; are required, whose main functionality represents the portrayal in the sense of 3D rendering and visualization.&lt;ref&gt;J. Klimke, J. Döllner: ''Service-oriented Visualization of Virtual 3D City Models''. Directions Magazine, 2012. http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/service-oriented-visualization-of-virtual-3d-city-models/226560&lt;/ref&gt; SOA-based approaches can be distinguished into two main categories, currently discussed in the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]]:

* Web 3D Service (W3DS): This type of service handles geodata access and mapping to computer graphics primitives such as scene graphs with textured 3D geometry models as well as their delivery to the requesting client applications. The client applications are responsible for the 3D rendering of delivered scene graphs, i.e., they are responsible for the interactive display using their own 3D graphics hardware.
* Web View Service (WVS): This type of service encapsulates the 3D rendering process for 3D city models at the server side. The server generates views of the 3D scene or intermediate, image-based representations (e.g., virtual panoramas or G-buffer cube maps&lt;ref&gt;J. Döllner, B. Hagedorn: ''[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Klimke/publication/254463533_Server-Based_Rendering_of_Large_3D_Scenes_for_Mobile_Devices_Using_G-Buffer_Cube_Maps/links/56c72b2f08ae0d3b1b65d517/Server-Based-Rendering-of-Large-3D-Scenes-for-Mobile-Devices-Using-G-Buffer-Cube-Maps.pdf Server-Based Rendering of Large 3D Scenes for Mobile Devices Using G-Buffer Cube Maps]''. Web3D '12 Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on 3D Web Technology, pp. 97-100, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;), which are streamed and uploaded to requesting client applications. The client applications are responsible for re-construction the 3D scene based on the intermediate representations. Client applications do not have to process 3D graphics data, but to provide management for loading, caching, and displaying the image-based representations of 3D scenes and do not have to process the original (and possibly large) 3D city model.

=== Map-Based Visualization ===
A map-based technique, the "smart map" approach, aims at providing "massive, virtual 3D city models on different platforms namely web browsers, smartphones or tablets, by means of an interactive map assembled from artificial oblique image tiles." &lt;ref&gt;J. Klimke et al.: "Scalable Multi-Platform Distribution of Spatial 3D Contents". ISPRS 8th 3D GeoInfo Conference &amp; WG II/2 Workshop 27–29 November 2013, Istanbul, Turkey, (U. Isikdag, ed.), vol. II-2/W1, ISPRS Annals, ISPRS, pp. 193-200, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The map tiles are synthesized by an automatic 3D rendering process of the 3D city model; the map tiles, generated for different levels-of-detail, are stored on the server. This way, the 3D rendering is completely performed on the server's side, simplifying access and usage of 3D city models. The 3D rendering process can apply advanced rendering techniques (e.g., global illumination and shadow calculation, illustrative rendering), but does not require client devices to have advanced 3D graphics hardware. Most importantly, the map-based approach allows for distributing and using complex 3D city models with having to stream the underlying data to client devices - only the pre-generated map tiles are sent. This way, "(a) The complexity of the 3D city model data is decoupled from data transfer complexity (b) the implementation of client applications is simplified significantly as 3D rendering is encapsulated on server side (c) 3D city models can be easily deployed for and used by a large number of concurrent users, leading to a high degree of scalability of the overall approach." &lt;ref&gt;J. Klimke et al.: "Scalable Multi-Platform Distribution of Spatial 3D Contents". ISPRS 8th 3D GeoInfo Conference &amp; WG II/2 Workshop 27–29 November 2013, Istanbul, Turkey, (U. Isikdag, ed.), vol. II-2/W1, ISPRS Annals, ISPRS, pp. 193-200, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''45×90 points''' are the four points on earth which are halfway between the [[geographical pole]]s, the [[equator]], the [[Prime Meridian]], and the [[180th meridian]].

==45°N, 90°W==
The best-known and most frequently visited such point is {{coord|45|0|0|N|90|0|0|W}} which is located on land at {{convert|1345|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} above sea level in the town of [[Rietbrock, Wisconsin]] near the unincorporated community of [[Poniatowski, Wisconsin|Poniatowski]].  An incorrect geographic marker was placed there by the [[Marathon County, Wisconsin|Marathon County]] Park Commission, but in 2017, it was removed and relocated to the actual location&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/45-x-90-geographical-marker|title=45 X 90 Geographical Marker|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==45°N, 90°E==
The only other 45×90 point located on land is {{coord|45|0|0|N|90|0|0|E}} which has a height of {{convert|3311|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} above sea level and is located in a desolate region of the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] of [[China]] near the [[Mongolia]]n border, some {{convert|240|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Ürümqi]]. Administratively, it is on the border of [[Qitai County|Qitai]] and [[Qinggil County|Qinggil]] Counties. Greg Michaels, an American, and Ru Rong Zhao, a taxi driver from the closest town of [[Qitai County|Qitai]], itself 110&amp;nbsp;km to the south-southwest, visited this point on April 13, 2004 and documented the visit on the [[Degree Confluence Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=45°N 90°E|url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?id=6993|publisher=[[Degree Confluence Project]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=13 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their visit shows that there is no monument or any physical sign that recognition has been given to this location.

==45°S, 90°E==
[[File:MH370_SIO_search.png|thumb|400px|Possible debris from [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]] (colored spots in lower left) were spotted by satellite near 45°S, 90°E.]]

[[File:Diagram of Holland Channel cable.png|thumb|300px|right|A period depiction of the Ambrose Channel pilot cable in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bond|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Ambrose Channel pilot cable''', also called the '''Ambrose Channel leader cable''', was a cable laid in [[Ambrose Channel]] at the entrance to the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] that provided an audio tone for guiding ships in and out of port at times of low visibility. The cable was laid during 1919 and 1920;  it had been removed from the channel and replaced by wireless technology by the end of the 1920s.
&lt;!-- Note: this image needs 500px as it has detail which gets blurred out at lower resolution. --&gt;

==Background==
[[Ambrose Channel]] is the only shipping channel in and out of the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]], an important [[commercial port]]. Delays posed a major problem for shipping en route to [[New York City]], and bad weather could close the channel for days. Ships were forced to wait at the harbor's entrance for conditions to clear. These delays cost shipping companies substantial amounts of money, with each ship costing between $500 and $4000 per hour it was stopped (roughly $5,700 to $46,000 in 2013 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and operation==
[[File:Ambrose pilot cable cross section.png|thumb|The Cable was composed of several layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921b|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]The Ambrose leader cable was an armored cable with a single internal conductor (see picture) that acted like a long radio antenna laid on the channel floor. It originated at [[Fort Lafayette]] (near the present day [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]]), then extended 16 miles down the [[Ambrose Channel]] to the vicinity of [[Lightship Ambrose]] offshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=44–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500&amp;nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]] (cycles per second) current at 400&amp;nbsp;volts, resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field along the length of the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=51}}. Other voltages may have been used in subsequent operation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current was mechanically keyed to send the word "NAVY" in [[Morse Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ship received by a pair of [[induction coil]]s hung on opposite sides of the ship, and fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=46–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
[[File:SE 1600 amplifier ckt.png|thumb|200px|Two-stage vacuum-tube amplifier alternately takes input from inductance coils (top) hung on each side of ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The pilot cable required a series of prior discoveries and inventions. In 1882,  A. R. Sennett patented the use of a submerged electrical cable to communicate with a ship at a fixed location. Around the same time Charles Stevenson patented a means of navigating ships over an electrically charge cable using a [[galvanometer]]. The method became practical when Earl Hanson adapted early [[vacuum tube]] circuits to amplify the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=34}}; {{Harvnb|Current History|1921|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert H. Marriott]] was a radio pioneer employed by the Navy in [[Puget Sound]], where he conducted early experiments with underwater pilot cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geselowitz|2009}}; {{Harvnb|Marriott|1924}}; {{Harvnb|Woods|1980|p=523}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His results were sufficiently promising that he recommended further development to Commander Stanford C. Hooper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, 1919 Commander Hooper instructed A. Crossley, an expert radio aid, to develop and test the concept on a larger scale at the [[Naval Submarine Base New London#History|New London Naval Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Crossley installed a longer version of the cable that Marriott had designed. He used a wooden hulled [[launch (ship)|launch]] for the first round of tests before moving to a steel-hulled [[submarine]] for later tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both types of vessel picked up the signal and followed the underwater test cable without problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation and testing==
[[File:Ambrose Channel pilot cable in action.PNG|frame|left|Commander R. F. McConnell on the USS ''Semmes'' with the "Hanson apparatus".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nautical Gazette|1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Following the successful tests at New London, the Navy proceeded to large scale testing in Ambrose Channel late in 1919. The [[Minelayer#Naval minelayers|minelayer]] ''Ord'' laid a pilot cable composed of 2,000 feet of leaded and armored cable, 2,000 feet of leaded cable, and 83,000 feet of standard rubber-insulated cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=38–39 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[USS O'Brien (DD-51)|USS ''O'Brien'']] was fitted with receiving equipment and attempted to follow the cable out of the channel. Unfortunately, it was unable to detect a signal past the 1,000 foot mark, where a break in the cable had prevented the signal from continuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=40 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The break in the cable was repaired, but over the course of the winter of 1919-1920, crews found that the cable had broken in a total of fifty-two different places due to the strain placed on it while it was being laid. The damage was irreparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=40 }}; {{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=250 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Going back to the drawing board, engineers tested 150-foot segments of three different types of cable and used the results to design a new full-size pilot cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navy ordered 87,000 feet of cable from the Simplex Wire and Cable Company in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once complete, the cable was loaded onto the [[USS Pequot (ID-2998)|USS ''Pequot'']] in the [[Boston Navy Yard]]. The ship arrived in New York on July 31, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=43 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ambrose Channel was already crossed by three telegraph cables, owned by [[Western Union]], the [[United States Army|Army]], and the [[New York City Police Department|police]], all of which had to be raised to the surface so the pilot cable could be laid underneath them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=43 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation of the cable was completed on August 6, 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|pp=38–39 }}; {{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and by August 28, electrical tests showed that both the sending and receiving circuits were functioning properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Navy tested the cable using the seagoing tug [[USS Algorma (AT-34)|USS ''Algorma'']]. It then invited "representatives of various radio companies, shipping interests, [[Maritime pilot|pilots']] associations, governmental bureaus, naval attaches, and others" for a public demonstration on board the destroyer [[USS Semmes (DD-189)|USS ''Semmes'']] from October 6 through October 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crossley|1921a|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship's windows were covered with canvas and the captains took turns navigating using only the audio cues from the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cable was well received. Even before the New London tests, the Washington Post called it "the greatest development in marine travel since the invention of the steam turbine"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Washington Post|1919|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Los Angeles Times declared the technology to be "one of the greatest peacetime gifts that science has devised."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once operational, the latter newspaper called it "the greatest safeguard devised for shipping in modern history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Los Angeles Times|1920}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 1921 trade magazine, leader cables had five functions: "to enable a ship to make a good landfall in thick weather, to lead a ship up the harbor, to lead a ship from open water through a restricted channel to open water on the far side, to give warning of outlying dangers, and to assist a vessel to keep a straight course from port to port and thus save fuel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1921|p=951}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1922, the publication ''Radio World'' stated that the cable's first two years of operation had been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1922|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1922, ''Radio Broadcast'' boasted about the money saved by the cable as well as the ease of using it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cable itself was paid for using public funds, but it was the responsibility of ship owners to outfit their vessels with receiving equipment. Installation of the cable cost roughly $50,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the listening apparatus installed on each ship using the channel cost $1,200,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|New York Times|1920|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; compared with hourly costs of delays that ranged from $500 to $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=249 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Radio Broadcast'' expressed the belief that navigation cables would become common for both ships and aircraft: "...there is a future for the audio cable... Its fullest usefulness at American ports and elsewhere waits, however, on that large appreciation of radio devices for sea as well as air navigation which pilots, both on the sea and in the air, expect, but do not as yet demand."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p=251}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obsolescence and legacy ==
Despite the media hype, it appears that the Ambrose Channel pilot cable never met with large scale commercial success. Initially, some contemporaries of the cable proposed that it be extended several miles past the Ambrose light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilhelm|1922|p= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such plans never came to fruition, as advances in technology rendered the pilot cable obsolete.  By 1929 the ''Baltimore Sun'' reported ships navigating the Channel blindly without making any reference to the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baltimore Sun|1929}}; {{Harvnb|Putnam|1924|p=215}}; {{Harvnb|Science|1924|p=xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, Marriott publicly complained that navigation cables still had unrealized potential for guiding ships. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Science News-Letter|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Leader cable systems appear to have been made obsolete by the refinement of [[radio direction finding]] and the placement of [[Electric beacon|radio beacons]] (low-power radio transmitters) at strategic locations. Those beacons are analogous to lighthouses, but can be "seen" in all weather, and are used for navigation in the same way as regular lighthouses.  The first successful application of these radio beacons as "radio fog signals" were three stations installed near New York in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Putnam|1924}}; {{Harvnb|Radio Broadcast|1922|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, there were eleven stations in operation in the United States and nearly three hundred ships suitably equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Putnam|1924|p=213}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1930, an article in the ''Journal of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]'' declared that "wireless aids and echo sounding have superseded [the leader cable]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper|1930|pp=995–996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, more modern navigation tools such as [[radar]], [[global positioning system|GPS]], and lighted [[buoy]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s help ships navigate Ambrose Channel.



Earl Hanson, one of the key players in designing the Ambrose Channel cable, writing for ''Popular Mechanics,'' viewed it as a step toward applying radio cable technology in vast swaths of everyday life, including guiding aircraft and navigating and powering automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hanson|1934}}; {{Harvnb|Yates|Pacent|1922|p=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambrose Channel cable was removed from the channel and used in testing an early system of [[autolanding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Howeth|1963|loc= Chap. 28, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112064674325;view=1up;seq=367 §16]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cable found no more success in that role than it did in guiding ships. The [[Blind Landing Experimental Unit]] later tried a similar system briefly before also abandoning it in favor of wireless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wood|1930|p=13 }}; {{Harvnb|Davis|1922|p=5}}; {{Harvnb|Armstrong|1930|pp=1–2}}; {{Harvnb|Perry|2004|p=100}}; {{Harvnb|Hanson|1919|p=489}}; {{Harvnb|Current History|1921|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''boundary marker''', '''border marker''', '''boundary stone''', or '''border stone''' is a robust physical marker that identifies the start of a land [[Border|boundary]] or the change in a boundary, especially a change in direction of a boundary.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; There are several other types of named border markers, known as '''pillars''', '''obelisks''', and '''corners'''.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;  Border markers can also be markers through which a border line runs in a straight line to determine that border.&lt;ref name="straight-border"&gt;{{cite conference | title=AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE – Longitude 129 degrees east, and why it is not the longest, straight line in the world | publisher=Eyepiece – Official Organ of The Institution of Surveyors, Australia, W.A. Division | accessdate=15 January 2012 | author=Porter, John | conference=National Perspectives – 32nd Australian Surveyors Congress Technical Papers 31 March – 6 April 1990 | location=Canberra: The Institution | pages=18–24 |date=June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be the markers from which a border marker has been fixed.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;

==Purpose ==
According to Josiah Ober, boundary markers are "a way of imposing human, cultural, social meanings upon a once-undifferentiated natural environment." Boundary markers are linked to social hierarchies, since they derive their meaning from the authority of a person or group to declare the limits of a given space of land for political, social or religious reasons. Ober notes that "determining who can use parcels of arable land and for what purpose, has immediate and obvious economic implications."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ober, Josiah. "Greek Horoi: Artifactual Texts and the Contingency of Meaning." ''Methods in the Mediterranean: Historical and Archaeological Views of Texts and Archaeology.'' Ed. David. B. Small. Leiden: Brill, 1995. URL: http://www.stanford.edu/group/dispersed_author/docs/GreekHoroi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many borders were drawn along invisible lines of [[latitude]] or [[longitude]], which often created a need to mark these borders on the ground, as accurately as possible, using the technology of the day.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; Advances in [[GPS]] technology have shown that there are many borders inaccurately marked on the ground.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;

Boundary markers have often been used to mark critical points{{clarify|date=February 2016}} on political boundaries, i.e. those between countries, [[Federated state|states]] or local administrations, but have also been used to mark out the limits of private landholdings, especially in areas where fences or walls are impractical or unnecessary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In developed countries the use of markers for land ownership has in many places been replaced by maps and land ownership registration. Boundary markers are not legal markers in Western countries and may have troublesome legal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairview-industries.com/gismodule/PartTwoMisplacedBoundary.html |title=Cadastral Information For GIS Specialists - Case Of The Misplaced Boundary Marker |publisher=Fairview-industries.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921084505/http://www.fairview-industries.com/gismodule/PartTwoMisplacedBoundary.html |archivedate=21 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, boundary markers have legal meaning in [[Japan]], and are generally installed across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ja.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E6%B0%91%E6%B3%95%E7%AC%AC229%E6%9D%A1 Civil Law 229]; [http://www.hiroshima-chousashi.or.jp/kanri/kan0page.htm more information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103125854/http://www.hiroshima-chousashi.or.jp/kanri/kan0page.htm |date=3 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Markers are still used extensively for marking international borders, which are traditionally classified into two categories: natural boundaries, correlating to topographical features such as rivers or mountain ranges, and artificial boundaries, which have no obvious relation to topography. The latter category includes borders defined by boundary markers such as stones and walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Settlement of Boundary Disputes in International Law|last = Cukwurah|first = A. Oye|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 1967|location = Manchester|pages = 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; International boundary markers are placed and can be maintained by mutual agreement of the bordering countries.

==Construction==
Boundary markers, traditionally, were often made of [[Rock (geology)|stone]], but later many have been made with concrete or a mixture of materials.&lt;ref name="kimberley"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.kununurra.org.au/research/1921-wa-nt-border-determinations

 |publisher=Kununurra Historical Society Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically placed at a notable or especially visible point. Many are inscribed with relevant information such as the abbreviation of the boundary holder and often a date.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Asia ===

==== China ====
The oldest known boundary stone in China is from Jiangsu Province. Dating from 12 A.D., it bears the inscription "the sea area from Jiaozhou Bay to the east of Guixan county belongs to Langya Shire and the waters from the south of Guixan county to the east of the estuary of Guanhe River belongs to Donghai Shire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/regional/2015-05/18/content_20750795.htm|title = The boundary stone of Han Dynasty in Suma Bay  - China - Chinadaily.com.cn|last = 潘其|website = www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the border between Russia and China was formally demarcated with boundary stones as the result of the Treaty of Kiakhta in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Asia|last = Perdue|first = Peter C.|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2009|location = Cambridge, MA|pages = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, stones were used to outline the limits of the International Settlement in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Britain and China, 1840-1970: Empire, Finance and War|author1=Bickers, Robert |author2=Jonathan J.

==== Thailand ====
In ancient Thailand, sacred boundary stones called ''Sema Hin'' delimited Buddhist temple precincts.

=== Near East and Africa ===

==== Israel ====
According to B. S. Jackson, stones were put in place in ancient Israel to "mark the boundary of a territory (public or private), and to seek to deter potential violators of that boundary through the use of threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The World of Ancient Israel: Sociological, Anthropological and Political Perspectives|editor-last = Clements|editor-first = Ronald E. |publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1991|location = Cambridge|pages = 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Bible contains a strict prohibition against the unauthorized displacement or removal of boundary markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Settlement of Boundary Disputes in International Law|last = Cukwurah|first = A. Oye|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 1967|location = Manchester|pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Egypt ====
An example of boundary markers in ancient Egypt were the boundary stelae of Akhenaten. They defined the limits of the sacred city of Akhet-Aten, built by Akhenaten as the center of the Aten religious cult which he founded. Egyptologists categorize the stelae based on whether they are inscribed with the "Earlier Proclamation," a general explanation of why the location was selected and how the city would be designed, or the "Later Proclamation," which provides additional details about the perimeters of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|last = Murnane|first = William J.|publisher = Kegan Paul Int.|year = 1993|location = London|pages = 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

==== Finland ====
[[File:Kaavi, Pohjois-Savo.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|left|A typical roadside border marker in Finland, entering [[Kaavi]] municipality in [[Pohjois-Savo]] region.]]
[[Glacial erratic]]s and similar natural stones were often used as boundary markers between properties. Knowledge of their locations was typically maintained by oral tradition, wherein men of each house would walk the length of the border. These stones then became boundary markers for [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]], and eventually provinces and countries. For example, Kuhankuono is a stone that marks the [[Quadripoint#Multipoints of greater numerical complexity|multipoint]] border between seven municipalities in [[Kurjenrahka National Park]] near [[Turku]]. Today, however, steel rods topped with a cube painted orange are usually used. Municipalities often post a traffic sign featuring their coat of arms on the border on major roads. On the [[Finnish-Russian border]], many historical border stones, marked with Swedish and Imperial Russian symbols, are still in use. The actual Finnish-Russian border is marked by small white bollard, but on both sides of the border there are large striped bollards decorated with a coat of arms: a blue/white bollard on the Finnish side, a red/green bollard on the Russian side.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015082320139715_uu.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial cairns are found on the Norway-Russia-Finland tripoint ([[Treriksrøysa]]) and Norway-Sweden-Finland tripoint ([[Three-Country Cairn]]). The Sweden-Finland border on [[Märket]] is marked with holes drilled to the rock, because seasonal [[pack ice]] can shear off any protruding markers. In folklore, a type of [[haltija]], ''rajahaltija'', a kind of a local spirit, was believed to haunt borders that had been unjustly moved.

==== Greece ====
The earliest reference to a boundary stone in Greek literature is in the ''Iliad'', which describes the goddess Athena using one as a projectile. Boundary stones, known as ''horos'', could be made of either carved or undressed stones, and were typically inscribed with the Greek word ''horos''. One such stone was used to indicate the edge of the Athenian ''agora''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The practice of separating areas of land with boundary stones, though common, was widely considered by classical writers to be a violation of the principle of communal land ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science and Civilization in China: Volume 2, History of Scientific Thought|last = Needham|first = Joseph|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1956|location = Cambridge|pages = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rome ====
In ancient Roman religion, the god [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]] was worshiped as the patron god of boundary markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Settlement of International Boundary Disputes in International Law|last = Cukwurah|first = A. Oye|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 1967|location = Manchester|pages = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid, in a hymn directed to the god, wrote: "O Terminus, whether thou art a stone or a stump buried in the field, … thou dost set bounds to people and cities and vast kingdoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brown's Boundary Control and Legal Principles|author1=Robillard, Walter G. |author2=Donald A.

==== Monaco ====
In 1828, the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] established a physical border with 91 boundary stones, each numbered 1 to 91, running along the border from present-day [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]] to [[Menton|Menton-Garavan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://bornes.frontieres.free.fr/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 1848, the Principality of Monaco included the villages of Roquebrune, Monti, Garavan and Menton.  Of the original 91 boundary stones only 12 remain: 6 within the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]], 3 in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]], and 3 in [[Menton]].  The boundary stones numbered 9, 12, 15, and 31 are located in [[Monaco]].  Another stone has been cast in concrete in the Sainte-Cécile area of [[Monaco]] thus rendering its number illegible.  Stone number 55, originally located in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]], was given as a gift from the city of [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]] to the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] and is now located in [[Monaco]]'s city hall.  Stones numbered 56, 57, and 58 are located in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]].  Stones numbered 62, 71, and 73 are located in [[Menton]].  All the boundary stones have three engraved sides: one side with their individual numbers (1 to 91), one side with the letter "M" indicating [[Monaco]]'s territory, and one side with a cross (+) indicating the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia's territory.  The cross represents the coat of arms of the [[House of Savoy]], rulers of Piedmont-Sardinia.

===Western Australia===
The history of [[Western Australia border#Marking the WA border on the ground|marking the Western Australian border on the ground]] states that the "Austral Pillar" and the "Deakin Pillar" are points used to determine their position east of [[Greenwich]] and then fix a border from, in this case used to determine the line of the [[129th meridian east]] [[longitude]], as the [[Western Australia border|Western Australian border]].&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; The Deakin [[Obelisk]] and the Kimberley Obelisk in Australia are used in a slightly different way, in that a line is run north and south through a point on the obelisks, formed by a copper plug embedded into the top centre of the concrete obelisks.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; The "corners" in Australia, such as [[Cameron Corner Survey Marker|Cameron Corner]], [[Haddon Corner]], [[Poeppel Corner]], and [[Surveyor Generals Corner]], are where multiple borders meet or a border changes direction.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;

=== United States ===

==== Hawaii ====
The basic unit of the ancient Hawaiian land division system was the ''ahupua'a'', a self-sustaining agricultural district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hawaii: A History of the Big Island|last = Oaks|first = Robert|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|year = 2003|location = Charleston|pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The places where a road crossed the border of an ''ahupua'a'' were marked with distinctive altars, known as ''ahu'' or (stone) piles. These altars served not only as boundary markers but also as sites for the performance of religious rituals related to land taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Dictionary of Hawaiian Legal Land Terms|last = Lucas|first = Paul Nahoa|publisher = University of Hawaii Press|year = 1995|location = Honolulu|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.

==== Washington, D.C. ====
The original boundaries of the District of Columbia were marked using boundary stones. These were made of saw-cut sandstone blocks and stood two feet high when set in the ground. Ten boundary stones were placed along each side of the 100 square mile (259 square kilometer) district of Columbia. Although the original surveyors intended each side to be ten miles (16 kilometers) long, their measurements were often inaccurate, resulting in the sometimes significant misplacement of stones and the overall skewing of the District boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Woodward|first = Fred E.|date = 1907|title = A Ramble Along the Boundary Stones of the District of Columbia with a Camera|journal = Historical Society of Washington, D.C. |pages=63–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these discrepancies are intentional, because the ground at the exact mile point was covered in water; “in such cases,” Andrew Ellicott, the leader of the surveying crew, noted in 1793, “the stones are placed on the nearest firm ground and the true distance in miles and poles is marked on them”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Nye|first = Edwin Darby|date = 1971|title = Revisiting Washington's Forty Boundary Stones|journal = Historical Society of Washington, D.C. |pages=740–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information engraved on the stones includes the number (1 through 10) of the stone within the sequence on that side of the District, the date of placement, and the words "Jurisdiction of the United States." In the twentieth century, the Daughters of the American Revolution voluntarily took responsibility for preserving the stones, which had fallen victim to vandalization and urban development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the late 1990s renewed interest in the boundary stones led to increased preservation efforts by the DAR and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.boundarystones.org|title = Boundary Stones of Washington, D.C.|website = www.boundarystones.org|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other States ====
In 1773, a Franciscan friar named Francisco Palou erected the first boundary marker between Alta and Baja California.

__NOTOC__
[[File:Monument Valley, late afternoon.jpg|thumb|[[West and East Mitten Buttes|The Mittens]] and [[Merrick Butte]] in [[Monument Valley]], [[Arizona]]]]

In [[geomorphology]], a '''butte''' ({{IPAc-en|b|juː|t}}) is an isolated [[hill]] with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller [[landform]]s than [[mesa]]s, [[plateau]]s, and [[Table (landform)|tablelands]]. The word "butte" comes from a [[French language|French]] word meaning "small hill"; its use is prevalent in the [[Western United States]], including the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] where "mesa" is used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. In differentiating mesas and buttes, geographers use the [[rule of thumb]] that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mesa and Butte | work=Science Clarified | year=2008 | url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Mesa-and-Butte.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230831/http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Mesa-and-Butte.html|archivedate=2 December 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable buttes==
The [[West and East Mitten Buttes|Mitten Buttes]] of [[Monument Valley]] in [[Arizona]] are two of the most distinctive and widely recognized buttes. Monument Valley and the Mittens provided backgrounds in scenes from many  [[Western (genre)|western-themed]] [[film]]s, including seven movies directed by [[John Ford]].{{refn|name=note1|group=note|The John Ford westerns with location work shot in Monument Valley were ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949), ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Sergeant Rutledge]]'' (1960), and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964).}} The [[Devils Tower]] in northeastern [[Wyoming]] is a [[laccolith]]ic butte composed of [[igneous rock]] rather than [[sandstone]], [[limestone]] or other [[sedimentary rock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Devils Tower National Monument - Geologic Formations | url=http://www.nps.gov/deto/naturescience/geologicformations.htm | publisher=National Park Service | date=10 Mar 2014 | accessdate=13 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B D - Devil's Tower select (3) 1.1 (by).jpg|thumb|left|[[Devils Tower]] in [[Wyoming]]]]

Three other notable formations that are either named ''butte'' or may be considered buttes even though they do not conform to the formal geographer's rule are [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]] in [[Nebraska]] which is actually a collection of five bluffs, [[Crested Butte]] which is a {{convert|12168|ft|m|abbr=on}} mountain in [[Colorado]], and [[Elephant Butte Dam|Elephant Butte]] which is now an island in Elephant Butte Reservoir in [[New Mexico]].

Among the well-known non-flat-topped buttes in the United States are [[Bear Butte]], [[South Dakota]], [[Black Butte (Oregon)|Black Butte]], [[Oregon]], and the [[Sutter Buttes]] in [[California]]. In many cases, buttes have been given other names that do not use the word ''butte'', for example, [[Courthouse Rock]], Nebraska.  Also, some large hills that are technically not buttes have names using the word ''butte'', examples of which are [[Kamiak Butte]] and Chelan Butte in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]].

==Formation==
Buttes form by [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] when hard [[caprock]] overlies a layer of less resistant [[rock (geology)|rock]] that is eventually worn away. The harder rock on top of the butte resists erosion. The caprock provides protection for the less resistant rock below from wind abrasion which leaves it standing isolated. As the top is further eroded by abrasion and weathering, the excess material that falls off adds to the [[scree]] or talus slope around the base. On a much smaller scale, the same process forms [[Hoodoo (geology)|hoodoo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Davis, George Herbert|year=1999|title=Structural Geology of the Colorado Plateau Region of Southern Utah, with Special Emphasis on Deformation Bands|series=G.S.A.

'''Community Greens''', sometimes referred to as ''backyard commons'', ''urban [[Common lands|common]]s'', or [[pocket neighborhood]]s, are shared open green spaces on the inside of city blocks, created either when residents merge backyard space or reclaim underutilized urban land such as vacant lots and [[Alley|alleyway]]s. These shared spaces are communally used and managed only by the residents whose homes abut them. They are not a public park, a private backyard, or a community garden; however, they can function as all three.

==Community Greens==
Community Greens is an organization concerned with the development of shared green spaces in residential neighborhoods in American cities. These green spaces are community greens.  The Community Greens movement believes that such an approach presents the best opportunity to add usable green space to American cities, by converting under utilized backyards and dysfunctional alleys into functional and beautiful shared green spaces that are owned, managed, and enjoyed by the people who live around them.

This has led communities in numerous American cities, including Boston, Sacramento, Baltimore, New York, and San Francisco, taking down their backyard fences, to create backyard commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/existinggreens.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618112110/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/existinggreens.htm |archivedate=2009-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Luzerne glover green alley.JPG|thumb|alt=Luzerne Glover Block Party to celebrate completion of gated and greened alley|Community Green behind the Luzerne-Glover Block]]

Community Greens are multi-functional spaces for gardening, recreation, and leisure which are designed to provide social, economic, and environmental benefits to urban residents. The creation of  backyard commons can lead to an increased interaction with neighbors throughout the planning and implementation process, which may result in a stronger overall sense of community. Other possible social benefits that are claimed include decreased crime, from having more eyes on the street, and safe places where children can play and adults relax. Community Greens, like other types of urban green spaces, can significantly improve the ecological functioning of urban habitats. Vegetation and permeable pavement can slow storm water runoff and increase groundwater, which in turn can reduce pollutant flowing into nearby bodies of water during a storm. Urban environments are often significantly warmer than outlying suburbs, mostly due to the prevalence of  heat retentive concrete surfaces. City trees can mitigate this effect through shading, etc..&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, AH, and Romm, JJ. (Feb/Mar97 ) “Painting the town white-and green.”''MIT's Technology Review''. 100(2):52-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The taking down  of backyards fences transforms fragmented habitats to connected corridors for urban wildlife. Furthermore because city dwellers recognize value in green space, often simply from an aesthetic standpoint, and this may be reflected through increased property values.&lt;ref&gt;Been, V.

==The beginnings in Maryland==
* Community Greens was founded as an offshoot of Ashoka, by Ashoka founder [[Bill Drayton]] in 2001.
* Spearheaded a state wide legislature in [[Maryland]], which changed the City Charter which allows the city to lease and gate alleys to homeowners.
* Started the Alley Gating and Alley Greening pilot project in [[Baltimore]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Alley greening [http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/Divisions/AlleyGatingGreeningProgram.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local ordinance passed in the City of Baltimore in 2007.
* As of 2009, there are 3 completely gated and greened alleys in Baltimore and over 70 applications from interested neighborhoods.

===Baltimore: The pilot project===
In 2002, a group of residents from the [[Patterson Park]] neighborhood approached the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation (CDC) looking for a way to improve the dirty, crime-ridden alley that ran behind their homes. Simultaneously, Community Greens also approached the Patterson Park CDC looking for an alley they could use as a pilot project in Baltimore, and these two groups were put into contact. The Luzerne-Glover block was granted a temporary permit from the city to gate their alleyway, despite the fact that it was not yet legal to gate a right-of-way. Community Greens, the Patterson Park CDC, the Patterson Park Neighborhood Association and the Luzurne‐Glover block group turned to University of Maryland law professor Barbara Bezdek, who enlisted the help of her law students, who researched existing laws and current uses of Baltimore alleyways.

[[File:Luzerne and Chandlers Yard Before.jpg|thumb|alt=Luzerne alleyway before gating and greening|The Luzerne-Glover Block alley before gating and greening]]

Looking for a permanent solution, these groups aligned themselves with the Mayor's Department of Neighborhoods and took their case to Annapolis. Maryland Delegate [[Peter A. Hammen]] sponsored House Bill 1533 to amend the Baltimore City Charter, allowing the City to close alleyways and lease them to interested parties. The Luzerne-Glover group testified before the Environmental Committee of the state legislature and House Bill 1533 passed in 2004. Community Greens then worked with law firm [[Hogan &amp; Hartson]], in collaboration with Barbara Bezdek, to draft a city alley gating and leasing ordinance, which was then submitted to the City of Baltimore.

In April 2007, the [[Baltimore City Council]] under the leadership of newly elected Mayor [[Shelia Dixon]], passed the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance, enabling Baltimore residents to legally gate and green the alleys behind their homes, contingent on a requirement that 80% of the homeowners on the alley submit consent forms and 100% of property owners to approve projects that impede traffic flow. Projects requiring 100% consent include removal of existing concrete and installation of permeable pavement and large tree plantings; beautification and smaller greening projects that do not impede traffic only require 80% approval.

Interested communities need approval from several Baltimore City Departments, including Solid Waste, Transportation, Fire, and Police to ensure that proposed alley projects meet the necessary infrastructural conditions. Once initial approval is received, residents submit an application to the Department of Public Works, which includes the necessary consent forms from homeowners and a signed affidavit stating that attempts were made to obtain approval from all homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.baltimore.md.us/government/dpw/alleyGating.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525041536/http://www.ci.baltimore.md.us/government/dpw/alleyGating.php |archivedate=2009-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luzerne Glover neighborhood now has their green alleyway, and is the first community in Baltimore to use the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/alleyreport_final_reduced.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225084428/http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/alleyreport_final_reduced.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, seven Baltimore communities have successfully completed this process and have created eight useful Community Greens from the underutilized alleyways in their backyards.

==Other existing greens==

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090628111701/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/montgomerypark/Montgomery%20Park.htm Montgomery Park - Boston, Massachusetts]===
'''Montgomery Park''' is a third of an acre common space shared by 85 households in Boston's South End neighborhood. From the time the neighborhood was first developed in the 1860s through the 1970s, the park was separated from the residents' backyards by an alley and fence. In more recent years, residents began to connect the park to their individual yards by replacing the alley separating their private backyards from the park with a narrower brick walkway and tearing down backyard fences. Additionally, residents have moved garbage collection to the front street and convinced utility companies to bury service lines. Residents now enjoy greater access to the shared Community Green, and use it for gardening and recreation.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090625143531/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/stoneycreek/stoneycreek.htm Stoney Creek Apartments - Livermore, California]===
'''Stoney Creek Apartments''' were constructed in 1992 to address a lack of affordable housing in [[Livermore, California]]. Ten residential buildings share five courtyards, accessible from a small alleyway. Homes have front and back patios in addition to the shared courtyards, and neighbors have the opportunity to enjoy this shared outdoor space and experience a heightened sense of community. The inward-facing position of these patios allows parents to keep a watchful eye on children playing in the courtyard.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619124249/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/chandlersyard/chandlersyard.htm Chandlers Yard - Baltimore, Maryland]===
Located in the Federal Hill neighborhood of downtown Baltimore and hidden behind eleven narrow rowhouses, '''Chandler's Yard''' is a tree-shaded courtyard that was carved out of the backyards of the surrounding homes by developer Bill Struever who wanted to make living on the block more attractive to potential buyers. Struever convinced some of the property owners in this block to give up part of their backyards for this shared courtyard and pay a small construction fee. The result is a beautiful shared space for these residents, who enjoy a heightened sense of security and increased property values.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090218163042/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/villagehomes/villagehomes.htm Village Homes - Davis, California]===
The '''Village Homes''' development is situated on a sixty-acre parcel in suburban Davis, California. While home lots are smaller than the average for Davis, clusters of eight homes share common green spaces accessible from private backyards. In addition to these courtyards, Village Homes residents share two large parks, two vineyards, and numerous small orchards and community gardens. Gardens are irrigated by naturally-flowing creeks, which also serve as natural filters that eliminate the need for an expensive storm-water sewer system. Residents enjoy environmental and aesthetic benefits from their shared spaces, and the increased sense of community is evident; Village Homes residents on average know 40 neighbors, compared to an average of 17 acquaintances reported in a nearby traditional suburban development.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090630004718/http://www.communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/jacksonheights/jacksonheights.htm Jackson Heights - Queens, New York]===
For nearly nine decades, the historic neighborhood of '''Jackson Heights''' in Queens has maintained its fourteen block-long shared interior courtyards, and is considered to be the first "garden apartments" constructed in the United States. These spaces have helped to sustain the blocks' distinctive appeal since their development in the early decades of the last century. Over the years, Jackson Heights residents fought to hold on to their gardens and green spaces in the midst of a city where high property values create an intense pressure to develop any available open space.  The preservation of these shared spaces has increased both community pride and residential property values; if these inner courtyards had been developed, Jackson Heights property values would have dropped by one-third. In 1993, Jackson Heights was officially declared a historic district by the NYC Landmark Preservation Commission, furthering sense of place for this community.

===[http://www.communitygreens.org/st-francis-square St. Francis Square - San Francisco, California]===
A cooperative apartment community, '''St. Francis Square''' consists of 299 apartments wrapped around three shared, open spaces. These community greens are full of gardens, basketball courts, playgrounds, and quiet places to relax.  St. Francis Square was established as a limited equity co-operative apartment, although it converted to market rate ownership in 2004.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619124254/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/hopecommunity/hope.htm The Hope Community - Minneapolis, MN]===
Fifteen years ago, this community was situated in an area of Minneapolis plagued by urban flight and crime. Instrumental to the rehabilitation and renovation of this neighborhood is a local community development corporation, [http://www.hope-community.org/ Hope Community, Inc]. In the late 1980s, residents were selling their properties for one dollar because they had lost all value; this is when the Hope Community began purchasing houses in the hopes of developing affordable rental units clustered together on a single block. Today, nine rehabilitated houses abut community areas, a playground, and gardens. Property values are steadily increasing and the community itself is stabilizing. By following principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) and creating defensible space, '''the Hope Community''' has created a sense of shared ownership and community in a troubled urban area.

==Green alleys==
Something similar has taken place in various cities in North America, involving the [[greening]] of [[back lane]]s or [[alley]]s. This includes [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name=chicago /&gt; [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/docs/pmp/greenalleyhandbook_chicago.pdf "The Chicago Green Alley Handbook"] on the City of Seattle website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpl.org/green-alleys "Green Alleys"] on the [[Trust for Public Land]] website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ddot.dc.gov/publication/ddot-green-alley-project-fact-sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montréal]], Canada, who have started to reclaim their alleys from garbage and crime by [[greening]] the service lanes, or back ways, that run behind some houses.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;[http://dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Projects+and+Planning/Environment/Green+Alley+Projects "Green Alley Projects"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104000808/http://dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Projects%2Band%2BPlanning/Environment/Green%2BAlley%2BProjects |date=January 4, 2014 }} on the District of Columbia Department of Transportation website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://integratedalleys.tumblr.com/about "About Us"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104095801/http://integratedalleys.tumblr.com/about |date=January 4, 2014 }} on the ''Integrated Alleys'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Chicago]]''', [[Illinois]] has about {{convert|1900|mi|km}} of alleyways.&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;[http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/street/svcs/green_alleys.html "Service: Green Alleys"] on the City of Chicago website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Chicago Department of Transportation]] started converting conventional alleys which were paved with [[asphalt]] into so called Green Alleys. This program, called the Green Alley Program, is supposed to enable easier water runoff, as the alleyways in [[Chicago]] are not connected to the sewer system. With this program, the water will be able to seep through semi-permeable [[concrete]] or [[asphalt]] in which a colony of fungi and bacteria will establish itself. The bacteria will help breakup oils before the water is absorbed into the ground. The lighter color of the pavement will also reflect more light, making the area next to the alley cooler.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140103190427/http://www.screamtobegreen.com/2007/11/chicago-alleys-to-go-green/ "Chicago Alleys to Go Green"] on the ''Scream to be Green'' website&lt;/ref&gt; The greening of such alleys or laneways can also involve the planting of native plants to further absorb rain water and moderate temperature.

'''Eye2eye Software Ltd''' is a UK educational software publisher, which has systematically photographed Britain in 360 degree panoramas and stills, publishing the collection as the school resource and home reference '''''Eye2eye Britain'''''. Using a portable panoramic camera developed by themselves they have followed a 'points of interest' approach--taking panoramas on mountains, beaches, inside parliaments, factories, heritage sites, etc. rather than a street (car) based approach like [[Google street view]].&lt;ref name=eye2eyews&gt;[http://www.eye2eyesoft.co.uk Eye2eye Software Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Eye2eye Software Ltd, based in Cambridge, England, was founded in 1998 by Martin Clemoes, son of the late [[Peter Clemoes]]. Eye2eye Britain may have been partly inspired by 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]] developed by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]] where Martin worked before.

November 1998 - first edition of Eye2eye Britain (1.0) published. Supplied on CD-ROM, this mapped out Britain in 10,000 digital photos (no panoramas). Each photo is captioned and indexed using metadata, e.g. topic, date of heritage sites on a timeline, as well as map location.

1999 - Press interest in Eye2eye Britain.
* The Guardian started an article ''CoastBusters''&lt;ref&gt;Newnham, D: ''Coastbusters'', The Guardian, 20 February 1999&lt;/ref&gt; with the line "Ever had an urge to explore the entire coastline of mainland Britain? Put away that sou'wester and boot up your PC instead. For a round trip from John O'Groats to John O'Groats, its not rainwear you need, but software."
* Personal Computer World subtitled a review&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, N: ''Eye2eye Britain'', Personal Computer World, July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; with "A hugely impressive reference work that focuses on places of note in the British Isles".

January 2005 - First Panoramic Edition of Eye2eye Britain published. Added 950 full screen 360 by 105 degree panoramas, of England from Leeds in Yorkshire South, to 10,000 photos.

2005-06 - Consumer press critical, better feedback for education.
* Before 2007 launch of [[Google street view]], consumer press did not see appeal of exploring with panoramas - e.g. 5 May Computer Shopper review&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, M: ''Eye2eye Britain - Panorama Edition'', Computer Shopper, 17 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ending with "As no information is provided for people who want to visit the places featured in Eye2eye Britain, it's more suitable as an educational product than for use by day-trippers or holiday-makers."
* With whiteboards becoming widely used in UK schools, education press more enthusiastic, e.g. in 6 December Education Guardian article called ''Bring maps to life and save the world''.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, A: ''Bring maps to life and save the world'', Education Guardian, 12 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

January 2010 - Latest edition - Eye2eye Britain Panoramic 5 - published. 1,500 panoramas and 10,800 photos now cover mainland England, Wales and Scotland plus the largest of Britain's many islands.&lt;ref name=eye2eyews /&gt; Edition 5 also supports other school needs such as [[Virtual learning environment]].

==Panorama technology==
Eye2eye's approach to panoramic photography depends on two technologies they have developed themselves:&lt;ref name=eye2eyews /&gt;
# A portable panoramic camera system capturing a 360 by 105 degree  panorama in a single click.
# Panorama rendering software for the PC that syncs with screen refresh, rendering a perspective view frame for each screen refresh (e.g. 60 frames per second) for smooth panorama movement.

This technology has shaped their approach to panorama-photographing Britain. They have used their portable camera system to capture points of interest panoramas on foot, e.g. interiors, beaches, tower-top or mountain-top views. Single-click capture copes well with places with movement, e.g. crowds, waves on beach. This approach has the advantage of covering places of [inter]national interest, but the disadvantage of being labour-intensive, so the quantity of panoramas (currently around 1,500) is less than in car-based projects like [[Google Street View]]. Eye2eye have also been able to write captions and indexes for each panorama.

{{Other uses|Frame of reference (disambiguation)}}
{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals}}

In [[physics]], a '''frame of reference''' (or '''reference frame''') consists of an abstract [[coordinate system]] and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

In n dimensions, n+1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates]], a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance along each of the n coordinate axes.

In [[Theory of relativity|Einsteinian relativity]], reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation. In this context, the phrase often becomes "'''observational frame of reference'''" (or "'''observational reference frame'''"), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the [[coordinate time]], which does not correspond across different frames [[relative motion|moving relatively]] to each other. The situation thus differs from [[Galilean relativity]], where all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.

== Different aspects of "frame of reference" ==
The need to distinguish between the various meanings of "frame of reference" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in ''Cartesian frame of reference''. Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in ''[[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]]''. Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in ''[[Galilean frame of reference]]''. Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in ''macroscopic'' and ''microscopic frames of reference''.&lt;ref name=macroscopic&gt;The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic frames shows up, for example, in electromagnetism where [[Constitutive equation|constitutive relations]] of various time and length scales are used to determine the current and charge densities entering [[Maxwell's equations]]. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Electromagnetic and Optical Pulse Propagation 1: Spectral Representations in Temporally Dispersive Media |author=Kurt Edmund Oughstun |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=behRnNRiueAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame++electromagnetism|isbn=0-387-34599-X |year=2006 |publisher=Springer}}. These distinctions also appear in thermodynamics. See {{cite book |title=Classical Theory |author=Paul McEvoy |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj0wFIxn-PoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=macroscopic+frame#PPA205,M1 |isbn=1-930832-02-8 |year=2002 |publisher=MicroAnalytix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, the term ''observational frame of reference'' is used when emphasis is upon the ''state of motion'' rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a ''coordinate system'' may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs ''[[generalized coordinates]]'', ''[[normal modes]]'' or ''[[eigenvectors]]'', which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:

*An observational frame (such as an [[inertial frame]] or [[non-inertial frame of reference]]) is a physical concept related to state of motion.
*A coordinate system is a mathematical concept, amounting to a choice of language used to describe observations.&lt;ref name =Pontriagin&gt;

In very general terms, a coordinate system is a set of arcs ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (''t'') in a complex [[Lie group]]; see {{cite book |author=Lev Semenovich Pontri͡agin |title=L.S.

Less abstractly, a coordinate system in a space of n-dimensions is defined in terms of a basis set of vectors {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,… '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}; see {{cite book |title=Linear Algebra: A Geometric Approach |author1=Edoardo Sernesi |author2=J.

&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, an observer in an observational frame of reference can choose to employ any coordinate system (Cartesian, polar, curvilinear, generalized, …) to describe observations made from that frame of reference. A change in the choice of this coordinate system does not change an observer's state of motion, and so does not entail a change in the observer's ''observational'' frame of reference. This viewpoint can be found elsewhere as well.&lt;ref name=Johansson&gt;

where ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''etc.'' are the ''n'' Cartesian coordinates of the point. Given these functions,  '''coordinate surfaces''' are defined by the relations:

As is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a [[Model theory|mathematical construct]], part of an [[axiomatic system]]. There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, [[Lorentz transformation]]s and [[Galilean transformation]]s may be viewed as [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformation]]s.

General and specific topics of coordinate systems can be pursued following the [[#See also|See also]] links below.

===Observational frames of reference===
{{main|Inertial frame of reference}}

An '''observational frame of reference''', often referred to as a ''physical frame of reference'', a ''frame of reference'', or simply a ''frame'', is a physical concept related to an [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized ''only by its state of motion''.&lt;ref name=Kubar&gt;See {{cite book |author1=Arvind Kumar |author2=Shrish Barve |page=115 |title=How and Why in Basic Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=czlUPz38MOQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22characterized+only+by+its+state+of+motion%22+inauthor:Kumar|isbn=81-7371-420-7 |year= 2003 |publisher =Orient Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an ''observer'' and a ''frame''. According to this view, a ''frame'' is an ''observer'' plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran.&lt;ref name=Doran&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9780521715959&amp;qt=owc_search |title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists |author1=Chris Doran |author2=Anthony Lasenby |page= §5.2.2, p. 133 |isbn=978-0-521-71595-9 |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity.&lt;ref name=Moller&gt;For example, Møller states: "Instead of Cartesian coordinates we can obviously just as well employ general curvilinear coordinates for the fixation of points in physical space.…we shall now introduce general "curvilinear" coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; in four-space…." {{cite book |author=C.

|page=211 |isbn=0-8247-1749-X |year=1983 |publisher=CRC Press   }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

There are two types of observational reference frame: [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial]] and [[non-inertial reference frame|non-inertial]]. An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In [[special relativity]] these frames are related by [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which are parametrized by [[rapidity]]. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that [[Newton's first law]] holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a [[free particle]] travels in a [[straight line]] at constant [[speed]], or is at rest. These frames are related by [[Galilean transformation]]s. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of [[Representation theory|representations]] of the [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Poincaré group]] and of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]].

In contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which [[fictitious force]]s must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the [[Coriolis force]], [[centrifugal force]], and [[gravitational force]]. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)

===Measurement apparatus===
A further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the [[metrology|measurement apparatus]] (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see [[measurement problem]]).

In physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the [[laboratory frame]] or simply "lab frame." An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the [[center of momentum frame]] "COM frame" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.

In this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect [[metrology]] that is connected to the nature of the [[vacuum]], and uses [[atomic clocks]] that operate according to the [[standard model]] and that must be corrected for [[gravitational time dilation]].&lt;ref name= Wolfson&gt;{{cite book |author=  Richard Wolfson |title=Simply Einstein |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUJWKdlFKeQC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;dq=%22gravitational+time+dilation+%22|page=216 |isbn=0-393-05154-4 |publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co. |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[second]], [[meter]] and [[kilogram]]).

In fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.&lt;ref name=Rizzi&gt;See {{cite book |title=Relativity in rotating frames |page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGrlCLkkIgC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=centrifugal+%22+%22+relativity+OR+relativistic#PPA33,M1

=== Simple example ===
[[File:Two reference frames.PNG|thumb|320px|Figure 1: Two cars moving at different but constant velocities observed from stationary inertial frame ''S'' attached to the road and moving inertial frame ''S′'' attached to the first car.]]
Consider a situation common in everyday life. Two cars travel along a road, both moving at constant velocities. See Figure 1. At some particular moment, they are separated by 200 metres. The car in front is travelling at 22 metres per second and the car behind is travelling at 30 metres per second. If we want to find out how long it will take the second car to catch up with the first, there are three obvious "frames of reference" that we could choose.

First, we could observe the two cars from the side of the road. We define our "frame of reference" ''S'' as follows. We stand on the side of the road and start a stop-clock at the exact moment that the second car passes us, which happens to be when they are a distance ''d'' =  200 m apart. Since neither of the cars is accelerating, we can determine their positions by the following formulas, where &lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position in meters of car one after time ''t'' in seconds and &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of car two after time ''t''.

:&lt;math&gt; x_1(t)= d + v_1 t = 200\ + \ 22t\ ; \quad x_2(t)=  v_2 t = 30t &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that these formulas predict at ''t'' = 0 s the first car is 200 m down the road and the second car is right beside us, as expected. We want to find the time at which &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we set &lt;math&gt;x_1=x_2&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, that is:

:&lt;math&gt;200 + 22 t = 30t \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;8t = 200 \quad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 25 \quad \mathrm{seconds}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, we could choose a frame of reference ''S′'' situated in the first car. In this case, the first car is stationary and the second car is approaching from behind at a speed of {{math|1=''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 8 m / s}}. In order to catch up to the first car, it will take a time of {{math|1={{sfrac|''d''|''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{sfrac|200|8}} s}}, that is, 25 seconds, as before. Note how much easier the problem becomes by choosing a suitable frame of reference. The third possible frame of reference would be attached to the second car. That example resembles the case just discussed, except the second car is stationary and the first car moves backward towards it at 8 m / s.

It would have been possible to choose a rotating, accelerating frame of reference, moving in a complicated manner, but this would have served to complicate the problem unnecessarily. It is also necessary to note that one is able to convert measurements made in one coordinate system to another. For example, suppose that your watch is running five minutes fast compared to the local standard time. If you know that this is the case, when somebody asks you what time it is, you are able to deduct five minutes from the time displayed on your watch in order to obtain the correct time. The measurements that an observer makes about a system depend therefore on the observer's frame of reference (you might say that the bus arrived at 5 past three, when in fact it arrived at three).

===Additional example===
[[File:Wikipage pic.PNG|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Simple-minded frame-of-reference example]]
For a simple example involving only the orientation of two observers, consider two people standing, facing each other on either side of a north-south street. See Figure 2. A car drives past them heading south.  For the person facing east, the car was moving towards the right.  However, for the person facing west, the car was moving toward the left.  This discrepancy is because the two people used two different frames of reference from which to investigate this system.

For a more complex example involving observers in relative motion, consider Alfred, who is standing on the side of a road watching a car drive past him from left to right.  In his frame of reference, Alfred defines the spot where he is standing as the origin, the road as the x-axis and the direction in front of him as the positive y-axis.  To him, the car moves along the ''x'' axis with some [[velocity]] ''v'' in the positive x-direction. Alfred's frame of reference is considered an [[inertial frame of reference]] because he is not accelerating (ignoring effects such as Earth's rotation and gravity).

Now consider Betsy, the person driving the car. Betsy, in choosing her frame of reference, defines her location as the origin, the direction to her right as the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction in front of her as the positive ''y''-axis.  In this frame of reference, it is Betsy who is stationary and the world around her that is moving – for instance, as she drives past Alfred, she observes him moving with velocity ''v'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  If she is driving north, then north is the positive ''y''-direction; if she turns east, east becomes the positive ''y''-direction.

Finally, as an example of non-inertial observers, assume Candace is accelerating her car.  As she passes by him, Alfred measures her [[acceleration]] and finds it to be ''a'' in the negative x-direction.  Assuming Candace's acceleration is constant, what acceleration does Betsy measure?  If Betsy's velocity ''v'' is constant, she is in an inertial frame of reference, and she will find the acceleration to be the same as Alfred in her frame of reference, ''a'' in the negative ''y''-direction.  However, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction (in other words, slowing down), she will find Candace's acceleration to be ''a′'' = ''a'' − ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction - a smaller value than Alfred has measured.  Similarly, if she is accelerating at rate ''A'' in the positive y-direction (speeding up), she will observe Candace's acceleration as ''a′'' = ''a'' + ''A'' in the negative ''y''-direction – a larger value than Alfred's measurement.

Frames of reference are especially important in [[special relativity]], because when a frame of reference is moving at some significant fraction of the speed of light, then the flow of time in that frame does not necessarily apply in another frame. The speed of light is considered to be the only true constant between moving frames of reference.

===Remarks===
{{see also|Special theory of relativity|General theory of relativity}}
It is important to note some assumptions made above about the various inertial frames of reference. Newton, for instance, employed universal time, as explained by the following example. Suppose that you own two clocks, which both tick at exactly the same rate. You synchronize them so that they both display exactly the same time. The two clocks are now separated and one clock is on a fast moving train, traveling at constant velocity towards the other. According to Newton, these two clocks will still tick at the same rate and will both show the same time. Newton says that the rate of time as measured in one frame of reference should be the same as the rate of time in another. That is, there exists a "universal" time and all other times in all other frames of reference will run at the same rate as this universal time irrespective of their position and velocity. This concept of time and simultaneity was later generalized by Einstein in his [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) where he developed transformations between inertial frames of reference based upon the universal nature of physical laws and their economy of expression ([[Lorentz transformations]]).

It is also important to note that the definition of inertial reference frame can be extended beyond three-dimensional Euclidean space. Newton's assumed a Euclidean space, but [[general relativity]] uses a more general geometry. As an example of why this is important, let us consider the [[geometry]] of an ellipsoid. In this geometry, a "free" particle is defined as one at rest or traveling at constant speed on a [[geodesic]] path. Two free particles may begin at the same point on the surface, traveling with the same constant speed in different directions. After a length of time, the two particles collide at the opposite side of the ellipsoid. Both "free" particles traveled with a constant speed, satisfying the definition that  no forces were acting. No acceleration occurred and so Newton's first law held true. This means that the particles were in inertial frames of reference. Since no forces were acting, it was the geometry of the situation which caused the two particles to meet each other again. In a similar way, it is now common to describe&lt;ref name="caveatondescription"&gt;That is, both descriptions are equivalent and can be used as needed.  This equivalence does not hold outside of general relativity, e.g., in [[entropic gravity]].&lt;/ref&gt; that we exist in a four-dimensional geometry known as [[spacetime]]. In this picture, the curvature of this 4D space is responsible for the way in which two bodies with mass are drawn together even if no forces are acting. This curvature of spacetime replaces the force known as gravity in Newtonian mechanics and special relativity.

==Non-inertial frames==
{{main|Fictitious force|Non-inertial frame|Rotating frame of reference}}
Here the relation between inertial and non-inertial observational frames of reference is considered. The basic difference between these frames is the need in non-inertial frames for fictitious forces, as described below.

An accelerated frame of reference is often delineated as being the "primed" frame, and all variables that are dependent on that frame are notated with primes, e.g. ''x′'', ''y′'', ''a′''.

The vector from the origin of an inertial reference frame to the origin of an accelerated reference frame is commonly notated as  '''R'''.  Given a point of interest that exists in both frames, the vector from the inertial origin to the point is called '''r''', and the vector from the accelerated origin to the point is called '''r′'''.
From the geometry of the situation, we get
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf R + \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the first and second derivatives of this with respect to time, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf v = \mathbf V + \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf A + \mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;
where '''V''' and '''A''' are the velocity and acceleration of the accelerated system with respect to the inertial system  and '''v''' and '''a''' are the velocity and acceleration of the point of interest with respect to the inertial frame.

These equations allow transformations between the two coordinate systems; for example, we can now write [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s second law|Newton's second law]] as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = m\mathbf a = m\mathbf A + m\mathbf a'&lt;/math&gt;

When there is accelerated motion due to a force being exerted there is manifestation of inertia. If an electric car designed to recharge its battery system when decelerating is switched to braking, the batteries are recharged, illustrating the physical strength of manifestation of inertia. However, the manifestation of inertia does not prevent acceleration (or deceleration), for manifestation of inertia occurs in response to change in velocity due to a force. Seen from the perspective of a rotating frame of reference the manifestation of inertia appears to exert a force (either in [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal]] direction, or in a direction orthogonal to an object's motion, the [[Coriolis effect]]).

A common sort of accelerated reference frame is a frame that is both rotating and translating (an example is a frame of reference attached to a CD which is playing while the player is carried). This arrangement leads to the equation (see [[Fictitious force]] for a derivation):

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a = \mathbf a' + \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' + 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' + \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') + \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

or, to solve for the acceleration in the accelerated frame,

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a' = \mathbf a - \dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r' - 2\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v' - \boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r') - \mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying through by the mass ''m'' gives
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F' = \mathbf F_\mathrm{physical} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} + \mathbf F'_\mathrm{centripetal} - m\mathbf A_0&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Euler} = -m\dot{\boldsymbol\omega} \times \mathbf r'&lt;/math&gt; ([[Euler force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{Coriolis} = -2m\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf v'&lt;/math&gt;  ([[Coriolis force]])

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F'_\mathrm{centrifugal} = -m\boldsymbol\omega \times (\boldsymbol\omega \times \mathbf r')=m(\omega^2 \mathbf r'- (\boldsymbol\omega \cdot \mathbf r')\boldsymbol\omega) &lt;/math&gt;  ([[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2494">'''Geographic contiguity''' is the characteristic in [[geography]] of political or geographical land divisions, as a group, not being interrupted by other land or water. Such divisions are referred to as being ''contiguous.''  In the [[United States]], for example, the "[[Contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]]" excludes [[Hawaii]] and [[Alaska]], which do not share borders with other [[U.S. state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html Wetlands Metadata for the Lower 48 States, US Fish and Wildlife Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105143231/http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html |date=5 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of geographical contiguity might include the "contiguous European Union" excluding member states such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Malta and Cyprus (these being non-contiguous), or the "contiguous United Kingdom" referring to all parts of the country excepting Northern Ireland (it being geographically non-contiguous).

Two or more contiguous [[Municipality|municipalities]] can be consolidated into one, or one municipality can consist of many noncontiguous elements. For example, the [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act]] allows the commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] to merge contiguous municipalities to reduce [[financial distress]].

Geographic contiguity is important in [[biology]], especially [[range (biology)|animal ranges]]. For a particular species, its habitat may be a '[[contiguous range]]', or it might be broken, requiring periodic, typically seasonal migrations (see: [[Disjunct distribution]]). The same concept of contiguous range is true for human transportation studies in an attempt to understand census geography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&amp;REFCODE=1&amp;LANG=E Census Metropolitan Area, Statistics Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217115704/http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&amp;REFCODE=1&amp;LANG=E |date=17 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also comes into play with electoral geography and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/217 The Electoral Geography of Weimar Germany: Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses of Protestant Support for the Nazi Party, by John O'Loughlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geohash-36''' [[Geocoding|geocode]] is an [[opensource]] compression algorithm for world coordinate data. It was developed as a variation of the [[Irish Geocodes|OpenPostcode]] format developed as a candidate [[geolocation]] [[Postal codes in the Republic of Ireland|postcode for the Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DCENR Postcodes|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Communications/Postal/Postcodes.htm|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is similar in function to the original [[public domain]] [[Geohash]] code. It is calculated differently and uses a more concise [[base 36]] (or rather [[radix]] 36) representation rather than the base 32 representation used by Geohash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geohash Tips &amp; Tricks|url=http://geohash.org/site/tips.html|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coding Method ==
Designed for [[URL]]s and electronic storage and communication rather than human memory and conversation, it is case-sensitive, using a 36 character alphabet: "23456789bBCdDFgGhHjJKlLMnNPqQrRtTVWX".

Characters are chosen to avoid [[vowel]]s, vowel-like numbers, character confusion, and to use lowercase characters which are generally distinct from their uppercase equivalents in standard typefaces.

The code can be of varying length and thus precision. Each character represents a further subdivision in a 6 by 6 grid - starting at the North-West (top-left) coordinate and continuing, row by row, to the South-East (bottom-right). Neighbouring coordinates have largely similar encodings and generally vary at the rightmost characters only; however extreme [[edge cases]] exist where neighbouring coordinates are on opposing sides of a grid division. Codes sort logically but not in ordinary coordinate order.

Without vowels, unintended English-language words are avoided that may appear in the original Geohash code. As vowels are not used, an altitude component of encoded meters is optional with a prefixing "A" character (below sea-level prefixed by a lowercase "a").

An optional [[checksum]] is represented using the lowercase English alphabet. It confirms the code as a Geohash-36 and provides a check for incorrect or transposed characters. It is calculated as [[modulo operator|modulus]] 26 of the sum of each character value (the altitude delimiters of "A" or "a" are valued at zero) multiplied by its position reading from left to right.

== Efficiency ==
Compared to storing GPS coordinates using the [[Decimal data type|Decimal]] datatype in [[SQL]] the Geohash-36 does not save significantly on database bytes. Using DECIMAL(8,5) and DECIMAL(7,5) requires 10-bytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MSDN "decimal and numeric (Transact-SQL)"|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187746.aspx|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An equivalent 10-bytes of the Geohash-36 code is accurate to approximately a 6th of square meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geohash-36 |url=http://www.openpostcode.org/other-codes/geohash-36 |accessdate=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227195936/http://www.openpostcode.org/other-codes/geohash-36 |archivedate=27 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Statue of Liberty]], at coordinates 40.689167, -74.044444, is encoded as 9LVB4BH89g-m. The reverse decoding equates to 40.68916''8'',-74.044445.

The [[Shard London Bridge|Shard]] building, London, at coordinates 51.504444, -0.086667 is encoded as bdrdC26BqH-m (decodes to 51.504444,-0.08666''6''), or may be successfully shorted to bdrdC26B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geo36.org|url=http://geo36.org/bdrdC26BqH-m|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''Global Map''' is a set of digital maps that accurately cover the whole globe to express the status of global environment. It is developed through the cooperation of [[National mapping agency|National Geospatial Information Authorities]] (NGIAs) in the world. An initiative to develop Global Map under [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]], the Global Mapping Project, was advocated in 1992 by Ministry of Construction, Japan (MOC) at the time (the current [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan]]-MLIT).

Global Map is digital [[geospatial information]] in 1&amp;nbsp;km [[Optical resolution|resolution]] which satisfies the following conditions:
# Covering the whole land area of the [[globe]]
# In consistent specifications
# Easily accessible by anyone in marginal cost
The global geospatial information developed as Global Map mainly consists of the following thematic layers:
* [[Transportation]] 
* [[Border|Boundary]] 
* [[Drainage]] 
* Population Centers 
* [[Elevation]] 
* [[Vegetation]] （Percent Tree Cover） 
* [[Land Cover]] 
* [[Land Use]]

== History of the Global Mapping Project ==
Since the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in 1972, global environmental challenges have been recognized as an issue which is common to humankind. “The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the [[Earth Summit]])” in Brazil in 1992 adopted “An action plan of humankind for sustainable development: [[Agenda 21]].” Agenda 21 describes in many parts the importance of information for decision-making to appropriately cope with global environmental challenges. Especially geospatial information is regarded to be critical.

In response to the objectives of Agenda 21 and in recognition of the need for further contribution to the development of geospatial information, the MOC at the time (the current MLIT) advocated, in the same year, the Global Mapping Project, an international cooperation initiative to develop global geospatial information to understand the present status and changes of global environment. This concept was presented at the Fifth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for the Americas in New York in 1993. At the same time, resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
calling for the promotion of the development of global geospatial data was adopted at this conference. Following this conference, a similar resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was adopted at Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific in Beijing in 1994.
 
In 1996, International Steering Committee for Global Mapping (ISCGM), which consists of heads or its equivalents of NGIAs, was established to promote the Global Mapping Project. Thus the mechanism for the international promotion was formed. The [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]] (GSI) has been serving as the secretariat of the ISCGM. In the following year, in 1997, which was five years after the Earth Summit, the nineteenth [[United Nations General Assembly#Special sessions|special session of the United Nations General Assembly]] (19th UNGASS) was held. At the paragraph 112 of the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21

|accessdate=2012-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the 19th UNGASS, importance of a supportive environment to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection and processing, especially in developing countries, to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues was mentioned along with the description mentioning the significance of international cooperation, including global mapping, as a means to develop the supportive environment.

As a result of such movement, In 1998, a recommendatory letter to participate in the Global Mapping Project was sent from the [[United Nations]] to NGIAs of respective countries in the world.

Further, at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg Summit) held in 2002, global mapping was included in the Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Batura valley Passu.jpg|right|thumb|[[Muchu Chhish]] at far left is the tallest peak on earth that is not off limits to climbers that remains still unclimbed as of 2018.]]
An '''unclimbed mountain''' is a mountain peak that has yet to be climbed to the top. Determining which unclimbed peak is highest is often a matter of controversy. In some parts of the world, surveying and mapping are still unreliable, and there are no comprehensive records of the routes of explorers, mountaineers and local inhabitants. In some cases, even modern ascents by larger parties have been poorly documented and, with no universally recognized listing, the best that can be achieved in determining the world's highest unclimbed peaks is somewhat speculative. Most sources indicate that [[Gangkhar Puensum]] ({{convert|7570|m|ft}}) in [[Bhutan]] or on the Bhutan-[[China]] border is the tallest mountain in the world that has yet to be fully summited. Gangkhar Puensum has been off limits to climbers since 1994 when Bhutan prohibited all mountaineering above {{convert|6000|m|ft|abbr=on}} due to spiritual/religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=nuwer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nuwer|first1=Rachel|title=The mountains we have never climbed|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140703-the-last-mountains-to-climb|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 February 2018|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unclimbed mountains are sometimes referred to as "virgin peaks". Many virgin peaks exist because the mountain is unreachable, due to either geographic isolation or political instability. Some mountains remain off limits due to religious beliefs of a country or region that hold such mountains are sacred and should remain inviolate. Additionally, since the endeavor to scale taller mountains of the world is usually a major undertaking, lesser peaks, while still very formidable, simply get less attention than the taller ones, and instead these taller peaks are summited by parties following a new route or perhaps during the winter when conditions are generally more treacherous.&lt;ref name=nuwer/&gt;

==Challenges in definition==
===Definition of a mountain===
[[File:prominence_definition.svg|right|thumb|250px|Figure 1. Vertical arrows show the topographic prominence of three peaks on an island. The dashed horizontal lines show the lowest contours that do not encircle higher peaks. Curved arrows point from a peak to its parent.]]
Many mountains, in addition to their highest point or peak, will also have subsidiary subpeaks. Generally, the [[topographic prominence]] of a peak or subpeak, as well as the general topography, all come into consideration when determining whether such apexes are considered to be independent peaks or subpeaks. Although objective criteria have been proposed for distinguishing peaks from subpeaks, there is no widely agreed standard. In 1994, the [[International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation]] (UIAA) classified 82 mountain peaks in the [[Alps]] whose summits were at least {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level and with at least {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} of topographic prominence over any adjacent [[mountain pass]] or [[col]], as a distinct peak.&lt;ref name="uiaa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountain Classification|url=http://www.theuiaa.org/mountaineering/mountain-classification/|publisher=UIAA-International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verification of unclimbed status===
It can be difficult sometimes to determine whether or not a mountain peak has been fully summited. Long before modern mountaineering commenced in the middle of the 19th century, evidence indicates that people did indeed travel up to the summits or near to the summits of major mountain peaks. Archaeological excavations in the [[Andes]] have shown that humans travelled up to {{convert|6739|m|ft|abbr=on}} in pre-historic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reinhard|first1=Johan|last2=Ceruti|first2=Constanza|title=Inca Rituals and Sacred Mountains: A Study of the World's Highest Archaeological Sites|date=2010|publisher=Institute of Archaeology Press|isbn=9781931745765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent settlements as high as {{convert|4500|m|abbr=on}} were established as long as 12,000&amp;nbsp;years ago in the Andes as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Oldest High-Altitude Human Settlement Discovered in Andes|url=https://www.livescience.com/48419-high-altitude-setllement-peru.html|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Greater Himalaya region, [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]], in Tibet, sitting at {{convert|3650|m|abbr=on}} has been permanently occupied since the 7th century and many smaller settlements across the Greater Himalaya thrive at elevations exceeding {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=Nicholas|title=Where are the world's highest cities?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/08/where-world-highest-cities-altitude|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With humans living at high elevations for many millennia, nearby peaks to such settlements may or may not have been summited at some point in the past. However, many regions away from settlements may have never before been explored, especially since some high peaks in the [[Greater Ranges]] are so remote that they were unknown to local inhabitants when first sighted by European explorers.

The worlds third tallest peak, [[Kangchenjunga]], has been summited a number of times, but after the first climbers of the peak agreed to honor the wishes of locals and not set foot on the topmost part of the mountain, succeeding mountaineering parties may have followed this tradition. Similarly, [[Nanda Devi]] has also been climbed but the topmost summit was not ascended and the primary summit is now off limits to climbers. [[Machapuchare]] had only one summit attempt back in 1957 when climbers came within {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}} of the summit; Nepal then banned future attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Four Forbidden Mountains in the Himalayas|url=http://climbreport.net/4-forbidden-mountains-in-the-himalayas/|publisher=Climb Report|accessdate=16 March 2018|date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gangkhar Puensum==
[[File:Gangkhar puensum summit.JPG|thumb|Summit of [[Gangkhar Puensum]] from Gophu La pass, [[Bhutan]]]]
The mountain most widely claimed to be the highest unclimbed mountain in the world in terms of [[elevation]] is [[Gangkhar Puensum]] ({{convert|7570|m|ft|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name="TI_2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tsuguyasu Itami|title=Gankarpunzum &amp; First Ascent Of Liankang Kangri|journal=Japanese Alpine News|date=October 2001|volume=1|url=http://www.jac.or.jp/english/jan/vol1/GANKARPUNZUM.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in [[Bhutan]], on or near the border with [[People's Republic of China|China]]. In Bhutan, the climbing of mountains higher than {{convert|6000|m|ft|abbr=on}} has been prohibited since 1994. The rationale for this prohibition is based on local customs that consider this and similar peaks to be the sacred homes of protective deities and spirits, and the lack of high-altitude rescue resources from any locale closer than [[India]]. The prohibition was further expanded in 2003 when mountaineering of any kind was disallowed entirely within Bhutan. Gangkhar Puensum will likely remain unclimbed so long as the government of Bhutan prohibits it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jennings|first1=Ken|title=What's The World's Highest Mountain That's Never Been Climbed|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-12-14/whats-the-worlds-highest-mountain-thats-never-been-climbed|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highest unclimbed non-prohibited peak==
[[File:Kabru2.jpg|left|thumb|A secondary summit of Kabru is one of the tallest that still remain unclimbed]]
It is unclear which is the highest unclimbed non-prohibited mountain. While some recognize only peaks with {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} of topographical prominence as individual summits, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation uses a {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} as the cutoff for determining individual summits. Based on the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation's criteria, [[Muchu Chhish]] ({{convert|7452|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a prominence of {{convert|263|m|ft|abbr=on}}) in Pakistan is currently the world's tallest that has not been climbed even though it is legal to do so. Other unclimbed summits include one on the massif known as [[Kabru]] ({{convert|7318|m|abbr=on}} prominence c. {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}}), [[Labuche Kang III/East]] ({{convert|7250|m|ft|abbr=on}}) with prominence of {{convert|570|m|abbr=on}} and [[Karjiang]] ({{convert|7221|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a prominence of {{convert|895|m|ft|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name="newcomb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newcomb|first1=Tim|title=7 of the Tallest Unclimbed Mountains in the World|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/g13537785/7-of-the-tallest-unclimbed-mountains-in-the-world/|publisher=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Most prominent unclimbed peak==
Unclimbed candidates with high [[topographic prominence]] are by definition independent mountains, but some have relatively modest elevations. With such peaks there is a greater possibility of undocumented ascents, perhaps occurring long ago.

[[Sauyr Zhotasy]] ({{convert|3840|m|ft|abbr=on}}, prominence of {{convert|3252|m|ft|abbr=on}}), the highpoint in the [[Saur Mountains|Saur Range]] on the border between [[Kazakhstan]] and [[China]], and [[Mount Siple]] ({{convert|3110|m|ft|abbr=on}}, prominence of {{convert|3110|m|ft|abbr=on}}) on [[Siple Island]] off the coast of [[Antarctica]], have no record of successful ascents, but the unclimbed status of each of these peaks is difficult to confirm.&lt;ref name=newcomb/&gt;

In general, an '''imaginary line''' is any sort of [[line (geometry)|geometric line]] that has only an [[abstraction|abstract]] definition and does not physically exist. In fact, is used to identify a [[map]] properly.

As a [[geography|geographical]] concept, an imaginary line may serve as an arbitrary division, such as a [[border]]. It may also be a standardized marking that serves as a measurement or line of reference, such as a [[circle of latitude]] or the [[Prime Meridian]].

[[File:Mining claim, South Yuba River (cropped).jpg|thumb|Claim at the [[Yuba River|South Yuba River]]]]
A '''land claim''' is a legal declaration of desired control over areas of property, including bodies of water. The phrase is usually only used with respect to disputed or unresolved land claims. Some types of land claims include [[aboriginal land claim]]s, [[Territorial claims of Antarctica|Antarctic land claims]], and post-colonial land claims.

Land claims is sometimes used as a term when referring to disputed territories like [[Western Sahara]] or to refer to the claims of displaced persons. 

In the [[Colonialism|colonial]] times of the United States American men could claim a piece of land for themselves and the claim has different level of merit according to the [[de facto]] conditions:
# claim without any action on the ground
# claim with (movable) property of the claimant on the ground
# claim with the claimant visiting the land
# claim with claimant living on the land.

Today, only small areas of unclaimed land remain, yet large plots of land with little economical value (e.g., in Alaska) can still be bought for very low prices. Also, in certain parts of the world, land can still be [[Land_tenure#Modes_of_ownership_and_tenure|obtained]] by making productive use of it.

==Mining claim (United States)==
A '''mining claim''' is the claim of the right to extract minerals from a tract of public land. In the United States, the practice began with the [[California gold rush]] of 1849. In the absence of effective government, the miners in each new mining camp made up their own rules, and chose to essentially adopt Mexican mining law then in effect in California. The Mexican law gave the right to mine to the first one to discover the mineral deposit and begin mining it. The area that could be claimed by one person was limited to that which could be mined by a single individual or a small group.

The US system of mining claims is an application of the legal theory of ''[[prior appropriation]]'', by which public property is granted to the first one to put it to beneficial use.  Other applications of appropriation theory were the [[Homestead Act]], which granted public land to farmers, and water rights in the west.

The California miners spread the concept of mining claims to other mining districts all over the western United States.  The US Congress legalized the practice in 1866, and amended it in the [[Mining Act of 1872]].  All land in the [[Public_domain_(land)|public domain]], that is, federal land whose use has not been restricted by the government to some specific purpose, was subject to being claimed.  The mining law has been changed numerous times, but still retains some features similar to those settled on by the California [[California_Gold_Rush#Forty-niners|49ers]].

The concept was also used in other countries, for example during the [[Australian gold rushes]] which occurred at a similar time starting from the 1850s, and included similar groups of people including miners that migrated from the American gold rushes. The [[Oriental Claims]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] are one example of this.

===Staking a claim===
[[File:Mining claim corner Blue Ribbon Mine Alaska.jpg|thumb|Corner post of the claim of the Blue Ribbon Mine in Alaska]]

'''Staking a claim''' involves first the discovery of a valuable mineral in quantities that a "prudent man" (the Prudent Man Rule) would invest time and expenses to recover. Next, marking the claim boundaries, typically with wooden posts or capped steel posts, which must be four feet tall, or stone cairns, which must be three feet tall. Finally, filing a claim with both the land management agency (USFS or BLM), and the local county registrar.

There are four main types of mining claims: 
# Placer (minerals free of the local bedrock, and deposited in benches or streams) 
# Lode (minerals in place in the mother rock), 
# Tunnel (a location for a proposed tunnel which claims all veins discovered during the driving of it) 
# Millsite (a maximum five acre site for processing ore) 

A mining claim always starts out as an '''unpatented claim'''. The owner of an unpatented claim must continue mining or exploration activities on an unpatented claim, or he may pay a fee to the land management agency by September 1 of each year, or it is considered abandoned and becomes null. Activities on unpatented claims must be restricted to those necessary to mining. A '''patented claim''' is one for which the federal government has issued a ''patent'' (deed). To obtain a patent, the owner of a mining claim must prove to the federal government that the claim contains locatable minerals that can be extracted at a profit. A patented claim can be used for any purpose desired by the owner, just like any other real estate. However, Congress has ceased funding for the patenting process, so at this time a claim cannot be patented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13382">[[Image:Light characteristics.svg|thumb|400px|Symbols and abbreviations for light characteristics]]
A '''light characteristic''' is a graphic and text description of a navigational light sequence or colour displayed on a [[nautical chart]] or in a [[Light List]] with the chart symbol for a [[lighthouse]], [[lightvessel]], [[buoy]] or [[sea mark]] with a [[light]] on it. The graphic indicates how the real light may be identified when looking at its actual light output type or sequence. Different lights use different colours, frequencies and light patterns, so mariners can identify which light they are seeing.

==Abbreviations==
While light characteristics can be described in prose, e.g. "Flashing white every three seconds", lists of lights and navigation chart annotations use abbreviations. The abbreviation notation is slightly different from one light list to another, with dots added or removed, but it usually follows a pattern similar to the following (see the chart to the right for examples).
* An abbreviation of the type of light, e.g. "Fl." for flashing, "F." for fixed.
* The color of the light, e.g. "W" for white, "G" for green, "R" for red, "Y" for yellow. If no color is given, a white light is generally implied.
* The cycle period, e.g. "10s" for ten seconds.
* Additional parameters are sometimes added:
:* The height of the light above the chart datum for height (usually based on [[tide|high water]]). e.g. 15m for 15 metres.
:* The range in which the light is visible, e.g. "10M" for 10 [[nautical mile]]s.

An example of a complete light characteristic is "Gp Oc(3) W 10s 15m 10M". This indicates that the light is a ''group occulting light'' in which a group of three eclipses repeat every 10 seconds; the light is white; the light is 15 metres above the chart datum  and is visible for {{convert|10|nmi|km}}.

==Light patterns==
===Fixed light===
A fixed light, abbreviated "F", is a continuous and steady light.

===Flashing light===
A flashing light is a rhythmic light in which the total duration of the light in each period is clearly shorter than the total duration of the darkness and in which the flashes of light are all of equal duration. It is most commonly used for a single-flashing light which exhibits only single flashes which are repeated at regular intervals, in which case it is abbreviated simply as "Fl". It can also be used with a group of flashes which are regularly repeated, in which case the abbreviation is "Fl.(2)" or "Gr Fl.(2)", for a group of two flashes. Another possibility is a composite group, in which successive groups in the period have different numbers of flashes, e.g. "Fl. (2+1)" indicates a group of two flashes, followed by one flash.

A specific case sometimes used&lt;ref name=LoL/&gt; is when the flashes are longer than two seconds. Such a light is sometimes denoted "long flashing" with the abbreviation "L.Fl".

If the frequency of flashes is large (more than 30&lt;ref name=LLQuick&gt;''Light List'' states at one point that only "frequency not exceeding 30 flashes per minute" is considered "Flashing", yet at another that only "a rate of 60 flashes per minute" is considered "Quick", leaving the interval in-between undefined.&lt;/ref&gt; or 50&lt;ref name=LoL&gt;''List of Lights''&lt;/ref&gt; per minute) the light is denoted as a "quick light", see below.

===Occulting light===

An occulting light is a rhythmic light in which the duration of light in each period is longer than the total duration of darkness. In other words, it is the opposite to a flashing light where the total duration of darkness is longer than the duration of light. It has the appearance of flashing off, rather than flashing on. Like a flashing light, it can be used for a single occulting light that exhibits only a single period of darkness or the periods of darkness can be grouped and repeated at regular intervals (abbreviated "Oc"), a group (Oc (3)) or a composite group (Oc (2+1)).

===Isophase light===
An isophase light, abbreviated "Iso", is a light which has dark and light periods of equal length. The prefix derives from the Greek ''iso-'' meaning "same".

===Quick light===
A quick light, abbreviated "Q", is a special case of a flashing light with a large frequency (more than 30&lt;ref name=LLQuick/&gt; or 50&lt;ref name=LoL/&gt; per minute). If the sequence of flashes is interrupted by regularly repeated eclipses of constant and long duration, the light is denoted "interrupted quick", abbreviated "I.Q". 

Group notation similar to flashing and occulting lights is also sometimes&lt;ref name=LoL/&gt; used (e.g. Q.(9)). 

Another distinction sometimes&lt;ref name=LoL/&gt; made is between quick (more than 50 and less than 80 flashes per minute), very quick (more than 80 and less than 160 flashes per minutes, abbreviated "V.Q") and ultra quick (no less than 160 flashes per minute, abbreviate "U.Q"). This can be combined with notations for interruptions, e.g. I.U.Q. for interrupted ultra quick, or grouping, e.g. V.Q.(9) for a very quick group of nine flashes. Quick characteristics can also be followed by other characteristics, e.g. V.Q.(6)+L.Fl. for a very quick group of six flashes, followed by a long flash.

===Morse code===
A Morse code light is light in which appearances of light of two clearly different durations (dots and dashes) are grouped to represent a character or characters in the [[Morse Code]]. For example, "Mo. (A)" is a light in which in each period light is shown for a short period (dot) followed by a long period (dash), the Morse Code for "A".

===Fixed and flashing===
A fixed and flashing light, abbreviated "F. Fl", is a light in which a fixed low intensity light is combined with a flashing high intensity light.

===Alternating===
An alternating light, abbreviated "Al", is a light which shows alternating colors. For example, "Al WG" shows white and green lights alternately.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21704">This is a '''list of countries by westernmost point''' on land (dependent territories included). A selection of dependent territories are listed in ''italics'' and are not ranked.

There are five countries with territory on both sides of the [[180th meridian]], and thus can be said to be both the westernmost and easternmost countries: [[Russia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Fiji]], [[United States]], and [[Kiribati]] (as well as [[Antarctica]]). Russia, New Zealand, and Fiji have most of their territories west of the 180th meridian, in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]], so they are considered in this article to belong to the [[List of countries by easternmost point|easternmost]] countries with their territory stretching east beyond the 180th meridian into the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Conversely, the United States and Kiribati have most of their territories east of the 180th meridian, into the Western Hemisphere, so they are considered to belong to the westernmost countries, with their territory stretching west beyond the 180th meridian into the Eastern Hemisphere.

A '''Local Notice to Mariners''' is an authoritative instruction issued by a designated official, typically the [[harbormaster]].

==United States==

In the United States, notices are issued by each [[U.S. Coast Guard]] District to disseminate important information affecting navigational safety within that District. This Notice reports changes and deficiencies in aids to navigation maintained by the Coast Guard. Other marine information such as new [[nautical chart|charts]], channel depths, naval operations, and regattas is included. Since temporary information of short duration is not included in the weekly [[Notice to Mariners]], the ''Local Notice to Mariners'' may be the only source of such information. Small craft using the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] and small harbors not normally used by oceangoing vessels need it to keep charts and publications up-to-date.

Since correcting information for U.S. charts in the ''Notice to Mariners'' is obtained from the Coast Guard Local Notices, it is normal to expect a lag of 1 or 2 weeks for the ''Notice to Mariners'' to publish a correction from this source.

The ''Local Notice to Mariners'' may be obtained free of charge by contacting the appropriate Coast Guard District Commander. Vessels operating in ports and waterways in several districts must obtain the ''Local Notice to Mariners'' from each district. &lt;!-- See Figure 422 for a complete list of U.S. Coast Guard Districts. provide a link instead--&gt;

===Sources===
The text of the US material originated from section 422 of The [[American Practical Navigator]], a document produced by the government of the [[United States|United States of America]].

==Examples==
LNTMs are, by definition, concerned with local issues. Each issuing authority has its own series of LNTMs – there is no international standard numbering or indexing scheme. Individual LNTMs may concern short or long term situations. At [http://www.qhmportsmouth.com/port-lntm/ Portsmouth], mariners are instructed by LNTM 28/07 to ''keep clear of warship berths''. At [http://www.holyheadport.com/LNTM%20Index.pdf Holyhead], LNTM 5/2008 concerns ''Bunkering or transferring oil in port''. At [http://www.conservancy.co.uk/water/local_notices.asp Chichester], No 16 of 2008 ''Sea defence works at Hayling Island'' gives timely information about dredging operations.

[[File:Lunars-star-map.jpg|thumb|400px|Finding Greenwich time while at sea using a lunar distance. The lunar distance is the angle between the Moon and a star (or the Sun). The altitudes of the two bodies are used to make corrections and determine the time.]]

In [[celestial navigation]], '''lunar distance''' is the [[angular distance]] between the [[Moon]] and another [[celestial body]]. The '''lunar distances method''' uses this angle, also called a '''lunar''', and a [[nautical almanac]] to calculate [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich time]]. That calculated time can be used in solving  a spherical triangle. The method was published in 1763 and used until about 1850 when it was superseded by the [[marine chronometer]]. A similar method uses the positions of the [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]].

==Purpose==
In [[celestial navigation]], knowledge of the time at [[Greenwich]] and the measured positions of one or more [[celestial object]]s allows the navigator to calculate [[latitude]] and [[longitude]].&lt;ref name="Norie 1828 pg 222"&gt;

After the method was first published in 1763 by British astronomer royal [[Nevil Maskelyne]], for about a hundred years (until about 1850)&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, Squire, ''Wrinkles in Practical Navigation''&lt;/ref&gt; mariners lacking a chronometer used the method of lunar distances to determine Greenwich time as a key step in determining longitude.  Conversely, a mariner with a chronometer could check its accuracy using a lunar determination of Greenwich time.&lt;ref name="Norie 1828 pg 221"/&gt; The method saw usage all the way up to the beginning of the 20th century on smaller vessels that could not afford a chronometer or had to rely on this technique for correction of the chronometer.&lt;ref name=Bowditch&gt;{{cite wikisource |title= The American Practical Navigator |wslink=The_American_Practical_Navigator |last=Bowditch |first=Nathaniel|authorlink=Nathaniel Bowditch |year=2002 |publisher=[[National Imagery and Mapping Agency]] |location=Unites-States |page=7 |chapter=Chapter 1 |wspage=109 |scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

===Summary===
The method relies on the relatively quick movement of the moon across the background sky, completing  a circuit of 360 degrees in 27.3 days (the sidereal month), or 13.2 degrees per day. In an hour then, it will move about half a degree,&lt;ref name="Norie 1828 pg 222"/&gt; roughly its own [[angular diameter|diameter]], with respect to the background stars and the Sun.  Using a [[sextant]], the navigator precisely measures the angle between the moon and another [[celestial body|body]].&lt;ref name="Norie 1828 pg 222"/&gt;  That could be the Sun or one of a selected group of bright stars lying close to the Moon's path, near the [[ecliptic]]; [[Regulus]] was particularly commonly used. At that moment, anyone on the surface of the earth who can see the same two bodies will, after correcting for [[parallax]] error, observe the same angle. The navigator then consults a prepared table of lunar distances and the times at which they will occur.&lt;ref name="Norie 1828 pg 222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sources of lunar distance tables"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  By comparing the corrected lunar distance with the tabulated values, the navigator finds the Greenwich time for that observation. 
Knowing Greenwich time and local time, the navigator can work out longitude.&lt;ref name="Norie 1828 pg 222"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then the longitude (relative to Greenwich) is readily calculated from the difference between local time and Greenwich Time, at 15 degrees per hour.

===In practice===

Having measured the lunar distance and the heights of the two bodies, the navigator can find Greenwich time in three steps.

;Step one – Preliminaries
:Almanac tables predict lunar distances between the centre of the Moon and the other body (published between 1767 and 1906 in Britain).&lt;ref&gt;''The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris, for the year 1767'', London: W. Richardson and S. Clark, 1766&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Nautical Almanac Abridged for the Use of Seamen, 1924&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the observer cannot accurately find the centre of the Moon (or Sun, which was the most frequently used second object). Instead, lunar distances are always measured to the sharply lit, outer edge ("limb") of the Moon (or of the Sun). The first correction to the lunar distance is the distance between the limb of the Moon and its center. Since the Moon's apparent size varies with its varying distance from the Earth, almanacs give the Moon's and Sun's '''semidiameter''' for each day.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;

}} The authors show an example of correcting for lunar semidiameter.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the observed altitudes are cleared of semidiameter.

;Step two – Clearing
:'''Clearing''' the lunar distance means correcting for the effects of [[Parallax#Lunar parallax|parallax]] and atmospheric refraction on the observation. The almanac gives lunar distances as they would appear if the observer were at the center of a transparent Earth.  Because the Moon is so much closer to the Earth than the stars are, the position of the observer on the surface of the Earth shifts the relative position of the Moon by up to an entire degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The clearing correction for parallax and refraction is a relatively simple trigonometric function of the observed lunar distance and the altitudes of the two bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/ppcomp.html#13 | title=The Moon's topocentric position | author=Schlyter, Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Navigators used collections of mathematical tables to work these calculations by any of dozens of distinct clearing methods.

;Step three – Finding the time
:The navigator, having cleared the lunar distance, now consults a prepared table of lunar distances and the times at which they will occur in order to determine the Greenwich time of the observation.&lt;ref name="Norie 1828 pg 222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sources of lunar distance tables"/&gt; These tables were the high tech wonder of their day. Predicting the position of the moon years in advance requires solving the [[three-body problem]], since the earth, moon and sun were all involved. [[Euler]] developed the numerical method they used, called [[Euler's method]], and  received a grant from the [[Board of Longitude]] to carry out the computations.

Having found the (absolute) Greenwich time, the navigator either compares it with the observed local apparent time (a separate observation) to find his longitude, or compares it with the Greenwich time on a chronometer (if available) if one wants to check the chronometer.&lt;ref name="Norie 1828 pg 222"/&gt;

==Errors==

===Almanac error===
In the early days of lunars, predictions of the Moon's position were good to approximately half an arc-minute{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, a source of error of up to approximately 1 minute in Greenwich time, or one quarter degree of longitude. By 1810, the errors in the almanac predictions had been reduced to about one-quarter of a minute of arc. By about 1860 (after lunar distance observations had mostly faded into history), the almanac errors were finally reduced to less than the error margin of a sextant in ideal conditions (one-tenth of a minute of arc).

===Lunar distance observation===
The best [[sextant]]s at the very beginning of the lunar distance era could indicate angle to one-sixth of an arc-minute{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and later sextants (after c. 1800) to 0.1 arc-minutes, after the use of the [[vernier scale|vernier]] was popularized by its description in English in the book ''Navigatio Britannica'' published in 1750 by [[John Barrow (historian)|John Barrow]], the mathematician and historian.  In practice at sea, actual errors were somewhat larger.  Experienced observers can typically measure lunar distances to within one-quarter of a minute of arc under favourable conditions,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} introducing an error of up to one quarter degree in longitude. If the sky is cloudy or the Moon is "New" (hidden close to the glare of the Sun), lunar distance observations could not be performed.
&lt;!-- How do clearing errors contribute to errors in lunar distance observation? --&gt;

===Total error===
A lunar distance changes with time at a rate of roughly half a degree, or 30 arc-minutes, in an hour.&lt;ref name="Norie 1828 pg 222"/&gt; The two sources of error, combined, typically amount to about one-half arc-minute in Lunar distance, equivalent to one minute in Greenwich time, which corresponds to an error of as much as one-quarter of a degree of Longitude, or about {{convert|15|nmi|km}} at the equator.

== In literature ==
Captain [[Joshua Slocum]], in making the first solo [[circumnavigation]] in 1895&amp;ndash;1898, somewhat anachronistically used the lunar method along with [[dead reckoning]] in his [[navigation]]. He comments in [[Sailing Alone Around the World]] on a sight taken in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. After correcting an error he found in his [[log tables]], the result was surprisingly accurate:&lt;ref name=slocam&gt;Captain Joshua Slocum, [http://www.ibiblio.org/eldritch/js/a11.htm Sailing Alone Around the World, Chapter 11], 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I found from the result of three observations, after long wrestling with lunar tables, that her longitude agreed within five miles of that by dead-reckoning.
This was wonderful; both, however, might be in error, but somehow I felt confident that both were nearly true, and that in a few hours more I should see land; and so it happened, for then I made out the island of [[Nukahiva]], the southernmost of the [[Marquesas]] group, clear-cut and lofty. The verified longitude when abreast was somewhere between the two reckonings; this was extraordinary. All navigators will tell you that from one day to another a ship may lose or gain more than five miles in her sailing-account, and again, in the matter of lunars, even expert lunarians are considered as doing clever work when they average within eight miles of the truth...

The result of these observations naturally tickled my vanity, for I knew it was something to stand on a great ship’s deck and with two assistants take lunar observations approximately near the truth. As one of the poorest of American sailors, I was proud of the little achievement alone on the sloop, even by chance though it may have been...

The work of the lunarian, though seldom practised in these days of chronometers, is beautifully edifying, and there is nothing in the realm of navigation that lifts one’s heart up more in adoration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7103">'''Manhauling''', sometimes expressed as '''man-hauling''': is the pulling forward of sledges, trucks or other load-carrying vehicles by human power unaided by animals or machines. The term is used primarily in connection with travel over snow and ice, and was common during  [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] expeditions before the days of modern motorised traction.

In the years following the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]] the British [[Royal Navy]] took up polar/cold climate exploration as its chief peacetime activity. Due to its simplicity, manhauling was adopted by the early British naval expeditions, where it quickly became the preferred even the 'traditional' technique. In time it would be hailed as inherently more noble than the sole use of dogs as practised by the native Arctic-dwelling peoples. The technique’s chief advocate was [[Sir Clements Markham]], President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] during the latter part of the 19th century. A figure of considerable influence, he brought his prejudices to bear on the series of great British Antarctic ventures during the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]], in all of which manhauling was predominant.

Many later writers would condemn manhauling, particularly with heavily loaded sledges, as inefficient and wasteful, citing it as a direct cause of the great Antarctic tragedy of 1910&amp;ndash;12&amp;mdash;the deaths of [[Captain Scott]] and his four companions as they man-hauled their way across the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] on their return from the [[South Pole]].

==Historical perspective==

===Naval tradition===
Long before the nations of Europe and America became fascinated with polar exploration the native populations of Northern [[Canada]], [[Greenland]], [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]] and [[Siberia]] had trained dogs to draw sledges. Attempts by the early polar explorers to adopt these techniques were rarely successful&amp;mdash;the handling of “Eskimo” dogs was recognised as a specialized art;&lt;ref&gt;Berton, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the use of manhauling as a simpler alternative, when the Royal Navy began its long association with polar exploration. The first example of manhauling on a naval Arctic expedition was the journey by [[William Edward Parry]] across [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]] in 1820, when he and his party dragged {{convert|800|lb|kg|}} of equipment on a two-wheeled cart.&lt;ref&gt;Berton, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter man-hauling began to be seen as a natural, even a 'nobler' alternative to the use of dogs. [[Francis Leopold McClintock]] earned the title of "Father of Arctic Sledging" for his feats of manhauling travel during [[McClintock Arctic Expedition|one of the many expeditions]] despatched to search for the missing [[Franklin's lost expedition|Franklin expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;Berton, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  Among McClintock’s admirers on that expedition was a 21-year-old midshipman, [[Sir Clements Markham|Clements Markham]]&lt;ref&gt;Preston, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markham’s obsession===
Based on his experiences with McClintock and his love for naval traditions, Markham, future President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], became a fervent believer in the principle that manhauling was the purest form of polar travel.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Markham became the driving force behind British Antarctic exploration endeavours in the early 20th century, and was the mentor of [[Robert Falcon Scott]], to whom his thinking and drive were transferred. After his unhappy experiences with dogs in the Antarctic on the [[Discovery Expedition|''Discovery'' Expedition]], 1901&amp;ndash;04 Scott wrote, in his account of the expedition: "In my mind no journey ever made with dogs can approach the height of that fine conception which is realised when a party of men go forth to face hardships, dangers, and difficulties with their own unaided efforts […] Surely in this case the conquest is more nobly and splendidly won."&lt;ref&gt;Scott: Voyage of the Discovery Vol I,  p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scott and Shackleton===
An aversion to the use of dogs pervaded all the British expeditions during the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]] (including those led by [[Ernest Shackleton]]), This was baffling to the great Norwegian explorers [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and [[Roald Amundsen]]. To them manhauling was "futile toil", to be avoided at all costs.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], however, on the fatal southern journey during Scott’s 1910–1913 [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' Expedition]] expressed a profound relief, as the pole-bound party began its ascent of the [[Beardmore Glacier]] after the last of the ponies&lt;ref&gt;Shackleton had pioneered the use of Siberian ponies as an alternative to dogs, on his [[Nimrod Expedition|''Nimrod'' Expedition]], 1907–1909. Scott had followed suit on his [[Terra Nova Expedition|''Terra Nova'' Expedition]]. Both these expeditions however, relied very heavily on manhauling.&lt;/ref&gt; had been shot: "Thank God the horses are now done with, and we begin the heavier work ourselves", he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; His companion [[Lawrence Oates]] thought differently but kept his counsel. Later, when the Pole had been attained and Amundsen’s prior arrival discovered,  Oates privately castigated “our wretched manhauling” as a cause of his party’s defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some conclusions===
Some chroniclers have suggested that excessive reliance on manhauling may have cost the lives of Scott’s polar party. Each man pulling a sledge was burning around 6,000 calories a day, and consuming rations producing only 4,500 calories. Max Jones concludes that they were slowly starving to death.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Much earlier, an expedition account by James Gordon Hayes had highlighted two principal causes of Scott’s disaster: dietary deficiencies and the decision to rely on men instead of dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Hayes’s book Antarctica (1928) by Jones, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, in another history of the expedition, Michael de-la-Noy concludes: “…the whole expedition had been founded upon a blind and very British belief in the moral superiority of human muscle power…Scott thought it more manly for men to haul the sledges themselves. Five of them died as a result”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from de-la-Hoy’s book Scott of the Antarctic (1997) by Jones, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marconi Plaza''' is an urban park square located in [[South Philadelphia]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Plaza was named to recognize the 20th Century cultural identity in Philadelphia of the surrounding [[Italian-American]] enclave neighborhood and became the designation location of the annual Columbus Day Parade.

Marconi Plaza has two main halves, East and West, which are divided in the middle by [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]].  It is located at the most southern end of the city and within the northern border of the [[Sports Complex Special Services District]].  The park plaza is accessible via the Oregon Avenue Station of the [[Broad Street Line|Broad Street Subway]].

The urban park plaza itself, from which the neighborhood derives its name(Marconi East and "Marco" Marconi West), is a {{convert|19|acre|m2|sing=on}} rectangular park. The Roman styled plaza is divided in the center by Broad Street and is bordered by 13th Street, 15th Street, Bigler Street, and Oregon Avenue.

==History==
[[File:1926 Sesqui-Centennial Exposition "Luminous Liberty Bell", Philadelphia, PA.jpg|thumb|right|Grand pre-entrance for the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition -demolished 1927]]
The plaza design is credited to the strong influence of renowned architect [[Paul Philippe Cret]] in 1904 as part of his participation in the Art Jury reviewing the preliminary plans presented by landscape architects the [[Olmsted Brothers]], who were then charged with a modified design to complete the work.  
.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UzQCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=oregon+square+philadelphia+olmsted+brothers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yHdOs8z1-D&amp;sig=BCsUNxSmQzMJ7AApO7WozyGJoQo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBmoVChMIgYLFz8aPxwIVBhc-Ch3iAg32#v=onepage&amp;q=oregon%20square%20philadelphia%20olmsted%20brothers&amp;f=false Annual Report - City Parks Association of Philadelphia, Issues 16-26 (pp. 67-70)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Plaza later served as the grand pre-entrance for the 1926 [[Sesquicentennial Exposition]], leading visitors south along a tree lined [[Southern Boulevard Parkway (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)]] ( landscaped segment of South Broad Street) to the exhibition grounds that started at Packer Avenue and continued to [[League Island Park]]. This neighborhood twin park is mirrored on both sides of Broad Street and became property of the [[Fairmount Park]] system. It held the common name of Oregon Plaza until October 18, 1937 when it was officially named Marconi Plaza in honor of the Nobel Prize Laureate [[Guglielmo Marconi]], the inventor of Radio.

The [[F. Amadee Bregy School]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The original design of the Plaza was a two level [[Terrace garden|terrace]] with pathways, marble trims, urns, influenced by landscaped architecture modeling after [[Roman gardens]] and [[English gardens]]. The east and west plaza reflected the same winding pathways leading to a raised stepped terrace surrounded by stone railings and entrance sculptures of large urns with two small "reflecting" pools of water facing Broad Street at the center point, which at that time was cut away from the curbline forming half circles open to traffic on both the east and west. This accent was used in 1926 to position a large Liberty Bell at the center of the street permitting traffic to circle around.

Over the years many of the fine details have been erased including the half circled indented curbline on either side of Broad Street at the center. This location also had on both sides of the plaza, two reflecting pools of water. The pools were filled in to provide the foundation for the two statues that were later erected to support the cultural history of the immigrant Italian community and respond to [[Anti-Italianism]].

The park is currently lushly covered with 25% trees adorned with park benches, open areas for two tot lots, a baseball field, basketball court, and country cottage style enclosed [[bocce]] court. The sidewalk border surrounding the park is densely lined with large maple trees with heights of 30–50 feet high.

==Public Art==
[[File:Guglielmo_Marconi_Statue_by_Giancarlo_Saleppichi,_1975-erected_at_Marconi_Plaza_Philadelphia_PA.jpg|150px|thumb|right| Sculpted by Giancarlo Saleppichi,1975-erected at Marconi Plaza Philadelphia_PA]]
A bronze statue of [[Guglielmo Marconi]], sculpted by Saleppichi Giancarlo was erected on the east Plaza in 1975 though the efforts of the Marconi Memorial Association headed by Dr. Frank P. DiDio. The statue was dedicated on April 25, 1980, to commemorate the 106th anniversary of the birthday of the world-famous Italian scientist and inventor.

[[File:Columbus Broad St Philly art.JPG|150px|thumb|left| Marble Statue sculpted by Emanuele Caroni, erected October 12, 1876. Relocated 1982 to the west Plaza]]A statue of [[Christopher Columbus]] was erected on the west plaza in 1982. This work was originally located along Belmont Avenue in Fairmount Park, having been erected on October 12, 1876 for Philadelphia's [[Centennial Exposition]]. Thought to be the work of Emanuele Caroni, this is said to be first publicly funded monument to Christopher Columbus in the United States. It was purchased for $18,000 with money raised by Italian-Americans and the Columbus Monument Association, through the efforts of Alonzo Viti of Philadelphia and his brothers. The statue's initial installation began an annual tradition for the colony of mostly Italian Americans in South Philadelphia to march each year on Columbus Day to the statue in Fairmount Park. The {{convert|6|mi|km|sing=on}} journey was found to be too exhausting and in 1920 the celebration changed locations.

==Marconi East: Residential==
'''Mollbore Terraces of Marconi''': The 1930s Mollbore Terrace was a unique urban change from the densely lined row houses that characterized most of South Philadelphia. The design included front porches and a rear yard with an access service roadway for trash pick-up. Three separate Mollbore Terrace sections were constructed east of the plaza within the boundaries of 13th Street to 7th Street, and from Oregon Ave to Johnston Street. The layout departed from the standard street grid, offsetting the numbered streets that permitted placing a "mini-public-square" of green space for houses to face inward on all four sides and directions. The center large rectangular common parks space was originally designated as a "Terrace" that included pathways, grass and trees with an octagon-shaped wading pool at the west end and a raised octagon sand pit platform with a flag pole at the east end.

==Marconi West: Residential==
'''Roman Terraces of Marconi:''' The [[Greco-Roman]]–accented homes west of the plaza from 15th to 19th street, using the same concept but on a smaller scale, include two oval-shaped terrace streets at Smedley and Colorado.  The terrace at Colorado Street became well known citywide for its annual decorations and street lighting during the Christmas holidays from 1950 to 2000.

'''Moyamensing Avenue Parkway of Marconi:''' This main angular dual street with an approximately 50-foot center median landscaped area and tree-lined street, crosses the standard street grid and was designed as an alternative roadway access to the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition. It begins at Oregon Avenue, that once was a headhouse entrance for the 1926 Expo, through to the intersection of 20th Street, Penrose Avenue and Packer Avenue.  An architectural design for a grand public square like the squares of Center City Philadelphia (inspired by the [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]]) was planned at the parkway's end point of Penrose Avenue, which was viewed by city planners to be the significant southern gateway to the City. The 1926 square was never developed.

==Boundaries==
In 2002 the City of Philadelphia legislated boundaries of the Sports Complex Special Service District. The residential communities defined included Marconi Plaza. The Special District established an overlay providing the basis for a new definition to Marconi East as community "three" and Marconi West as community "four".

[[File:WikiMunzee.png|thumb|Illustration of a Munzee, which players create and hide for other players to find]]

'''Munzee''' is a [[freemium]] [[scavenger hunt]] game where places have to be found in the real world. The game is similar to [[geocaching]] but uses [[QR code]] technology, in addition to device [[GPS]] location, to prove the find instead of a logbook. Launched in [[Texas]] in 2011, the game caught on first in [[Germany]], along with [[California]] and [[Michigan]]. It is now played in more than 188 countries around the world, and there is at least one physical Munzee deployed on every continent, including [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name = "Spencer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorsey|first=Erika|title=Member Spotlight|journal=Heartland Highlights|date=2012|url=https://heartlandowners.org/rally/2013/LTA_munzee_hand-out.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The places are marked by other players using QR codes, which are hidden and often printed on weatherproof stickers. The places can also be marked by a [[Near field communication|NFC]] tag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Mike|title=Munzee adds NFC to geolocation game|url=http://www.nfcworld.com/2012/09/05/317625/munzee-adds-nfc-to-geolocation-game/|publisher=NFC World|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stickers are called Munzees. Both the finding and the hiding players receive points for deploying and finding Munzees. The QR codes on the Munzees are read by means of a [[smartphone]] app for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or Windows.
&lt;ref name = "Spencer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Susan|url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121110/NEWS/111109916/1246|title=New game in town|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Telegram}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinates of the Munzees as well as the data of the players are managed via the central web platform.

Virtual Munzees are also available for purchase. These also appear in app lists and on maps, and they are "captured" by locating the app device within 300 feet of the designated location. The device must also be within 300 feet of a QR code Munzee to verify "capture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speurvuur.nl/site/wat-is-munzee?lang=en |title=About Munzee |publisher=speurvuur.nl |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A common misconception is that the idea for Munzee was inspired by [[geocaching]], a game in which participants search for a hidden cache using GPS technology. However, Munzee co-founder Aaron Benzick (having never been a geocacher) came up with the idea of using QR codes for a game in 2008, but smartphone technology and capability were not available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scntx.com/articles/2011/07/03/plano_star-courier/news/8970.txt|title='M' marks the spot: Locally based Munzee takes hi-tech scavenger hunts global|last=Rush|first=Jessica|date=July 3, 2011 |work=Plano Courier Star|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzick, and co-founders, Scott Foster, Chris Pick, and Josh Terkelsen launched the game on July 1, 2011. The term Munzee was derived from the German word for coin, Münze. Since the domain name munze.com was no longer available, an e was added, which also resulted in what the company felt was a catchy name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://munzee.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211253046 ]&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea was to use poker chips or rounded coins with QR codes.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rush|first=Jessica|title=Resident promotes hi-tech scavenger hunt|url=http://www.littleelmjournal.net/articles/2011/07/13/little_elm_journal/news/9077.txt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909232553/http://www.littleelmjournal.net/articles/2011/07/13/little_elm_journal/news/9077.txt|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 9, 2012|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Little Elm|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Munzees ==
[[File:Munzee.jpg|thumb|Munzee on the back of a traffic sign]]

Munzees can consist of any material; they must have at minimum a QR-code and physically meet the conditions of the location (waterproof, weatherproof, etc.). Munzees either can be self-generated and printed or be purchased via the web store or through authorised distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brinkman|first=Lillie-Beth|title=Get App-y's odds and ends — Munzee, Pictorama, Flock|url=http://newsok.com/get-app-ys-odds-and-ends-munzee-pictorama-flock/article/3710556?custom_click=rss|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=NewsOK|date=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NFC Munzees and Virtual Munzees can be purchased from the web store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.munzee.com/Game-Pieces/ |title=Munzee store |publisher=munzee.com |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To generate or to order Munzees one has to be logged in on the central platform with a unique username. When generating a Munzee, the platform creates a web link, over which the generated Munzee can be managed. This web link is represented as a QR code on the Munzee. A descriptive name and an arbitrarily long comment can be assigned to the Munzee as properties. Both are stored on the central platform (not in the QR code) and can be changed later.

After a Munzee is physically created, it can be assigned coordinates anywhere outdoors or indoor and then deployed via the app. Business Munzees are also available which are deployed inside a business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.munzee.com/business |title=Business munzees |publisher=munzee.com |accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Munzee has been deployed it goes live on the map and is ready to be found or "captured" by other players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Faulkner|first=Adrian|title=Munzee – A scavenger hunt for your smartphone|url=http://gpstracklog.com/2012/08/munzee-a-scavenger-hunt-for-your-smartphone.html|publisher=GPS Tracklog|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a Munzee is damaged or taken down, players can report the malfunction and after two reports the Munzee is taken off the map.

The coordinates of all globally mounted Munzees are managed on the game platform at munzee.com.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourque|first=Andre|title=Driving Kids to Succeed through Gamification|url=http://www.business2community.com/mobile-apps/driving-kids-to-succeed-through-gamification-0281691|publisher=Business 2 Community|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players navigate themselves to the general location of a Munzee by accessing the map with a smartphone. When they find a Munzee, they capture it by either scanning the QR code or being within a certain radius of the published coordinates. The smartphone app sends the data scanned along with current coordinates to the central system which records the capture. The finder and the player that deployed the Munzee each earn points. The points award to the person who deploys the munzee and who captures the munzee vary depending on the playing piece deployed.

== Dissemination ==
As of January 2018, there are more than 7 million munzees worldwide in 235 countries, and more than 189 million Munzee captures had been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://statzee.munzee.com/|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2303">A '''navigation system''' is a (usually electronic) system that aids in [[navigation]]. Navigation systems may be entirely on board a vehicle or vessel (on the ships) [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]], or they may be located elsewhere and communicate via radio or other signals with a vehicle or vessel, or they may use a combination of these methods.

Navigation systems may be capable of:

* containing maps, which may be displayed in human readable format via text or in a graphical format
* determining a vehicle or vessel's location via sensors, maps, or information from external sources
* providing suggested directions to a human in charge of a vehicle or vessel via text or speech
* providing directions directly to an [[autonomous vehicle]] such as a robotic probe or guided missile
* providing information on nearby vehicles or vessels, or other hazards or obstacles
* providing information on traffic conditions and suggesting alternative directions

==Types of navigation systems==
* [[Automotive navigation system]]
* [[Marine navigation system]]
* [[satellite navigation system]]
** [[Global Positioning System]], a group of satellites and computers that can provide information on any person, vessel, or vehicle's location via a GPS receiver
*** [[GPS navigation device]], a device that can receive GPS signals for the purpose of determining the device's location and possibly to suggest or give directions
** [[GLONASS]], satellite navigation system run by Russia
** [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] global navigation satellite system
* [[Computer-assisted surgery|Surgical navigation system]], a system which determines the position of surgical instruments in relation to patient images such as CT or MRI scans.
* [[Inertial guidance system]], a system which continuously determines the position, orientation, and velocity (direction and speed of movement) of a moving object without the need for external reference
* [[Robotic mapping]], the methods and equipment by which an autonomous robot is able to construct (or use) a map or floor plan and to localize itself within it

[[File:Veale Gardens.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Veale Gardens]] in Adelaide, Australia]]
[[File:Slovakia Bratislava 947.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Sad Janka Kráľa]] park in [[Bratislava]] (Slovakia)]]
A '''park''' is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and [[recreation]] or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. It may consist of [[grass]]y areas, [[rocks]], [[soil types|soil]] and [[tree]]s, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as [[monument]]s, [[fountain]]s or [[playground]] structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as [[association football]], [[baseball]] and [[football]], and paved areas for games such as [[basketball]]. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less and is ideally within a [[10-Minute Walk]] of its residents. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain [[picnic table]]s and [[barbecue]] grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called "[[dog park]]s", permit dogs to run off-leash.

The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of seventy meters (thousands of square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers. There are also amusement parks which have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance/skill. Amusement parks are the largest types of park in the world. In many large parks, [[camping]] in [[tent]]s is allowed with a permit. Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g., rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles). Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a [[park ranger]] or a [[park warden]]. Large parks may have areas for [[canoeing]] and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, [[cross-country skiing]] and [[snowshoeing]] in colder months.

==History==
[[File:Medieval Hunting Park.JPG|thumb|upright|upright=0.7|Depiction of a medieval hunting park from a 15th-century manuscript]]
The first parks were [[Deer park (England)|English deer parks]],{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} land set aside for hunting by royalty and the [[aristocracy]] in [[medieval]] times. They had walls or thick hedges around them to keep game animals (e.g., stags) in and people out. It was strictly forbidden for commoners to hunt animals in these deer parks.

These game preserves evolved into landscaped parks set around [[mansion]]s and [[country house]]s from the sixteenth century onwards. These may have served as hunting grounds but they also proclaimed the owner's wealth and status. An aesthetic of landscape design began in these [[stately home]] parks where the [[natural landscape]] was enhanced by [[landscape architect]]s such as [[Capability Brown]]. As cities became crowded, the private hunting grounds became places for the public.

With the [[Industrial revolution]] parks took on a new meaning as areas set aside to preserve a sense of nature in the cities and towns. Sporting activity came to be a major use for these urban parks. Areas of outstanding natural beauty were also set aside as [[national park]]s to prevent their being spoiled by uncontrolled development.

==Design==
Park design is influenced by the intended purpose and audience, as well as by the available land features. A park intended to provide recreation for children may include a [[playground]]. A park primarily intended for adults may feature walking paths and decorative landscaping. Specific features, such as riding trails, may be included to support specific activities.

The design of a park may determine who is willing to use it. Walkers may feel unsafe on a [[mixed-use path]] that is dominated by fast-moving cyclists or horses. Different landscaping and infrastructure may even affect children's rates of use of parks according to sex. Redesigns of two parks in Vienna suggested that the creation of multiple semi-enclosed play areas in a park could encourage equal use by boys and girls.&lt;ref&gt;Foran, Clare (September 16, 2013)  [http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2013/09/how-design-city-women/6739/ "How to Design a City for Women"]  ''The Atlantic Cities.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks are part of the urban infrastructure: for physical activity, for families and communities to gather and socialize, or for a simple respite. Research reveals that people who exercise outdoors in green-space derive greater mental health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. &amp; Kaplan, S. 1989. ''The Experience of Nature: A Psychological Perspective. Cambridge:Cambridge University Press.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Providing activities for all ages, abilities and income levels is important for the physical and mental well-being of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, D. Dannenberg, A. Frumkin, H. Design and Public Health: Working Hand-in-Hand for Better built Environments ''Arcade'' Summer 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;National Recreation and Park Association. Issue Brief: Creating Safe Park Environments to Enhance Community Wellness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks can also benefit pollinators, and some parks (such as Saltdean Oval) have been redesigned to accommodate them better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/solutions/2014/09/for-bee-friendly-parks-head-for-the-great-unmown/380831/|title=For Bee-Friendly Parks, Head For the Great Unmown|website=citylab.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organisations, such as [[Xerces Society]] are also promoting this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/pollinator_friendly_parks_21ed_xerces_society.pdf|title=Pollinator-friendly parks|website=xerces.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in city revitalization===
City parks play a role in improving cities and improving the futures for residents and visitors - for example, Millennium Park in Chicago, Illinois&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/awards/2008/08winners/441.html|title=ASLA 2008 Professional Awards|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Mill River Park and Green way in Stamford, CT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/2015awards/95842.html|title=2015 ASLA PROFESSIONAL AWARDS|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One group that is a strong proponent of parks for cities is The American Society of Landscape Architects . They argue that parks are important to the fabric of the community on an individual scale and broader scales such as entire neighborhoods, city districts or city park systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/sustainablelandscapes/Vid_Parks.html|title=Designing Our Future: Sustainable Landscapes|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design for safety===
[[File:Example of night photography at The Garden of Five Senses, New Delhi.JPG|thumb|A well-lit path in Dehli's [[Garden of Five Senses]]]]
Parks need to feel safe for people to use them. Research shows that perception of safety can be more significant in influencing human behavior than actual crime statistics.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} If citizens perceive a park as unsafe, they might not make use of it at all.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A study done in four cities; Albuquerque, NM, Chapel Hill/Durham, NC, Columbus, OH, and Philadelphia, PA, with 3815 survey participants who lived within a half mile of a park indicated that in addition to safety that park facilities also played a significant role in park utilization and that increasing facilities instead of creating an image of a safe park would increase utilization of the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapham|first=Sandra C.|last2=Cohen|first2=Deborah A.|last3=Han|first3=Bing|last4=Williamson|first4=Stephanie|last5=Evenson|first5=Kelly R.|last6=McKenzie|first6=Thomas L.|last7=Hillier|first7=Amy|last8=Ward|first8=Phillip|date=2016-09-01|title=How important is perception of safety to park use? A four-city survey|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/content/53/12/2624|journal=Urban Studies|language=en|volume=53|issue=12|pages=2624–2636|doi=10.1177/0042098015592822|issn=0042-0980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of features that contribute to whether or not a park feels safe. Elements in the physical design of a park, such as an open and welcoming entry, good visibility (sight lines), and appropriate lighting and signage can all make a difference. Regular park maintenance, as well as programming and community involvement can also contribute to a feeling of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pps.org/reference/torontosafety2/|title=Key Factors in Planning, Designing and Maintaining Safer Parks - Project for Public Spaces|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Crime prevention through environmental design|Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design]] (CPTED) has been widely used in facility design, use of CPTED in parks has not been.  Iqbal and Ceccato performed a study in [[Stockholm|Stockholm, Sweden]] to determine if it would be useful to apply to parks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iqbal|first=Asifa|last2=Ceccato|first2=Vania|date=2016-06-01|title=Is CPTED Useful to Guide the Inventory of Safety in Parks? A Study Case in Stockholm, Sweden|url=http://icj.sagepub.com/content/26/2/150|journal=International Criminal Justice Review|language=en|volume=26|issue=2|pages=150–168|doi=10.1177/1057567716639353|issn=1057-5677}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their study indicated that while CPTED could be useful, due to the nature of a park, increasing the look of safety can also have [[unintended consequences]] on the aesthetics of the park.  Creating secure areas with bars and locks and lower the beauty of the park, as well as the nature of who is in charge of observing the public space and the feeling of being observed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Women as a measure of safety===
{{Globalize/US|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--consider using https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3819178/ to help globalize--&gt;

In the United States, the standard for safety in parks is increasingly measured by whether women feel safe in that particular location.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Paumgarten, Nick |title=Girl-Counter Counting visitors in Bryant Park |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=3 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was originally identified by the urban sociologist [[William H. Whyte]] in his 1988 studies in New York.&lt;ref&gt;}{{cite book|last1=Whyte |first1=William H. |last2= Underhill |first2=Paco |year=2009 |title=City: Rediscovering the Center |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=9780812220742 |edition=reprint }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research reveals that women have a different sense of safety compared to men, whether they are walking in their neighborhood or in a park.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Velasquez KS, Holahan CK, You X |title=Relationship of perceived environmental characteristics to leisure-time physical activity and meeting recommendations for physical activity in Texas. |journal=Prev Chronic Dis |date=January 2009 |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=A24 |pmid=19080030 |pmc=2644604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Biederman]], President of the Bryant Park Corp. stated "Women pick up on visual cues of disorder better than men do.... And if women don't see other women, they tend to leave."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Whether or not a woman feels safe can determine how much physical activity she has and if it will reach the recommended level for good health and disease prevention.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Harrison RA, Gemmell I, Heller RF |title=The population effect of crime and neighborhood on physical activity: an analysis of 15,461 adults |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |date=2007 |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=34–39 |pmid=17183012 |pmc=2465585 |doi=10.1136/jech.2006.048389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Park designers and planners can take several steps to increase safety from assault, including providing sufficient lighting, having patrols by police officers or other safety officials, and providing emergency buttons for summoning assistance.

==Active and passive recreation areas==
[[File:Portlandskate.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Burnside Skatepark in [[Portland, Oregon]] is one of the world's most recognizable skateparks.]]
Parks can be divided into active and passive [[recreation]] areas. Active recreation is that which has an urban character and requires intensive development. It often involves cooperative or team activity, including [[playground]]s, ball fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and [[skateparks]]. Active recreation such as team sports, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and high costs. Passive recreation, also called "low intensity recreation" is that which emphasizes the open-space aspect of a park and allows for the preservation of natural habitat. It usually involves a low level of development, such as rustic picnic areas, benches and trails.

Many smaller ''neighborhood parks'' are receiving increased attention and valuation as significant community assets and places of refuge in heavily populated urban areas. Neighborhood groups around the world are joining together to support local parks that have suffered from [[urban decay]] and government neglect.

Passive recreation typically requires little management and can be provided at very low costs. Some open space managers provide nothing other than trails for physical activity in the form of walking, running, horse riding, mountain biking, snow shoeing, or cross-country skiing; or sedentary activity such as observing nature, bird watching, painting, photography, or picnicking. Limiting park or open space use to passive recreation over all or a portion of the park's area eliminates or reduces the burden of managing active recreation facilities and developed infrastructure. Many ski resorts combine active recreation facilities (ski lifts, gondolas, terrain parks, downhill runs, and lodges) with passive recreation facilities (cross-country ski trails).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Parks owned or operated by government==

===National parks===
[[File:Zackenberg.4.jpg|thumb|Northeast Greenland National Park, the world's largest national park]]
{{Main|National park}}
A national park is a reserve of land, usually, but not always declared and owned by a national [[government]], protected from most human development and pollution. Although this may be so, it is not likely that the government of a specific area owns it, rather the community itself. National parks are a [[protected area]] of [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] [[IUCN protected area categories|Category II]]. This implies that they are wilderness areas, but unlike pure nature reserves, they are established with the expectation of a certain degree of human visitation and supporting infrastructure.

While this type of [http://parksfamilyfarm.co/ national park] had been proposed previously, the United States established the first "public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people", [[Yellowstone National Park]], in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=amrvl&amp;fileName=vl002//amrvlvl002.db&amp;recNum=1&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/consrvbib:@field(NUMBER+@band(amrvl+vl002))&amp;linkText=0|title=Evolution of the Conservation Movement, 1850-1920|website=memory.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Yellowstone was not gazetted as a national park. The first officially designated national park was [[Mackinac National Park|Mackinac Island]], gazetted in 1875. [[Australia]]'s [[Royal National Park]], established in 1879, was the world's second officially established national park.&lt;ref name=StevensBertram&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=105893|title=National parks|accessdate=2 November 2014|date=31 July 2007|work=Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts|publisher=[[Australian Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest national park in the world is the [[Northeast Greenland National Park]], which was established in 1974 and currently protects {{convert|972001|km2|mi2|-3|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Greenland, [http://www.stat.gl/LinkClick.aspx?link=Intranet%2fGIF_2009_WEB.pdf&amp;tabid=57&amp;mid=473&amp;language=en-US ''Greenland in Figures, 2009'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenland.com/en/about-greenland/natur-klima/nationalparken.aspx | title=The National Park | publisher=Greenland.com | accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-national parks===
{{Main|State park|Provincial park}}
In some [[Federation|Federal systems]], many parks are managed by the sub-national levels of government. In [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], and some states in [[Mexico]], as well as in [[Victoria (Australia)|the Australian state of Victoria]], these are known as state parks, whereas in [[Argentina]], [[Canada]] and [[South Korea]], they are known as provincial or territorial parks. In the United States, it is also common for individual [[County (United States)|counties]] to run parks, these are known as '''county parks'''.

===Urban parks===
[[File:Yoyogi Park from Hyatt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Yoyogi Park]] is a large urban park in [[Tokyo]].]]
{{Main|Urban park}}
A park is an area of open space provided for recreational use, usually owned and maintained by a local government. Parks commonly resemble [[savanna]]s or open [[woodland]]s, the types of [[landscape]] that human beings find most relaxing. [[Grass]] is typically kept short to discourage [[insect]] pests and to allow for the enjoyment of [[picnic]]s and sporting activities. Trees are chosen for their beauty and to provide [[shade (shadow)|shade]].

Some early parks include the [[La Alameda, Seville|la Alameda de Hércules]], in [[Seville]], a promenaded public mall, urban garden and park built in 1574, within the historic center of Seville; the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]], in Budapest, Hungary, which was property of the Batthyány family and was later made public.

An early purpose built public park was [[Derby Arboretum]] which was opened in 1840 by Joseph Strutt for the mill workers and people of the city. This was closely followed by [[Princes Park, Liverpool|Princes Park]] in the [[Liverpool]] suburb of [[Toxteth]], laid out to the designs of [[Joseph Paxton]] from 1842 and opened in 1843. The land on which the Princes park was built was purchased by Richard Vaughan Yates, an iron merchant and philanthropist, in 1841 for £50,000. The creation of Princes Park showed great foresight and introduced a number of highly influential ideas. First and foremost was the provision of open space for the benefit of townspeople and local residents within an area that was being rapidly built up. Secondly it took the concept of the designed landscape as a setting for the suburban domicile, an idea pioneered by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] at [[Regent's Park]], and re-fashioned it for the provincial town in a most original way. Nash's remodeling of St James's Park from 1827 and the sequence of processional routes he created to link The Mall with Regent's Park completely transformed the appearance of London's West End. With the establishment of Princes Park in 1842, Joseph Paxton did something similar for the benefit of a provincial town, albeit one of international stature by virtue of its flourishing mercantile contingent. Liverpool had a burgeoning presence on the scene of global maritime trade before 1800 and during the Victorian era its wealth rivalled that of London itself.

The form and layout of Paxton's ornamental grounds, structured about an informal lake within the confines of a serpentine carriageway, put in place the essential elements of his much imitated design for [[Birkenhead Park]]. The latter was commenced in 1843 with the help of public finance and deployed the ideas he pioneered at Princes Park on a more expansive scale. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] visited Birkenhead Park in 1850 and praised its qualities. Indeed, Paxton is widely credited as having been one of the principal influences on Olmsted and Calvert's design for New York's Central Park of 1857.

[[File:NYC - Manhattan - Central-Park.jpg|thumb|[[Central Park]] in [[New York City]] is the most-visited urban park in the U.S.&lt;ref name="CPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/about-cpc |title=About the Central Park Conservancy|website= Central Park Conservancy|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Another early public park is the [[Peel Park, Salford]], England opened on August 22, 1846.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salford.gov.uk/leisure/parks/publicparks/parks-bb.htm Salford City Council: Parks in Broughton and Blackfriars] Retrieved on September 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/daytrips/parks-gardens.html Papillon Graphics' Virtual Encyclopaedia of Greater Manchester: The Campaign for City Parks in Manchester and Salford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922182525/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/daytrips/parks-gardens.html |date=September 22, 2007 }} Retrieved on September 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buhu.salford.ac.uk/virtualtours/index.php University of Salford: Peel Park] Retrieved on September 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible claimant for status as the world's first public park is Boston Common (Boston, Massachusetts, USA), set aside in 1634, whose first recreational promenade, Tremont Mall, dates from 1728. True park status for the entire common seems to have emerged no later than 1830, when the grazing of cows was ended and renaming the Common as Washington Park was proposed (renaming the bordering Sentry Street to Park Street in 1808 already acknowledged the reality).

===Linear parks===
A [[linear park]] is a park that has a much greater length than width. A typical example of a linear park is a section of a former railway that has been converted into a park called a [[rail trail]] or [[Greenway (landscape)|greenway]] (i.e. the tracks removed, vegetation allowed to grow back). Parks are sometimes made out of oddly shaped areas of land, much like the vacant lots that often become city neighborhood parks. Linked parks may form a [[greenbelt]].

===Country parks===
{{Main|Country park}}
In some countries, especially the United Kingdom, ''country parks'' are areas designated for recreation, and managed by [[local authority|local authorities]]. They are often located near urban populations, but they provide recreational facilities typical of the countryside rather than the town.

==Private parks==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Private parks are owned by individuals or businesses and are used at the discretion of the owner. There are a few types of private parks, and some which once were privately maintained and used have now been made open to the public.

''Hunting parks'' were originally areas maintained as open space where residences, industry and farming were not allowed, often originally so that nobility might have a place to hunt&amp;nbsp;– see [[medieval deer park]]. These were known for instance, as ''deer parks'' (deer being originally a term meaning any wild animal). Many [[country house]]s in Great Britain and Ireland still have parks of this sort, which since the 18th century have often been landscaped for aesthetic effect. They are usually a mixture of open grassland with scattered trees and sections of woodland, and are often enclosed by a high wall. The area immediately around the house is the garden. In some cases this will also feature sweeping lawns and scattered trees; the basic difference between a ''country house's park'' and its garden is that the park is grazed by animals, but they are excluded from the garden.

A '''parkway''' is a broad, landscaped [[highway]] [[thoroughfare]].&lt;ref name="Parkway"&gt;''"parkway."''Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002. http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com (14 Apr. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The term is particularly used for a roadway in a [[park]] or connecting to a park from which trucks and other [[heavy vehicle]]s are excluded.&lt;ref name="Parkway"/&gt; Many parkways originally intended for scenic, recreational driving have evolved into major urban and commuter routes.

The term ''parkway'' is sometimes applied more generally to a variety of [[limited-access road]]s.

In Russia, long, broad (multi-lane) and beautified thoroughfares are referred to as [[Prospekt (street)|prospekt]]s.

===Scenic roads===
Over the years, many different types of roads have been labeled parkways.

The first parkways in the [[United States]] were developed during the late 19th century by landscape architects [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Beatrix Farrand]] as roads segregated for{{clarifyme|date=March 2018}} pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians, and [[horse carriage]]s, such as the [[Eastern Parkway]], which is credited as the world's first parkway,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/historical-signs/listings?id=196&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean Parkway]] in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]]. The terminology "parkway" to define this type of road was coined by [[Calvert Vaux]] and Frederick Law Olmsted in their proposal to link city and suburban parks with "pleasure roads".

Newer roads such as [[Delaware Park-Front Park System|Bidwell]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] and Park Presidio Boulevard in [[San Francisco, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Jeanne|title=History of Park Presidio Boulevard|website=ppnsf.org/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; were designed for automobiles and are broad and divided by large landscaped central medians. 

During the early 20th century, the meaning of the word was expanded to include [[limited-access highway]]s designed for recreational driving of automobiles, with [[landscape|landscaping]]. These parkways originally provided [[scenic route]]s without very slow or [[commercial vehicle]]s, at [[Level crossing|grade intersections]], or pedestrian traffic. Examples are the [[Merritt Parkway]] in Connecticut and the [[Vanderbilt Motor Parkway]] in New York. But their success led to more development, expanding a city's boundaries, eventually limiting the parkway's recreational driving use. The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] between [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and [[Pasadena, California]] is an example of lost [[pastoral]] aesthetics. It and others have become major commuting routes, while retaining the name "parkway".

===Early high speed roads===
{{See also|Parkways in New York State}}
In New York City, construction on the [[Long Island Motor Parkway]] (Vanderbilt Parkway) began in 1906 and planning for the [[Bronx River Parkway]] in 1907. In the 1920s, the  [[New York City Metropolitan Area]]'s parkway system grew under the direction of [[Robert Moses]], the president of the New York State Council of Parks and [[Long Island State Park Commission]], who used parkways to create and access state parks, especially for city dwellers. As Commissioner of New York City Parks under Mayor LaGuardia, he extended the parkways to the heart of the city, creating and linking its parks to the greater metropolitan systems.

Most of the New York metropolitan parkways were designed by Gilmore Clark. The famed "Gateway to New England" [[Merritt Parkway]] in [[Connecticut]] was designed in the 1930s as a pleasurable alternative for affluent locals to the congested Boston Post Road, running through forest with each bridge designed uniquely to enhance the scenery. Another example is the [[Sprain Brook Parkway]] from [[The Bronx]] to become the [[Taconic State Parkway]] to [[Chatham, New York]]. [[Landscape architect]] [[George Kessler]] designed extensive parkway systems for [[Kansas City, Missouri#Parks and boulevard system|Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Memphis Park and Parkway System|Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Indianapolis Park and Boulevard System|Indianapolis]]; and other cities at the beginning of the 20th century.

[[File:Natchez-Trace-Parkway-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Natchez Trace Parkway]]]]

===New Deal roads===
In the 1930s, as part of the [[New Deal]] the U.S. federal government constructed [[National Parkway]]s designed for recreational driving and to commemorate historic trails and routes. These divided four-lane parkways have lower [[speed limit]]s and are maintained by the [[National Park Service]]. An example is the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) built [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]].

Others are: [[Skyline Drive]] in [[Virginia]]; the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] in [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Tennessee]]; and the [[Colonial Parkway]] in eastern Virginia's [[Historic Triangle]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/special_sections/parkway/parkway1.html |archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20121009162431/http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/special_sections/parkway/parkway1.html |archive-date = October 9, 2012 |first1 = Tim |last1 = Thornton |first2 = Isak |last2 = Howell |title = Parkway’s Past Haunts Its Future |work = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]], running along the [[Potomac River]] near [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia]], were also constructed during this era.

===Post-war parkways===
In [[Kentucky]] the term "parkway" designates a [[controlled-access highway]] in the [[:Category:Kentucky parkway system|Kentucky Parkway system]], with nine built in the 1960s and 1970s. They were [[toll road]]s until the [[construction bond]]s were repaid, and are now [[freeway]]s since 2006.

The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] from [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] to [[Los Angeles]], built in 1940, was the first segment of the vast [[Southern California]] freeway system. It became part of [[Interstate 110 and State Route 110 (California)|State Route 110]] and was renamed the Pasadena Freeway. A 2010 restoration of the freeway brought the Arroyo Seco Parkway designation back.

[[File:Truckersuseexpwysnotpkwys.jpg|thumb|right|Sign informing truckers it is illegal to use a parkway in [[New York City]].]]
In the [[New York metropolitan area]], contemporary parkways are predominantly controlled-access highways restricted to non-commercial traffic, excluding [[truck]]s and [[tractor-trailer]]s. Some have low overpasses that also exclude buses. The Vanderbilt Parkway, an exception in western [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], is a surviving remnant of the [[Long Island Motor Parkway]] that became a [[surface street]], no longer with controlled-access or non-commercial vehicle restrictions. The [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] is a post-war parkway that starts at the [[George Washington Bridge]], heads north through New Jersey, continuing through Rockland and Orange counties in New York. The Palisades Parkway was built to allow for a direct route from New York City to [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]].

In New Jersey, the [[Garden State Parkway]], connecting the urban Northeast U.S. with the [[Jersey Shore]] and [[Atlantic City]], is restricted to buses and non-commercial traffic north of the [[New Jersey Route 18|Route 18]] interchange but is one of the busiest [[toll road]]s in the country.&lt;ref name=njdottrucks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/about/rules/pdf/chapter32truckaccess.pdf|title=Title 16.

In the [[Pittsburgh]] region, two of the major Interstates are referred to informally as parkways. The Parkway East ([[Interstate 376|I-376]], formally the [[Penn-Lincoln Parkway]]) connects Downtown Pittsburgh to [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania]]. The Parkway West ([[Interstate 376|I-376]]) runs through the [[Fort Pitt Tunnel]] and links Downtown to [[Pittsburgh International Airport]], southbound [[Interstate 79|I-79]], [[Imperial, Pennsylvania]], and westbound US&amp;nbsp;22/US&amp;nbsp;30. The Parkway North ([[Interstate 279|I-279]]) connects Downtown to [[Franklin Park, Pennsylvania]] and northbound [[Interstate 79|I-79]].
&lt;!---personal view &amp; opinions, &amp; missing NPOV---Many opponents of increased road construction in the [[United States]]{{Who|date=December 2008}} claim that the use of the term "parkway" in any sense other than as a scenic route through parkland, is deceptive. It is claimed by such advocates{{Who|date=December 2008}} that many existing and proposed parkways (such as the proposed [[West Eugene Parkway]] in [[Oregon]]) are functionally indistinguishable from [[freeway]]s and/or [[Limited-access road|expressways]], and the "parkway" label is used to make construction of such routes seem more palatable to the public{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} (who might otherwise stage a [[Freeway revolts|freeway revolt]], especially if their neighborhood is affected).  Others{{Who|date=December 2008}} claim that this is splitting hairs; and that the use of the term "parkway" in conjunction with urban and suburban highways is a well-established practice.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  Furthermore, most routes{{where}} designated with the "parkway" label do have scenic enhancements (making the route more attractive for both motorists and neighbors),{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} and many such routes do exclude trucks. As truck traffic interferes with normal vehicle movement the congestion in the road can be reduced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}---&gt;

In the suburbs of [[Philadelphia]], [[U.S. Route 202 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 202]] follows an at-grade parkway alignment known as the "U.S. Route 202 Parkway" between [[Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania|Montgomeryville]] and [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]]. The parkway varies from two to four lanes in width, has {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} shoulders, a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} walking path called the [[US 202 Parkway Trail]] on the side, and a {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit. The parkway opened in 2012 as a bypass of a section of US 202 between the two towns; it had originally been proposed as a four-lane freeway before funding for the road was cut.&lt;ref name=inq12312&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Mucha|title=New Route 202 parkway opens today|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=December 3, 2012|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/20121203_New_Route_202_parkway_opens_today.html|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intell"&gt;{{cite news|first=Freda R. |last=Savana|title=Make way for the 202 Parkway|work=[[The Intelligencer (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|The Intelligencer]]|date=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intell2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Christina |last=Kristofic|title=PennDOT to hold meetings on noise from parkway|work=[[The Intelligencer (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|The Intelligencer]]|date=November 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Minneapolis]], the [[Grand Rounds Scenic Byway]] system has {{convert|50|mi|km}} of streets designated as parkways. These are not freeways; they have a slow {{convert|25|mph|km/h|adj=on}} speed limit, pedestrian crossings, and stop signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minneapolisparks.org/grandrounds/inf_about.htm|title=Information Center: About the Grand Rounds|accessdate=2007-12-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214064938/http://www.minneapolisparks.org/grandrounds/inf_about.htm|archivedate=2015-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secondward.blogspot.com/2007/01/traffic-calming-event.html|title=Second Ward, Minneapolis: Traffic Calming Event|accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cincinnati]], parkways are major roads which trucks are prohibited from using. Some Cincinnati parkways, such as Columbia Parkway, are high-speed, limited-access roads, while others, such as Central Parkway, are multi-lane urban roads without controlled access. Columbia Parkway carries US-50 traffic from downtown towards east-side suburbs of Mariemont, Anderson, and Milford, and is a limited access road from downtown to the Village of Mariemont.

==Canada==
[[File:Icefields Parkway-02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Icefields Parkway]] runs through the [[Canadian Rockies]] in [[Jasper National Park]] and [[Banff National Park]].]]

"Parkway" is used in the names of many [[Canada|Canadian]] roads, including major routes through [[National parks of Canada|national parks]], scenic drives, major urban thoroughfares, and even regular freeways that carry commercial traffic.

Parkways in the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] are administered by the [[National Capital Commission|National Capital Region (Canada)]]. However, some of them are named "drive" or "driveway".

The term in Canada is also applied to multi-use paths and [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]] used by walkers and cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.translink.ca/en/Getting-Around/Cycling/BC-Parkway.aspx BC Parkway, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stcatharines.ca/en/playin/WellandCanalsParkwayTrail.asp Welland Canals Parkway Trail, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
{{main|Parkway (disambiguation)}}
The United Kingdom has parkways (known in that region as a [[carriageway]]) in many large towns and cities.{{dubious|date=March 2018}} Most examples are motorways or [[A road (UK)|A roads]]. Some parkways including [[Chelmsford]] Parkway have flyovers leading to major roads.

===Bristol (and other) park-and-ride railway stations===
[[File:Luton Airport Parkway railway station.jpg|thumb|270px|Luton Airport Parkway railway station]]
Several mainly park-and-ride-status railway stations in England have the suffix "parkway" in their name. The etymology is from the original U.S. meaning as the [[Bristol Parkway railway station]] was named after the adjacent [[M32 motorway]], originally known as The Parkway because of its green-[[buffer zone|buffered]] route into the city. Bristol Parkway was the first railway station so named, in 1972. The majority of such stations were opened in the late 20th century to relieve pressure on existing city centre stations. Examples such as [[Didcot Parkway railway station|Didcot Parkway]] are renamings following the expansion of the car parking facilities where the name is used promotionally (for example commuters to Oxford are encouraged to leave their car at Didcot and travel to Oxford by train) whereas in others with multi-storey car parks serving modest settlements such as [[Brookwood railway station|Brookwood]] and [[Fleet railway station|Fleet]] the suffix has not been adopted.

[[Luton Airport Parkway railway station|Luton Airport Parkway]] and [[Southampton Airport Parkway railway station|Southampton Airport Parkway]] are examples serving [[Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[Southampton Airport|Southampton]] airports. Some were so named as they are not in easy walking distance of an airport terminal; passengers use shuttle bus services, although Southampton Airport station is within easy walking distance of Southampton Airport and has no separate car parking facilities of its own.

===Peterborough===
{{further|Road transport in Peterborough}}
The city and [[New towns in the United Kingdom|third-generation new town]] of [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]] (population of 184,500 as at 2011 census) has an overall free-capacity system roads branded as "parkways", which together with other roads provide routes for much through traffic and local traffic sufficient to cope in most peak hours. The majority are dual carriageways, with many of their junctions numbered. Five main parkways (Soke Parkway, Nene Parkway, Fletton Parkway, Frank Perkins Parkway, Paston Parkway) form an orbital outer ring road. Orton Parkway, Werrington Parkway, Longthorpe Parkway are named after the settlements they serve. For example, Werrington Parkway is an arbitrary renaming of a short section of the A15 Lincoln Road.

===Plymouth===
In the [[Plymouth#Government|City of Plymouth]], the [[A38 road|A38]] is called "The Parkway" and bisects a rural belt of the [[unitary authority|local authority]] area, which coincides with the geographical centre; it has two junctions to enter the downtown part of the city.

== Australia ==

===Australian Capital Territory===
The [[Australian Capital Territory]] uses the term "parkway" to refer to roadways of a standard approximately equivalent to what would be designated as an "expressway", "freeway", or "motorway" in other areas. Parkways generally have multiple lanes in each direction of travel, no intersections (crossroads are accessed by interchanges), high speed limits, and are of dual carriageway design (or have high crash barriers on the median).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majuraparkway.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/161316/EPBC_Referral_Majura_Parkway_to_DEWHA_Rev1.pdf EPBC Referral - Majura Parkway to DEWHA (Revision 1)], SMEC, Page 9, 19 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] uses the term "parkway" to sometimes refer to smaller local access roads that travel through parkland. Unlike other uses of the term, these parkways are not high-speed routes but may still have some degree of limited access.

==Singapore==
[[Singapore]] uses the term "parkway" as an alternative to "[[Expressways of Singapore|expressway]]". As such, parkways are also dual carriageways with high speed limits and [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]]. The [[East Coast Parkway]] is currently the only expressway in Singapore that uses this terminology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2626">In [[ancient Egypt]], a '''rope stretcher''' (or '''harpedonaptai''') was a [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]] who [[Measurement|measured]] [[real property]] demarcations and [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] using [[knotted cord]]s, stretched so the rope did not sag. The practice is depicted in tomb paintings of the [[Theban Necropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Curtis Maitland et al. (1994) ''Evidence and procedures for boundary location''&lt;/ref&gt; Rope stretchers used [[special right triangles#Common Pythagorean triples|3-4-5 triangles]] and the [[plumb-bob|plummet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petrie.ucl.ac.uk/search/main/textresult.php?objectname=plumb&amp;find_location=&amp;amp;material=&amp;amp;period=&amp;amp;submit44=Search Petrie Museum website: plumbs]&lt;/ref&gt; which are still in use by modern surveyors.

The commissioning of a new sacred building was a solemn occasion, and officials as high-ranking as the Pharaoh participated in a ceremony that involved personally stretching ropes to define the foundation. This important ceremony, and therefore rope-stretching itself, are attested over 3000 years from the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic period]] to the [[Ptolemaic kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Kim and Michael J. Ostwald (2015) ''Architecture and Mathematics from Antiquity to the Future'' vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Rope stretching technology spread to [[ancient Greece]] and [[India]], where it stimulated the development of [[geometry]] and [[mathematics]].

{{short description|Any system that uses satellite radio signals to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning}}

A '''satellite navigation''' or '''satnav''' system is a system that uses [[satellite]]s to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small [[electronics|electronic]] receivers to determine their location ([[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[altitude]]/[[elevation]]) to high precision (within a few metres) using [[time signal]]s transmitted along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] by [[radio]] from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.

A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a '''global navigation satellite system''' ('''GNSS'''). {{As of|2018|10}}, the [[United States]]' [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and [[Russia]]'s [[GLONASS]] are fully operational GNSSs, with [[China]]'s [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System]] (BDS) and the [[European Union]]'s [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] scheduled to be fully operational by 2020.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2010-05/20/content_4222569.htm |title=Beidou satellite navigation system to cover whole world in 2020 |publisher=Eng.chinamil.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4366_en.htm |title=Galileo goes live! |publisher=europa.eu |date=2016-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], [[France]] and [[Japan]] are in the process of developing regional navigation and augmentation systems as well.

Global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a [[satellite constellation]] of 18–30 [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO) satellites spread between several [[orbital planes]]. The actual systems vary, but use [[orbital inclination]]s of &gt;50° and [[orbital period]]s of roughly twelve hours (at an altitude of about {{convert|20000|km|mi|disp=or}}).

==Classification==
Satellite navigation systems that provide enhanced accuracy and integrity monitoring usable for civil navigation are classified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifatca.org/system/files/public_docs/gnss.pdf |publisher=IFATCA |title=A Beginner's Guide to GNSS in Europe |format=PDF |accessdate=20 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''GNSS-1'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} is the first generation system and is the combination of existing satellite navigation systems (GPS and GLONASS), with [[Satellite Based Augmentation System]]s (SBAS) or [[Ground Based Augmentation System]]s (GBAS). In the United States, the satellite based component is the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), in Europe it is the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS), and in Japan it is the [[Multi-Functional Transport Satellite|Multi-Functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS). Ground based augmentation is provided by systems like the [[Local Area Augmentation System]] (LAAS).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* '''GNSS-2'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} is the second generation of systems that independently provides a full civilian satellite navigation system, exemplified by the European Galileo positioning system. These systems will provide the accuracy and integrity monitoring necessary for civil navigation; including aircraft. Initially, this system consisted of only Upper L-Band frequency sets (L1 for GPS, E1 for Galileo, G1 for GLONASS). In recent years, GNSS systems have begun activating Lower L-Band frequency sets (L2 and L5 for GPS, E5a and E5b for Galileo, G3 for GLONASS) for civilian use; they feature higher aggregate accuracy and less problems with signal reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/Galileo_General_Introduction|title=Galileo General Introduction - Navipedia|website=gssc.esa.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gssc.esa.int/navipedia/index.php/GNSS_signal|title=GNSS signal - Navipedia|website=gssc.esa.int|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late 2018, a few consumer grade GNSS devices are being sold that leverage both, and are typically called "Dual band GNSS" or "Dual band GPS" devices.

== History and theory ==
[[File:Accuracy of Navigation Systems.svg|thumb]]
Ground based [[radio navigation]] has long been practiced.  The [[Decca Navigator System|DECCA]], [[LORAN]], [[Gee (navigation)|GEE]] and [[Omega Navigation System|Omega]] systems used terrestrial [[longwave]] radio [[transmitter]]s which broadcast a radio pulse from a known "master" location, followed by a pulse repeated from a number of "slave" stations.  The delay between the reception of the master signal and the slave signals allowed the receiver to deduce the distance to each of the slaves, providing a [[fix (position)|fix]].

The first satellite navigation system was [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]], a system deployed by the US military in the 1960s. Transit's operation was based on the [[Doppler effect]]: the satellites travelled on well-known paths and broadcast their signals on a well-known [[radio frequency]].  The received frequency will differ slightly from the broadcast frequency because of the movement of the satellite with respect to the receiver. By monitoring this frequency shift over a short time interval, the receiver can determine its location to one side or the other of the satellite, and several such measurements combined with a precise knowledge of the satellite's orbit can fix a particular position. Satellite orbital position errors are induced by variations in the gravity field and radar refraction, among others. These were resolved by a team led by Harold L Jury of Pan Am Aerospace Division in Florida from 1970-1973. Using real-time data assimilation and recursive estimation, the systematic and residual errors were narrowed down to a manageable level to permit accurate navigation. &lt;ref&gt;Jury, H, 1973, Application of the Kalman Filter to Real-time Navigation using Synchronous Satellites, Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, Tokyo, 945-952. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Part of an orbiting satellite's broadcast included its precise orbital data. In order to ensure accuracy, the [[US Naval Observatory|US Naval Observatory (USNO)]] continuously observed the precise orbits of these satellites. As a satellite's orbit deviated, the USNO would send the updated information to the satellite. Subsequent broadcasts from an updated satellite would contain its most recent [[ephemeris]].

Modern systems are more direct.  The satellite broadcasts a signal that contains orbital data (from which the position of the satellite can be calculated) and the precise time the signal was transmitted.  The orbital [[ephemeris]] is transmitted in a data message that is superimposed on a code that serves as a timing reference. The satellite uses an [[atomic clock]] to maintain synchronization of all the satellites in the constellation. The receiver compares the time of broadcast encoded in the transmission of three (at sea level) or four different satellites, thereby measuring the time-of-flight to each satellite. Several such measurements can be made at the same time to different satellites, allowing a continual fix to be generated in real time using an adapted version of [[trilateration]]: see [[GNSS positioning calculation]] for details.

Each distance measurement, regardless of the system being used, places the receiver on a spherical shell at the measured distance from the broadcaster. By taking several such measurements and then looking for a point where they meet, a fix is generated. However, in the case of fast-moving receivers, the position of the signal moves as signals are received from several satellites. In addition, the radio signals slow slightly as they pass through the ionosphere, and this slowing varies with the receiver's angle to the satellite, because that changes the distance through the ionosphere. The basic computation thus attempts to find the shortest directed line tangent to four oblate spherical shells centred on four satellites. Satellite navigation receivers reduce errors by using combinations of signals from multiple satellites and multiple correlators, and then using techniques such as [[Kalman filter]]ing to combine the noisy, partial, and constantly changing data into a single estimate for position, time, and velocity.

==Applications==
{{Main article|GNSS applications}}
{{further|Automotive navigation system}}
[[File:Satellite-navigation.jpg|thumb|Satellite navigation using a [[laptop]] and a [[GPS]] receiver]]
The original motivation for satellite navigation was for military applications. Satellite navigation allows precision in the delivery of weapons to targets, greatly increasing their lethality whilst reducing inadvertent casualties from mis-directed weapons. (See [[Guided bomb]]). Satellite navigation also allows forces to be directed and to locate themselves more easily, reducing the [[fog of war]].

The ability to supply satellite navigation signals is also the ability to deny their availability. The operator of a satellite navigation system potentially has the ability to degrade or eliminate satellite navigation services over any territory it desires.

===GPS===
{{Main article|Global Positioning System}}

The United States' Global Positioning System (GPS) consists of up to 32 [[medium Earth orbit]] satellites in six different [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]s, with the exact number of satellites varying as older satellites are retired and replaced. Operational since 1978 and globally available since 1994, GPS is the world's most utilized satellite navigation system.

===GLONASS===
{{Main article|GLONASS}}
The formerly [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], and now [[Russia]]n, '''''Glo'''bal'naya '''Na'''vigatsionnaya '''S'''putnikovaya '''S'''istema'', (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System or GLONASS), is a space-based satellite navigation system that provides a civilian radionavigation-satellite service and is also used by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces. GLONASS has full global coverage with 24 satellites.

===Galileo===
{{Main article|Galileo (satellite navigation)}}
The [[European Union]] and [[European Space Agency]] agreed in March 2002 to introduce their own alternative to GPS, called the [[Galileo positioning system]]. Galileo became operational on 15 December 2016 (global Early Operational Capability (EOC)) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=europa.eu |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4366_en.htm |title=Galileo goes live!|date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At an estimated cost of €3 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5286200.stm |title=Boost to Galileo sat-nav system |date=25 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the system of 30 [[Medium Earth orbit|MEO]] satellites was originally scheduled to be operational in 2010. The original year to become operational was 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/7&amp;language=en |title= Commission awards major contracts to make Galileo operational early 2014 |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first experimental satellite was launched on 28 December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/The_future_-_Galileo/First_Galileo_Launch/GIOVE-A_launch_news|title=GIOVE-A launch News|date=2005-12-28|accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo is expected to be compatible with the [[GPS modernization|modernized GPS]] system. The receivers will be able to combine the signals from both Galileo and GPS satellites to greatly increase the accuracy. Galileo is expected to be in full service in 2020 and at a substantially higher cost.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Augmentation==
[[GNSS augmentation]] is a method of improving a navigation system's attributes, such as accuracy, reliability, and availability, through the integration of external information into the calculation process, for example, the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]], the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]], the [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]], [[Differential GPS]], [[GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation]] (GAGAN) and [[inertial navigation system]]s.

===DORIS===
{{Main article|DORIS (geodesy)}}
Doppler Orbitography and Radio-positioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) is a [[France|French]] precision navigation system. Unlike other GNSS systems, it is based on static emitting stations around the world, the receivers being on satellites, in order to precisely determine their orbital position. The system may be used also for mobile receivers on land with more limited usage and coverage. Used with traditional GNSS systems, it pushes the accuracy of positions to centimetric precision (and to millimetric precision for altimetric application and also allows monitoring very tiny seasonal changes of Earth rotation and deformations), in order to build a much more precise geodesic reference system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/doris.html |title=DORIS information page |publisher=Jason.oceanobs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low Earth orbit satellite phone networks==
The two current operational low Earth orbit [[satellite phone]] networks are able to track transceiver units with accuracy of a few kilometers using doppler shift calculations from the satellite. The coordinates are sent back to the transceiver unit where they can be read using [[AT command]]s or a [[graphical user interface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://common.globalstar.com/doc/common/en/products/gsp1700_usermanual.pdf |title=Globalstar GSP-1700 manual |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyhelp.net/acrobat/jan_05/Iridium%20SBD-FAQ%201-05.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109014357/http://www.skyhelp.net/acrobat/jan_05/Iridium%20SBD-FAQ%201-05.pdf |date=November 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be used by the gateway to enforce restrictions on geographically bound calling plans.

A '''shade tree''' is a large tree whose primary role is to provide shade in the surrounding environment due to its spreading [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] and [[crown (botany)|crown]], where it may give shelter from [[sunlight]] in the heat of the summer for people who seek recreational needs in [[urban parks]] and house [[Front yard|yard]]s, and thus, also protecting them from the sun's harmful [[UV rays]] and [[sunburn]]s. Therefore, some shade trees may be grown specifically for the comfort of the population due to their convenient shelter. 

Furthermore, shade trees are also effective in reducing the energy used in cooling homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/all-about-shade-trees All About Shade Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular shade trees==
Some of the most popular shade trees in [[temperate countries]] are [[oak]]s, [[Platanaceae|plane trees]], [[willow]]s, [[birch]]es, [[beech]]es, [[maple]]s, [[ash (tree)|ashes]], [[Tilia|lindens]], and [[elm]]s. In subtropical countries like Australia and India, [[figs]] are popular choices as shade trees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.specialitytrees.com.au/trees/categories/shade-tree-a5tx6 Shade Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[tropical countries]], trees such as the [[African tulip tree]] and some [[Erythrina]] species are often planted as shade trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Products/AFDbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1756 AgroForestryTree Database - Species information] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130113150200/http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Products/AFDbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1756 |date=2013-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species===
These trees are commonly grown, and/or used, as shade trees due to their protuberant size:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.winterhill.com.au/trees/shadetree/ Winterhill Tree Farm - Shade Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/gardening/factsheets/shade-trees/9429346 ABC - Gardening Australia - Shade Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/426/426-610/426-610_pdf.pdf Selecting Landscape Plants: Shade Trees] by Diane Relf, Extension Specialist, Horticulture, Bonnie Appleton, Extension Specialist, Horticulture, [[Virginia Tech]] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Planting==
There are a few factors to consider when choosing a shade tree: [[deciduous]]ness, coverage, longevity, and the ability of the roots to damage foundations. Shade trees can enhance the privacy of a [[back garden|garden]], [[patio]], or [[back yard]], by obstructing the view of outsiders.  A disadvantage is that in cool climates, an abundance of shade trees may lead to a dank environment in any nearby buildings or gardens. Shade trees must not be planted near chimneys as flying fire sparks can ignite tree branches which could cause rapidly expanding fires.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

Planting shade trees around a home can also reduce the energy that homeowners use in the summer months. Planting shade trees in locations near a home air conditioner can keep the air conditioner cooler which helps it run more efficiently, so less energy is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arborday.org/trees/climatechange/summerShade.cfm|title=How to Plant Trees to Conserve Energy for Summer Shade - Climate Change at arborday.org|website=www.arborday.org|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Southern Levant''' is a [[Region|geographical region]] encompassing the southern half of the [[Levant]]. It corresponds approximately to modern-day [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], and [[Jordan]]; some definitions also include southern [[Lebanon]], southern [[Syria]] and/or the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. As a strictly geographical description, it is sometimes used by [[archaeologists]] and [[historians]] to avoid the religious and political connotations of other names for the area.

Like much of [[Western Asia|Southwestern Asia]], the Southern Levant is an arid region consisting mostly of [[desert]] and [[dry steppe]], with a thin strip of wetter, [[Temperate climate|temperate]] climate along the Mediterranean coast. Geographically it is dominated by the [[Jordan Rift Valley|Jordan Valley]], a section of the [[Great Rift Valley]] bisecting the region from north to south, and containing the [[Sea of Galilee]], the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Dead Sea]] – the lowest point on the earth's land surface.

The Southern Levant has a long history and is one of the areas of the world most intensively investigated by archaeologists. It is considered likely to be the first place that both [[Out of Africa I|early hominins]] and [[Recent African origin of modern humans|modern humans]] colonised outside of Africa. Consequently, it has a rich [[Stone Age]] archaeology, stretching back as early as 1.5 million years ago.

}}The Southern Levant refers to the lower half of the [[Levant]] but there is some variance of geographical definition, with the widest definition including [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[southern Syria]] and the [[Sinai|Sinai Desert]].&lt;ref name="Levy et al 2010"/&gt; In the field of archaeology, the southern Levant is "the region formerly identified as Syria-Palestine and including Canaan."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YrnsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105|title=Historical Biblical Archaeology and the Future: The New Pragmatism|last=Burke|first=Aaron A.|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781134937530|editor-last=Levy|editor-first=Thomas Evan|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The Transformation of Biblical and Syro-Palestinian Archaeology|quote=Much work continues to be done in these regions, and not surprisingly this work is now of great interest to those studying the southern Levant (i.e. the region formerly identified as Syria-Palestine and including Canaan) [...] Nevertheless, despite such a well-reasoned basis for the identification of Levantine archaeology, the adoption of this term by many scholars has been, for the most part, simply the result of individual attempts to consider a wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus than that which is suggested by the use of terms like Canaan, Israel, or even Syria-Palestine. Regardless of the manner in which the term has come into common use, for a couple of additional reasons it seems clear that the Levant will remain the term of choice. In the first place scholars have shown a penchant for the term Levant, despite the fact that the term ‘Syria-Palestine’ has been advocated since the late 1970s. This is evident from the fact that no journal or series today has adopted a title that includes ‘Syria-Palestine’. However, the journal Levant has been published since 1969 and since 1990 Ägypten und Levante has also attracted a plethora of papers relating to the archaeology of this region. Furthermore, a search through any electronic database of titles reveals an overwhelming adoption of the term ‘Levant’ when compared to ‘Syria-Palestine’ for archaeological studies. Undoubtedly, this is mostly due to the fact that ‘Syria-Palestine’ is, correctly speaking, the title for a Roman administrative division of the Levant created by Hadrian (Millar 1993). The term ‘Syria-Palestine’ also carries political overtones that inadvertently evoke current efforts to establish a full-fledged Palestinian state. Scholars have recognized, therefore, that—for at least the time being—they can spare themselves further headaches by adopting the term Levant to identify this region.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars studying the region's archaeology have adopted the term Levant (including northern and southern halves) as the "term of choice" due to it being a "wider, yet relevant, cultural corpus" that does not have the "political overtones" of Syria-Palestine.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A survey of North American dissertations shows the "overwhelming emphasis and scope of these works has been the southern Levant, an area formerly identified as Syria-Palestine including Canaan", but with most modern Ph.D. dissertations using the terms ‘Israel’ and ‘Canaan’.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The term Southern Levant has also been criticized as imprecise&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1993|title=Note éditoriale.|trans-title=Editorial remarks|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/paleo_0153-9345_1993_num_19_1_4981|journal=Paléorient|volume=19|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|quote=In gathering contributions for the present issue, it soon became apparent - and this is a generally valid point - that imprecise terminology is one of the major difficulties encountered in our research. An example is the term "Southern Levant" used as a substitute for the geographers’ "Palestine". The use of this term hides the particularism of the regions on either side of the Jordan Valley just when the discoveries of the last decade have highlighted their specificity. The lack of precision traditional terminology (agriculture, herding, pastoralism, neolithic, etc.) applied to the complex phenomena that we are studying constantly leads to misunderstandings.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an awkward name.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoT6zimQOXMC|title=Towns in Ancient Israel and in the Southern Levant|last=de Geus|first=C.

In Europe we are used to the late Roman name 'Palestine,' and the designation 'Palestinian Archaeology' has a long history. According to Byzantine usage it included CisJordan and TransJordan and even Lebanon and Sinai. In modern times, however, the name 'Palestine' has exclusively become the political designation for a restricted area. Furthermore, in the period this book deals with a region called 'Palestine' did not yet exist. Also the ancient name 'Canaan' cannot be used as it refers to an older period in history. Designations as: 'The Land(s) of the Bible' or 'the Hold Land' evoke the suspicion of a theological bias. 'The Land of Israel' does not apply to the situation because it never included Lebanon or the greater part of modern Jordan. Therefore I have joined those who today advocate the designation 'Southern Levant.' Although I confess that it is an awkward name, it is at least strictly geographical.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0sHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|title=Introduction to the Old Testament|last=Arnold|first=Bill T.|date=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780521879651|location=Cambridge|pages=37|language=|quote=What we call the land of the Bible today has potential for misunderstanding. This small strip of land in the Southern Levant has been occupied by so many, fought over and carved up so many times, that it is hard to know just what to call it. The use of 'Israel' implies to some that all of it belongs today only to the Jews as legitimate descendants of OT Israel. Similarly, 'Palestine' has a longstanding usage, but may imply that all of it belongs to Palestinian Arabs exclusively. Both of these terms could be used strictly for geography. But because of the contemporary Israeli-Palestinian conflict, both terms also may introduce misunderstanding. And biblical scholars have no universal agreement on this topic. 'Syria-Palestine' is often used, as here, for geographical precision. But it is only the southern portion of Syria-Palestine that was occupied by ancient Israel, and it does not always communicate sufficiently. 'Canaan' is an ancient name, but it also is not exactly conterminous with the land occupied by ancient Israel. I have used 'Southern Levant' occasionally here but admit that this is a strange expression. l will most often refer simply to 'Israel,' by which I mean the territory of national Israel in the OT, but hope the reader will understand no modern political claims by this use.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Southern Levant has been described in academic discourse as a "at least a strictly geographical" description of the region, avoiding religious and political connotations of names such as "Canaan", "Holy Land", "Land of Israel", or "Palestine".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Southern Levant topographic map.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Topographic map of the Southern Levant]]
{{See also|Geography of Israel|Geography of Palestine|Geography of Jordan}}
The Southern Levant lies on the [[Eastern Mediterranean|eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea]], in the world region known variously as the [[Near East]], the [[Middle East]] or [[Western Asia|Western or Southwestern Asia]]. It is bordered to the east, southeast and southwest by the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]], [[Arabian Desert|Arabian]] and [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] deserts, respectively.&lt;ref name="Routledge 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner &amp; Killebrew 2014"/&gt; Some definitions include parts of these deserts in the region.&lt;ref name="Yaker 1998"/&gt; The [[Litani River]] is commonly considered the dividing line between the Southern Levant and the Northern Levant (i.e. [[Syria (region)|Syria]]),&lt;ref name="Yaker 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peregrine &amp; Ember 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner &amp; Killebrew 2014"/&gt; or sometimes the [[Orontes River]], also in central Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Routledge 2004"/&gt;

For the most part, the climate of the Southern Levant is [[arid]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], however a narrow strip along the coast experiences a [[Temperate climate|temperate]], [[Mediterranean climate]] due to its proximity to the sea.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziv|first=Baruch|last2=Dayan|first2=Uri|last3=Kushnir|first3=Yohanan|last4=Roth|first4=Chaggi|last5=Enzel|first5=Yehouda|date=2006-01-01|title=Regional and global atmospheric patterns governing rainfall in the southern Levant|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.1238/abstract|journal=International Journal of Climatology|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=55–73|doi=10.1002/joc.1238|issn=1097-0088}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average annual rainfall decreases sharply away from the coast, from over {{convert|1000|mm|abbr=off}} per year in [[Galilee]], to {{convert|200|-|400|mm|abbr=off}} in the [[Jordan Rift Valley|Rift Valley]], and less than {{convert|50|mm|abbr=off}} in the eastern deserts and the [[Negev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziv|first=Baruch|last2=Saaroni|first2=Hadas|last3=Pargament|first3=Roee|last4=Harpaz|first4=Tzvi|last5=Alpert|first5=Pinhas|date=2013-02-22|title=Trends in rainfall regime over Israel, 1975–2010, and their relationship to large-scale variability|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-013-0414-x|journal=Regional Environmental Change|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=1751–1764|doi=10.1007/s10113-013-0414-x|issn=1436-3798}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the region, precipitation is both highly seasonal―most rain falls between October and May, and hardly any in the summer—and subject to large, unpredictable interannual variation.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Temperature is also highly variable, with cool winters and hot summers.

The [[Jordan River]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;bisects much of the region into the [[Cisjordan]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].

==Archaeological findings==
{{See also|Prehistory of the Levant|History of the ancient Levant}}

The archaeology of the southern Levant is generally conceived as a series of phases or stages in [[human]] cultural and evolutionary development based, for the most part, on tool technology for early pre-historic, proto-historic and early historic periods. Later phases are generally associated with historical periods and are named accordingly.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} While there is no single, accepted sequence that all archaeologists agree upon, the basic conventions indicate a number of [[Stone Age]]s, followed by a Copper/Stone age, in turn followed by a [[Bronze Age]]. The names given to them, derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]], are also used widely for other regions. The different ages in turn are often divided up into sequential or sometimes parallel chrono-cultural facies, sometimes called “cultures” or “periods”. Sometimes their names are derived from [[History of Europe|European prehistory]], at other times from local sites, often where they were first discovered.

Archaeologically, it is among the most extensively excavated regions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/10962261/A_passion_for_cultural_difference._Archaeology_and_ethnicity_in_the_southern_Levant|title=A passion for cultural difference.

===Pre-history and Stone Age===
The Southern Levant is amongst the oldest inhabited parts of Eurasia, being on one of three plausible routes by which early [[Hominini|hominins]] could have [[Out of Africa I|dispersed out of Africa]] (along with the [[Bab-el-Mandeb|Bab al Mandab]] and the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fleagle, John G., Shea, John J., Grine, Frederick E., Baden, Andrea L., Leakey, Richard E., "Out of Africa I: The First Hominin Colonization of Eurasia", Springer 2010 pp 247-273.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Homo erectus]]'' left Africa and became the first hominin species to colonise Europe and Asia approximately two million years ago, probably via the Southern Levant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abbate|first=Ernesto|last2=Sagri|first2=Mario|date=2012-07-26|title=Early to Middle Pleistocene Homo dispersals from Africa to Eurasia: Geological, climatic and environmental constraints|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618211001479|journal=Quaternary International|series=The genus Homo from Africa to Europe: evolution of terrestrial ecosystems and dispersal routes|volume=267|pages=3–19|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2011.02.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rolland|first=Nicolas|date=2013-12-06|title=The Early Pleistocene human dispersals in the Circum-Mediterranean Basin and initial peopling of Europe: Single or multiple pathways?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618213003698|journal=Quaternary International|series=Middle to Upper Palaeolithic biological and cultural shift in Eurasia II|volume=316|pages=59–72|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2013.06.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase of the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene epoch]] the region was wetter and greener, allowing ''H. erectus'' to find places with fresh water as it followed other African animals that were dispersing out of Africa at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carotenuto|first=F.|last2=Tsikaridze|first2=N.|last3=Rook|first3=L.|last4=Lordkipanidze|first4=D.|last5=Longo|first5=Laura|last6=Condemi|first6=Silvana|last7=Raia|first7=P.|date=2016-06-01|title=Venturing out safely: The biogeography of Homo erectus dispersal out of Africa|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248416000294|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=95|pages=1–12|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such location was '[[Ubeidiya]], on the southern shore of the [[Sea of Galilee]], where some of the oldest hominin remains in Eurasia have been discovered, dating to between 1.2 million and 1.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNuoCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|title=World Prehistory and Archaeology|last=Chazan|first=Michael|date=2015-10-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317347514|location=|pages=82|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martínez-Navarro|first=Bienvenido|last2=Belmaker|first2=Miriam|last3=Bar-Yosef|first3=Ofer|date=2009-05-01|title=The large carnivores from ‘Ubeidiya (early Pleistocene, Israel): biochronological and biogeographical implications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248409000256|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=56|issue=5|pages=514–524|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2009.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[stone age]]s, when stone tools prevailed and make up the bulk of artifacts, are followed by periods when other technologies came into use. They lent their names to the different periods. The basic framework for the southern [[Levant]] is, as follows:  [[Paleolithic]] or Old Stone Age is often divided up into phases called, from early-to-late: [[Lower Paleolithic]], Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic. An [[Epipaleolithic (Levant)|Epipaleolithic]] (latest Paleolithic) period, also known as [[Mesolithic]] (transition to Neolithic) follows and is, in turn succeeded by a [[Neolithic]] (New Stone Age).

The following '''[[Chalcolithic]] period''' includes the first evidence of [[Nonferrous archaeometallurgy of the Southern Levant|metallurgy]] with copper making its appearance. However, as [[stone technology]] remains prevalent, the name, Chalcolithic (Copper/Stone) age combines the two.

===Bronze Age===
[[Bronze]] is used for the following periods, but is actually a misnomer for a good part of that time. An Early [[Bronze Age]] is divided into three major phases, Early Bronze I, II and III, but copper and not bronze was the most common [[metal]] in use, while [[stone technology]] continued to contribute the bulk of [[tool]]s. Early Bronze III is followed by another period, alternately named Early Bronze IV, Middle Bronze I, Intermediate Bronze or Early Bronze-Middle Bronze. In this period the name is apt; true bronze (a [[tin]] [[alloy]] of [[copper]]) makes its appearance in this time span.

The next period is generally known as Middle Bronze II and is generally broken down into two sub-periods, Middle Bronze IIa and Middle Bronze IIb. Some scholars acknowledge a Middle Bronze III. The next period is known as Late Bronze and is often sub-divided into Late Bronze I and II.

===Iron Age===
The introduction of [[iron]], although relatively rare, especially in the earliest phases, caused the following phase to be named the [[Iron Age]]. It is variously sub-divided into Iron I, Iron II and sometimes Iron III, with subdivisions becoming increasingly popular as sequences become better known. Some archaeologists suggest that there in the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, the large cultural differences are explained by foreign invasion, that is, the introduction of new ethnicity. More recent evidence indicates that the large culture changes were not the result of a foreign invasion. Rather, the Iron Age people of the southern Levant were related to their Bronze Age predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ullinger|first=Jaime M.|last2=Sheridan|first2=Susan Guise|last3=Hawkey|first3=Diane E.|last4=Turner|first4=Christy G.|last5=Cooley|first5=Robert|date=2005-10-01|title=Bioarchaeological analysis of cultural transition in the southern Levant using dental nonmetric traits|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=128|issue=2|pages=466–476|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20074|issn=0002-9483|pmid=15895418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later historical periods===
The post Iron Age is generally thought of as historical and accordingly names of periods reflect this. The very latest Iron Age phase is sometimes called “[[Assyria]]n” and the following period is universally known as the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] period.

The 333 BC conquest of the region is accepted as the beginning of the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] period. The [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical book]] [[2 Maccabees]] records: "Apollonius the son of Tharseas, who at that time was governor of Celesyria and Phenicia", Celesyria being the transliteration of [[Coele-Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Maccabees|3:8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is followed by Early [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and Late Roman periods. The 4th century is recognized as the beginning of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period that lasted until the [[Arab]] conquest of the region.

Later periods are alternately known as Early Arab and sub-periods by the names of reigning dynasties. The [[Crusades|Crusader]] conquest of the region is known, appropriately as the Crusader period and it is followed by a [[Mameluks|Mameluke]] period after the conquering dynasty. In 1517 the [[Ottoman empire]] conquered the region and gave its name to the period that lasted until 1917, when the British conquered it in [[World War I]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">Temporary adjustments are set of operations which are performed on a [[theodolite]] to make it ready for taking observations. These include its initial setting up on a tripod or other stand, centering, levelling up and focusing of eyepiece.

==Initial setting==
[[File:theodolite vermeer.svg|thumb|The measurement axes and scales of a theodolite]]
&lt;div&gt;The initial setting operation includes fixing the theodolite on a [[tripod]], along with approximate levelling and centering over the station mark. For setting up the instrument, the tripod is placed over the station with its legs widely spread so that the centre of the tripod head lies above the station point and its head approximately level (by eye estimation). The instrument is then fixed with the tripod by screwing through the trivet.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The height of the instrument should be such that observer can see through [[telescope]] conveniently. After this, a [[plumb bob]] is suspended from the bottom of the instrument and it should approximately align with the station mark.&lt;/div&gt;

==Centering==
[[image:Tribrach for surveying instruments.JPG|right|thumb|A tribrach with an optical plummet (the black cylinder pointing to the left lower corner of the image).]]
&lt;div&gt;Centering means bringing the [[vertical axis]] of the theodolite exactly over the station mark.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher, page no. 341. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; Exact centering is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the sliding head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the plumb bob is exactly over the station mark. After the exact centering, the screw clamping ring is tightened. This can be done by means of a forced centering plate or [[tribrach (instrument)|tribrach]]. An optical or laser plummet is normally used for the most accurate setting. The centering and levelling of the instrument is interactive and iterative; a re-levelling may change the centering, so error each is eliminated in successively until negligible.

==Levelling==
[[File:Green bull's eye level (level).jpg|thumb|Bull's eye level with alignment rings]]
[[File:Theodolite in use.JPG|thumb|Theodolite in use with cones to protect tripod positioning]]
Leveling of an instrument is done to make it vertical axis with respect to the apparent force of gravity at the station.

For two spirit vials at right angles;

# Bring one of the level tubes parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward. The bubble moves in the same direction as the left thumb.
# The bubble of the other level tube is then brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating the third foot screw either inward or outward. [In step 1 itself, the other plate level will be parallel to the line joining the third foot screw and the centre of the line joining the previous two foot screws.]
# Repeat Step 2 and step 3 in the same quadrant till both the bubble remain central.
# By rotating the upper part of the instrument through 180°, the level tube is brought parallel to first two-foot screws in reverse order. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment.
Otherwise, repeat the whole process starting from step 1 to step 5.

The same principle applies for a bulls-eye level:

# Bring the level parallel to any two of the foot screws, by rotating the upper part of the instrument.
# The bubble is brought to the centre of the level tube by rotating both the foot screws either inward or outward.
# Rotate the upper part of the instrument through 180°, so the level is over the remaining foot screw. The bubble will remain in the centre if the instrument is in permanent adjustment. If not adjust this screw to halve the error. Then rotate back through 180 degrees and check the error. Adjust those screws to halve the residual error.  Continue until the bubble is always central on the ring.

==Focusing==
To obtain an accurate clear sighting, the cross hairs should be in focus; adjust the eyepiece to do this.

* '''Focusing of eyepiece lens'''.
For focusing of the eye piece, point the telescope to the [[sky]] or hold a piece of white paper in front of telescope. Move the eye-piece in and out until a distinct sharp black image of the cross-hairs is seen. This confirms proper focusing.&lt;ref&gt;Text book on surveying by prof. C.L Kochher on Page no. 342. Retrieved on 16 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
To Clearly view the object being sighted Focus the objective lens.

* '''Focusing of objective lens'''.
It is done for each independent observation to bring the image of the object in the plane of cross hairs. It includes following steps of operation: First, direct the [[telescope]] towards the object for observation. Next, turn the focusing screw until the image of the object appears clear and sharp as the observer looks through properly focused eye-piece. If focusing has been done properly, there will be no parallax i.e., there will be no apparent movement of the image relative to the cross hairs if the observer moves his eye from one side to the other or from top to bottom.

The '''Travellers Club''' is a private [[gentlemen's club]] situated at 106 [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is the oldest of the surviving [[List of gentlemen's clubs in London|Pall Mall clubs]] and one of the most exclusive, having been established in 1819. It was described as "the [[quintessential English]] gentleman's club" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/nov/07/travel/tr-spano7 Touring the manly realm of London's Travellers Club] Los Angeles Times, November 7, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The original concept of the club, by [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]] and others, dates from the conclusion of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They envisaged a club where gentlemen who travelled abroad might meet and offer hospitality to distinguished foreign visitors. The original rules of 1819 excluded from membership anyone ''“who has not travelled out of the British islands to a distance of at least five hundred miles from London in a direct line”''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/entertainment/travellersclub.htm|title=Victorian London - Entertainment and Recreation - Clubs - Travellers Club; (Peter Cunningham, Hand-Book of London, 1850)|website=www.victorianlondon.org|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The members of the club's first Committee included the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]] (later Prime Minister), [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]] (after whom [[Auckland]], New Zealand is named), the [[Henry Petty-FitzMaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] (who had already served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later refused office as Prime Minister) and [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]] (later Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister).

Subsequent members included statesmen and travellers such as Prime Minister [[George Canning]],&lt;ref name=TCH&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Club History and Building| work =| publisher =The Travellers Club| date =| url =http://www.thetravellersclub.org.uk/club/| doi =| accessdate =2008-09-23| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080726164615/http://www.thetravellersclub.org.uk/club/| archivedate =2008-07-26| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|the Duke of Wellington]],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], Prime Minister [[Arthur Balfour]],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Prime Minister [[Alec Douglas-Home]], [[Francis Beaufort]]&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; (creator of the [[Beaufort scale]]), [[Robert FitzRoy]] of [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']],&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Sir [[William Edward Parry]]&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; (explorer of the [[Northwest Passage]]), Sir [[Roderick Murchison]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} (after whom the [[Murchison crater]] on the [[Moon]] is named) and Sir [[Wilfred Thesiger]].&lt;ref name=TCH /&gt; Novelist [[Anthony Powell]] was a member, and the club is featured in various guises in the work of [[Graham Greene]], [[Jules Verne]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and John le Carré.

The club's members include members of the British and foreign royal families, the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] whilst in office, and various ambassadors to London; a tradition still continued today and there is also a special category of membership for particularly distinguished travellers, explorers and travel writers. Such well-known current members include Field Marshal [[Edwin Bramall|Lord Bramall]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and [[Terry Waite]].&lt;ref name=TGP&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4718049/So-what-should-an-English-gentleman-do.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=So what should an English gentleman do? | date=1999-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its membership remains exclusive, although there are a number of connections with other clubs throughout the world whose members may use its premises from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;Club Guide Accessed May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Welby]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, announced in 2014 that he would resign from the club, owing to its refusal to admit women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10972976/Archbishop-of-Canterbury-will-quit-gentlemens-club-that-voted-against-female-members.html|title=Archbishop of Canterbury will quit gentlemen's club that voted against female members|first=Raziye|last=Akkoc|date=17 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premises==
The club's original premises were at 12 Waterloo Place. It moved to 49 Pall Mall in 1821 (a building which had once been occupied by [[Brooks's]]). However, it quickly outgrew this building and in 1826 the members decided to spend £25,000 on the construction of a purpose built club house on the present site at 106 Pall Mall, backing onto Carlton gardens.

The architect was Sir [[Charles Barry]] who was later to be the architect for the [[Houses of Parliament]], and the Travellers Club building proved to be one of his masterpieces. It takes the form of a [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] palace which is said to have been inspired by [[Raphael]]'s Palazzo Pandolfini in Florence. It was completed in 1832, with the tower (which had been in Barry's original design) added in 1842.

The club building includes a smoking room (a large common room which looks over Carlton Gardens), the cocktail bar and adjacent Bramall room (which gives access to [[Carlton House Terrace#Carlton Gardens|Carlton Gardens]]), the Outer Morning Room (a large drawing room overlooking Pall Mall, and connecting to an Inner Morning Room), and the dining room (known as the Coffee Room). ''[[The Times]]'' on 10 January 2004 noted ''"the wonderful dining, heavy on fish and game (partridges to [[potted shrimps]]) with echoes of public school food (bread pudding) and a superb wine cellar"''.

The magnificent library is decorated with a cast of the [[Bassae Frieze]] from the 5th century BCE [[Greek temple]] of Apollo Epicurius at [[Bassae]]. The originals of this frieze were discovered by the architect [[Charles Robert Cockerell]], who was on the first Committee of the Club in 1819, and they are now in the [[British Museum]]. The library has a large and important collection of books, from the antiquarian to the modern, mainly on travel.

There are a number of bedrooms at the club for out-of-town members. The dress code is formal at all times.

An '''underwater acoustic positioning system'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dosits.org/gallery/tech/n/at1.htm University of Rhode Island: Discovery of Sound in the Sea]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underwater Acoustic Positioning Systems, P.H. '''Milne''' 1983, {{ISBN|0-87201-012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a system for the tracking and navigation of underwater vehicles or divers by means of acoustic distance and/or direction measurements, and subsequent position triangulation. Underwater acoustic positioning systems are commonly used in a wide variety of underwater work, including oil and gas exploration, [[Oceanography|ocean sciences]], salvage operations, [[Maritime archaeology|marine archaeology]], law enforcement and military activities.

==Method of operation==
Figure 1 describes the general method of operation of an acoustic positioning system,&lt;ref&gt;The ROV Manual, Robert D. '''Christ''' and Robert L. '''Wernli''' Sr 2007, pages 96-103, {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8148-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is an example of a long baseline (LBL) positioning system for [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]

[[Image:LBL Acoustic Positioning Aquamap ROV.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Figure 1: Method of the operation of a Long Baseline (LBL) acoustic positioning system for ROV]]

;Baseline station deployment and survey

Acoustic positioning systems measure positions relative to a framework of baseline stations, which must be deployed prior to operations.  In the case of a long-baseline (LBL) system, a set of three or more baseline transponders are deployed on the sea floor.  The location of the baseline transponders either [[local coordinates|relative to each other]] or in [[Geographic coordinate system|global coordinates]] must then be measured precisely. Some systems assist this task with an automated acoustic self-survey, and in other cases [[GPS]] is used to establish the position of each baseline transponder as it is deployed or after deployment.

;Tracking or navigation operations

Following the baseline deployment and survey, the acoustic positioning system is ready for operations.  In the long baseline example (see figure 1), an interrogator (A) is mounted on the ROV that is to be tracked.  The interrogator transmits an acoustic signal that is received by the baseline transponders (B, C, D, E). The reply of the baseline transponders is received again at the ROV. The signal time-of-flight or the corresponding distances A-B, A-C, A-D and A-E are transmitted via the ROV umbilical (F) to the surface, where the ROV position is computed and displayed on a tracking screen.  The acoustic distance measurements may be augmented by [[Pressure sensor|depth sensor data]] to obtain better positioning accuracy in the three-dimensional underwater space.

Acoustic positioning systems can yield an accuracy of a few centimeters to tens of meters and can be used over operating distance from tens of meters to tens of kilometers.  Performance depends strongly on the type and model of the positioning system, its configuration for a particular job, and the characteristics of the underwater acoustic environment at the work site.

==Classes==

Underwater acoustic positioning systems are generally categorized into three broad types or classes&lt;ref&gt;'''Milne''', chapters 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Christ and Wernli''', sections 4.2.6-4.2.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Long Baseline Acoustic Positioning System|Long-baseline (LBL) systems]], as in figure 1 above, use a sea-floor baseline transponder network.  The transponders are typically mounted in the corners of the operations site.  LBL systems yield very high accuracy of generally better than 1 m and sometimes as good as 0.01m along with very robust positions&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/deeparch/www/research/precisionnav.html MIT Deepwater Archaeology Research Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/deeparch/www/publications/papers/FoleyMindell2002.pdf B.P. Foley and D.A. Mindell, "Precision Survey and Archaeological Methodology in Deep Water," ENALIA The Journal of the Hellenic Institute of Marine Archaeology, Vol. VI, 49-56, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that the transponders are installed in the reference frame of the work site itself (i.e. on the sea floor), the wide transponder spacing results in an ideal geometry for position computations, and the LBL system operates without an acoustic path to the (potentially distant) sea surface.
     
[[Ultra-short baseline|Ultra-short-baseline (USBL) systems]]  and the related super-short-baseline (SSBL) systems rely on a small (ex. 230&amp;nbsp;mm across), tightly integrated transducer array that is typically mounted on the bottom end of a strong, rigid transducer pole which is installed either on the side or in some cases on the bottom of a surface vessel.&lt;ref&gt;'''Milne''', chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Christ and Wernli''', section 4.2.6.3&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike LBL and SBL systems, which determine position by measuring multiple distances, the USBL transducer array is used to measure the target ''distance'' from the transducer pole by using signal run time, and the target ''direction'' by measuring the [[phase shift]] of the reply signal as seen by the individual elements of the transducer array.  The combination of distance and direction fixes the position of the tracked target relative to the surface vessel.  Additional sensors including GPS, a gyro or electronic compass and a vertical reference unit are then used to compensate for the changing position and orientation (pitch, roll, bearing) of the surface vessel and its transducer pole.  USBL systems offer the advantage of not requiring a sea floor transponder array.  The disadvantage is that positioning accuracy and robustness is not as good as for LBL systems. The reason is that the fixed angle resolved by a USBL system translates to a larger position error at greater distance. Also, the multiple sensors needed for the USBL transducer pole position and orientation compensation each introduce additional errors. Finally, the non-uniformity of the underwater acoustic environment cause signal refractions and reflections that have a greater impact on USBL positioning than is the case for the LBL geometry.

[[Short Baseline Acoustic Positioning System|Short-baseline (SBL) systems]] use a baseline consisting of three or more individual sonar transducers that are connected by wire to a central control box. Accuracy depends on transducer spacing and mounting method. When a wider spacing is employed as when working from a large working barge or when operating from a dock or other fixed platform, the performance can be similar to LBL systems.  When operating from a small boat where transducer spacing is tight, accuracy is reduced.  Like USBL systems, SBL systems are frequently mounted on boats and ships, but specialized modes of deployment are common too. For example, the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] uses a SBL system to position the [[Jason (ROV)|Jason]] deep-ocean ROV relative to its associated MEDEA [[depressor weight]] with a reported accuracy of 9&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/mindell/www/Publications/MTSsharpspaper.pdf Integrating Precision Relative Positioning Into JASON/MEDEA ROV Operations, Bingham et al., MTS Journal Spring 2006 (Volume 40, Number 1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GPS intelligent buoys]] (GIB) systems are inverted LBL devices where the transducers are replaced by floating buoys, self-positioned by GPS. The tracked position is calculated in realtime at the surface from the Time-Of-Arrival (TOAs) of the acoustic signals sent by the underwater device, and acquired by the buoys. Such configuration allow fast, calibration-free deployment with an accuracy similar to LBL systems. At the opposite of LBL, SBL or USBL systems, GIB systems use one-way acoustic signals from the emitter to the buoys, making it less sensitive to surface or wall reflections. GIB systems are used to track AUVs, torpedoes, or divers, may be used to localize airplanes black-boxes, and may be used to determine the impact coordinates of inert or live weapons for weapon testing and training purposes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tridentresearch.com/pubs/Weapon_Scoring_Results_from_GPS_Acoustic_System.pdf Kayser, J.R., Cardoza, M.A., et. al., "Weapon Scoring Results from a GPS Acoustic Weapons Test and Training System", Institute of Navigation National Technical Meeting, San Diego, CA, 24-26 January 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tridentresearch.com/pubs/InsideGNSS_8x11.pdf Cardoza, M.A., Kayser, J.R., &amp; Wade, B.

==History and examples of use==

[[Image:USNS Mizar.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Figure 2a: An acoustic short baseline (SBL) positioning system was installed on the ''USNS Mizar'' during the search dives to the wreckage of the submarine ''USS Thresher'']]
[[Image:Bathyscaphe Trieste.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Figure 2b: The bathyscaphe ''Trieste'' was guided by that acoustic positioning system to the ''Thresher'']]

An early use of underwater acoustic positioning systems, credited with initiating the modern day development of these systems,&lt;ref&gt;'''Milne''', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; involved the loss of the American nuclear submarine [[USS Thresher (SSN-593)|USS ''Thresher'']] on 10 April 1963 in a water depth of 2560m.&lt;ref&gt;'''Christ and Wernle''', page 96&lt;/ref&gt;  An acoustic short baseline (SBL) positioning system was installed on the oceanographic vessel [[USNS Mizar (T-AGOR-11)|USNS ''Mizar'']].  This system was used to guide the bathyscaphe [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste 1]] to the wreck site.  Yet, the state of the technology was still so poor that out of ten search dives by Trieste 1, visual contact was only made once with the wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;'''Milne''', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Acoustic positioning was again used in 1966, to aid in the search and subsequent recovery of a nuclear bomb lost [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|during the crash of a B-52 bomber]] at sea off the coast of Spain.

In the 1970s, oil and gas exploration in deeper waters required improved underwater positioning accuracy to place drill strings into the exact position referenced earlier thorough seismic instrumentation&lt;ref&gt;'''Christ and Wernli''', section 4.2.1&lt;/ref&gt; and to perform other underwater construction tasks.

[[Image:Mir front.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Figure 3: The Russian deep sea submersibles ''MIR-1'' and ''MIR-2'' searched the wreck site of the Japanese submarine ''I-52'' in 1998. A LBL positioning system was used to guide and document the progressing search over multiple dives]]

But, the technology also started to be used in other applications.  In 1998, salvager Paul Tidwell and his company Cape Verde Explorations led an expedition to the wreck site of the World War 2 [[Japanese submarine I-52 (1943)|Japanese cargo submarine I-52]] in the mid-Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Dive, National Geographic Magazine October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Resting at a depth of 5240 meters, it had been located and then identified using side scan sonar and an underwater tow sled in 1995. War-time records indicated the I-52 was bound for Germany, with a cargo including 146 gold bars in 49 metal boxes.  This time, Mr. Tidwell's company had hired the Russian oceanographic vessel, the ''Akademik Mstislav Keldysh'' with its two manned deep-ocean  submersibles ''MIR-1'' and ''MIR-2'' (figure 3). In order to facilitate precise navigation across the debris field and assure a thorough search, ''MIR-1'' deployed a long baseline transponder network on the first dive. Over a series of seven dives by each submersible, the debris field was progressively searched. The LBL positioning record indicated the broadening search coverage after each dive, allowing the team to concentrate on yet unsearched areas during the following dive.  No gold was found, but the positioning system had documented the extent of the search.

In recent years, several trends in underwater acoustic positioning have emerged.  One is the introduction of compound systems such the combination of LBL and USBL in a so-called LUSBL&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dynamic-positioning.com/dp2002/acoustics_flexible_davis.pdf Flexible Acoustic Positioning System Architecture, Davis, MTS Dynamic Positioning Conference 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; configuration to enhance performance. These systems are generally used in the offshore oil &amp; gas sector and other high-end applications.  Another trend is the introduction of compact, task optimized systems for a variety of specialized purposes. For example, the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] commissioned a system (figure 4), which continually measures the opening area and geometry of a fish sampling net during a trawl. That information helps the department improve the accuracy of their fish stock assessments in the [[Sacramento River Delta]].

[[Image:NetTrack Operation.jpg|thumb|640px|center|Figure 4: NetTrack is an example of a special-purpose underwater acoustic positioning system of the SBL type, designed to measure the opening geometry and area of a trawl net for accurate fish stock assessment purposes. Left: Four small responders (A, B, C, D) are mounted in the corners of the trawl net opening and wired via junction bottle (E) and umbilical (F) to a surface station computer. Center: The net is deployed. Right: The surface station computer sends instructions to one responder (ex. A) to transmit, while instructing the other responders (ex. B, C, D) to receive. By this method all six distances (A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D) are measured. The four sides of the opening and one diagonal are used to triangulate the trawl net opening geometry and area. The second diagonal is available to compute a measurement error metric for data quality verification.]]

'''Urban design''' is the process of designing and shaping the physical features of cities, towns and villages and planning for the provision of municipal services to residents and visitors. In contrast to architecture, which focuses on the design of individual buildings, urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings, streets and public spaces, whole neighborhoods and districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making urban areas functional, attractive, and sustainable.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/49f234rd|author=Boeing|title=LEED-ND and Livability Revisited|journal=Berkeley Planning Journal|date=2014|volume=27|pages=31–55|accessdate=2015-04-15|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban design is an inter-disciplinary field that utilizes elements of many built environment professions, including [[landscape architecture]], [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], [[civil engineering]] and [[municipal engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). [http://plt.sagepub.com/content/12/2/177.short Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems]. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for professionals in all these disciplines to practice urban design. In more recent times different sub-subfields of urban design have emerged such as strategic urban design, [[landscape urbanism]], [[water-sensitive urban design]], and [[sustainable urbanism]].

Urban design demands an understanding of a wide range of subjects from physical geography to social science, and an appreciation for disciplines, such as [[real estate development]], [[urban economics]], [[political economy]] and [[social theory]].

Urban design is about making connections between people and places, movement and urban form, nature and the built fabric. Urban design draws together the many strands of place-making, environmental stewardship, social equity and economic viability into the creation of places with distinct beauty and identity. Urban design draws these and other strands together creating a vision for an area and then deploying the resources and skills needed to bring the vision to life.

Urban design theory deals primarily with the design and management of [[public space]] (i.e. the 'public environment', 'public realm' or 'public domain'), and the way public places are experienced and used.  Public space includes the totality of spaces used freely on a day-to-day basis by the general public, such as streets, plazas, parks and public infrastructure.  Some aspects of privately owned spaces, such as building facades or domestic gardens, also contribute to public space and are therefore also considered by urban design theory. Important writers on urban design theory include [[Christopher Alexander]], [[Peter Calthorpe]], [[Gordon Cullen]], [[Andres Duany]], [[Jane Jacobs]], [[Mitchell Joachim]], [[Jan Gehl]], [[Allan Jacobs|Allan B. Jacobs]], [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]], [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Colin Rowe]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[William H. Whyte]], [[Camillo Sitte]], Bill Hillier ([[Space syntax]]) and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]].

==History==

Although contemporary professional use of the term 'urban design' dates from the mid-20th century, urban design as such has been practiced throughout history. Ancient examples of carefully planned and designed [[cities]] exist in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas, and are particularly well known within Classical Chinese, Roman and Greek cultures (see [[Hippodamus of Miletus]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

European Medieval cities are often, and often erroneously, regarded as exemplars of undesigned or 'organic' city development.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} There are many examples of considered urban design in the Middle Ages (see, e.g., David Friedman, ''Florentine New Towns: Urban Design in the Late Middle Ages'', MIT 1988).  In England, many of the towns listed in the 9th century [[Burghal Hidage]] were designed on a grid, examples including [[Southampton]], [[Wareham, Dorset]] and [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire]], having been rapidly created to provide a defensive network against Danish invaders.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} 12th century western Europe brought renewed focus on urbanisation as a means of stimulating economic growth and generating revenue.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The [[burgage]] system dating from that time and its associated burgage plots brought a form of self-organising design to medieval towns.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  Rectangular grids were used in the [[Bastides]] of 13th and 14th century Gascony, and the new towns of England created in the same period.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Throughout history, design of [[street]]s and deliberate configuration of [[public spaces]] with [[buildings]] have reflected contemporaneous social norms or philosophical and religious beliefs (see, e.g., [[Erwin Panofsky]], ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'', Meridian Books, 1957). Yet the link between designed urban space and human mind appears to be [[wikt:bidirectional|bidirectional]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Indeed, the reverse impact of [[urban structure]] upon human behaviour and upon thought is evidenced by both [[environmental psychology|observational]] study and historical record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} There are clear indications of impact through [[Renaissance]] urban design on the thought of [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] (see, e.g., Abraham Akkerman, "Urban planning in the founding of Cartesian thought," ''Philosophy and Geography'' 4(1), 1973). Already [[René Descartes]] in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' had attested to the impact Renaissance planned new towns had upon his own thought, and much evidence exists that the Renaissance streetscape was also the perceptual stimulus that had led to the development of coordinate geometry (see, e.g., Claudia Lacour Brodsky, ''Lines of Thought: Discourse, Architectonics, and the Origins of Modern Philosophy'', Duke 1996).

The beginnings of modern urban design in Europe are associated with the [[Renaissance]] but, especially, with the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Spanish colonial cities were often planned, as were some towns settled by other imperial cultures.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} These sometimes embodied utopian ambitions as well as aims for functionality and good governance, as with [[James Oglethorpe]]'s plan for [[Savannah, Georgia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In the [[Baroque]] period the design approaches developed in French formal gardens such as [[Gardens of Versailles|Versailles]] were extended into urban development and redevelopment. In this period, when modern professional specialisations did not exist, urban design was undertaken by people with skills in areas as diverse as [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[garden design]], [[surveying]], [[astronomy]], and [[military engineering]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries, urban design was perhaps most closely linked with surveyors (engineers) and architects. The increase in urban populations brought with it problems of epidemic disease,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} the response to which was a focus on public health, the rise in the UK of [[municipal engineering]] and the inclusion in British legislation of provisions such as minimum widths of street in relation to heights of buildings in order to ensure adequate light and [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Much of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederick Law Olmsted|url=http://www.fredericklawolmsted.com|publisher=fredericklawolmsted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; work was concerned with urban design, and the newly formed profession of landscape architecture also began to play a significant role in the late 19th century.

===Modern urban design===
[[File:Lorategi-hiriaren diagrama 1902.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ebenezer Howard]]'s influential 1902 diagram, illustrating urban growth through [[Garden city movement|garden city]] "off-shoots"]]
[[Urban planning]] focuses on public health and urban design. Within the discipline, modern urban design developed.

At the turn of the 20th century, planning and architecture underwent a paradigm shift because of societal pressures. During this time, cities were industrializing at a tremendous rate; private business largely dictated the pace and style of this development. The expansion created many hardships for the [[working poor]] and concern for health and safety increased. However, the [[laissez-faire]] style of government, in fashion for most of the [[Victorian era]], was starting to give way to a [[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]]. This gave more power to the public. The public wanted the government to provide citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments. Around 1900, modern urban design emerged from developing theories on how to mitigate the consequences of the [[industrial age]].

The first modern urban planning theorist was Sir [[Ebenezer Howard]]. His ideas, although utopian, were adopted around the world because they were highly practical. He initiated the garden city movement in 1898 [[garden city movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Urban_and_Regional_Planning.html?id=LFLydtcQf54C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Urban and Regional Planning|author=Peter Hall, Mark Tewdwr-Jones|year=2010|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His garden cities were intended to be planned, self-contained communities surrounded by parks. Howard wanted the cities to be proportional with separate areas of residences, industry, and agriculture. Inspired by the [[Utopian]] novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' and [[Henry George]]'s work ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', Howard published his book ''[[Garden Cities of To-morrow]]'' in 1898. His work is an important reference in the history of urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rudi.net/node/6597|title=To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; He envisioned the self-sufficient garden city to house 32,000 people on a site {{convert|6000|acres|0|abbr=on}}. He planned on a [[concentric]] pattern with open spaces, public parks, and six radial [[boulevard]]s, {{convert|120|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, extending from the center. When it reached full population, Howard wanted another garden city to be developed nearby. He envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as [[satellite town|satellites]] of a central city of 50,000 people, linked by road and rail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Goodall | first = B | year = 1987 | title = Dictionary of Human Geography | place = London | publisher = Penguin}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His model for a garden city was first created at [[Letchworth]]{{Sfn | Hardy | 1999 | p = 4}} and [[Welwyn Garden City]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. Howard's movement was extended by [[Frederic Osborn|Sir Frederic Osborn]] to regional planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.tcpa.org.uk/data/files/18991999.pdf | title = History 1899–1999 | publisher = TCPA | format = [[PDF]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727123822/http://www.tcpa.org.uk/data/files/18991999.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-27 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, urban planning became professionalized. With input from [[utopia]]n visionaries, civil engineers, and [[local government|local councilors]], new approaches to city design were developed for consideration by decision makers such as elected officials. In 1899, the [[Town and Country Planning Association]] was founded. In 1909, the first academic course on urban planning was offered by the [[University of Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/619445/urban-planning|title=urban planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban planning was first officially embodied in the [[Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1909|Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909]] Howard's ‘garden city’ compelled local authorities to introduce a system where all housing construction conformed to specific building standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/towncountry/towns/overview/townplanning/|title=The birth of town planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom following this Act, [[surveying|surveyor]], [[civil engineer]]s, [[architect]]s, and [[lawyer]]s began working together within [[municipal government|local authorities]].
In 1910, [[Thomas Adams (architect)|Thomas Adams]] became the first Town Planning Inspector at the [[Local Government Board]] and began meeting with practitioners. In 1914, The [[Town Planning Institute]] was established. The first urban planning course in America wasn’t established until 1924 at [[Harvard University]]. Professionals developed schemes for the development of land, transforming town planning into a new area of expertise.

In the 20th century, urban planning was forever changed by the [[automobile]] industry. Car oriented design impacted the rise of ‘urban design’. City layouts now had to revolve around roadways and traffic patterns.
In 1956, 'Urban design' was first used at a series of conferences [[Harvard University]]. The event provided a platform for Harvard's Urban Design program. The program also utilized the writings of famous urban planning thinkers: [[Gordon Cullen]], [[Jane Jacobs]], [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]],  and [[Christopher Alexander]].

In 1961, [[Gordon Cullen]] published ''The Concise Townscape''. He examined the traditional artistic approach to city design of theorists including Camillo Sitte, Barry Parker and [[Raymond Unwin]]. Cullen also created the concept of 'serial vision'. It defined the urban landscape as a series of related spaces.

In 1961, [[Jane Jacobs]] published ' ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''. She critiqued the [[Modernism]] of [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]] (International Congresses of Modern Architecture). Jacobs also [[crime rate]]s in publicly owned spaces were rising because of the Modernist approach of ‘city in the park’. She argued instead for an 'eyes on the street' approach to town planning through the resurrection of main public space precedents (e.g. streets, squares).

In the same year, [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] published ''The Image of the City''. He was seminal to urban design, particularly with regards to the concept of legibility. He reduced urban design theory to five basic elements: paths, districts, edges, nodes, landmarks. He also made the use of mental maps to understanding the city popular, rather than the two-dimensional physical master plans of the previous 50 years.

Other notable works:

''Architecture of the City'' by [[Aldo Rossi|Rossi]] (1966)

''Learning from Las Vegas'' by [[Robert Venturi|Venturi]] (1972)

''Collage City'' by [[Colin Rowe]](1978)

''The Next American Metropolis'' by [[Peter Calthorpe]](1993)

''The Social Logic of Space'' by Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson (1984)

The popularity of these works resulted in terms that become everyday language in the field of urban planning. Aldo Rossi introduced 'historicism' and 'collective memory' to urban design. Rossi also proposed a 'collage metaphor' to understand the collection of new and old forms within the same urban space. Peter Calthorpe developed a manifesto for sustainable urban living via medium density living. He also designed a manual for building new settlements in his concept of [[Transit-oriented development|Transit Oriented Development]] (TOD). Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson introduced [[Space Syntax]] to predict how movement patterns in cities would contribute to urban vitality, anti-social behaviour and economic success. 'Sustainability', 'livability', and 'high quality of urban components' also became commonplace in the field.

Urban design seeks to create [[sustainable city|sustainable urban]] environments with long-lasting structures, buildings and overall livability. [[Walkability|Walkable]] urbanism is another approach to practice that is defined within the ''Charter of [[New Urbanism]]''. It aims to reduce environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create smart cities that support [[sustainable transport]].&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt; Compact urban neighborhoods encourage residents to drive less.

[[Urban planner]]s frequently act as urban designers when preparing design guidelines, regulatory frameworks, legislation, and advertising. Urban planners also work in urban design with [[architects]], [[landscape architects]], [[transportation engineers]] and [[industrial designers]]. They must also deal with ‘[[place management]]’ to guide and assist the use and maintenance of urban areas and public spaces. Public agencies, authorities, and the interests of nearby property owners manage public spaces. Users often compete over the spaces and negotiate across a variety of spheres. Input is frequently needed from a wide range of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s.

While there are some professionals who identify themselves specifically as urban designers, a majority have backgrounds in [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], or [[landscape architecture]]. Many collegiate programs incorporate urban design theory and design subjects into their curricula. There are an increasing number of university programs offering degrees in urban design at the post-graduate level.

Urban design considers:
* [[Pedestrian zones]]
* [[Incorporation of nature within a city]]
* [[Aesthetics]]
* ''[[Urban structure]]'' – arrangement and relation of business and people
* ''[[Typology (urban planning and architecture)|Urban typology]], [[Urban density|density]]'' and sustainability - spatial types and morphologies related to intensity of use, consumption of resources and production and maintenance of viable communities
* ''[[Accessibility]]'' – safe and easy transportation
* ''Legibility and [[wayfinding]]'' – accessible information about travel and destinations
* ''Animation'' – Designing places to stimulate public activity
* ''Function and fit'' – places support their varied intended uses
* ''Complementary [[Mixed-use|mixed uses]]'' – Locating activities to allow constructive interaction between them
* ''[[Neighbourhood character|Character]] and meaning'' – Recognizing differences between places
* ''Order and incident'' – Balancing consistency and variety in the urban environment
* ''Continuity and change'' – Locating people in time and place, respecting [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and contemporary culture
* ''[[Civil society]]'' – people are free to interact as civic equals, important for building [[social capital]]

==Equality issues==

Until the 1970s, the design of towns and cities took little account of the needs of [[Disability|people with disabilities]]. At that time, disabled people began to form movements demanding recognition of their potential contribution if social obstacles were removed. Disabled people challenged the 'medical model' of disability which saw physical and mental problems as an individual 'tragedy' and people with disabilities as 'brave' for enduring them. They proposed instead a 'social model' which said that barriers to disabled people result from the design of the [[built environment]] and attitudes of able-bodied people. 'Access Groups' were established composed of people with disabilities who audited their local areas, checked planning applications and made representations for improvements. The new profession of 'access officer' was established around that time to produce guidelines based on the recommendations of access groups and to oversee adaptations to existing buildings as well as to check on the accessibility of new proposals. Many [[Local government|local authorities]] now employ access officers who are regulated by the Access Association. A new chapter of the Building Regulations (Part M) was introduced in 1992. Although it was beneficial to have legislation on this issue the requirements were fairly minimal but continue to be improved with ongoing amendments. The [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] continues to raise awareness and enforce action on disability issues in the urban environment.

In [[robotics]] and [[computer vision]], '''visual odometry''' is the process of determining the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the associated camera images. It has been used in a wide variety of robotic applications, such as on the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s.&lt;ref name=Maimone2007&gt;{{cite journal

==Overview==
In [[navigation]], [[odometry]] is the use of data from the movement of actuators to estimate change in position over time through devices such as [[rotary encoder]]s to measure wheel rotations. While useful for many wheeled or tracked vehicles, traditional odometry techniques cannot be applied to [[mobile robot]]s with non-standard locomotion methods, such as legged robots. In addition, odometry universally suffers from precision problems, since wheels tend to slip and slide on the floor creating a non-uniform distance traveled as compared to the wheel rotations. The error is compounded when the vehicle operates on non-smooth surfaces. Odometry readings become increasingly unreliable as these errors accumulate and compound over time.

Visual odometry is the process of determining equivalent odometry information using sequential camera images to estimate the distance traveled. Visual odometry allows for enhanced navigational accuracy in robots or vehicles using any type of locomotion on any surface.

==Types==
There are various types of VO.

===Monocular and Stereo===
Depend on the camera setup, VO can be categorized as Monocular VO (single camera), Stereo VO (two camera in stereo setup).

[[File:VIO sensor in various commercial quadcopters .jpg|thumb|VIO is widely used in commercial quadcopters, which provide localization in GPS denied situations]]

===Feature Based and Direct Method===
Traditional VO's visual information is obtained by Feature Based Method, which extract image feature points and tracking them in the image sequence. Recent development in VO research provided an alternative, called Direct Method, which uses pixel intensity in the image sequence directly as visual input. There are also hybrid methods.

===Visual Inertial Odometry===
If an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU) is used within the VO system, it is commonly referred to as Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO).

==Algorithm==
Most existing approaches to visual odometry are based on the following stages.

## Choice 1: [[Kalman filter]] for state estimate distribution maintenance.

Features are detected in the first frame, and then matched in the second frame. This information is then used to make the optical flow field for the detected features in those two images. The optical flow field illustrates how features diverge from a single point, the ''focus of expansion''. The focus of expansion can be detected from the optical flow field, indicating the direction of the motion of the camera, and thus providing an estimate of the camera motion.

There are other methods of extracting egomotion information from images as well, including a method that avoids feature detection and optical flow fields and directly uses the image intensities.&lt;ref name="irani" /&gt;
