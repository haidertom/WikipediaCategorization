The '''action game''' is a [[Video game genres|video game genre]] that emphasizes physical challenges, including hand–eye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes a large variety of sub-genres, such as [[fighting game]]s, [[beat 'em up]]s, [[shooter game]]s and [[platform game]]s which are widely considered the most important action games, though [[multiplayer online battle arena]] and some [[real-time strategy]] games are also considered to be action games.

In an action game, the player typically controls a [[Character (arts)|character]] often in the form of a [[protagonist]] or [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. This [[player character]] must navigate a [[Level (video gaming)|level]], collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, and battling enemies with their natural skills as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal. At the end of a level or group of levels, the player must often defeat a boss enemy that is more challenging and often a major [[antagonist]] in the game's story. Enemy attacks and obstacles deplete the player character's [[Health (gaming)|health]] and [[1-up|lives]], and the player receives a [[Game over]] when they run out of lives. Alternatively, the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels and seeing the [[Closing credits|credits]]. But some action games, such as early [[arcade games]], are unbeatable and have an indefinite number of levels; with the player's only goal being to get as far as they can to maximize their score.

== Defining elements ==
The action genre includes any game where the player overcomes challenges by physical means such as precise aim and quick response times.&lt;ref name="NGen15"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|pages=28-42|quote=Action game - A game characterized by simple action and response gameplay. ... the defining characteristic is that enemies and obstacles are overcome by 'physical' means, rather than involved intellectual problem solving.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Action games can sometimes incorporate other challenges such as races, puzzles, or collecting objects, but they are not central to the genre. Players may also encounter tactical and exploration challenges, but these games first-and-foremost require high reaction speed and good hand–eye coordination. The player is often under time pressure, and there is not enough time for complex strategic planning. In general, faster action games are more challenging. Action games may sometimes involve puzzle solving, but they are usually quite simple because the player is under immense time pressure.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew| authorlink=|author2=Ernest Adams|title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game design ==

=== Levels ===

Players advance through an action game by completing a series of [[level design|levels]]. Levels are often grouped by theme, with similar graphics and enemies called a world. Each level involves a variety of challenges, whether dancing in a dance game or shooting things in a shooter, which the player must overcome to win the game. Older games force players to restart a level after dying, although action games evolved to offer saved games and checkpoints to allow the player to restart partway through a level. Increasingly, though, some games allow for 'resurrection' or 'cloning' and the opportunity to regain lost items upon death for a certain sum of ingame currency, typically increasing exponentially the more times the player dies. The obstacles and enemies in a level do not usually vary between play sessions, allowing players to learn by trial and error. However, levels sometimes add an element of randomness, such as an enemy that randomly appears or that takes an unpredictable path.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Levels in an action game may be linear or [[nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]], and sometimes include shortcuts. For levels that require exploration, the player may need to search for a level exit that is hidden or guarded by enemies. Such levels can also contain secrets—hidden or hard-to-reach objects or places that contain something valuable. The prize can be a bonus (see below) or a non-standard exit that allows a player to access a hidden level, or jump ahead several levels. Action games sometimes offer a teleporter that will cause the player's avatar to re-appear elsewhere in the same level. Levels often make use of locked doors that can only be opened with a specific key found elsewhere in the level.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Action games sometimes make use of time restrictions to increase the challenge. However, game levels typically do not react to time passing, and day/night cycles are rare.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; When the timer expires, the player typically loses a life, although some games generate a difficult enemy or challenge. If the level is completed with time remaining, this usually adds to the player's score.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Character abilities ===
In most action games, the player controls a single [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] as the [[protagonist]].&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; The avatar has the ability to navigate and maneuver, and often collects or manipulates objects. They have a range of defenses and attacks, such as shooting or punching. Many action games make use of a powerful attack that destroys all enemies within a limited range, but this attack is rare.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Players may find a [[power-up]] within the game world that grants temporary or permanent improvements to their abilities. For example, the avatar may gain an increase in speed, more powerful attacks, or a temporary shield from attacks. Some action games even allow players to spend upgrade points on the power ups of their choice.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Obstacles and enemies ===
In action games that involve navigating a space, players will encounter obstacles, traps, and enemies. Enemies typically follow fixed patterns and attack the player, although newer action games may make use of more complex [[artificial intelligence]] to pursue the player. Enemies sometimes appears in groups or waves, with enemies increasing in strength and number until the end of the level. Enemies may also appear out of thin air. This can involve an invisible spawn point, or a visible generator which can be destroyed by the player. These points may generate enemies indefinitely, or only up to a certain number.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; At the end of a level or group of themed levels, players often encounter a [[boss (video games)|boss]]. This boss enemy will often resemble a larger or more difficult version of a regular enemy. A boss may require a special weapon or attack method, such as striking when the boss opens their mouth or attacking particular part of the Boss.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Health and lives ===
In many action games, the avatar has a certain number of hit-markers or health, which are depleted by enemy attacks and other hazards. Sometimes health can be replenished by collecting an in-game object. When the player runs out of health, the player dies. The player's avatar is often given a small number of chances to retry after death, typically referred to as [[1-up|lives]]. Upon beginning a new life, the player resumes the game either from the same location they died, a checkpoint, or the start of the level. Upon starting a new life, the avatar is typically invincible for a few seconds to allow the player to re-orient themselves. Players may earn extra lives by reaching a certain score or by finding an in-game object. Arcade games still limit the number of player lives, while home video games have shifted increasingly to unlimited lives.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Graphics and interface ===
Action games take place in either 2D or 3D from a variety of perspectives. 2D action games typically use a side view or top-down view. The screen frequently scrolls as the player explores the level, although many games scroll through the level automatically to push the player forward. In 3D action games, the perspective is usually tied to the avatar from a first-person or third-person perspective. However, some 3D games offer a context-sensitive perspective that is controlled by an [[artificial intelligence]] camera. Most of what the player needs to know is contained within a single screen, although action games frequently make use of a [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] that display important information such as health or ammunition. Action games sometimes make use of maps which can be accessed during lulls in action, or a mini-map that is always visible.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

=== Scoring and victory ===
Action games tend to set simple goals, and reaching them is obvious.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; A common goal is to defeat the end-of-game boss. This is often presented in the form of a structured story, with a happy ending upon winning the game. In some games, the goal changes as the player reveals more of the story.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Many action games keep track of the player's score. Points are awarded for completing certain challenges, or defeating certain enemies. Skillful play is often rewarded with point multipliers, such as in ''Pac-Man'' where each ghost that the avatar eats will generate twice as many points as the last. Sometimes action games will offer bonus objects that increase the player's score. There is no penalty for failing to collect them, although these bonus objects may unlock hidden levels or special events. In many action games, achieving a high score is the only goal, and levels increase in difficulty until the player loses. Arcade games are more likely to be unbeatable, as they make their money by forcing the player to lose the game. On the other hand, games sold at home are more likely to have discrete victory conditions, since a publisher wants the player to purchase another game when they are done.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

== Subgenres ==
Action games have several major subgenres. However, there are many action games without any clear subgenre, such as ''[[Frogger]]'', as well as other types of genres like Adventure or Strategy that have action elements.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[Action-adventure game]]s''' mix elements of both action and adventure genres, examples include The Legend of Zelda, Assassin's Creed and Grand Theft Auto series.

'''[[Beat 'em up]]s''' are games that involve fighting through a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stage of multiple adversaries, using martial arts or other close-range fighting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-tao-of-beat-em-ups-article?page=2 | author = Spanner Spencer | publisher = EuroGamer | title = The Tao of Beat-'em-ups | date = 2008-02-06 | accessdate = 2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/reviews/fightingforce2/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080604002041/http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/reviews/fightingforce2/ | archivedate = 2008-06-04 | author = Subskin | publisher = GameSpy | title = Reviews - Fighting Force 2 | accessdate = 2009-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Fighting game]]s''' feature combat between pairs of fighters, usually using martial arts moves. Actions are limited to various attacks and defenses, and matches end when a fighter's health is reduced to zero. They often make use of special moves and combos. There are both 2D and 3D fighting games, but most 3D fighting games largely take place in a 2D plane and occasionally include side-stepping. They are distinct from [[sports game]]s such as boxing and wrestling games  which attempt to model movements and techniques more realistically.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[List of maze video games|Maze game]]s''' such as ''[[Pac-Man]]'' involve navigating a maze to avoid or chase adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Intelligence and Technology | author = Robert J. Sternberg,  David Preiss | publisher = Routledge | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Platform game]]s''' involve jumping between platforms of different heights, while battling enemies and avoiding obstacles. Physics are often unrealistic, and game levels are often vertically exaggerated. They exist in both 2D and 3D forms.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[Rhythm game|Rhythm action games]]''' challenge the player's sense of rhythm, and award points for accurately pressing certain buttons in sync with a musical beat. This is a relatively new subgenre of action game.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; Rhythm games are sometimes classified as a type of [[music video game|music game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/10/27/one-on-one-with-shigeru-miyamoto/ | title = One-On-One With Shigeru Miyamoto: From ‘Wii Music’ To Bowser To…  MotionPlus? | author = Stephen Totilo | date = 2008-10-27 | accessdate = 2009-02-20 | publisher = MTV | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090115074435/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/10/27/one-on-one-with-shigeru-miyamoto/| archivedate= 15 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Shooter game]]s''' allow the player to take action at a distance using a ranged weapon, challenging them to aim with accuracy. Although shooting is usually a form of violence, non-violent shooters exist as well, such as [[Splatoon]]. This subgenre includes [[first-person shooter]]s and [[third-person shooters]], as well as a plethora of other [[shoot 'em up]] games taking place from a [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] or side-view perspective.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

'''[[Survival game]]s''' start the player off with minimal resources, in a hostile, open-world environment, and require them to collect resources, craft tools, weapons, and shelter, in order to survive as long as possible. Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the [[survival horror]] genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse. A specific subgenre of survival game is [[Battle royale game|battle royale]].

== Physical impact ==
Studies have shown that people can improve their eyesight by playing action video games. Tests by scientists at the [[University of Rochester]] on college students showed that over a period of a month, performance in eye examinations improved by about 20% in those playing ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' compared to those playing ''[[Tetris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11123-action-computer-games-can-sharpen-eyesight.html  "Action computer games can sharpen eyesight"] retrieved from NewScientestTech&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[arcade game]]s are action games, because they can be difficult for unskilled players, and thus make more money quickly.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

Researchers from ''[[Helsinki School of Economics]]'' have shown that people playing a ''[[first-person shooter]]'' might secretly enjoy that their character gets killed in the game, although their expressions might show the contrary. The game used in the study was ''[[James Bond 007: Nightfire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2008/02/gamers-secretly-enjoy-getting-killed.html  "Gamers secretly enjoy getting killed "] retrieved from NewScientestTech&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==


A major turning point for action games came with the 1978 release of the [[shoot 'em up]] game ''[[Space Invaders]]'',&lt;ref name="1UP-50"/&gt; which marked the beginning of the [[golden age of arcade video games]].&lt;ref name="Whittaker-122"&gt;{{citation|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of ''Space Invaders''' mainstream success, the industry came to be dominated by action games,&lt;ref name="1UP-50"/&gt; which have remained the most dominant [[Video game genres|genre]] in [[Amusement arcade|video arcades]] and on [[Video game console|game consoles]] through to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The cyberspace handbook|author=Jason Whittaker|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=0-415-16835-X|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with ''Space Invaders'',&lt;ref name="GS-SI-Hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/spaceinvaders.shtm |title=The Gamespy Hall of Fame: Space Invaders |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |author=Kevin Bowen |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408152913/http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/halloffame/spaceinvaders.shtm |archivedate=2008-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' from 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/838/838642p1.html | title = Asteroids Deluxe Review | author = Nate Ahearn | publisher = IGN | date = 2007-11-29 | accessdate = 2009-02-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/65tmzzT9T?url=http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/838/838642p1.html | archivedate = 2012-03-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pac-Man]]'' from 1980&lt;ref name="bandainamco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandainamcogames.co.jp/bnours/hotnews/index.php?id=21 |title=Bandai Namco press release for 25th Anniversary Edition |language=Japanese |quote={{lang|ja|2005年5月22日で生誕25周年を迎えた『パックマン』。}} ("Pac-Man celebrates his 25th anniversary on May 22, 2005", seen in image caption) |author=Namco Bandai Games Inc. |publisher=bandainamcogames.co.jp/ |date=2005-06-02 |accessdate=2007-10-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230012914/http://www.bandainamcogames.co.jp/bnours/hotnews/index.php?id=21 |archivedate=2007-12-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also become iconic examples from the action genre.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt; ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'', released in arcades in 1982, also became a classic in the shooter subgenre.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"/&gt;

In much the same way ''Space Invaders'' set the template for the [[shooter game]] subgenre,&lt;ref name="1UP-50"&gt;{{cite web|title=Essential 50: Space Invaders |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-space-invaders |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018124241/http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-space-invaders |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2011-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP-10things"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3168373 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226064943/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3168373 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-02-26 |title=Ten Things Everyone Should Know About Space Invaders |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |author=Edwards, Benj |accessdate=2008-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' did the same for the [[platform game]] subgenre when it released in 1981.&lt;ref name="GRadar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming's most important evolutions|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=October 8, 2010|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1984 saw the emergence of martial arts themed games, with ''[[Karate Champ]]'' establishing the one-on-one [[fighting game]] subgenre,&lt;ref name="games.ign.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://games.ign.com/articles/840/840621p1.html | title = IGN's Top 10 Most Influential Games | publisher = IGN | author = Ryan Geddes &amp; Daemon Hatfield | date = 2007-12-10 | accessdate = 2009-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'' laying the foundations for the [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[beat 'em up]] subgenre.&lt;ref name="tao1"&gt;Spencer, Spanner, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-tao-of-beat-em-ups-article?page=2 The Tao of Beat-'em-ups], ''Eurogamer'', Feb 6, 2008, Accessed Mar 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CGW"&gt;Kunkel, Bill; Worley, Joyce; Katz, Arnie, "The Furious Fists of Sega!", ''Computer Gaming World'', Oct 1988, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autism spectrum disorder]]s (''ASD''s) or autism spectrum conditions (''ASC''s) describe a range of conditions classified as [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s in the [[DSM-5]], used by the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref name=DSM5Autism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=Autism spectrum disorder fact sheet |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |work=DSM5.org |year=2013 |accessdate=13 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006210933/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Autism%20Spectrum%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many [[wikt:neurodivergent|neurodivergent]] people and conditions, the popular image of autistic people and autism itself is often based on inaccurate media representations.&lt;ref name=Trapped&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarrett|first=J C|title=Trapped children: popular images of children with autism in the 1960s and 2000s.|journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|date=June 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=141–53|doi=10.1007/s10912-010-9135-z|pmid=21225325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, fictional portrayals of people with [[autism]], [[Asperger syndrome]], and other ASCs have become more frequent.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite journal |author=Murray S |title=Autism and the contemporary sentimental: fiction and the narrative fascination of the present |journal=Lit Med |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=24–45 |year=2006 |pmid=17040083 |doi=10.1353/lm.2006.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public perception of autism is often based on these fictional portrayals in novels, biographies, movies, and TV series.

==MMR vaccine theory==

The MMR vaccine was the subject of controversy resulting from publication of a (now retracted) 1998 paper by [[Andrew Wakefield]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name=MMR&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wakefield A, Murch S, Anthony A|author-link=Andrew Wakefield|title= Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children |journal=Lancet|volume=351|issue=9103|pages = 637–41|year=1998|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0|pmid=9500320|url=http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm|accessdate= 5 September 2007|display-authors=etal}}{{Retracted paper|{{PMID|20137807}}|intentional=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been "dishonest";&lt;ref name=Irresponsible&gt;{{cite news|last=Boseley|first=Sarah|title=Andrew Wakefield found 'irresponsible' by GMC over MMR vaccine scare|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/28/andrew-wakefield-mmr-vaccine|newspaper=The Guardian (London)|date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by the ''[[BMJ]]''.&lt;ref name=Fraud&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |title=Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=342 |issue= |pages=c7452 |year=2011 |pmid=21209060 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |doi = 10.1136/bmj.c7452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2007 article in ''[[BMC Public Health]]'' postulated that media reports on Wakefield's study had "created the misleading impression that the evidence for the link with autism was as substantial as the evidence against".&lt;ref name=hilton&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hilton S, Petticrew M, Hunt K |title=Parents' champions vs. vested interests: who do parents believe about MMR?

''[[PRWeek]]'' noted that after Wakefield was removed from the general medical register for misconduct in May 2010, 62% of respondents to a poll regarding the MMR controversy stated they did not feel that the media conducted responsible reporting on health issues.&lt;ref name=PRWeek&gt;[http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/1007378/Reputation-survey-MMR-panic-subsides "Reputation Survey: MMR panic subsides."] ''[[PR Week]]'', 2 June 2010: 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' article examining the history of antivaccinationists said that opposition to vaccines has existed since the 19th century, but "now the antivaccinationists' media of choice are typically television and the Internet, including its social media outlets, which are used to sway public opinion and distract attention from scientific evidence".&lt;ref name=AgeOld&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Poland GA, Jacobson RM |title= The Age-Old Struggle against the Antivaccinationists |journal= N Engl J Med |volume= 364 |issue= 2 |pages= 97–9 |date= 13 January 2011 |pmid= 21226573 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMp1010594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the media in the sensationalization of the MMR vaccination issue was discussed by the ''[[BMJ]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;The original paper has received so much media attention, with such potential to damage public health, that it is hard to find a parallel in the history of medical science.

Media speculation of historical figures on the [[autism spectrum]] is based on reported behavior and anecdotal evidence rather than any clinical observation of the individual.  [[Fred R. Volkmar|Fred Volkmar]] of the [[Yale Child Study Center]] has remarked that "there is unfortunately a sort of cottage industry of finding that everyone has Asperger's".&lt;ref name=GoodeNYT&gt;{{cite news|title=CASES; A Disorder Far Beyond Eccentricity|author=Goode, Erica

Additionally, media speculation of contemporary figures as being on the autism spectrum has become popular in recent times.  [[New York magazine|''New York'' magazine]] reported some examples, which included that [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] suggested that [[Bill Gates]] is autistic, and that a biographer of [[Warren Buffett]] wrote that his prodigious memory and "fascination with numbers" give him "a vaguely autistic aura." The magazine also reported that on ''[[Celebrity Rehab]]'', Dr. Drew Pinsky deemed basketball player [[Dennis Rodman]] a candidate for an Asperger's diagnosis, and the [[UCLA]] specialist consulted "seemed to concur". [[Nora Ephron]] criticized these conclusions, writing that popular speculative diagnoses suggest autism is "an epidemic, or else a wildly over-diagnosed thing that there used to be other words for."&lt;ref name="nymag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Benjamin|title=Autism Spectrum: Are You On It?|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/autism-spectrum-2012-11/|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=NYMag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Sowell]] has criticized ''Time''{{'s}} diagnosis of Bill Gates, saying that the people diagnosing him have not seen him personally.&lt;ref name="sowell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sowell|first1=Thomas|title=The Einstein Syndrome : bright children who talk late|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465081417|pages=142, 189|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=046508141X|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Steinberg]] has also criticized the literary portrayals of Warren Buffett and [[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]] as autistic, writing these men are able to compensate more completely than a truly autistic child or adult whose language deficiencies and cognitive deficits can often put him at a level of functioning in the mentally retarded range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Paul|title=Asperger’s History of Overdiagnosis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/opinion/aspergers-history-of-over-diagnosis.html?scp=1&amp;sq=asperger&amp;st=cse|accessdate=3 May 2016|work=The New York Times|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
== Definition ==
=== ''The Art of Sinking in Poetry'' ===
{{main|Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry}}
As the combination of the very high with the very low, the term was introduced by [[Alexander Pope]] in his essay ''[[Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry]]'' (1727).  On the one hand, Pope's work is a [[parody]] in prose of [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]' ''Peri Hupsous'' (''[[On the Sublime]]''), in that he imitates Longinus's system for the purpose of ridiculing contemporary poets, but, on the other, it is a blow Pope struck in an ongoing struggle against the "dunces."

The nearest model for Pope's essay is the ''Treatise of the Sublime'' by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]] of 1712.  Pope admired Boileau, but one of Pope's literary adversaries, [[Leonard Welsted]], had issued a "translation" of Longinus in 1726 that was merely a translation of Boileau.  Because Welsted and Pope's other foes were championing this "sublime," Pope commented upon and countered their system with his ''Peri Bathos'' in the [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]-[[Alexander Pope|Pope]]-[[John Gay|Gay]]-[[John Arbuthnot|Arbuthnot]] ''Miscellanies.''  Whereas Boileau had offered a detailed discussion of all the ways in which poetry could ascend or be "awe-inspiring," Pope offers a lengthy schematic of the ways in which authors might "sink" in poetry, [[satire|satirizing]] the very men who were allied with [[Ambrose Philips]].  Pope and Philips had been adversaries since the publication of Pope's ''Odes,'' and the rivalry broke down along political lines. According to Pope, bathos can be most readily applicable to love making after two years of marriage which is clearly in binary opposition to the sublime but is no less political. [[Edmund Burke]] was believed to be particularly charmed by Pope's articulation of love after marriage, inspiring Burke's essay [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]] (1756).

One example of Pope's style and satire shows in his description of sinking in painting.  In the commonplace Academic hierarchic ranking of pictorial [[genre]]s, [[still life]] ranked the lowest.  However, Pope describes how it might fall and, with the single word "stiffen," evokes the unnatural deadness that is a mark of failure even in this [[Hierarchy of genres|"low" genre]]:

:''Many Painters who could never hit a Nose or an Eye, have with Felicity copied a Small-Pox, or been admirable at a Toad or a Red-Herring. And seldom are we without Genius's for Still Life, which they can work up and stiffen with incredible Accuracy''. ("Peri Bathous" vi).

In chapters X and XI, Pope explains the comic use of the [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] and [[figures of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William Kurtz |last=Wimsatt |authorlink=William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr. |year=1989 |origyear=1954 |title=The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KmrUKcU2JUoC&amp;pg=PA176 176] |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-8131-0111-8 |oclc=19554431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Pope's manual of bad verse offers numerous methods for writing poorly, of all these ways to "sink," the method that is most remembered now is the act of combining very serious matters with very trivial ones. The radical juxtaposition of the serious with the frivolous does two things.  First, it violates "decorum," or the fittingness of subject, and, second, it creates humor with an unexpected and improper juxtaposition.

=== Subsequent evolution ===
Since Pope's day, the term "bathos," perhaps because of confusion with "[[pathos]]," has been used for art forms, and sometimes events, where something is so ''pathetic'' as to be humorous.

When artists consciously mix the very serious with the very trivial, the effect is of [[Surreal humour]] and [[absurd humor|the absurd]].  However, when an artist is unconscious of the juxtaposition (e.g., when a film maker means for [[Robot Monster|a man in a gorilla suit with a diving helmet]] to be frightening), the result is bathos.

Arguably, some forms of [[kitsch]] (notably the replication of serious or sublime subjects in a trivial context, like tea-towels with prints of [[Titian|Titian's]] ''Last Supper'' on them or hand guns that are actually cigarette lighters){{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} express bathos in the concrete arts.

A tolerant but detached enjoyment of the aesthetic characteristics that are inherent in naive, unconscious and honest bathos is an element of the [[Camp (style)|camp sensibility]], as first analyzed by [[Susan Sontag]], in a 1964 essay [http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Sontag-NotesOnCamp-1964.html "Notes on camp"].

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
Bathos as Pope described it may be found in a grandly rising thought that punctures itself: Pope offers one "Master of a Show in Smithfield, who wrote in large Letters, over the Picture of his Elephant:
:"This is the greatest Elephant in the World, except Himself."

Several decades before Pope coined the term, [[John Dryden]] had described one of the breath-taking and magically extravagant settings for his [[Restoration spectacular]], ''[[Albion and Albanius]]'' (1684–85):
:"The cave of [[Proteus]] rises out of the sea, it consists of several arches of rock work, adorned with mother of pearl, coral, and abundance of shells of various kinds. Through the arches is seen the sea, and parts of [[Dover|Dover pier]]."

Pope himself employed this type of figure intentionally for humor in his mock-heroic ''[[Rape of the Lock]],'' where a lady would be upset at the death of a lover "or lapdog."  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], in ''The Sickness Unto Death,'' did the same thing, when he suggested that the "self" is easy to lose and that the loss of "an arm, a leg, a dog, or a wife" would be more grievous.  When intended, this is a form of satire or the literary figure of ''undercutting.''  When the context demands a lofty, serious, or grand interpretation, however, the effect is bathos.

[[Image:William Hogarth - The Bathos.png|thumb|right|Hogarth's ''The Bathos'']]

In 1764, [[William Hogarth]] published his last engraving, ''The Bathos, or the Manner of Sinking in Sublime Paintings inscribed to Dealers in Dark Pictures'', depicting [[Father Time]] lying exhausted in a scene of destruction, [[parody]]ing the fashion at that time for "[[wikt:sublime|sublime]]" works of art, and [[satire|satirising]] criticisms made of Hogarth's own works.  It may also be seen as a ''[[vanitas]]'' or ''[[memento mori]]'', foreshadowing Hogarth's death six months later.  Headed ''Tail Piece'', it was intended as the [[tailpiece]] for a bound edition of Hogarth's engravings.

== Examples ==

===Traditional===
[[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s [[narrative poem]] ''[[Enoch Arden]]'' ends with the following lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;So past the strong heroic soul away.
And when they buried him the little port
Had seldom seen a costlier funeral.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After stanzas of heightened poetic language, the poet, in three short lines, wraps up a [[pathos]]-laden story with mundane and practical details. The effect yanks the reader out of the poetic world, simultaneously offering commentary on the finality of death and the transience of heroics.

A musical representation is found in composer [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1923 [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet]] for wind instruments. The first two movements and the majority of the third movement follow traditional classical structures, albeit employing modern and innovative harmonies. The last fifteen seconds of the 25-minute work, however, abruptly and whimsically turn to popular harmony, rhythm, and style found in contemporary dance hall music.

=== Modern ===

Contemporary examples often take the form of analogies, written to seem unintentionally funny:
* Week 310: It's Like This of [[The Style Invitational]] humor contest column in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' (14 March 1999), on humorous analogies, many exhibiting bathos, such as:
:The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender leg behind her, like a dog at a fire hydrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Week 310: It's Like This|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/16/AR2007031600738_pf.html|accessdate=1 June 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=March 14, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]] features [[purple prose]], at times exhibiting bathos:
:They had but one last remaining night together, so they embraced each other as tightly as that two-flavor entwined string cheese that is orange and yellowish-white, the orange probably being a bland Cheddar and the white . . . Mozzarella, although it could possibly be Provolone or just plain American, as it really doesn't taste distinctly dissimilar from the orange, yet they would have you believe it does by coloring it differently.

Legendary [[darts]] commentator [[Sid Waddell]] was famed for his one-liners, including this example:
:“When Alexander of Macedonia was 33, he cried salt tears because there were no more worlds to conquer..... [[Eric Bristow|Bristow]] is only 27.”

==Notable casting couch remarks and incidents==
===United States===
* The legend of the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] casting couch coincided with the rise of the [[studio system]] in the 1910s. Several [[media mogul|mogul]] producers were rumoured to have been enthusiastic practitioners, and it has been claimed that many actresses attempted, with varying degrees of success, to attain stardom via this route.&lt;ref&gt;Freedland, Michael (2009) ''The Men Who Made Hollywood: The Lives of the Great Movie Moguls'', London: Aurum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gil Troy |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-casting-couch-perverts-who-peddled-fairy-tales |title=The Casting Couch Perverts Who Peddled Fairy Tales |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=2017-10-15 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/19/moguls-and-starlets-100-years-of-hollywoods-corrosive-systemic-sexism |title=Moguls and starlets: 100 years of Hollywood’s corrosive, systemic sexism |work=Guardian |accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1945, [[Maureen O'Hara]] was quoted as saying, "I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://indy100.com/article/hollywood-sexual-harrassment-in-1945-reshared-8038396 |title=Maureen O'Hara's comment about sexual harassment in Hollywood from 1945 is going viral |work=Indy100 |date=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she repeated: "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/oscars/11210734/Maureen-OHara-I-wasnt-going-to-play-the-whore.html |title=Maureen O'Hara: I wasn't going to play the whore |work=Indy100 |date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a 1996 interview, actor [[Woody Harrelson]] declared "every [acting] business I ever entered into in [[New York City|New York]] seemed to have a casting couch&amp;nbsp;... I've seen so many people sleep with people they loathe in order to further their ambition."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Mansfield, "Wild and Woody", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', July 5, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
* At a 2005 class reunion, producer [[Chris Hanley]] told his former classmates that "almost every leading actress in all of [his] 24 films has slept with a director or producer or a leading actor to get the part that launched her career".&lt;ref&gt;"News from the casting couch", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', June 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, a New York City producer was accused of sexually harassing several members of the cast of the [[off-Broadway]] play ''[[Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead]]''. She had previously been accused of harassing actors [[Gabriel Byrne]], [[Aidan Quinn]], [[Esai Morales]] and [[Joey McIntyre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/19/gender.arts |title=Turning tables on the casting couch |work=[[The Observer]] |date=19 February 2006 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2017, [[Lance Bass]] of 'N Sync wrote that "as a society, we've been become far too comfortable with the pervasive 'casting couch' adage that it no longer resembles what it truly is—sexual assault. ...

'''Circassian beauties''' is a phrase used to refer to an idealized image of the women of the [[Circassians|Circassian people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus|Northwestern Caucasus]]. A fairly extensive literary history suggests that Circassian women were thought to be unusually beautiful, spirited, and elegant, and as such were desirable as [[concubine]]s.

This reputation dates back to the Late Middle Ages, when the Circassian coast was frequented by traders from Genoa, and the founder of the Medici dynasty, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], had [[Carlo de' Medici|an illegitimate son]] from a Circassian slave. During the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Persian [[Safavid]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, Circassian women living as slaves in the Sultan's [[Imperial Harem]] and Shah's harems started to build their reputation as extremely beautiful and genteel, which then became a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in Western [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, ''Çerkes Güzeli: Bir Şarkiyatçı İmgenin Serüveni'' [The Fair Circassian: Adventures of an Orientalist Motif], trans. A. Anadol (Istanbul: Oğlak Yayınları, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this reputation, in Europe and America Circassians were often characterised as [[ideal of feminine beauty|ideals of feminine beauty]] in poetry and art. Cosmetic products were advertised, from the 18th century on, using the word "Circassian" in the title, or claiming that the product was based on substances used by the women of Circassia.

In consequence, most wives of several [[Ottoman Sultan]]s were ethnic Circassians converted to [[Islam]], e.g. [[Valide Sultan]]s (Empress mothers), including [[Rahime Perestu Sultan|Perestü Valide Sultan]], [[Pertevniyal Sultan|Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]], [[Şevkefza Sultan|Şevkefza Valide Sultan]], [[Tirimüjgan Sultan|Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan]], [[Nükhetsezâ Hanımefendi (wife of Abdul Hamid I)|Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi]], other important [[Khatun|Hatun]]s (Ladies) and [[Sultans]] like [[Şemsiruhsar Hatun]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Saçbağlı Sultan]], [[Haseki sultan]]s (chief consorts) such as [[Mahidevran Sultan|Mahidevran Haseki Sultan]], [[Hümaşah Sultan|Hümaşah Haseki Sultan]], [[Hatice Muazzez Sultan|Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan]], and [[Ayşe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ayşe Haseki Sultan]] besides numerous [[Kadınefendi|Başkadınefendi]]s (most senior consorts), including [[Bedrifelek Kadınefendi|Bedrifelek I]], [[Biydâr Kadın Efendi|Bidar II]], [[Kamures Kadınefendi|Kamures I]], and [[Servetsezâ Kadınefendi|Servetseza I]] as well as [[Kadınefendi]]s (senior consorts) such as [[Bezmican Kadınefendi|Bezmara VI]], [[Düzd-i Dil Kadın Efendi|Düzdidil III]], [[Hayranidil Kadınefendi|Hayranıdil II]], [[Meyliservet Kadınefendi|Meyliservet IV]], [[Mihrengiz Kadınefendi|Mihrengiz II]], [[Neşerek Kadınefendi|Neşerek III]], [[Abdul Hamid II#Second marriage and issue|Nurefsun II]], [[Reftar-i Dil Hatgil|Reftaridil II]], [[Şayan Kadınefendi (wife of Murad V)|Şayan III]], amongst many others, or [[Hanımefendi|İkbals]] (honoured lady consorts), most notable of them being [[Cevherriz Hanımefendi|Cevherriz II]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Ceylanyar II]], [[Dilfirib Kadınefendi|Dilfirib I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nalanıdil III]], and [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nergis IV]] in addition to [[Hanımefendi|Gözde]]s (favourite lady consorts), including [[Abdul Hamid II|Dürdane I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Hüsnicenan III]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Safderun IV]], amongst others. The "golden age" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the [[Crimean Khanate]] and cut off their slave trade in Eastern European women, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians [[Circassian genocide|destroyed Circassia itself]].

In the 1860s the showman [[P. T. Barnum]] exhibited women who he claimed were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, [[big hair]] style, which had no precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which was soon copied by other female performers in the United States, who became known as "moss-haired girls". This hair style was a sort of a exhibit's trademark and was achieved by washing the hair of women in beer, drying it and then teasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Showmen, Disabilities and the Freak Show|last=Bogdan|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-74393-8|location=NY|pages=200, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It may have been a reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.

There were also several classical Turkish music pieces and poems that praise the beauty of the "Lepiska Saçlı Çerkes" (Straight, [[blonde#flaxen|flaxen]]-haired Circassian; "lepiska" refers to long blonde hair which is soft and straight, as if flatironed).

==Literary allusions==
[[File:Inspecting New Arrivals by Giulio Rosati 2.jpg|thumb|''Inspection of New Arrivals'', a typical [[orientalism|Orientalist]] fantasy painted by [[Giulio Rosati]] (1858–1917).]]

The legend of Circassian women in the western world was enhanced in 1734, when, in his ''[[Letters on the English]]'', [[Voltaire]] alludes to the beauty of Circassian women:

{{Quote|The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with those beauties the [[seraglio]] of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian [[Sophy (Safavid Empire)|Sophy]], and of all of those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise. These maidens are very honorably and virtuously instructed how to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.|Letter XI, On Inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.html |title=Voltaire's Letters on the English |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Their beauty is mentioned in [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), in which Fielding remarked, "How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes!"&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fielding, ''Tom Jones'', book 5, ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar erotic claims about Circassian women appear in [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1818–24), in which the tale of a slave auction is told:

{{poemquote|
Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
Warranted virgin. Beauty's brightest colours
Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven.
Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
Who bade on till the hundreds reached the eleven,
But when the offer went beyond, they knew
'Twas for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
|''Don Juan'', canto IV, verse 114 }}

The legend of Circassian women was also repeated by legal theorist [[Gustav Hugo]], who wrote that "Even beauty is more likely to be found in a Circassian slave girl than in a beggar girl", referring to the fact that even a slave has some security and safety, but a "free" beggar has none. Hugo's comment was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] in ''The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law'' (1842) on the grounds that it excused slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], [http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/08/09.htm The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law]", first appearing in Supplement to the ''Rheiniche Zeitung'' No. 221, 9 August 1842. (Excerpts online)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] reported in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' (1869) that "Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in [[Constantinople]] by their parents, but not publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Twain |date=1869 |chapter=34 |title=''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' |publisher=American Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American travel author and diplomat [[Bayard Taylor]] in 1862 claimed that, "So far as female beauty is concerned, the Circassian women have no superiors. They have preserved in their mountain home the purity of the Grecian models, and still display the perfect physical loveliness, whose type has descended to us in the [[Venus de' Medici]]."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |author-link=Bayard Taylor |date=1862 |chapter=Circassian Beauty |title=Prose Writings of Bayard Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HN_v61_E-cC&amp;dq=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned%2C%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned,%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;f=false |volume=7 |publisher=[[G.

An anthropological literary suggests that Circassians were best characterized by what was called "rosy pale" or "translucent white skin". While most [[Circassians#Circassian tribes|Circassian tribes]] were famous for abundance of fair or dark blond and red hair combined with greyish-blue or green eyes,&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu&gt;{{cite book |last=Osmanoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=1960 |title=Babam Abdülhamid |location=Istanbul |publisher=Güven Yayınevi |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many also had the pairing of very dark hair with very light complexions, a typical feature of [[Peoples of the Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=ColarussoBeauties&gt;Colarusso, John 1989.

Pp. 644-651. Page 644: "The Circassians were famed throughout the Middle East for the beauty of their women and the courage of their men. Physically most Circassians are European in appearance with perhaps a slight oriental cast to their features. Many Circassians are blond and blue-eyed, while others show a common feature of the Caucasus: very light skin coupled with black or extremely dark hair. A lithe and erect physique were favored, both for the men and the woman, and many villages even today have large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Circassian women in the Ottoman harem were described as having "green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet."&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu/&gt; The fact that Circassian women were traditionally encouraged to wear corsets in order to keep their posture straight might have shaped their [[wasp waist]] as a result. In the late 18th century, it was claimed by Western European coutouriers that "the Circassian Corset is the only one which displays, without indelicacy, the shape of the bosom to the greatest possible advantage; gives a width to the chest which is equally conducive to health and elegance of appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Morison |year=2009 |orig-year=1930 |chapter=The Fair Circassian |title=[[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], 1745–1831: A Memoir |format=Paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |publication-date=November 2009 |page=70 |isbn=978-0-521-14314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that a lithe and erect physique were favored for Circassians, and many villages had large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Colarusso |first=John |date=March 1989 |title=Prometheus among the Circassians: A modern oral tale from a little known people of the Caucasus shows striking parallels with myths from Ancient Greece, Ancient India and the pagan Germanic world |magazine=[[World and I]] |publisher=[[The Washington Times|Washington Times Publishing Corporation]] |volume= |issue= |pages=644–651 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maturin Murray Ballou]] described Circassians as being of the "fair and rosy-cheeked race," and "with a form of ravishing loveliness, large and lustrous eyes, and every belonging that might go to make up a Venus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Maturin Murray |author-link=Maturin Murray Ballou |date=1851 |title=The Circassian Slave, or, the Sultan's Favorite: A Story of Constantinople and the Caucasus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOhEAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=circassian%20ebony&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=fair%20and%20rosy-cheeked%20Circassian%20race&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Frederick Gleason]] |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Henry Lindlahr]]'s words in the early 20th century, "Blue-eyed Caucasian regiments today form the cream of the Sultan's army. Circassian beauties are admired for their abundant and luxuriant yellow hair and blue eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindlahr |first=Henry |author-link=Henry Lindlahr |date=1974 |orig-year=1919 |chapter=Iris color and Mental Characteristics |title=Natural Therapeutics: Iridiagnosis and Other Diagnostic Methods |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ky6m_hnfaIC&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;vq=Circassian%20beauties%20are%20admired%20for%20their%20abundant%20and%20luxuriant%20yellow%20hair%20and%20blue%20eyes.&amp;dq=Blue-eyed%20Caucasian%20regiments%20today%20form%20the%20cream%20of%20the%20Sultan's%20army.&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q=Circassian%20beauties%20are%20admired%20for%20their%20abundant%20and%20luxuriant%20yellow%20hair%20and%20blue%20eyes.&amp;f=false |location=Pomeroy, WA |publisher=Health Research Books |page=32 |isbn=978-0-787-30563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Year Among the Circassians'', John Augustus Longworth describes a Circassian girl of typical Circassian features as the following: "She had regular and pretty features, blue eyes, and fair complexion; her hair was of a light auburn colour, and hung in a profusion of braided tresses over her shoulders, from a bonnet of scarlet cloth, trimmed and crossed with broad silver lace, not unlike the Albanian skull-cap. She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longworth, Esq. |first=John Augustus |date=1840 |title=A Year Among the Circassians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYGeRLRf7xsC&amp;dq=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features%2C%20blue%20eyes%2C%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features,%20blue%20eyes,%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Henry Colburn |volume=1 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also understood from the memoirs of Princess Emily Ruete, a half-Circassian and half-Omani herself, that Circassian women, who were captured in Constantinople and brought to Africa for the harem of Zanzibari [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman]], were envied by their rivals who considered Circassians to be of the "hateful race of blue-eyed cats."

{{Quote|At [[Sultan's Palace, Zanzibar|Bet il Sahel]] there was much more luxury and grand style than at Bet il Mtoni. The handsome and graceful Circassian women were much more numerous than at Bet il Mtoni, where my mother and her lady friend Medîne were the only members of this race. Here the majority of the women were Circassian, who without any doubt are much more distinguished in appearance....This natural superiority was the cause of a good deal of ill-will and envy. One Circassian woman, favoured with an aristocratic appearance, was avoided and even hated by the chocolate-coloured Abyssinian women through no fault of hers, but simply because she looked majestic. Under these circumstances it was bound to happen that occasionally a kind of ridiculous "racism" broke out among my brothers and sisters....We, the children of Circassian women, were usually called "cats" by those of our brothers and sisters who had Abyssinian blood in their veins, because some of us had the misfortune of possessing: blue eyes. Derisively they called us "Highness", a proof of how annoyed they were about us having been born with lighter skin. My father was of course never forgiven the fact that he had chosen his favourite children Sharîfe and Chole—both by Circassian mothers, Sharîfe even being blue-eyed—from the hateful race of "cats".&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruete |first=Princess Emily |author-link=Emily Ruete |date=1993 |original-date= |title=An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds: Memoirs, Letters Home, Sequels to the Memoirs |chapter=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU2w8K8IyoEC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;f=false |editor=E.

Regarding one of her half-sisters who was also from a Circassian mother, Princess Ruete of Zanzibar mentions that, "The daughter of a Circassian was a dazzling beauty with the complexion of a German blonde. Besides, she possessed a sharp intellect, which made her into a faithful advisor of my father's."&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"/&gt;

The characteristics of Circassian and Northwest Georgian women were further articulated in 1839 by the author Emma Reeve who, as stated by Joan DelPlato, differentiated "between 'the blond Circassians' who are 'indolent and graceful, their voices low and sweet' and what she calls the slightly darker-skinned Georgians who are 'more animated' and have more 'intelligence and vivacity than their delicate rivals'."&lt;ref name="DelPlato"&gt;{{cite book |last=DelPlato |first=Joan |date=2002 |chapter=Chapter 2.

Similar descriptions of the Circassian women appear in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s travel journal where Nightingale called Circassians "the most graceful and the most sensual-looking creatures I ever saw".&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

According to the feminist [[Harriet Martineau]], Circassians were the only saving virtue of the Egyptian harem where these Circassian mothers produced the finest children and if they were to be excluded from the harem, the upper class in Egypt would be doomed.&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

In parts of Europe and North America where blond hair was more common, the pairing of extremely white skin with very dark hair also present among some Circassians was exalted, even in Russia which was [[Russo-Circassian War|at war with the Circassians]]; Semyon Bronevskii exalted Circassian women for having light skin, dark brown hair, dark eyes and "the lineaments of the face of the Ancient Greek".&lt;ref&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 135&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the girls disguised as "Circassians" exhibited by [[Phineas T. Barnum]] were in fact Catholic [[Irish people|Irish girls]] from [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=King139&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Circassian men were also exalted for their beauty, manliness and bravery in Western Europe, in a way Caucasus historian Charles King calls "homoerotic".&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 134&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], in 1862, Circassian chiefs arrived to advocate their cause against Russia and to persuade Britain to stop the [[Circassian genocide|actions of the Russian army at that time]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosser-Owen (2007)."The First 'Circassian Exodus' to the Ottoman Empire (1858-1867)". Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and upon the arrival of two Circassian leaders, Hadji Hayder Hassan and Kustan Ogli Ismael, the ''Dundee Advertiser'' reported that "the Chiefs are two remarkable looking men. Their imposing bearing, their romantic dress... and their natural dignity of mien, stamp them as very superior... Raven haired, black-bearded, broad-browed, with wide springing eyebrows of sooty black... these bronzed and armed children of the mountains tend to put us out of love with our own specimens of men, and suggests thoughts not complementary to the types of manhood which, in this country, they are surrounded."&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic/&gt;

===Pseudoscientific explanations for the extreme white skin===
During the 19th century, various Western intellectuals offered [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] explanations for the light complexion present among Circassians. The [[doctor of medicine]] [[Hugh Williamson]], a signatory to the [[United States Constitution]], argued that the reason for the extreme whiteness of the Circassian and coastal [[Celtic people|Celto]]-[[Germanic peoples]] can be explained by the geographical [[Location (geography)|location]] of these folks' ancestral homelands which lie in high latitudes ranging from 45° to 55° N near a sea or ocean where [[Prevailing Westerlies|Westerlies]] prevail from the west towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Williamson |date=1811 |title=Observations of the Climate in different parts of America, compared with the Climate in corresponding Parts of the other Continent |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudoscientific racialist theories==
By the early nineteenth century, Circassians were associated with theories of racial hierarchy, which elevated the Caucasus region as the source of the purest examples of the "white race", which was named the [[Caucasian race]] after the area by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach theorised that the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus "the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop Jordan, ''White over Black'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968, pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; This fuelled the idea of female Circassian beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/searchlm.php?function=find&amp;exhibit=star&amp;browse=star |title=The Circassian Beauty Archive |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, the decade after the expulsion of Circassians from the Caucasus where only a minority of them live today, it was argued that "the Caucasian Race receives its name from the Caucasus, the abode of the Circassians who are said to be the handsomest and best-formed nation, not only of this race, but of the whole human family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Sarah S. |date=1873 |title=Cornell's Physical Geography: Accompanied with Nineteen Pages of Maps, a Great Variety of Map-questions, and One Hundred and Thirty Diagrams and Pictorial Illustrations, and Embracing a Detailed Description of the Physical Features of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6waAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Caucasian%20Race%20receives%20its%20name%20from%20the%20Caucasus&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20abode%20of%20the%20Circassians,%20who%20are%20said%20to%20be%20the%20handsomest%20and%20best-formed%20nation,%20not%20only%20of%20this%20race,%20but%20of%20the%20whole%20human%20family&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] and [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another anthropologist [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] distinguished the Caucasian race and the "Circassians who are admired for their beauty" in particular by their oval form of their head, straight nose, thin lips, vertically-placed teeth, facial angle from 80 to 90 degrees that he calls the most developed one, and their regular features overall, which "causes them to be considered as the most handsome and agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William |author-link=William Guthrie (historian) |date=1843 |title=A new geographical, historical, and commercial grammar |editor=Richard Alfred Davenport |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bayard Taylor]] observed the Circassian women during his trip to the Ottoman Empire and argued that, "the Circassian face is a pure oval; the forehead is low and fair, an excellent thing in woman, and the skin of an ivory whiteness, except the faint pink of the cheeks and the ripe, roseate stain of the lips."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"/&gt;

Circassians are depicted in images of harems at this time through these ideologies of racial hierarchy. [[John Frederick Lewis]]'s ''The Harem'' portrays Circassians as the dominant mistresses of the harem, who look down on other women, as implied in the review of the painting in ''[[The Art Journal]]'', which described it as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It represents the interior of a harem at Cairo, wherein is seated in luxurious ease a young Turk, attired in the excess of Moslem fashion. Near him, and reclining upon cushions, are two Circassian women, also dressed in the extremity of Oriental taste... On the right is seen a tall Nubian eunuch, who removes from the shoulders of an Egyptian slave the shawl by which she had been covered, in order to show her to the master of the harem; this figure with her high shoulders and the characteristics of her features, is a most successful national impersonation. The Circassian women look languidly to the Egyptian with an expression of supreme contempt, which is responded to by a sneer on the face of the Nubian eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Journal'', Review of the Old Water-colour Society Exhibition, 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orientalizing paintings of nudes were also sometimes exhibited as "Circassians".

The Circassians became major news during the [[Caucasian War]], in which [[Russia]] conquered the North Caucasus, displacing large numbers of Circassians southwards. In 1856 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report entitled "Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women — Infanticide in Turkey", asserting that a consequence of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was an excess of beautiful Circassian women on the [[Constantinople]] slave market, and that this was causing prices of slaves in general to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/ Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women—Infanticide in Turkey]; ''New York Daily Times'', 6 August 1856&lt;/ref&gt; The story drew on ideas of racial hierarchy, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The temptation to possess a Circassian girl at such low prices is so great in the minds of the Turks that many who cannot afford to keep several slaves have been sending their blacks to market, in order to make room for a newly purchased white girl.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also claimed that children born to the "inferior" black concubines were being killed. This story drew widespread attention to the area, as did later conflicts.

At the same time writers and illustrators were also creating images depicting the authentic costumes and people of the Caucasus. [[Francis Davis Millet]] depicted Circassian women during his 1877 coverage of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]], specifying local costume and hairstyle.

==Advertising of beauty products==
[[File:Circassian hair dye.jpg|thumb|A poster from c. 1843 advertising Circassian Hair Dye]]

An advertisement from 1782 titled "Bloom of Circassia" makes clear that it was by then well established "that the Circassians are the most beautiful Women in the World", but goes on to reveal that they "derive not all their Charms from Nature". They used a concoction supposedly extracted from a vegetable native to Circassia. Knowledge of this "Liquid Bloom" had been brought back by a "well-regarded gentleman" who had traveled and lived in the region. It "instantly gives a Rosy Hue to the Cheeks", a "lively and animated Bloom of Rural Beauty" that would not disappear in perspiration or handkerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom of Circassia, ''New-York Gazette'', 2 September 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 "the Balm of Mecca" was also marketed as being used by Circassians: "This delicate as well as fragrant composition has been long celebrated as the summit of cosmetics by all the Circassian and Georgian women in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan". It claims that the product was endorsed by Lady [[Mary Wortley Montague]] who stated that it was very helpful "for removing those sebacious impurities so noxious to beauty". The article continues: "Any lady must be as great an Infidel as the Grand Sultan himself, who, after receiving such authority can doubt that her skin will become as superlatively smooth, soft, white and delicate, as that of the lovely Fatima, whatever may have been its feel or its appearance before. What fair one but must yield implicit faith, when she has the honour of the Countess De --- fairly pledged, that all sepacious [sic] impurities will be at once removed by this wonder-working nostrum. And above all, who but must long for an article, from the seraglio of the Grand Turk, which produces a near resemblance to the Georgian and Circassian beauties?"&lt;ref&gt;To the Ladies, ''New-York Herald'', 14 July 1802&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Lotion" was sold in 1806 for the skin, at fifty cents the bottle. "A sovereign remedy for surfeits, scorching from the heat of the sun, freckles, blights from cold and chills of winter, scorbutic, pimples or eruptions of the face and skin, however violent or disfigured, animalcula generated under the cuticle or outer skin, prickley heat, shingles, ring worms, redness of the nose and chin, obstinate cutaneous diseases, and for every impurity or unnatural appearance with which the skin may be affected; to be used as a common wash for clearing and improving the complexion, and in a superior degree to preserve, soften, cleanse and beautify the skin".&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle' (NYC), 20 September 1806&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Eye-Water" was marketed as "a sovereign remedy for all diseases of the eyes",&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Gazette and State Journal, 2 February 1815&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1840s "Circassian hair dye" was marketed to create a rich dark lustrous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Barrett (1998), Southern Living (in Captivity): The Caucasus in Russian Popular Culture, ''The Journal of Popular Culture'' 31 (4), 75–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century sideshow attraction==
[[Image:Circassian.jpg|thumb|As a sideshow attraction, Circassian beauties were women with [[big hair]], a reference to the teased hair they wore, held in place by beer. Circassian ancestry was not required as in this example.]]

The combination of the popular issues of [[slavery]], the [[Orient]], racial ideology, and sexual titillation gave the reports of Circassian women sufficient notoriety at the time that the [[circus]] leader [[P. T. Barnum]] decided to capitalize on this interest. He displayed a "Circassian Beauty" at his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in 1865. Barnum's Circassian beauties were young women with tall, teased hairstyles, rather like the [[Afro]] style of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850–1877'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2005, pp. 68–88&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Circassian hairstyles bore no resemblance to Barnum's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/23800/23851/Circassian_23851.htm |title=Circassian |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum's first "Circassian" was marketed under the name "[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/344/ Zalumma Agra]" and was exhibited at his American Museum in New York from 1864. Barnum had written to John Greenwood, his agent in Europe, asking him to purchase a beautiful Circassian girl to exhibit, or at least to hire a girl who could "pass for" one. However, it seems that "Zalumma Agra" was probably a local girl hired by the show, as were later "Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]], ''Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body'', [[New York University Press]], 1996, pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum also produced a booklet about another of his Circassians, Zoe Meleke, who was portrayed as an ideally beautiful and refined woman who had escaped a life of sexual slavery.

The portrayal of a white woman as a rescued slave at the time of the [[American Civil War]] played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time. It has been argued that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show Circassian with African identity, and thus,

&lt;blockquote&gt;resonates oddly yet resoundingly with the rest of her identifying significations: her racial purity, her sexual enslavement, her position as colonial subject; her beauty. The Circassian blended elements of white Victorian True Womanhood with traits of the enslaved African American woman in one curiosity.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trend spread, with supposedly Circassian women featured in [[dime museum]]s and travelling [[medicine show]]s, sometimes known as "Moss-haired girls". They were typically identified by the distinctive hairstyle, which was held in place by the use of beer. They also often performed in pseudo-oriental costume. Many postcards of Circassians also circulated. Though Barnum's original women were portrayed as proud and genteel, later images of Circassians often emphasised erotic poses and revealing costumes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; As the original fad faded, the "Circassians" started to add to their appeal by performing traditional circus tricks such as [[sword swallowing]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bogdan, ''Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1990, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[The Safety Fire]], British [[progressive metal]] band, released their song "[[Grind the Ocean|Circassian Beauties]]" in 2012.
*The American [[alternative rock]] band [[Monks of Doom]] released another song with the title "Circassian Beauty" in their 1991 album ''Meridian''.

== Feature films ==

=== ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs'' (2009) ===
{{Main article|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)}}

Flint Lockwood invents a machine that transforms water into food called the "Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator" (FLDSMDFR). Flint turns on the FLDSMDFR in his laboratory, but ends up overloading the house's electrical supply. He then decides to power the machine by hooking it up to a nearby power plant. When he turns the machine back on, it ends up rocketing through town, causing various damage, ultimately shooting up into the sky. While recovering from his failure, Flint meets Samantha "Sam" Sparks, a weather intern whose big break was foiled by Flint's actions. Their conversation is cut short when rainbow colored clouds float over the town and begin to rain cheeseburgers.

=== ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2'' (2013) ===
{{Main article|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2}}

Upon arriving back at Swallow Falls, they notice that a jungle-like environment made of food has overgrown the island. Tim stays behind while Flint and the others investigate, finding a vast habitat of living food animals called foodimals and meet a cute strawberry nicknamed Barry. Tim, searching for sardines at his abandoned tackle shop, encounters a family of humanoid pickles and bonds with them by fishing. Chester discovers that Flint allowed his friends to join him on the mission, so he travels to the island with Barb, chagrined and determined to separate them, and he arrives just in time to save them from a Cheespider. Flint then finds his old lab and invents a device to find the FLDSMDFR. After escaping a Tacodile attack, Sam notices that the foodimal was protecting its family, and begins to suspect Chester is up to no good. Sam attempts to convince Flint to spare the foodimals, but Flint is intent on impressing Chester. Sam leaves in anger, and Flint's other companions go with her. In the jungle, Manny confirms Sam's suspicions when he reverses the Live Corp logo to reveal the "Live" as "Evil" spelled backwards. In addition, Sam proves that the foodimals mean no harm by taming a Cheespider. They also learn that the foodimals had known the truth about Live Corp before. Upon realizing Chester's intentions, the group is then ambushed by Evil Corp employees.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}
{{wiktionary}}
'''Comic relief''' is the inclusion of a [[humour|humorous]] character, scene, or witty dialogue in an otherwise serious work, often to relieve tension.

==Definition==
Comic relief usually means a releasing of emotional or other tension resulting from a comic episode interposed in the midst of serious or tragic elements in a drama. Comic relief often takes the form of a bumbling, [[wikt:wisecrack|wisecrack]]ing [[sidekick]] of the [[hero]] or [[villain]] in a work of fiction. A sidekick used for comic relief will usually comment on the absurdity of the [[hero]]'s situation and make comments that would be inappropriate for a character who is to be taken seriously. Other characters may use comic relief as a means to irritate others or keep themselves confident.

==Use==
Sometimes comic relief characters will appear in fiction that is [[comic]]. This generally occurs when the work enters a [[drama]]tic moment, but the character continues to be comical  regardless.
[[Greek tragedy]] did not allow any comic relief within the drama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/European-History-670/Greek-Tragedy-English-Tragedy.htm|title=Greek Tragedy and English Tragedy|last=Rutherford|first=Sam|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had a tradition of concluding a series of several tragic performances with a humorous [[satyr play]]. Even the Elizabethan critic Sidney following [[Horace]]’s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' pleaded for the exclusion of  comic elements  from a tragic  drama. But in the Renaissance England Marlowe among the [[University Wits]] introduced comic relief through  the presentation of crude scenes in Doctor Faustus following the native tradition of Interlude which was usually introduced between two tragic plays. In fact, in the classical tradition the mingling of the tragic and the comic was not allowed.

==Examples==
[[William Shakespeare]] deviated from the classical tradition and used comic relief in ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The Porter scene in ''Macbeth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tromly |first=Frederic B.|date=Spring 1975|title=Macbeth and His Porter |journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|volume=26|issue=2|pages=151–156|doi=10.2307/2869244|publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library|jstor=2869244}}&lt;/ref&gt; the grave-digger scene in ''Hamlet'' and the gulling of Roderigo provide immense comic relief. The mockery of the fool in ''[[King Lear]]'' may also be regarded as a comic relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Draudt|first=Manfred|year=2002|title=The Comedy of Hamlet|journal=Atlantis|volume=24|issue=2|pages=85–107|issn=0210-6124|url=http://www.atlantisjournal.org/Papers/24_1/draudt.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CompetitiveDanceGroup.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A dance group strikes an ending pose at the conclusion of their competitive performance. Groups such as this are typically formed from students in a dance class. The dancers in this image are members of a tap dance class.]]

'''Competitive dance''' is a popular, widespread hobby  in which competitors perform dances in any of several permitted dance styles—such as [[acro dance|acro]], [[ballet]], [[contemporary]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[hip-hop dance|hip-hop]], [[lyrical dance|lyrical]], [[modern dance|modern]], [[musical theatre]], and [[tap dance|tap]]—before a common group of judges. This is in contrast with other activities that involve competition among dancers based on purpose, or specific dance style, such as [[dance squad|pom squad]] and [[dancesport]].
The competitive dance industry largely consists of ''competition production companies''—also sometimes called ''dance competition companies and dance competition lines''—that conduct regional competitions at stops along their annual, nationwide tours. Dancers who compete at these regional competitions are students ranging in age from approximately four to eighteen years old. Dance schools (often referred to as dance studios) arrange for their classes to compete as groups. Advanced dancers may be chosen to compete solos, duets, trios, or in a small group dance in addition to or in place of large group routines. Competitions typically begin in January and end in July or August.

Competitive dancers must be physically fit because even short dances can be physically demanding. Dancers must continuously train to maintain and improve their technique, balance skills, strength and flexibility. Except for holidays and short breaks during the summer, competitive dancing is typically a year-round activity: dancers attend classes during competition season, to refine their competitive routines, and during off-season to prepare for the next upcoming competition season. Some dancers attend dance intensives during the summer to improve technique. These intensives normally last a few weeks and happen in various locations across the world.

==Competition==

===Dance music===

The [[music]] used in competitive dance routines is typically adapted from commercially available songs created by professional [[recording artist]]s. Dance routines are subject to time limits at most dance competitions, and consequently the original, commercial music is usually edited to conform to such time limits. 

Different styles of dance require different forms of music. Lyrical, contemporary, and modern dances often require slower music. Jazz and hip hop dances are set to more upbeat songs. The musical theatre category is composed of routines set to songs from Broadway musicals, films, and TV shows. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.westsideacademy.com/perfco/forum/download.php?id=4 
  | accessdate = 2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards===
There is no industry-wide standard for scoring. The maximum number of points issued by each judge, as well as the maximum possible final score, varies among competition production companies. Although it is common for judges to issue a maximum of 100 points each, at least one company implements a system in which judges may issue up to 200 points, based on the rationale that such a scoring system is similar to that employed in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Groove Competition
  | title = Competition Rules
  | url = https://www.groovecompetition.com/rules-and-regulations
  | accessdate = 2010-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although scoring at dance competitions vary, the judges score the performances based on similar qualities. The judges usually score based off technique, performance, costume, music, and challenge level of the performance. Each competition's ranks are different. For example some competition's highest medal may be a "gold", whereas another is a "crystal." The performances are usually ranked within the category of dance (Jazz, Ballet, Lyrical, Hip-Hip, etc.) The dances are also ranked "overall". This means that out of all the dances of that age group are ranked based on their score. Overalls include all different categories of dance.

Most competitions have opportunities for dancers to win title positions. Titles include Mr. and Miss dance. These competitions normally include elite dancers who choose to pay an extra fee to run for title. The title competition includes competing a solo, entering a headshot, and being interviewed by the judges. Winners of the title competition typically receive money and a crown.

==Competitions==

===Competitive dance industry===
Dance competitions are organized and conducted by independent competition production companies. In 2007 there were at least 150 such companies operating in the United States and Canada alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DanceCompetitionHub.com |title=Dance Competition Hub |url=http://www.dancecompetitionhub.com |archivedate=November 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition production companies move from one [[metropolitan area]] to another, stopping for a few days in each area to conduct a regional competition. By touring in this manner, these companies are able to generate profits while at the same time enabling significant numbers of dancers to attend local competitions. Some companies also conduct one or more national competitions after their regional tours have ended.

The competitive dance industry has no oversight body or standards organization, although at least one effort was attempted to establish a limited set of competition rules and safety standards in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Association of Dance Conventions and Competitions| url = http://www.theadcc.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition production companies seldom coordinate their tours with each other. Tour start and end dates, as well as cities visited, vary from one company to another. Most companies conduct regional tours from approximately January through May, while National competitions generally run from June through August. It is not uncommon for two regional tours to be visiting the same metropolitan area at the same time.

===Rules and Regulations===
Age Divisions: Dancers in competitions are split into different age categories. The categories are: 4 &amp; under, 5-8 years old (mini), 9-11 years old (junior), 12-14 (teen), and 15-18 (senior). Dancers must bring proof of age to every competition in case their age is challenged. Dancers must stay within one age group of their own respective age group when dancing in groups with dancers of other ages. 

Competition Levels: Dances are split into three categories based on difficulty level. These categories are beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Studio directors and choreographers decide which level a dance is placed in. If judges feel that a dancer is in the level, they may either disqualify the dance or bump it into its right category. 

General Divisions: Solo (1 performer), Duo/trio (2-3 performers), small group (4-9 performers), large group (10-19 performers), line (19-24 performers), and production (25 or more performers)

===Videography and photography===
The choreography of a dance routine—which is the design of movement and flow of steps in the routine—is copyrightable.&lt;ref name="VanCamp2007"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Van Camp
  | first = Julie
  | title = Copyright of Choreographic Works
  | url = http://www.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/copyrigh.html
  | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, video recording is often prohibited at dance competitions in order to steer clear of copyright infringement issues. Some competition production companies employ professional videographers to capture and sell video recordings of competitive performances with the restriction that video recordings may only be sold to the subject performers or members of their studios, thus avoiding infringement. When no professional videographer is available, competition production companies will sometimes permit each attending dance school to designate a videographer to record performances of students from that school.

Unlike videography, still photography does not infringe copyrighted choreography.&lt;ref name="VanCamp2007"/&gt; Because of this, many competition production companies permit photography at their competitions. Virtually all competitions prohibit flash photography, however, both for the safety of performers and to prevent undesirable distractions. Some competition production companies employ professional photographers to capture and sell photographs of dance performances. In such cases, photography by audience members is typically prohibited so as to provide an exclusive market for the official photographers.

{{Nihongo|'''''Da Capo II'''''|〜ダ・カーポII〜|Da Kāpo II|commonly abbreviated as '''''D.C. II'''''}} is a Japanese [[Eroge|adult]] [[visual novel]] developed by [[Circus (company)|Circus]] which was first released on May 26, 2006 for Windows computers. It is a part of the ongoing ''Da Capo'' series of games by Circus, and is the direct sequel to Circus' previous title ''[[Da Capo (visual novel)|Da Capo]]'' released in 2002. ''Da Capo II'' is described by Circus as a {{Nihongo|"ticklish school romance adventure|こそばゆい学園恋愛アドベンチャー|Kosobayui Gakuen Renai Adobenchā}}. A fan disc, ''Da Capo II: Spring Celebration'', was released on April 27, 2007 and features springtime stories set after the endings for each of the six ''Da Capo II'' heroines. An all-ages consumer port titled ''Da Capo II: Plus Situation'' containing additional scenarios was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] in May 2008. The PlayStation 2 version was later ported to PC, titled ''Da Capo II: Plus Communication'' and containing the [[hentai]] scenes found in the original release, in December 2008.

There have been many [[drama CD]]s, and two separate sets of novels and [[manga]] created based on the original game. An [[anime]] adaptation aired in Japan between October and December 2007 on [[TV Aichi]], and was also broadcast on other networks as well. A second season of the anime aired between April and June 2008;&lt;ref name="ANN-2nd-season"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-12-25/da-capo-ii-second-season-to-air-in-japan-in-april|title=''Da Capo II'' Second Season to Air in Japan in April|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 25, 2007|accessdate=December 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; each anime season contained thirteen episodes and were produced by [[Feel (company)|Feel]]. A sequel set 20 years after the end of ''Da Capo II'', ''[[Da Capo III]]'', was released on April 27, 2012.

==Gameplay==
The [[gameplay]] in ''Da Capo II'' utilizes the same system  used in ''[[Da Capo (visual novel)|Da Capo]]'', in which little interaction is required from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent on simply reading the text that will appear on the screen; this text represents either [[dialogue]] between the various characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a "decision point" where he or she is given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. During these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction, depending on which choice the player makes. The consequences of these decisions varies, in which they may either affect the protagonist, Yoshiyuki's action, or his location. At the beginning of the gameplay, the player will mostly be given choices based on the protagonist's actions, but is soon introduced to choices based on locations and the alarm clock. Choices based on locations are accompanied by an image of a heroine, to allow the choices to be easier. The player may also adjust the protagonist's alarm clock, determining the events which occurs the following morning in the game.&lt;ref name="vnreview"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.visual-novels.net/vn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=52|title=Da Capo II review|publisher= visual-novels.net|accessdate=September 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. In order to view the six plot lines to their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points in order to further the plot in an alternate direction.  The game is split into three main parts: the first [[story arc]] revolves around an upcoming [[Christmas]] party, the second arc takes place during the winter holiday break, and the last arc is back at school in the new year.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Da Capo series characters#Da Capo II|l1=List of Da Capo II characters}}
''Da Capo II'' takes place 53 years after the events of ''Da Capo'', when Sakura Yoshino, weary of being alone for so long, wished upon a prototype artificial wish-granting magical cherry tree for a son—Yoshiyuki Sakurai. In the first arc, while Yoshiyuki attends Kazami Academy, beneath the school, he awakens Minatsu Amakase, a robot. Yoshiyuki helps her adapt to a life with humans despite robots being nothing more than mere tools. In the second arc, Yoshiyuki begins to harbor feelings for his stepsisters, Otome and Yume, the granddaughters of Jun'ichi and Nemu. However, the cherry tree starts malfunctioning, granting all wishes, regardless of how impure, which is causing numerous incidents to occur in Hatsune. The situation gradually worsens and Otome has to choose whether or not to wither the cherry tree, which would erase Yoshiyuki's existence in the process, so as to save Hatsune. 

The game centers on {{Nihongo|Hatsunejima|初音島}} the same island as ''Da Capo'' from the original story. Yoshiyuki Sakurai is the protagonist of the game. Sakura and Jun'ichi are the only returning characters, and Nemu is the only other ''Da Capo'' character to be mentioned by name. Moe, Mako, Kotori, Miharu, and Yoriko are also mentioned, but indirectly. Yume, Nanaka, Minatsu, and Sakura's themes are remixes of themes from previous Circus games. Yume, Minatsu, and Sakura's are remixes of Nemu, Miharu, and Sakura's from ''Da Capo'', and Nanaka's is a remix of Sayaka's from ''[[Suika (visual novel)|Suika]]''.

==Development==
''Da Capo II'' was Circus' twenty-ninth game, but was the eleventh game developed by the development group Circus Northern who had also produced their second title ''[[Suika (visual novel)|Suika]]'' and their fourth title ''[[Da Capo (visual novel)|Da Capo]]''. The game's production was headed by Tororo, president of Circus, who also worked on the game's music with Comet Nekono who worked on the game's [[background music]]. The scenario in the game was divided between five people who worked on the different stories for the heroines who include Kōta Takeuchi who mainly worked on Minatsu's and Anzu's stories, the director of the project Chihare Ameno who wrote most of Otome's and Yume's scenarios, Mochizuki JET who wrote Nanaka's and Koko's stories, Nonoka Maihama as a scenario assistant, and Mori no Me. Initial character design was mainly created by Natsuki Tanihara, but [[GotoP]] designed Sakura's pet dog Harimao. Using Tanihara's designs, five more artists in addition to Tanihara illustrated the characters and settings used in the game; these artists include Mochi Chinochi, Mitsumamu, Yuka Kayura, Eko, and Meikai. Tanihara designed Yume, Minatsu, and Sakura; Chinochi designed Nanaka, Koko, and the supporting cast; Mitsumamu designed Anzu; and Kayura designed Otome.

==Reception==
The original ''Da Capo II'' release was positively reviewed at visual-novels.net, commenting: "I know a lot of gamers may not enjoy ''Da Capo'', but whilst I think the story on some arcs was weaker than on others they were still amazing paths to play. On the stronger paths you really start to feel a lot of emotion for these girls, and because they're so closely tied together, someone always gets hurt. That for me bought some realism to the game."&lt;ref name="vnreview"/&gt; In the October 2007 issue of ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'', poll results for the fifty best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, ''Da Capo II'' ranked seventh with forty-seven votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011213916/http://gs.dengekinet.com/ranking/index.html|url= http://gs.dengeki.com/ranking/index.html|title=読者が選ぶ MY BEST ギャルゲーランキング 電撃G'smagazine.com|trans-title=Reader Chosen MY BEST Girl Game Ranking Dengeki G's magazine.com|publisher= [[ASCII Media Works]]|archivedate=October 11, 2007|accessdate=November 7, 2013|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Da Capo II'' was the most widely sold game of 2006 on Getchu.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getchu.com/pc/salesranking2006.html|title=Highest selling games of 2006 on Getchu.com ranking|publisher=Getchu.com|accessdate=September 22, 2007|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Da Capo II: Spring Celebration'' was the second most widely sold game for the first half of 2007 on Getchu.com, just behind ''[[Kimi ga Aruji de Shitsuji ga Ore de]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getchu.com/pc/2007-1salesranking.html|title=Highest selling games of the first half of 2007 on Getchu.com ranking|publisher=Getchu.com|accessdate=September 22, 2007|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, ''Da Capo II: Spring Celebration'' was the sixth most widely sold game of 2007 on Getchu.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getchu.com/pc/salesranking2007.html|title=Highest selling games of 2007 on Getchu.com ranking|publisher=Getchu.com|accessdate=December 31, 2007|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39155">'''Digital storytelling''' is a short form of [[digital media]] production that allows everyday people to share aspects of their story. The media used may include the digital equivalent of [[film technique]]s (full-motion video with sound), stills, audio only, or any of the other forms of non-physical media (material that exists only as [[electronic file]]s as opposed to actual paintings or photographs on paper, sounds stored on tape or disc, movies stored on film) which individuals can use to tell a story or present an idea.

==Introduction==
"Digital storytelling" is a relatively new term which describes the new practice of everyday people who use digital tools to tell their 'story'. Digital stories often present in compelling and emotionally engaging formats, and can be interactive.

The term "digital storytelling" can also cover a range of digital narratives (web-based stories, interactive stories, hypertexts, and narrative computer games); It is sometimes used to refer to film-making in general, and as of late, it has been used to describe advertising and promotion efforts by commercial and non-profit enterprises.

One can define digital storytelling as the process by which diverse peoples share their life stories and creative imaginings with others. This newer form of storytelling emerged with the advent of accessible media production techniques, hardware and software, including but not limited to digital cameras, digital voice recorders, [[iMovie]], [[Windows Movie Maker]] and [[Final Cut Express]]. These new technologies allow individuals to share their stories over the Internet on [[YouTube]], [[Vimeo]], compact discs, [[podcast]]s, and other electronic distribution systems.

One can think of digital storytelling as the modern extension of the ancient art of storytelling, now interwoven with digitized still and moving images and sound. Thanks to new media and digital technologies, individuals can approach storytelling from unique perspectives. Many people use elaborate non-traditional story forms, such as non-linear and interactive narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moursund|first=Dave|title=Information Age Education|url=http://i-a-e.org/articles/46-feature-articles/50-digital-storytelling.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply put, digital stories are multimedia presentations that combine a variety of communicative elements within a narrative structure. Media may include any combination of the following: text, images, video, audio, social media elements (like tweets), or interactive elements (like maps).  

Digital stories may be used as an expressive medium within the classroom to integrate subject matter with extant knowledge and skills from across the curriculum. Students can work individually or collaboratively to produce their own digital stories. Once completed, these stories can easily be uploaded to the internet and can be made available to an international audience, depending on the topic and purpose of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roland|first=Craig|title=Digital Stories in the Classroom|journal=School Art|date=March 2006|volume=105|series=7|issue=7|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and pioneers==

The broad definition has been used by many artists and producers to link what they do with traditions of oral storytelling and often to distinguish their work from slick or commercial projects by focusing on authorship and humanistic or emotionally provocative content. Digital Storytelling has been used by [[Ken Burns]], in the documentary ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]],'' cited as one of the first models of this genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sylvester|first=Ruth|author2=Wendy-lou Greenidge|title=Digital Storytelling: Extending the Potential for Struggling Writers|journal=The Reading Teacher|date=December 2009|volume=63|issue=4|pages=284–295|doi=10.1598/rt.63.4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his documentary, Burns used first-person accounts that served to reveal the heart and emotions of this tragic event in American history, as well as narration, archival images, modern cinematography, and music (Sylvester &amp; Greenidge, 2009). Some of the other artists who have described themselves as digital storytellers are the late [[Dana Atchley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dana|first=Atchley|title=Pioneer of Digital Storytelling|url=http://www.nextexit.com/nextexit/nextframeset.html|work=Next Exit|publisher=Dana Atchley Productions|accessdate=6 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219064738/http://www.nextexit.com/nextexit/nextframeset.html|archivedate=19 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his collaborator [[Joe Lambert]], [[Abbe Don]], [[Brenda Laurel]], and [[Pedro Meyer]].

The "short narrated films" definition of digital storytelling comes from a production workshop by Dana Atchley at the [[American Film Institute]] in 1993 that was adapted and refined by Joe Lambert in the mid-1990s into a method of training promoted by the San Francisco Bay Area-based StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling).&lt;ref name=woletz&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Information Science Reference| isbn = 9781599048635| pages = 587–601| editors = Sigrid Kelsey and Kirk St Amant (eds.)| last = Woletz| first = Julie D.| title = Handbook of research on computer mediated communication| chapter = Digital Storytelling from Artificial Intelligence to YouTube| location = Hershey, PA| year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling), digital stories are produced in intensive workshops. The product is a short film that combines a narrated piece of personal writing, photographic and other still images, and a musical soundtrack. Technology enables those without a technical background to produce works that tell a story using "moving" images and sound. The lower processing and memory requirements for using stills as compared with video, and the ease with which the so-called "Ken Burns" pan effect can be produced with video editing software, have made it easy to create good-looking short films.

Digital storytelling was integrated into [[public broadcasting]] by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s ''Capture Wales'' project working with organisations such as Breaking Barriers. The following year a similar project was launched by the BBC in England titled ''Telling Lives''. [[Sveriges Utbildningsradio]] created ''Rum för Berättande'' (''Room for Storytelling'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ur.se/rfb/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206003423/http://www.ur.se/rfb/|title=URs Rum för Berättande - dina digitala berättelser online / digitalt berättande|archivedate=6 December 2006|work=ur.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netherlands Educational TV Teleac/NOT created a program with young people in different parts of the country. KQED, Rocky Mountain PBS, WETA and other public television stations in the US have developed projects. Digital storytelling is evolving from the simple narrated video to forms that are interactive and look better. These include websites and online videos created to promote causes, entertain, educate, and inform audiences.

==Components==

The most important characteristics of a digital story are that it no longer conforms to the traditional conventions of storytelling because it is capable of combining still imagery, moving imagery, sound, and text, as well as being nonlinear and contain interactive features.  The expressive capabilities of technology offers a broad base from which to integrate. It enhances the experience for both the author and audience and allows for greater interactivity.

With the arrival of new media devices like computers, digital cameras, recorders, and software, individuals may share their digital stories via the Internet, on discs, [[podcasts]], or other electronic media. Digital storytelling combines the art of storytelling with multimedia features such as photography, text, audio, voiceover, [[hypertext]] and video. Digital tools and software make it easy and convenient to create a digital story. Common software includes iMovie and Movie Maker for user-friendly options. There are other online options and free applications as well.

Educators often identify the benefit of digital storytelling as the array of technical tools from which students may select for their creative expression. Learners set out to use these tools in new ways to make meaningful content. Students learn new software, choose images, edit video, make voiceover narration, add music, create title screens, and control flow and transitions. Additionally, there is opportunity to insert interactive features for "reader" participation.  It is possible to click on imagery or text in order to choose what will happen next, cause an event to occur, or navigate to online content.

Additionally, distinctions may be drawn between [[Web 2.0]] storytelling and that of digital storytelling. Web 2.0 storytelling is said to produce a network of connections via social networking, blogging, and [[YouTube]] that transcends beyond the traditional, singular flow of digital storytelling. It tends to "aggregate large amounts of microcontent and creatively select patterns out of an almost unfathomable volume of information,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=M|author2=Garcia|title=Digital Storytelling: A New Player on the Narrative Field|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|year=2010|issue=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  therefore the bounds of Web 2.0 storytelling are not necessarily clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=B|author2=Levine|title=Web 2.0 Storytelling: Emergence of a New Genre|journal=EDUCAUSE Review|year=2008|volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of digital storytelling is the [[micromovie]], which is "a very short exposition lasting from a few seconds to no more than 5 minutes in length. It allows the teller to combine personal writing, photographic images or video footage, narrative, sound effects, and music. Many people, regardless of skill level, are able to tell their stories through image and sound and share those stories with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Storytelling|url=http://i-a-e.org/articles/46-feature-articles/50-digital-storytelling.html|publisher=Information Age Education|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telling a digital story combines a narrative, whether it be fiction or non fiction, personal or general, and digital media.  Digital media includes imaging, video, sound and all other forms of media then can be portrayed visually, the most simple of digital stories can even be a power point.  The point is to convey a message through imagery, which a lot of times can be more effective then if just conveyed through sound.  In my opinion a digital story can even be told by some social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram, where you are constantly posting images accompanied by captions in order to portray the story of your life. "A story can be as short as explaining how you misplaced your keys this morning or as long as a multivolume autobiography", the wonderful thing about telling a digital story is that there really are no rules.  Like any story you want to capture, your audience it is so important when telling a digital story. So, to sell your story, as a writer, a filmmaker, a dramatist, you more often than not will ask yourself about what stories could be more compelling to you and where you might find an interesting and profound dramatic story.

==Uses in education==
The StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model has also been adopted in education, especially in the US, sometimes as a method of building engagement and [[multimedia literacy]]. For example, the Bay Area Video Coalition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=StoryCenter|url=http://www.storycenter.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Youthworx Media Melbourne&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouthWorx Media|url=http://youthworx.org.au/welcome/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709005753/http://youthworx.org.au/welcome/|archivedate=2011-07-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; employ digital storytelling to engage and empower young people at risk.

===Uses in primary and secondary education===

"The idea of merging traditional storytelling with today's digital tools is spreading worldwide."  Anybody today with a computer can create a digital story simply by answering such questions as "What do you think? What do you feel?  What is important? How do we find meaning in our lives?"&lt;ref name="kompar"&gt;{{cite web | first1 = F. | last1 = Komplar | url = http://www.greenwichschools.org/page.cfm?p=4201 | title = Digital Storytelling }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most digital stories focus on a specific topic and contain a particular point of view. "These topics can range from personal tales to the recounting of historical events, from exploring life in one's own community to the search for life in other corners of the universe and every story in between."&lt;ref name="kompar" /&gt;

For primary grades the focus is related to what is being taught, a story that will relate to the students. For primary grades the story is kept under five minutes to retain attention. Vibrant pictures, age-appropriate music and narration are needed.  Narration accompanied by subtitles can also help build vocabulary. Content-related digital stories can help upper-elementary and middle-school students understand abstract or layered concepts. For example, in one 5th grade class a teacher used digital storytelling to depict the anatomy of the eye and describe its relationship to a camera. A fifth grader said, "This year I have learned that places are not just physical matter but emotional places in peoples' hearts.  iMovie has made all my thoughts and feelings come alive in an awesome movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = T. | last1 = Banaszewski | url = http://www.infotoday.com/mmschools/jan02/banaszewski.htm | title = Digital Storytelling Finds its Place in the Classroom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These aspects of digital storytelling, pictures, music, and narration reinforce ideas and appeal to different learning types. Teachers can use it to introduce projects, themes, or any content area, and can also let their students make their own digital stories and then share them.  Teachers can create digital stories to help facilitate class discussions, as an anticipatory set for a new topic, or to help students gain a better understanding of more abstract concepts.  These stories can become an integral part of any lesson in many subject areas.  Students can also create their own digital stories and the benefits that they can receive from it can be quite plentiful.  Through the creation of these stories students are required to take ownership of the material they are presenting.  They have to analyze and synthesize information as well.  All of this supports higher level thinking. Students are able to give themselves a voice through expressing their own thoughts and ideas.

When students are able participate in the multiple steps of designing, creating and presenting their own digital stories, they can build several literacy skills. These include the following: Research skills by finding and analyzing information when documenting the story, writing skills when developing a script, and organization skills by managing the scope of the project within a time constraint. Technology skills can be gained through learning to use a variety of tools, such as digital cameras and multimedia authoring software and presentation skills through the presentation of the story to an audience. Students also gain interview, interpersonal, problem-solving and assessment skills through completing their digital story and learning to receive and give constructive criticism.&lt;ref name="Robin" /&gt;

Software such as [[iMovie]], [[Photo Story]] 3 or [[Windows Movie Maker|Movie Maker]] do all that is required.

Faculty and graduate students at the [[University of Houston]] have created a website, The Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalstorytelling.coe.uh.edu/|title=Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling|work=uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the use of digital storytelling by teachers and their students across multiple content areas and grade levels.

The [[National Writing Project]] has a collaboration with the [[Pearson Foundation]] examining the literacy practices, the values, attitudes, beliefs and feelings, associated with their digital storytelling work with students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = National Writing Project | url = http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/nwp_amsession/1417 | title = Examining the Writing Processes of Digital Storytelling }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use by teachers in curriculum===

&lt;blockquote&gt;Teachers can incorporate digital storytelling into their instruction for several reasons.  Two reasons include 1) to incorporate multimedia into their curriculum and 2) Teachers can also introduce storytelling in combination with social networking in order to increase global participation, collaboration, and communication skills.  Moreover, digital storytelling is a way to incorporate and teach the twenty-first century student the twenty-first century technology skills such as information literacy, visual literacy, global awareness, communication and technology literacy.&lt;ref name="kompar" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The educational goals for teachers using digital storytelling are to generate interest, attention and motivation for students of the "digital generation" in classrooms. The use of digital storytelling as a presentation tool also appeals to the diverse learning styles of students. Digital storytelling also capitalizes on students' creative talents and allows their work to be published on the [[Internet]] for others to view and critique.&lt;ref name="Robin"&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = Bernard | last1 = Robin | url = http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/brobin/TLA/pages/03.htm | title = Digital Storytelling Hands-On Lab | booktitle = The Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling | location = Austin, TX | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A handful of teachers around the world have embraced digital storytelling from a mobile platform. The use of small handheld devices allows teachers and students to create short digital stories without the need for expensive editing software. iOS devices are the norm nowadays and mobile digital storytelling applications like The Fold Game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefoldgame.com/|title=The Fold • unfold stories with friends|work=thefoldgame.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; have introduced an entirely new set of tools for the classroom.

With an emphasis on collaborative learning and hands on teaching, this website offer an in depth look at how to integrate 21st Century Skills with the objectives of a rigorous academic program:

===Uses in higher education===

Digital storytelling spread in higher education in the late nineties with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) collaborating with a number of Universities while based at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]].  StoryCenter programs with the [[New Media Consortium]] led to links to many campuses where programs in digital storytelling have grown; these include University of Maryland Baltimore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umbc.edu/stories|title=Digital Stories @ UMBC|work=umbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cal State Monterey, Ohio State University, Williams College, MIT,  and the University of Wisconsin, Madison.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The University of Colorado, Denver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storycenter.org/certificate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402063802/http://www.storycenter.org/certificate.html |archivedate=2010-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kean University, Virginia Tech, Simmons College, Swarthmore College, the University of Calgary, University of Massachusetts (Amherst), the Maricopa County Community Colleges (AZ),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maricopa.edu/curriculum/A-C/056art150.html|title=Maricopa Community Colleges  ART150     20056-99999 |work=maricopa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have developed programs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. The University of Utah offered its first class on digital storytelling (Writing 3040) in the Fall of 2010. The program has grown from 10 students the first semester to over 30 in 2011, including 5 graduate students. [[Mark Tatge|Chicago journalist Mark Tatge]] started a Digital Storytelling program at [[DePauw University]] in 2011. Students learned journalistic-style storytelling techniques and published the resulting stories on a class website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellingdigitalstories.com|title=Digital Storytelling|work=Digital Storytelling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of digital storytelling among humanities faculty connected with the [[American Studies Crossroads Project]] was a further evolution through a combination of both personal and academic storytelling.  Starting in 2001, Rina Benmayor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcom.csumb.edu/faculty/2tier/faculty/fulltime/rina.html|title=Division of Humanities &amp; Communication|work=csumb.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511004521/http://hcom.csumb.edu/faculty/2tier/faculty/fulltime/rina.html|archivedate=2009-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from California State University-Monterey Bay) hosted a StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) seminar and began using digital storytelling in her Latino/a life stories classes. Benmayor began sharing that work with faculty across the country involved in the Visible Knowledge Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/blogs/vkp/|title=- Visible Knowledge Project|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Georgetown University; LaGuardia Community College, CUNY; Millersville University; Vanderbilt University, and University of Wisconsin–Stout.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Out of this work emerged publications in several key academic journals{{vague|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- name them --&gt; as well as the Digital Storytelling Multimedia Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/projects/digitalstories/|title=Digital Stories - Introduction|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ball State University]] has a masters program in digital storytelling based in the Telecommunications Department,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} as does the University of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imk/MEVIT4130/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[University of Mary Washington]] launched an open online course in digital storytelling titled DS106.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds106.us|title=Welcome to ds106|work=ds106.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course includes credit-seeking students at the University as well as many open, online participants from around the world.

Digital storytelling is also used as an instructional strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daigle|first=Brent|author2=Sulentic-Dowell|title=Can Digital Storytelling Improve Literacy Outcomes for Students with Autism?|journal=Georgia Journal of Reading|date=Spring 2010|volume=33|issue=1|pages=25–34|url=http://www.slideshare.net/brentdaigle/georgia-journal-of-reading-4262677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowenthal, P.

''The Internet and Higher Education''. {{doi|10.1016/j.iheduc.2009.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses in public health, healthcare, social services, and international development===
[[File:Getting out of gangs (8517217065).jpg|thumb|"Day Walker" was Welcome's [[nickname]] in the [[Sonke Gender Justice]] "One Man Can" campaign tackling HIV and gender-based violence.]]

The development of the [[Silence Speaks]] project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silencespeaks.org|title=Silence Speaks|work=Silence Speaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 under the direction of Amy Hill (who joined the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) in 2005) led to the expansion of digital storytelling in public health. Projects developed with the [[Centers for Disease Control]], the [[Open Society Foundation]], work in gender-based violence prevention with groups in California, Texas, New York, Minnesota, and with the organization [[Sonke Gender Justice]] in South Africa, the broad use of digital storytelling with [[Foster Youth]], and finally the connection to digital storytelling to public campaigns in substance abuse prevention and community mental health programs.

Digital storytelling is being used to raise awareness of the "human" factors in healthcare.

The [http://www.patientvoices.org.uk Patient Voices programme] is the product of Pip Hardy and Tony Sumner. Established in 2003, their project provides a means for people (patients, families or healthcare workers) to tell their stories which might affect clinicians, managers and decision-makers in the healthcare arena. The Programme has worked closely with The Royal College of Nursing, The National Clinical Governance Support Team, The National Audit Office, NHS England, NHS Improving Quality, Imperial College Healthcare Trust, Kings College London, University College London and many other NHS organisations and universities. Patient Voices projects have also taken place in Canada, Australia, Norway, Hong Kong and Tanzania and the stories are used in schools of medicine and healthcare throughout the world to prompt reflection and stimulate discussion and debate.

The Patient Voices programme also provides a freely accessible resource to anyone who desires to improve the quality of health and social care. All stories, once released, are  available at The Patient Voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patientvoices.org.uk/stories.htm|title=Patient Voices: The Patient Voices digital stories|work=patientvoices.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stories have contributed to an understanding of patients' experiences and their role in their illness as well as to a greater understanding of the experience of people who work in healthcare.&lt;ref&gt; Haigh, C. and Hardy, P. (2010) Tell me a story: a conceptual exploration of storytelling in healthcare. Nurse Education Today&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the process of creating a Patient Voices digital story has been used to enhance the reflective skills of newly qualified nurses and medical students.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey, G., &amp; Hardy, P. (2010). Challenging the shock of reality through digital storytelling. Nurse Education in Practice&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses in museums===
Digital storytelling is being used by many different museums.

The largest project,  ''Culture Shock!'', is currently taking place in the North East of England.&lt;ref name="Cultureshock"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Cultureshock | url = http://www.cultureshock.org.uk/about.html | title = Cultureshock! - About }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is using museum and gallery collections to inspire people to create their own digital stories, which are also being added to the relevant museum collections.

Another large-scale project is the work of the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]].

The [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. also held a series of classes to integrate arts education curriculum with digital storytelling from 2003-2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = J. | last1 = Springer | first2 = S. | last2 = Kajder | first3 = J. | last3 = Borst | url = http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2004/papers/springer/springer.html | title = Digital Storytelling at the National Gallery of Art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some museums help interpret and make community history accessible. In 2007, the [[Colorado Historical Society]] collaborated with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) to create a program, ''The Italians,'' about Italian American History.  In 2008, a group of eleven museums in Yorkshire launched ''My Yorkshire,'' a digital storytelling project.&lt;ref&gt;http://myyorkshire.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The museums work with communities to use contemporary collected oral histories alongside those from archives to interpret local history from a personal point of view, through the use of historical oral recordings and archival photos. The group has also produced help guides to creating digital stories in a museum setting.

Finished digital stories can have many uses: advertising an upcoming exhibition, preserving a short-term project, building relations with communities. They provide skills to volunteers and can be permanently displayed in galleries.

===Uses for religious training===

In 2005, the Church of Norway initiated a project wherein young people raised questions of faith and life in short biographical mini-films called 'Digital Faith Stories'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital faith stories|url=http://www.uv.uio.no/intermedia/english/research/projects/mediatized-stories/studies/digital-faith.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of this project in a congregation near Oslo found that the method of 'Digital Storytelling' could contribute to a more systematic educational method for including the lifeworld of the young in religious training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaare|first=Birgit Hertzberg|title=Youth as Producers: Digital stories of faith and life|journal=Nordicom Review|year=2008|volume=29|issue=2|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in libraries==

A digital story station is a public space for people to create a digital story that serves to archive oral histories from the public perspective.  These oral stories may focus on a personal experience, incident, describing a place or witnessing an event.  Based on the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model, over 30 public libraries ranging from Northern down the coast to Southern California have a place for people to tell their own story.

Bilingual library staff work with participants to create a recording using the digital station, which can be integrated with a variety of media, including audio, video, pictures, and images. The digital storytelling station project called ''California of the Past'' is funded by a grant from the California State Library, U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services and Technology Act, and administered in California by librarians. The Media Arts Center in San Diego facilitates this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oakland Library|url=http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/PR/pr010509digitalstory.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922052123/http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/PR/pr010509digitalstory.htm|archivedate=2011-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, San Diego has housed a story station in its downtown library. The Media Arts Center of San Diego partnered with the downtown public library to set up a story station where the public can create a three-minute video. The topics of the archived videos range from personal to historical documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Arts Center|url=http://www.mediaartscenter.org/site/c.dfLIJPOvHoE/b.3469457/k.6F12/Digital_Story_Station.htm|accessdate=June 26, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009030357/http://www.mediaartscenter.org/site/c.dfLIJPOvHoE/b.3469457/k.6F12/Digital_Story_Station.htm|archivedate=October 9, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in business==
With the development of marketing in the digital world is digital storytelling implemented in business.
Digital storytelling is used as a tool of [[user-generated content]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/marketing-digital/lecture/mqL1l/digital-concept-user-generated-content-part-1/|title=Digital Concept: User Generated Content, Part1 in the Course :Marketing in Digital World |publisher= [[Coursera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; when consumers contribute their opinion based on their own experiences about a product to promote a firm's product in the digital world.

Digital storytelling is being used by innovative startups to pitch their ideas to the potential investors and to communicate with potential customers to get feedback about the market potential of their product or service.
 
The Enterprise Center with Salem State University organized a Big Idea Video Pitch Contest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enterprisectr.org/big-idea-video-pitch-competition/|title=Big Idea Video Pitch Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;  competition for students to submit a 60-second video pitch of a unique idea for a business, non-profit or social cause. People could vote once per day using the "vote now" button that is displayed in the voting section. The Digital Story that receives the most votes was awarded. Videos were judged on originality, creativity, and the clarity of message.
 
Project [[SomePitching]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somepitching.com/|title=SomePitching}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a crowdsourced online competition for new business ideas and early stage startups to provide feedback on their product and business ideas. The freeform explanation could be a website, a short pitching video or an animation (max. 90 seconds), a slideset (max. 5 pages with font size 20+), or any other material (or combination of materials) that was short and clear for anyone to evaluate.

SomePitching used the Innopinion platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.innopinion.com/|title=Innopinion platform}}&lt;/ref&gt; to manage the idea rating process and the selection of winners based on the ratings from both the public and professional jury.

The intent of this competition wasn't to present the best Big Idea of the product, service, or solution only, but also to find the way, how to interpret it by Digital Story the best way from visual and narrative point of view. Because in the public jury phase, the evaluations was based on the following categories (with percent of the final score):
*Interest to buy or use the solution (20%)
*The importance of the problem the solution solves (20%)
*The value the solution brings (20%)
*The clarity and quality of the material (20%)

==Place-based digital storytelling==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
The [[Canadian Film Centre]]'s New Media Lab (formerly MediaLinx Habitat) launched a project, Murmur, out of the 2002–2003 studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murmurtoronto.ca|title=hear you are --- [murmur] Toronto|work=murmurtoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project integrates audio interviews into cellphone-based tours. StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) created Storymapping.org in 2006 with projects in [[Mendocino, California|Mendocino]] (California), [[Houston]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] (Alabama) to promote the connection between storytelling and issues of local memory and civic planning.

'''The Voice Library (TVL)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.TheVoiceLibrary.net|title=THE VOICE LIBRARY - Digital storytelling: Instantly record and share voices for generations to come.|work=thevoicelibrary.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched two, ongoing, social-giving projects in 2014. ''The Military Families Story Project'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militarystoryproject.thevoicelibrary.net/|title=Military Families Story Project by The Voice Library|work=thevoicelibrary.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; based out of Portsmouth, NH, maintains and strengthens families' ties, builds morale through a brother-/sisterhood network, enables service men and women and their families to record history as they make it, and memorializes veterans' experiences. TVL's national ''Let Me Be Your Memory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letmebeyourmemory.net/|title=Let Me Be Your Memory - Powered by TheVoiceLibrary.net &amp; Cognitive Dynamics|work=letmebeyourmemory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; project, in collaboration with '''Cognitive Dynamics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cognitivedynamics.org/2010/09/welcome-to-cognitive-dynamics/|title=Welcome to Cognitive Dynamics|author=SonarDNS|work=cognitivedynamics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a unique, six-week audio-based archiving Language Arts curriculum for students and educational institutions that builds multiple, Common Core-adaptable competencies by raising awareness of those living with memory disorders and their caregivers. It stimulates students to learn, investigate, and connect with family and community. The Voice Library changes the digital storytelling paradigm by providing users passcode-protected access through any telephone technology. It also provides online access. [[Interactive web stories|Both combine audio and still-image capability.]] For 24/7, global access, unlike social media, subscribers' private accounts are secured on the company's server.

''Elfland Catacombs'' is one of the earliest examples of [[hypertext fiction]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} . It was published by Winterhearth company in 1981{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, several years before [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]'s ''[[Afternoon, a story]]'' (which is generally thought to be "the first hypertext fiction"). Author Alan Lance Andersen created ''Elfland Catacombs'' as a children's fantasy adventure, using the [[Commodore BASIC]] computer language. The plot involved the reader visiting an aunt in the border country of Scotland and becoming lost after crossing into Elfland with the help of an elf named Jennings. Numerous plot paths led to different endings — some happy and others not quite so pleasant. Unlike the many computer game style adventures of the period, this was a true electronic storybook with hypertextual links. Paul Jordan Hollander later converted it from the obsolete Commodore Basic into HTML files. 
Whatever its literary or technological merits may have been, "Elfland Catacombs" had little or no influence on the development of hypertext fiction. It was distributed on 5" floppy disk in Central Iowa; indeed, it appears to have been almost entirely forgotten outside of Iowa. It is not mentioned in Bolter and Joyce's seminal Hypertext 87 essay on "Hypertext and Creative Writing", nor in Ted Nelson's _Literary Machines_, George P. Landow's _Hypertext: The Convergence of Contemporary Literary Criticism and Technology_, nor in J. Yellowlees' Douglas 1991 doctoral dissertaion on hypertext fiction .  It has never been cited in the Proceedings of the ACM Hypertext Conference.  In contrast, Joyce's [[Afternoon, a story]] has been the subject of numerous reviews, essays, studies, and dissertations.

An '''entertainment robot''' is, as the name indicates, a robot that is not made for utilitarian use, as in production or domestic services, but for the sole subjective pleasure of the human. It serves, usually the owner or his housemates, guests or clients. Robotics technologies are applied in many areas of culture and entertainment.

Expensive robotics are applied to the creation of narrative environments in commercial venues where [[servo motors]], [[pneumatics]] and [[hydraulic]] actuators are used to create movement with often preprogrammed responsive behaviors such as in Disneyland's haunted house ride.

Entertainment robots can also be seen in the context of media arts where artist have been employing advanced technologies to create environments and artistic expression also utilizing the actuators and sensor to allow their robots to react and change in relation to viewers.

==Toy robot==
{{Category see also|Toy robots}}
Relatively cheap, mass-produced entertainment robots are used as mechanical, sometimes interactive, toys which perform various tasks and tricks on command. The first commercial hit was, not surprisingly, modelled on the most popular pet: the canine.

===Robotic dog===
{{further|Robot dog}}
Robot dogs as a fad have been produced with relatively little variation. These are some commercial models:
* ''Teksta'' a toy robot dog popular in the 1990s which was intended to be able to perform card tricks and respond to commands.
* ''[[Aibo]]'' (The [[Sony]] robot dog)
* ''[[Poo-Chi]]''
* ''Bo-wow''
* ''[[I-Cybie]]''
* ''[[iDog]]'' ([[Sega]]'s robot iPod music speaker)
* ''[[Gupi]]'', a robotic [[guinea pig]]
* ''Space Dog'', the remote control dog&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.retroplanet.com/the-history-of-toy-robots/|title=The History of Toy Robots|date=2009-07-15|work=Retro Planet|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robot dogs also appear fairly frequently in fiction compared to other forms of personal entertainment robots.
* ''[[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]]'' [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]]'s portable computer and robot, from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[BBC Television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''.
* ''Preston'' - Wendolene's robot dog from the 1995 animated [[Wallace and Gromit]] film ''[[A Close Shave]]''.
* ''Goddard'' pet of [[Jimmy Neutron]].

===Humanoid entertainment robots===
{{further|Humanoid robot}}
Despite those [[humanoid]] robots for utilitarian uses, there are some humanoid robots which aims at entertainment uses, such as [[Sony]]'s [[QRIO]] and [[Wow Wee]]'s [[RoboSapien]]. They are usually capable of some advanced features like Voice Recognition or Walking.

===Substitute pets===
{{Weasel|section|date=January 2010}}
While primitive robot toy models only execute standardized pre-programmed routines, sometimes little more than a wind-up toy could do, advancing technology allows for interaction with the user and/or other environmental stimuli (e.g. sensor-detected obstacles), thus somewhat resembling a live playmate.

Nevertheless, in the mind of some users the things can hold the loved place of a pet, as demonstrated by the fact that some even sleep with a metallic one instead of a plush cuddly toy.

In fact manufacturers even found it pays to produce a toy that is essentially designed to be nurtured, rather like an egg in some 'parenting experience simulations', as proven by the success of the Japanese [[Tamagotchi]].

Entertainment robots can take the form of interactive communications marketing tools at trade shows wherein promotional robots move about a trade show floor providing tongue-in-cheek interaction with trade show attendees in order to bring said attendees to a particular companies trade show booth. These promotional robots are hired by companies to entertain the inform trade show attendees about products ad services available at trade shows, example www.entertainmentrobots.com rents trade show robots.

==Commercial show robots==
As usual in the entertainment industry, capital and creativity are invested to try and top anything the private person can afford. In fact, from their owner's point of view this is a professional use, but the product is designed with as end use in mind its appreciation by the public.

Thus expensive robots are made for use as:
*marketing tool - logically showed off by the manufacturers, to promote their products and technology, occasionally used in other promotional productions
*prop - inanimate performer or even artificial actor in show, TV and movie production (as the fictitious first toy robots, see above); as technology advances, some advanced robots can, often helped with other special effects, to make them seem what cannot (yet), even be significantly more than a cast extra, such as the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' double trilogy (1977-2005) which have proved rather popular from the start.

== Non-commercial art robots ==
In 1956, [[Nicolas Schöffer]] created ''Cysp 1 (Spatiodynamique Cybernétique)'', a robot and dancer working together to create an abstract sculpture and choreography with [[musique concrète|concrete music]] by [[Pierre Henry]]. These works could react to color, sound and light.

[[Survival Research Laboratories]], in San Francisco, California, creates large destructive robotic performances to [[roast (comedy)|roast]] contemporary culture and express their distaste for the [[military-industrial complex]].

[[Emergent Systems]] is creating large-scale interactive art environments where robots are able to respond to humans and each other as they react and evolve in the robotic installations. Autopoiesis was one such [[artificial life]] work that allowed a series of robots constructed of grapevines to both act as individuals and a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628201408/http://accad.osu.edu/~rinaldo/works/autopoiesis/autopoiesis.html|title=Ken Rinaldo; Autopoiesis is a group consciousness of interactive robotic sculptures - robotic art|date=2006-06-28|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augmented Fish Reality allowed [[Siamese fighting fish]] to control their robots to meet across the gap of their glass fish bowls.

[[Intel Museum]] hosts the A.I. driven interactive robot, ARTI, which is short for "artificial intelligence". This robot is considered to be a work of fine art and is capable of recognizing faces, understands speech and even teaches the museum guests about the history of the museum and its founders, Robert Noyes and Gordon Moore. ARTI's face is made out of an inanimate silicon wafer.

A '''flashing arrow''' is a metaphorical audiovisual cue used in [[film]]s to bring some object or situation that will be referred later, or otherwise used in the advancement of plot, to the attention of the viewers.

The device is not introduced into the plot or the dialogue, but is something peripheral; however made ''obvious'' (hence the name) by a particular camera shot or background music.
An example of this device is a camera close-up in a horror movie that suggests information like danger from an unlocked door. A ''literal'' flashing  arrow was used in the 1981 film ''[[Student Bodies]]'' to mock this [[cliché]]d use.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- Is this the origin of the term? --&gt; http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/public/tv-smarter-johnson.html&lt;/ref&gt; The use of flashing arrows and that particular joke were both mentioned in ''[[Everything Bad Is Good for You]]'', where the authors says works that have little use of this and require figuring things out yourself have a more deductive viewer base.

Another example of a literal flashing arrow can be seen in the ''[[Ouran High School Host Club]]''. This device is used several times throughout the anime—for instance in the first episode, a flashing arrow and high-pitched beeping noise indicate a vase that a character breaks later on in that scene.

Yet another instance is a cut, situation blank in an action film when the hero is in a [[deathtrap (plot device)|difficult-to-escape situation]], to a brief shot of the item he will use to save himself.

A form of flashing arrows is used in some video games as well; in these cases, the important object or clue is itself glowing or flashing.  However, this use can be forgiven to an extent,{{Says who|date=February 2011}} as a realistically sized key (for example) would be nearly impossible to see on a standard-sized television set ''without'' some sort of illumination.

A case in point of this can be seen in the film ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'' during a scene where the protagonist stabs to death a young woman with a pencil. The pencil shows up in nearly every cut scene before the girl's death.

Another example of a flashing arrow is used in the film ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'', when the child with the bike and the bus driver appear in numerous scenes, before both of them become a factor in Harold Crick's "death".

{{Video Games}}
A '''gamer''' is a person who [[Player (game)|plays interactive games]], especially [[video games]], tabletop [[role-playing games]], and skill-based [[Card game|card games]], and who plays for usually long periods of time. In some countries, such as the UK, the term "gaming" can also refer to legalized [[gambling]], which can take both traditional [[Tabletop game|tabletop]] and [[Online gambling|digital forms]]. There are many different gamer [[Community|communities]] around the world. Since the advent of the internet, many communities take the form of [[Internet forum]]s or [[YouTube]]/[[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] [[virtual communities]], as well as [[Real life#As distinct from the Internet|in-person]] [[social clubs]].

Those who play video games regularly are split roughly equally between male and female, but men are more likely to call themselves a 'Gamer.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/|title=Gaming and Gamers|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|date=2015-12-15|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female gamer/gamer girl===
{{Main|Women and video games}}
[[File:Go Play One 2010 - P1370638.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A woman playing Go Play One in 2010]]
A female gamer, or gamer girl, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.&lt;ref name="Theesa.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Facts and Figures"/&gt;
According to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Duggan |first1=Maeve |title=Who plays video games and identifies as a “gamer” |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/who-plays-video-games-and-identifies-as-a-gamer/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=17 September 2018 |date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of the term "girl gamer" is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[reappropriation|reappropriated term]], while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/10699-In-Defense-of-the-Casual-Gamer | title=In Defense of the Casual Gamer | publisher=Escapist magazine | date=30 October 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2014 | author=Heather Barefoot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotypes==
Although men and women play roughly the same number of games, there is a [[stereotype]] that women are not considered ¨True Gamers¨ because they tend to play more [[Casual game|casual games]] which do not require much skill and dedication. This stereotype exists due to the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, thus, overshadowing the girl gamers who could compete at the same level but are not able to get the same amount of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-016-0678-y|title=SpringerLink|last=|first=|date=|website=db16.linccweb.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.

*''Newbie'': ''[[Newbie]]'', (commonly shortened to "noob", "n00b", or "newb") is a slang term for a [[wikt:novice|novice]] or [[wikt:newcomer|newcomer]] to a certain game, or to gaming in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masonry/Misc/welaish.html |title=Masonry on the Internet |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/words-online-gaming-opinions-books-newbs.html|title=Gamer Speak for Newbs|work=Forbes|author=Anna Vander Broek|date=2009-04-23|accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Casual gamer'': The term ''casual gamer'' is often used for gamers who primarily play [[casual games]], but can also refer to gamers who play less frequently than other gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/04/30/core-and-casual-whats-the-difference/|title=Core and Casual: What’s the difference?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casual gamers may play games designed for ease of gameplay, or play more involved games in short sessions, or at a slower pace than hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="Heather Barefoot"/&gt; The types of game that casual gamers play vary, and they are less likely to own a dedicated video game console.&lt;ref&gt;Magrino, Tom, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6178563.html?tag=result;title;1 GameStop: Casual gamers spurring hardcore holiday sales]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072417/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6178563.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B1 |date=July 11, 2011 }}, GameSpot, Sep 11, 2007, Accessed 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyes, Emma, [http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result;title;0 GDC '08: Are casual games the future?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711000000/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |date=July 11, 2011 }}, ''GameSpot'', Feb 18, 2008, Accessed May 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of casual games include ''[[The Sims]]'' and ''[[Nintendogs]]''.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Casual gamer demographics vary greatly from those of other video gamers, as the typical casual gamer is older and more predominantly female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_6695921|title=Women driving 'casual game' boom|first=Troy|last=Wolverton|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=2007-08-23|accessdate=2007-10-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fitness gamer"s, who play motion-based exercise games, are also seen as casual gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://playstationlifestyle.net/2010/04/19/plethora-of-fitness-titles-lined-up-for-playstation-move/|title=Plethora of Fitness Titles Lined Up For PlayStation Move#|work=PlayStation LifeStyle|date=2010-04-19|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Core gamer'': A core or mid-core gamer is a player with a wider range of interests than a casual gamer and is more likely to enthusiastically play different types of games,&lt;ref name="IwataAsksWiiU3definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/index.html?disableNav=true/#/e32011/newhw/0/6|title=Iwata Asks: E3 2011 Special Edition|page=7|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-06-09|quote='''Iwata''':  the definition of a core gamer is much wider, namely, someone who has a much wider range of interests, someone who enthusiastically plays many types of games that challenges different creative directions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but without the amount of time spent and sense of competition of a hardcore gamer. The mid-core gamer enjoys games but may not finish every game they buy, doesn't have time for long MMO quests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/06/are-you-a-mid-core-gamer/|title=Are you a mid-core gamer?|publisher=[[joystiq.com]]|author=Scott Jon Siegel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[target market|target consumer]].&lt;ref name="NextGeneration"&gt;{{cite web | title=GameStop | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1277&amp;Itemid=32 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203110531/http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1277&amp;Itemid=32 | archivedate=2007-12-03 | first=Colin | last=Campbell | date=2005-10-10 | work=Edge | publisher=Future| accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]] stated that they designed the [[Wii U]] to cater to core gamers who are in between the casual and hardcore categories.&lt;ref name="IwataAsksWiiU3cater"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/index.html?disableNav=true/#/e32011/newhw/0/6|title=Iwata Asks: E3 2011 Special Edition|page=7|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2011-06-09|quote='''Iwata''': On the other hand, I certainly do not think that Wii was able to cater to every gamer's needs, so that's also something I wanted to resolve. [...] The keyword for our presentation at this year's E3 is "Deeper and Wider". With Wii U, I would like to offer this proposal with that concept.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of theories have been presented regarding the rise in popularity of mid-core games.  James Hursthouse, the founder of Roadhouse Interactive, credits the evolution of devices towards tablets and touch-screen interfaces, whereas [[Jon Radoff]] of [[Disruptor Beam]] compares the emergence of mid-core games to similar increases in media sophistication that have occurred in media such as [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/9/4604088/the-rise-of-midcore-gaming|title=Core gamers, mobile games and the origins of the midcore audience|publisher=Polygon|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Hardcore gamer'': [[Ernest W. Adams|Ernest Adams]] and [[Scott Kim]] have proposed classification metrics to distinguish "hardcore gamers" from casual gamers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131397/from_casual_to_core_a_statistical_.php | title=From Casual to Core: A Statistical Mechanism for Studying Gamer Dedication | publisher=Gamasutra | work=Gamasutra | accessdate=17 June 2014 | author=Adams, Ernest}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing action, competition, complexity, gaming communities, and staying abreast of developments in hardware and software. Others have attempted to draw the distinction based primarily on which platforms a gamer prefers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcauthority.com.au/Feature/260885,the-problems-of-defining-a-hardcore-gamer.aspx|title=The problems of defining a hardcore gamer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to decry the entire concept of delineating casual from hardcore as divisive and vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/10/22/call-of-duty-demonstrates-the-completely-fictitious-line-between-hardcore-and-casual-gaming/|title='Call of Duty' Demonstrates The Completely Fictitious Line Between Hardcore And Casual Gaming|first=Paul|last=Tassi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional gamer===
{{See also|eSports}}
[[Professional]] gamers generally play video games for [[prize]] [[money]] or [[salaries]]. Such individuals usually deeply study the game to master it and usually to play in [[competitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Schorn |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/19/60minutes/main1220146.shtml |title='Fatal1ty' article at CBS News |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2006-08-06 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries of Asia, particularly [[South Korea]] and [[China]], professional gamers and teams are [[sponsorship|sponsored]] by large companies and can earn more than {{USD|link=yes}}100,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/7/23/235053/081 |title=A Brief Look At Professional Gaming |publisher=kuro5hin.org |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 [[Major League Gaming]] contracted several ''[[Halo 2]]'' players including [[Tom "Tsquared" Taylor]] and members of [[Team Final Boss]] with $250,000 USD yearly deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/news/mlg-awards-1-75-million-in-contracts-for-top-pro-gamers |title=MLG Awards $1.75 Million in Contracts for Top Pro Gamers (press release)|work=Major League Gaming |date=December 18, 2006 |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrogamer===
{{Main|Retrogaming}}
A retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and often enough collect, [[retro games]]—older video games and [[arcade game]]s. They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification in taxonomies===

A number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:
* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.
* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[Glitch|glitches]], and expose all game mechanics.
* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.
* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.
* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it.
The [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described aesthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avatar==
{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}
{{See also|Player character}}
An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Similarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.

==Clans and guilds==
A [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).

==Identity==
{{See also|Gamergate controversy}}
The identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the "true gamer" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to "[[cinemaphile]]".&lt;ref name="escapistPublisherNote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;
People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play "enough" to qualify.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"/&gt; Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term "gamer", even though they may play regularly.&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newmediaDoYou"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

In August 2014 began a controversy linked to gamer identity, named [[Gamergate controversy]]. The controversy has been described as a manifestation of a [[culture war]] over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The [[Gamergate controversy]] concerns issues of [[Sexism in video gaming|sexism]] and [[progressivism]] in video game culture, stemming from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]] #GamerGate.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of [[feminism]] on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Demographics===
[[File:Hillary Rodham Clinton playing a Nintendo Game Boy video game on the flight from Austin en route to Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hillary Clinton]] playing a [[Nintendo Game Boy]] video game on a flight]]
Games are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been increasing over time.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-10-30-platform-not-gender-drives-gamer-differences-eedar|last=Nofziger|first=Heather|title=Platform, not gender, drives gamer differences
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/public-debates-about-gaming-and-gamers/|title=2. Public debates about gaming and gamers|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|date=2015-12-15|website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt; Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by [[Nintendo marketing#Demographic shifts|Nintendo's efforts to reach new demographics]].&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; Market penetration of [[smartphones]] with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience,&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"/&gt; since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.&lt;ref name="bizNotGender"/&gt;

While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers.&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=Why ALL gamers matter — my view as a female games analyst|date=28 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun ‘Gamer’ Label}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of [[hispanics]] identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of [[African-Americans]] and 7% of [[whites]].&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt; The competitive [[fighting game]] scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant.&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/2/6/5361004/fighting-game-diversity|last=Bowman|first=Rich|work=Polygon|title=Why the Fighting Game Community is Color Blind}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]].&lt;ref name="polygonFightingGame"/&gt; Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"/&gt;

===Casualization===
Casualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly.&lt;ref name="inaCasualization"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarrazin|first=Vincent|date=October 7, 2011|url=http://www.inaglobal.fr/en/video-games/article/casualisation-video-games|title=The Casualisation of Video Games|work=ina global|publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]]|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of [[gameplay]] in established genres and franchises.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"/&gt; Compared to seminal titles like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]]'', more recent mass-market action games like the [[Call of Duty]] series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of [[interactive movie]]s.&lt;ref name="eurogamerDoom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-06-22-years-on-doom-retains-the-ability-to-shock|last=Stewart|first=Keith|work=The Guardian|title=22 years on, Doom retains the ability to shock}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press rarely calls attention to depth or features found in [[retro games]] but missing from new releases.&lt;ref name="gamasutraAmnesiac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20141009/227370/Amnesiac_Heroes_Why_are_we_abandoning_gaming_history.php|last=Pepe|first=Felipe|work=Gamasutra|title=Amnesiac Heroes: Why are we abandoning gaming history?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestudies.org/1201/articles/kirkpatrick|title=Constitutive tensions of gaming's field: UK gaming magazines and the formation of gaming culture|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Graeme|work=Gamestudies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Brendan Keogh]], these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity.&lt;ref name="overlandClueless"/&gt; Belying these trends, games including ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Minecraft]]'' have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex.&lt;ref name="gamasutraDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JohnathonSwift/20140110/208440/quotDumbing_downquot.php|last=Swift|first=Johnathon|work=Gamasutra|title=Dumbing down}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are "just as 'hardcore' as the next guy over who plays ''[[Counter-Strike]]''"&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/17/more-women-play-video-games-than-boys-and-other-surprising-facts-lost-in-the-mess-of-gamergate/|last=Harwell|first=Drew|work=The Washington Post|title=More women play video games than boys, and other surprising facts lost in the mess of Gamergate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreunen says being in control of a game's environment appeals equally to boys and girls.&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"/&gt; [[Leigh Alexander (journalist)|Leigh Alexander]] argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.&lt;ref name="edgeDumbingDown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |last=Alexander |first=Leigh |work=Edge |title=Too many gamers think diversity means dumbing down – it’s time to forget that outmoded view |date=August 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713174818/http://www.edge-online.com/features/too-many-gamers-think-diversity-means-dumbing-down-its-time-to-forget-that-outmoded-view/ |archivedate=July 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">The '''Herkie''' (aka Hurkie) is a [[cheerleading]] jump named after [[Lawrence Herkimer]], the founder of the [[National Cheerleaders Association]] and former cheerleader at [[Southern Methodist University]].  This jump is similar to a side-hurdler and to the abstract (double hook), except instead of the bent leg's [[knee]] being pointed downward, it should be flat while the other leg is straight in a straddle jump (toetouch) position. 

The jump was invented accidentally, because Herkimer was not able to do an actual side-hurdler.&lt;ref&gt;Branch, John. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/sports/ncaabasketball/15cheer.html "Shaking Pompoms for the Grandfather of Modern Cheerleading"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 14, 2009. Accessed March 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Common misspellings include: Hurky, Herky.

==Jump Position==
In a left herkie, the jumper has the left leg straight in a half-straddle position, and the right leg bent flat beneath them. In a right herkie, it is the opposite. When used as a "signature" at the end of an organized cheer, the jumper typically bends their weaker [[human leg|leg]].

===Arm Positions===
When you do a Herkie, the arm positions depend on how your legs are. If you were to do a left Herkie, then your left arm would be straight up in a High V motion, and your right arm would be on your hip. If your were doing a right Herkie, it would be the opposite.

'''''Idols''''' (also known as '''''SuperStar''''' in some countries) is a reality television singing competition [[Media franchise|format]] created by British television producer [[Simon Fuller]] and developed by [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]]. The format began in 2001 with the British television series ''[[Pop Idol]]''; its first adaptation was the Polish series ''[[Idol (Polish TV series)|Idol]]'' in 2002. It has since become the world's most widely watched television franchise, as well as one of the most successful entertainment formats, [[spin-off (media)|adapted]] in over 46 regions around the world, with its various versions broadcast to 150 countries. An estimated worldwide audience between 3.2{{nbsp}}billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rautiainen-Keskustalo |first1=Tarja |title=Pop Idol: Global Economy – Local Meanings |journal=The Ashgate Research Companion to Popular Musicology |date=23 December 2009 |issue=26 |doi=10.4324/9781315613451.ch26 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |url=https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9781315613451.ch26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 6.5{{nbsp}}billion viewers have watched variants of the show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25263456|title=Pakistan Idol talent show is broadcast for first time|publisher=BBC|date=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the franchise has generated more than {{US$|2.5 billion|long=no}} in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘IDOL’ FRANCHISE WORTH $2.5 BILLION |url=https://nypost.com/2007/01/09/idol-franchise-worth-2-5-billion/ |work=[[New York Post]] |date=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each season, the series aims to find the most outstanding unsigned solo recording artist (or "idol") in a region. Originally aimed for pop singers, the series have since evolved to accept singers from different genres of music, such as [[rock music|rock]], [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], and [[country music|country]]. Through a series of mass auditions, a group of finalists are selected by a panel of judges (which usually consists of artists and record producers) who offer critiques on their performances. The finalists then advance to the weekly live shows. On each live show, the contestants all sing, the television audience votes (by telephone or [[SMS]]), and then the contestant who receives the fewest votes gets eliminated. The final episode is the grand finale episode, when usually two, but sometimes three or four, finalists are left, and the contestant who gets the largest number of votes is declared the winner. The winner receives a [[recording contract]], monetary prizes, and a title as their nation's "Idol", "SuperStar" or "Star". Sometimes one or more of the runners-up get recording contracts as well.

The various series have launched the careers of a number of highly successful recording artists around the world, including ''Idols'' winners [[Will Young]] of the United Kingdom, [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Carrie Underwood]] of the United States, [[Kurt Nilsen]] of Norway, [[Ryan Malcolm]] and [[Kalan Porter]] of Canada, [[Guy Sebastian]] of Australia, and [[Elvis Blue]] of South Africa. Contestants who did not win but have still gone on to prominence include [[Anthony Callea]], [[Ricki-Lee Coulter]] and [[Jessica Mauboy]] of Australia, [[Carly Rae Jepsen]] of Canada, and [[Clay Aiken]] and [[Chris Daughtry]] of the United States, among many others. Some ''Idols'' contestants have also achieved success in acting and musical theater, most notably [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Academy Award]] winner [[Jennifer Hudson]].

== Origin and background ==

In 2001, British talent manager and television producer [[Simon Fuller]] created the British television series ''[[Pop Idol]]''. The series was developed by production company [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]] and was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 6 October 2001. Fuller, along with television producer [[Nigel Lythgoe]], was inspired to create the series by the New Zealand television series ''[[Popstars]]'', which was adapted in the United Kingdom as ''[[Popstars (UK)|Popstars]]'' in January 2001. The [[Pop Idol (series 1)|first series]] of ''Pop Idol'' proved to be more popular than ''Popstars'', in part due to the chemistry of the judges and the success of its first winner [[Will Young]].

''Pop Idol''{{'}}s success led to an interest for adaptations in other countries. Before selling the format, Fuller reached out for an out-of-court settlement with ''Popstars'' creator Jonathan Dowling, in which international versions of ''Idols'' will be prohibited to use the prefix ''Pop'' in their local titles. As such, Poland, the first country to adapt the format, named their version as simply ''[[Idol (Polish TV series)|Idol]]''. ''Idol'' was launched in 2002, months after the first series of ''Pop Idol'' ended.

Fuller, Lythgoe, and ''Pop Idol'' judge [[Simon Cowell]] attempted to sell the format in the United States in 2001, but the idea was met with poor response from major networks. [[Elisabeth Murdoch (businesswoman)|Elisabeth Murdoch]], daughter of [[News Corporation]] chairman [[Rupert Murdoch]], persuaded her father to buy the rights for an American adaptation. The series, ''[[American Idol|American Idol: The Search for a Superstar]]'', debuted on the [[Fox network]] on 11 June 2002. ''American Idol'' also featured Cowell as its judge, who also proved to be popular among the American audiences. ''American Idol'' quickly rose to the top of the [[Nielsen ratings|U.S. TV ratings]], due to the popularity of the judges (particularly Cowell) and its contestants, which were led by its first winner, [[Kelly Clarkson]].

The success brought by ''American Idol'' led to even more adaptations in other countries, where the Dutch ''[[Idols (Dutch TV series)|Idols]]'' became the top television series in the Netherlands during its airing.

==Concept==
The show is a reality television singing competition where the winner is selected by the audience voting. The show combines a number of elements previously used by other shows such as ''[[Popstars]]'' – mass auditioning, the search of a new star, and the use of a judging panel that critiques the audtioners' performance and selects the contestants. An important element is audience participation, where the audience may vote by telephone or text to decide which contestant can proceed further each week and ultimately win. According to the show creator, Simon Fuller, "the interactivity was important because this would allow the audience to tell me who they liked best and this, in turn, would indicate to me who would have the most fans and eventually sell the most music and become the biggest stars."&lt;ref name="fuller"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fuller|first=Simon|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118037190?refcatid=14&amp;printerfriendly=true|title=Simon Fuller on how 'Idol' began|publisher=Variety.com|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this is added "the drama of backstories and the real-life soap opera of the unfolding real-time events" as the show is presented as a live competition event which drew "more from a sporting concept of true competition".&lt;ref name="fuller"/&gt;

==Format==
===Hosts===
Each show has at least one host that directs the show, introduces the singers and delivers the results of each episode including the finale. While some countries have one host (''[[American Idol]]'': [[Ryan Seacrest]], ''[[Indonesian Idol]]'': [[Daniel Mananta]], ''[[New Zealand Idol]]'': [[Dominic Bowden]]), most shows have two co-hosts. As well as judges, some countries have adopted new members to the hosting/jury party.

===Judges/jury===
A preselected panel of [[music industry]] representatives tour some, if not all audition cities (depending on which show) to observe and advance those auditioning throughout the show up to and including the Grand Finale. The judges offer [[critique]]s and/or advice after each contestant performance, which can be positive or negative; [[Nouvelle Star|''Nouvelle Star 4'']] for the first time in any country introduced a red and blue "score card" type system where the jury award a blue "positive" or red "negative" rating and in [[Nouvelle Star|''Nouvelle Star 14'']], they introduced a scoring system where the jury give a point from a range of 1 to 10 after every mottoshow performance.

As many as five stable jury members have appeared in any one ''Idol'' season ([[Idol (Poland)|''Idol Poland 3'']], [[Indonesian Idol (season 9)|''Indonesian Idol 9'']]), though some versions offer "guest judges" or special musical guests on the program to also offer advice.

The judges of some shows gain a lot of popularity outside of the show as well as the contestants, due to their being collectively known to have a "caustic" or raw &amp; blunt attitude towards contestants' performances, notably [[Simon Cowell]], [[Kyle Sandilands]], [[Kuba Wojewódzki]], [[Dieter Bohlen]], [[Ian "Dicko" Dickson]], [[Paul Moss]], [[Ahmad Dhani]], [[Titi DJ]], [[Zack Werner]], [[Wyngard Tracy]] and [[Anu Malik]] amongst others.

===Performance stages===

'''Auditions''' are held in numerous places in any particular region or country that give most people (audition entry is bound by certain legal requirements such as age and [[citizenship]] for example) the chance to sing in front of musical/television producers and if successful, they advance to a recorded televised audition where the show "judges" advance up to 300 people in some countries to the next round.

The '''Theatre round''' is where a specially selected group of auditioners from all regional auditions converge (always in the host city) to perform in three sub stages: a ''chorus line'' in groups of 10 where free song choices are allowed, a ''[[Trio (music)|trio]]'' (or less commonly a duo or quartet) where contestants must memorize a preselected song to perform and choreograph together, and finally a solo ''[[a cappella]]'' round where contestants sing a song of their own choice without musical backing in front of friends, family, judges &amp; fellow contestants.

Each stage of the theatre round, a number of contestants are eliminated and sent home by the judges, though in some countries there have been very few contestants brought back during the Wildcards show or by the disqualification or resignation of another contestant.

In ''[[American Idol]]'', this stage has been expanded to five stages (three in Hollywood, two in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]) since season 10.

The '''semi-final''' occurs usually live or pre-recorded (in some countries) where contestants sing in a television studio fully televised; again judges give critiques but beginning at this stage, home viewers vote via telephone and [[short message service|SMS]] (and in some countries other voting mechanisms including via Internet or via [[Red Button (Digital Television)|Red Button]]) who they want to stay in the competition. During the "semi-final" weeks, contestants receive a workshop tuition with a vocal coach to prepare their song of choice. The format started out with contestants only singing along to a piano, though other instruments &amp; even a live band have been introduced to some versions.

An average semi-final usually consists of 18 to 50 contestants where they either perform in an even group of contestants (three groups of ten for example) or in a "heat" type semi-final where the contestants sing every week until all finalists have been chosen. During the format, a '''Wildcards''' feature was introduced which re-introduced past semi-finalists to receive a second chance to become a finalist, in some shows – the judges sometimes pick one or more contestants to advance as well as the viewers' vote. As of late, live audiences have been incorporated into the semi-final round.

A results show of the semi-final usually airs either a few hours after the performance show or the night after where the results are given. Three or four contestants are told that they may have received highest votes, though only a selected two or three are put through to the finals.

The '''Live shows''' ([[Aka (initialism)|a.k.a.]] '''Mottoshows''', '''Spectacular shows''' or '''theme shows''') are an elaborate and spectacular version of the semi-final. There is a weekly theme on which contestants must base their song choices, such as "80s Hits" or "Hits of [[Elton John]]" for example. In a bid to counter sagging ratings, contestants on ''[[Australian Idol]]'' were allowed to bring instruments on stage with them and had the opportunity to sing original material from the 2006 season, a world first. Since then America and Canada have followed Australia's lead. Again a results show follows the show; this time it may include group performances, musical guests or extra footage of the contestants' time on the show. The contestant/s with the lowest polled votes leaves the competition. The live shows continue until there are only two contestants left in the competition or three contestants in some cases.

The '''Grand Finale''' occurs when there are two (or, rarely, three and only once so far four) contestants left in the competition. This is the pinnacle of the entire series and often highest rated show; also for some countries, it is venued in a prestigious location (''[[American Idol]]'': [[Dolby Theatre]]/[[Microsoft Theater|Nokia Theatre]], ''[[Canadian Idol]]'': [[John Bassett Theatre]], ''[[Australian Idol]]'': [[Sydney Opera House]], ''[[Philippine Idol]]'': [[Araneta Coliseum]], ''[[Indonesian Idol]]'': [[Ancol Dreamland|Ecovention Ocean Ecopark]]/[[Jakarta International Expo|Hall D2 JIExpo]], [[Idol (Sweden)|''Idol Sweden'']]: [[Ericsson Globe]], ''[[Singapore Idol]]'': [[Singapore Indoor Stadium]]). In this final stage a specially awarded song is sung by both remaining contestants which is ultimately slated to be released as the winner's debut [[CD single|single]] though recently in some countries this has been phased out.

During the extended results show, there are usually group performances and/or special musical guests. Also, it has the best moments of the series which leads up to the announcement of the winner, which is determined by the highest number of votes. When that happens, he or she will perform an encore of the coronation single which sometimes includes [[pyrotechnics]]/[[fireworks]].

While the show's premise is to find one winner with promises of a recording deal and other frugal benefits, the Idol series often has several contestants who go onto the same route of fame, whether they be finalists, semi-finalists, or even auditioners. Key examples of this from ''American Idol'' include [[Clay Aiken]] (second place, [[American Idol (season 2)|season 2]]) and [[Chris Daughtry]] (fourth place, [[American Idol (season 5)|season 5]], through his band [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]]), who have each [[Top-selling American Idol alumni in the United States|outsold]] all ''American Idol'' winners except [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Carrie Underwood]]; [[Jennifer Hudson]] (seventh place, [[American Idol (season 3)|season 3]]), who would later win the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]]; and [[William Hung]], who turned his off-key season 3 audition into a recording career and has outsold some finalists.

===Releases===
Often, a studio [[compilation album]] and/or a CD single is made to promote the show. In some cases, DVDs of highlights of the show will be released. While these releases have sold well in countries including the United States and Australia, many countries did not release CDs after the first series.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Since [[American Idol (season 6)|season 6]], ''[[American Idol]]'' has sold only promotional downloads instead of CDs. For season 6, it sold studio-recorded MP3 and performance video downloads of the finalists on its website; no CDs were sold prior to the post-''Idol'' releases of winner [[Jordin Sparks]] and runner-up [[Blake Lewis]]. For [[American Idol (season 7)|season 7]], audio and video downloads are sold exclusively through the [[iTunes Store]], which became a sponsor in that season; the iTunes downloads have included audio of all semi-finalist performances, studio recordings and performance videos for all finalists, videos of finalist group performances, and audio and video performances from the ''[[Idol Gives Back]]'' episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanidol.com/itunes/ iTunes Downloads – American Idol]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media/sponsorship===
[[Sony Music]] is the general record company associated and affiliated with the Idols format in most countries, though countries like [[Iceland]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Kazakhstan]] have affiliate labels as they do not have a local Sony Music subsidiary. FremantleMedia and Sony Music were related through common parent [[Bertelsmann]], which owns 90.4% of FremantleMedia's immediate parent [[RTL Group]] and previously owned 50% of joint venture [[Sony BMG]] from 2004 to 2008. Since 2011, [[Universal Music Group]] replaced [[Sony Music Entertainment]] as the general record company associated and affiliated with the Idols format in most countries.

==Themes==

A notable commonality among Idol-format shows is the theme logo &amp; intro style.
Many different versions of the Idol logo and show intro have been created since Idol's inception in June 2001.

===Logo===

The basic plan for the logo is an oval with the particular show's name centered in custom lettering based on a common font ([[Kaufmann (script)|Kaufmann]]). Mostly the name of the show is written horizontally, however occasionally part of the name is angled upwards.

The original ''Pop Idol'' logo featured an enhanced star in the logo. The star also appeared briefly on the ''American Idol'' logo, but was scrapped early in the [[American Idol (season 1)|Season 1]] auditions.

The logo for some countries comes with an underline on the words '''SuperStar''', or '''Idol''', such as ''[[Deutschland sucht den Superstar]]'', ''[[Hrvatski Idol]]'', Hrvatska traži zvijezdu, [[Super Star (Arabic TV series)|''Super Star'']], ''[[Hay Superstar]]'', ''[[Nouvelle Star]]'', ''[[Narodniy Artist]]'', ''[[Super Idol (Greek TV series)|Super Idol]]'', and ''[[Pinoy Idol]]'' (which also has a raised word). ''[[Turkstar]]'' has the only Idol logo to not use the common font style. As part of a relaunch after the first season, the French ''Nouvelle Star'' logo was changed to purple – the only logo to depart from the standard blue palette until Arab [[Super Star (Arabic TV series)|''SuperStar'']] season five had changed to the same color scheme also.

==='Intro' sequence===

====Idolatry (2001–2005)====
The original version of the ''Idol'' intro was created by Liquid TV Graphics in London which started with the dark blue Idol logo descending on the screen. A [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] human figure appears, with arms raised, intended to be the 'Idol' of the show's name. While the Idol figure sings, and then walks, images of guitars, microphones, cameras, and airplanes flow by, representing the life of a superstar. During this, the gender of the figure alternates between male and female. Finally, the figure is again in front of the Idol logo, raising hands in victory. The ''[[American Idol]]'' intro was altered each season from Season 2, including new sound effects and replacing the jet airplanes with waving flags. The flag concept was also used in the ''[[Indian Idol]]'' intro, as well as displays of famous national landmarks appearing in the first scene.

====Tunnel (2005–2012)====
In 2005, a new version of the ''Idol'' intro was created by Aerodrome Pictures in Los Angeles which first appeared on the [[American Idol (season 4)|Season 4]] premiere of ''[[American Idol]]''. The intro starts with the ''Idol'' logo without the dark blue background spinning in the American and Canadian version while the other Idol formats only glows and sparkles then the logo zooms in featuring a long section of the CGI ''Idol'' figure riding an open elevator past large vertical screens and displays and then walking down a stylized tunnel to a stage, where the figure starts to perform. On this basic template, the American and Canadian versions are customized, with past ''Idol'' winners appearing on the screens in the American version, while the Canadian version's screens feature Canadian [[landmarks]]. The American &amp; Canadian versions last for 30 seconds; the new intro sequences for other ''Idol'' shows only last 15 seconds, with no customization and instead of the logo being 'stuck down' to the outside of the tunnel, it is pasted over the top. Also, the intro sequence for Nouvelle Star has a purple and blue color scheme instead of the standard light blue/light green.

====Gyroscope (2008–present)====
In 2008, a new version of the ''Idol'' intro was created and introduced by BLT &amp; Associates in Los Angeles on the [[American Idol (season 7)|''American Idol'' 7th]] season finals. The intro starts with the Idol logo spinning behind a gyroscope then features real male and female Idol figures passing horizontal and arc displays then walking to an arena where the two figures start to perform. Finally, only one figure raises his/her hands in victory in front of a huge arc display then zooms out to the atmosphere and to space, where the title of the show zooms out in front of planet Earth. The ending title of this intro is similar to the [[Universal Pictures]] logo of 1990 (for the starry background) and in 2012 (for the earth model). The American, Australian, Canadian, Croatian, Latin American and Swedish versions are customized by featuring their past Idol winners in the horizontal and arc displays and last for 30 seconds. Other versions are also customized and last for 30 seconds without featuring their past winners. Some of the Idols versions didn't use the Gyroscope theme in the intro, such as Indian Idol and Deutschland sucht den SuperStar (Germany). Indian Idol used the Tunnel theme for the intro from 2007 to 2010 and in next season after that, 2012, Indian Idol used the 'Hall of Idols' theme, while Deutschland sucht den SuperStar used the 'Tunnel' theme for the intro until 2012, until in 2013 till present, Deutschland sucht den SuperStar uses its own intro. Only the French version lasts for 20 seconds.

====Hall of Idols (2011–present)====
In 2011, a new version of the ''Idol'' intro was created once again by Aerodrome Pictures in Los Angeles which first appeared on the [[American Idol (season 10)|Season 10]] premiere of ''[[American Idol]]''. The intro starts with a stage being spotted under a spotlight from the sky. Then, a stylized bridge leading towards a screen is shown. Winners of ''Idol'', as well as notable alumni from past seasons are shown on the screen. The camera turns to a [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]-like shape blooming and a CGI figure appears. Depending on the figure's gender in the intro, the figure would yield a different action in front of the ''American Idol'' logo and the huge "IDOL" word string (in "American Idol" and "Indonesian Idol" (not shown anymore since [[Indonesian Idol (season 9)|Season 9]]) but not in "Arab Idol"): the male figure raises his hand in victory and strikes a pose while the female figure raises her arms in victory before bowing down. Sometimes, a female figure will appear.

====New Idol (2013–present)====
In 2013, a new version of the ''Idol'' Intro was created on the [[Deutschland sucht den Superstar (season 10)|Season 10]] premiere of ''[[Deutschland sucht den Superstar]]''. The new intro begins with a mysterious person with a microphone at the mouth. As previous posting Intro male and female talents are displayed. They sing and dance on the big stage. In the meantime, always a person who appears followed a path. On that path along former candidates from earlier seasons are displayed on screens.

====Gyroscope 2.0 (2014–present)====
In 2014, a new version of the ''Idol'' intro was created by The Mill in Los Angeles which first appeared on the [[American Idol (season 13)|Season 13]] premiere of ''[[American Idol]]''. The intro starts with a hole opening up. Then, the gyroscope logo comes out of the hole. A crowd cheers in a stage. Finally, the gyroscope logo appears with the Roman numerals "XIII" below the logo. The intro was also used in the South African version of Idol.

====Idol on Street (2015)====
In 2015, a new version of the ''Idol'' intro was created and appeared on the [[American Idol (season 14)|Season 14]] premiere of ''[[American Idol]]''.

====The Farewell of Idol (2016)====
In 2016, a new version of the ''Idol'' intro was created and appeared on the [[American Idol (season 15)|Season 15]] premiere of ''[[American Idol]]''.

====Hall of Idol 2.0 (2016 – present)====
In 2016, a new version of the ''Idol'' intro was created and appeared on the Season 5 premiere of ''Idols'' in Netherland.

====ABC's Idol (2018 – present)====
[[American Idol (season 16)|American Idol's revival]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was accompanied with a Disney-like intro. It starts with several shooting stars falling from the sky before curving up and circling the neon American Idol logo with fireworks in the background at the end. This opening is much shorter than the previously used intros. It acts as an integrated part of a longer opening introduction in each episode rather than a standalone opening theme as in previous seasons.

==Setting==

===Characters &amp; organizations===
{{details|Kerberos saga characters}}
As a military science fiction work the Kerberos Saga's main characters are members of rival military and police services, namely the [[List of Kerberos Saga characters#Metropolitan Security Police Organization "M.P."|Shutokei]] (a.k.a. the "Capital Police" in the English language adaptation), the [[List of Kerberos Saga characters#Self-Police|Self-Police]] ("Local Police" in the English adaptation) and the [[JSDF]]. However, these conflictual forces have a common foe, [[Sedition|Anti-government]] organizations and terrorists such as [[The Sect]] and its factions.

Secondary and [[guest appearance]] characters introduced by author Mamoru Oshii are taken from his previous works such as [[culinary art]] and [[rhetoric]] masters [[Tachiguishi]] ("Fast Food Grifters" in the English adaptation) or [[Kerberos saga characters#Cameo characters|Detective Matsui]] from the ''[[Patlabor]]'' franchise.

Members of the saga's core organisation, the Shutokei's [[List of Kerberos Saga characters#Special Armed Garrison "Kerberos"|Special Armed Garrison]], have an animal counterpart which is an [[allegory]] and sometimes a [[metonymy]]. This animal can be a [[mythological]] dog such as [[Cerberus]] (the garrison's [[emblem]]) and [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]] as in the comic book, or it can be a German [[dog breed]]s as in ''[[Kerberos Panzer Cop]]'' and its sequel ''[[Kerberos Saga: Rainy Dogs]]''; this comic book series original title means "Dog-Wolf Legend" (犬狼伝説, ''kenrou densetsu''). It can be a [[Honshū wolf|Japanese wolf]] (狼, ''Ookami'') as in ''Jin-Roh'' ("Man-Wolf" in English) and in ''Kerberos &amp; Tachiguishi'' which borrow drama parts to the ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' tale. Also it can be a stray dog as in the 1991 eponymous movie.

===Timeline===
The Kerberos Saga is based upon an [[alternate history]] with key events called "incidents" (事件, ''jiken''). Altered historical events turned into fiction include Japan siding with the Allies, the Germany-won [[battle of Stalingrad]], [[Claus von Stauffenberg|Stauffenberg]]'s then-successful [[20 July plot|assassination attempt on Hitler]], the [[occupation of Japan]] by Germany - instead of the United States - called "[[Weimar Republic|Weimar Establishment]]" (ワイマール体制, ''weimaru taisei''), and the prominent [[February 26 Incident|26 February ''coup d'état'']] (a.k.a. "Kerberos Uprising") attempted by the Special Armed Garrison instead of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].

===Main locations===
Although the saga's plot is mainly located in the Japanese capital (as the Special Armed Garrison jurisdiction is limited to the [[Tokyo]] area), some episodes happen in foreign cities including [[Taipei]] and [[Tainan City|Tainan]] (''[[StrayDog: Kerberos Panzer Cops]]''), [[Old Havana]] (''[[The Killers (2003 manga)|The Killers]]'') and [[Stalingrad]] (''Kerberos Panzer Jäger'').

Among the Tokyo landmarks appearing in the saga are [[Odaiba]] (''The Red Spectacles''), [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], the [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]] (''Kerberos Panzer Cop'' Act4), [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department|Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department headquarters building]] (''Kerberos Panzer Cop'' Act8), the [[Prime Minister of Japan]]'s cabinet called [[Kantei]] (''Kerberos Panzer Cop'' Act8) and the [[University of Tokyo]]'s [[University of Tokyo, Komaba Campus|Yasuda Auditorium]] (''Kerberos Saga Rainy Dogs'' Act3).

A recurring location is [[sewerage|sewer]], it can be the Tokyo sewer as in ''Kerberos Panzer Cop'' (Act 1) and ''Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade'' or abroad sewer as in ''Kerberos Saga Rainy Dogs'' (Act 8). In all these works, sewer is the final stage holding the Special Armed Garrison (Kerberos) main character's last fight. In the Greek mythology, the ''Kerberos'' ([[Cerberus]]) watchdog guards the gates of the Underworld, called [[Hades]], to prevent those who have crossed the [[river Styx]] from ever escaping. Hence the sewer can be regarded as an [[allegory]] of the [[Underworld]]; the original title for the 1991 movie ''[[StrayDog]]'' is "kerberos: watchdog of ''jigoku''" (ケルベロス 地獄の番犬, ''keruberosu: jigoku no banken'') with ''[[Diyu|jigoku]]'' being the realm of the dead in the [[Japanese mythology]].

==Releases==

===Japanese releases===
The saga started in January 1987 with the Japanese broadcast of the [[radio drama]] series ''[[While Waiting for the Red Spectacles]]'' (紅い眼鏡を待ちつつ, ''Akai megane o machi tsutsu''), prior to the theatrical release of the live-action film ''[[The Red Spectacles]]'' (紅い眼鏡, ''Akai megane''). A manga series adaptation, ''[[Kerberos Panzer Cop]]'' (''Kenrou densetsu'') started the following year and was compiled as a single volume (Acts 1~4) in 1990.

The following year was released ''[[StrayDog: Kerberos Panzer Cops]]'' (ケルベロス 地獄の番犬, ''Keruberosu jigoku no banken''), the first theatrical adaptation of the manga.

In 1999, the manga series was completed (Acts 5~8) and re-released as two compilation volumes. Few months later was released ''[[Jin-Roh]]'' (人狼, ''Jinrou'') the anime adaptation of the first manga. It remains the franchise's most popular work outside Japan until today.

''[[Tachigui: The Amazing Lives of the Fast Food Grifters]]'' (立喰師外伝, ''Tachiguishi retsuden''), an animation feature spin-off was released in theaters and DVD in 2006.

===Asian releases===
''Kerclros Panzer Cop 犬狼伝説'', an unlicensed Chinese version of the 1990 manga volume was published in Taiwan in the early 1990s.

''犬狼傳說'', a Chinese version complete volume (Acts 1~8) was available in [[Malaysia]] in 2000. A licensed, two volumes, Chinese version of the Japanese 2000 re-edition ("Frozen Version") was issued in [[Hong Kong]] the same year. A similar edition was available in Korean language in South Korea the same year.

A traditional Chinese 2-volume licensed edition was published in Taiwan in 2002.

===North American releases===
A six issues English adaptation of the first manga volume was published in 1994, in the United States and Canada as ''[[Hellhounds: Panzer Cops]]''. A compilation volume edition was published in 1997.

The English dubbed version of ''Jin-Roh'' was released in North America in 2001.

Two years later, the English subtitled version of the 1987 and 1991 live action films was released on DVD.

===European releases===
''Hellhounds: Panzer Cops'', the English adaptation of the first manga volume, was translated in German and serialized in a German book from 1996 to 1997.

In 1998, the American ''Hellhounds: Panzer Cops'' all-in-one volume was licensed and distributed in the United Kingdom.

The following year ''Jin-Roh'' was premiered in France and later released in Germany. It was one year before the Japanese release.

===Toy lines===

With each new episode release, Japanese toys and model kits manufacturers such as Kaiyodo, Medicom or [[Takara]] produce Protect-Gear scale models.

===Fan works===

After the North American release of Jin-Roh, various Kerberos Protect-Gear skins were created by fans to be used in the popular [[Counter-Strike]] [[First-person shooter|FPS]], an American video game series (1998~2004).

In 2005, ''Images of the Last Battalion'', an independent short anime directed by a student, [[Koichi Kishita]], was released in Japanese film contests. The following year, the bootleg video was edited and projected as an official trailer at Mamoru Oshii's ''[[Kerberos Panzer Jäger]]'' launch party and Kishita joined [[Production I.G]]'s 3DCG team.

Japanese and Chinese Protect-Gear fans sculpted, modified, or repainted licensed toys. Some of these "custom" items are released as limited edition garage kits available in conventions and import action figure shops and websites.

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=''KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World'' is an anime that has a lot of fun mocking the tropes of the typical JRPG fantasy world via a colorful cast of characters that are enjoyable in their own right.

Like its light novel counterpart, the anime has received positive reception for its comedy, parody of the "trapped in a fantasy world" subgenre, and faithful adaptation of the light novels.&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; Reviewing the first few episodes, [[Anime News Network]] (ANN)'s Theron Martin described the second episode as "the funniest episode of anime I have seen since ''[[Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun]]'' aired", while also praising the series' musical score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/konosuba-god-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world/episodes-1-2/.97800 |title=KonoSuba – God's blessing on this wonderful world!!

In contrast, a common criticism of the anime was its inconsistent character animation, one that was described as "low budget" as characters appeared [[off-model]].&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrissy|first=Kim|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2017/02/27-1/feature-novel-vs-anime-konosuba|title=FEATURE: Novel vs Anime - "Konosuba"|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=February 27, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koichi Kikuta responded by stating such design was intentional, hoping to "bring out the individuality of each character" rather than the prettier artwork in the light novels; to do this, Kikuta's animation displayed "their more human sides, like their unflattering traits and their distressed moments."&lt;ref name="Interview with Koichi Kikuta"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wavemotioncannon.com/2017/02/07/konosuba-interview-with-koichi-kikuta-anime-style-009-july-2016/|title=Konosuba Interview with Koichi Kikuta (Anime Style 009, July 2016)|work=Wave Motion Cannon|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crunchyroll]]'s Kim Morrissy considered the animation to be humorous, especially fitting in a comedic anime.&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; [[Kotaku]] writer Richard Eisenbeis explained much of the series' humor derives from the deconstruction of Kazuma's hopes of becoming the hero of a fantasy world, instead realizing he is forced to struggle his way through the world.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eisenbeis|first=Richard|url=https://kotaku.com/when-your-new-life-in-a-jrpg-world-doesn-t-live-up-to-e-1778353269|title=When Your New Life in a JRPG World Doesn't Live Up to Expectations|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=May 26, 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing Kazuma's problems in a fantasy world to those in real life, Creamer wrote about a sense of relatability between the series' protagonists and the audience, as the party deals with issues like debt and taking questionable jobs because of high pay. On a critical note, Creamer disapproved of Kazuma's negative attitude, which he felt harmed the comedy in the series.&lt;ref name="Creamer review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Nick|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/konosuba-god-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world-episodes-1-10-streaming/.100209|title=KonoSuba – God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!

''KonoSuba''{{'s}} characters, especially those in Kazuma's party, have gained favorable thoughts in the anime community. Creamer described the group as possessing a "strange but endearing chemistry," as the members are unfriendly with one another, yet are close.&lt;ref name="Creamer review" /&gt; Morrissy added the party's "emotional bond is also evident in the ways they interact with each other.

'''''Lake Placid''''' is an [[United States|American]] series of monster horror/comedy films created by [[David E. Kelley]]. It began with ''[[Lake Placid (film)|Lake Placid]]'' in 1999 and spawned five made for television sequels, ''[[Lake Placid 2]]'' (2007), ''[[Lake Placid 3]]'' (2010), ''[[Lake Placid: The Final Chapter]]'' (2012), ''[[Lake Placid vs. Anaconda]]'' (2015) (the latter being a crossover with the [[Anaconda (film series)|''Anaconda'' series]]) and ''[[Lake Placid: Legacy]]'' (2018). 

Each installment revolves around the presence of giant, 30-foot-long [[man-eater|man-eating]] [[crocodile]]s in the [[fictional location]] of Black Lake, [[Maine]], and the efforts of various groups to capture or destroy the creatures. All of the films reference members of the fictitious "Bickerman" family.

==Films==
===''Lake Placid'' (1999)===

A group attempts to destroy a giant, 30-foot-long man-eating crocodile, which terrorizes Black Lake, Maine.

===''Lake Placid 2'' (2007)===
{{Main article|Lake Placid 2}}
In the sequel to the feature film, man-eating crocodiles return to the lake as two males and one aggressive female crocodile, which is protecting her nest, wreak havoc on the locals.

===''Lake Placid 3'' (2010)===
{{Main article|Lake Placid 3}}
A game warden moves his family to Lake Placid, once the site of deadly crocodile attacks. Locals assure him the crocs are gone, but his mischievous young son finds a few baby crocs and begins feeding them. They quickly grow into very big adults and start attacking the game warden's family and nearby town.

===''Lake Placid: The Final Chapter'' (2012)===
{{Main article|Lake Placid: The Final Chapter}}
Reba the poacher is back, now an EPA agent. Black Lake is turned into a crocodile sanctuary surrounded by an electric fence. When the fence gets left open one night, a high-school field trip bus unknowingly enters the park. It's up to Reba and the sheriff to save the kids from becoming crocodile chow.

===''Lake Placid vs. Anaconda'' (2015)===
{{Main article|Lake Placid vs. Anaconda}}
In Black Lake, Maine, an accident allows the two giant species, crocodiles and [[anaconda]]s to be regenerated and they escape towards Clear Lake. Now, Reba teams up with Tully to find his daughter Bethany and a group of sorority girls in a deadly match between the two creatures.

===''Lake Placid: Legacy'' (2018)===
{{Main article|Lake Placid: Legacy}}
A group of young explorers discover a secret area hidden from all maps and GPS devices. When they reach the center of the lake, they discover an abandoned facility that houses one of the largest, and deadliest apex-predators known to man. This is a direct sequel to the original film, which ignores the events to the previous films and the only film in the series to not feature or reference the Bickerman family.

[[Lifestyle (sociology)|Lifestyle]] changes have been increasing slowly since the introduction of [[media (communication)|media]]. Media – [[film]]s, [[television show]]s, [[magazine]]s, and more recently, the [[Internet]] (i.e. [[Blogs|self-written blogs]] and popular [[website]]s) are the main sources of lifestyle influence around the world. Lifestyle changes include how people eat, dress, and communicate. [[Celebrity endorsements]] are prevalent. Lifestyle trends have always been influenced by the [[wealth]]y and [[celebrity|famous]], whether they are spotted at leisure or in a paid advertisement.  At the dawn of the media age, the newspaper, popular magazines like ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', and TV allowed the general public glimpse lifestyles that before were only available to the imagination.  After its creation, the Internet became arguably the most powerful medium for spotting and influencing trends, not just by celebrities but by the average person. The computer era has changed the way people obtain their news, perspectives and communication. Magazines are still popular, but advertisers now often supply a [[web address]] where consumers can visit for more information than a print ad can provide. The average American household has two personal computers, making the Internet easily accessible. The rise of [[user-generated content]] is exemplified by the fact that anyone with Internet access can create a blog or an [[online journal]], whether personal or commercial, which might detail someone's experience in a new restaurant, a purchased item of clothing or knickknack, or a review to a film.  With the advent of the Android phone and its relative ease of uploading photos to social media sites such as Facebook, one can get an idea of how quickly an idea, pub review, or coveted object can be shared. Advertisers have always been privy to the strength of [[word-of-mouth]] and have tapped into [[social media]], including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Tumblr]] to make their wares known. [[Douglas Kellner]] writes, "Radio, television, film, and the other products of media culture provide materials out of which we forge our very identities; our sense of selfhood; our notion of what it means to be male or female; our sense of class, of ethnicity and race, of nationality, of sexuality; and of "us" and "them.""&lt;ref name=Kellner&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellner|first=Douglas|title=CULTURAL STUDIES, MULTICULTURALISM, AND MEDIA CULTURE|url=http://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/papers/SAGEcs.htm|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity-endorsed beauty and health products==
Media affects how people diet. Commercials advertise special [[diet pill|pill]]s, [[Juice fasting|juice fasts]], [[raw diet]]s, and all-soy diets. Celebrities [[Celebrity endorsement|endorse]] food products and diets that promise dramatic results in little time. Audiences are impressionable depending on their age range. [[Salma Hayek]], who has been using juice cleanses for 15 years promises health with her own line, Cooler Cleanse. [[Jennifer Aniston]] is famous for her [[yoga]]-body and has revealed her secret, which the public has taken as a big health influence. So Feminine provides health and lifestyle advice taken from celebrities and their personal assistants/trainers. Reality star [[Kim Kardashian]] endorsed QuickTrim, a [[Weight loss drug|weight-loss product]] designed to get rid of unwanted weight. Recent news articles claim that the product is unhealthy, and Kardashian is facing a lawsuit for her endorsement. Along with cleanses are celebrity [[beauty products]]. Salma Hayek has a [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]]-exclusive line of hair care and cosmetic products, called Nuance. Admirers of Hayek who covet her beauty have hope that her products will make them look appealing. Websites such as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' and Celebrity Beauty Buzz list favorite skincare and makeup products of celebrities so readers can purchase the same products in hopes of achieving similar results. Health articles note that the meticulous science process is often forgotten in favor of the newer-is-better trend taking over mass media. Harvard School of Public Health states, "With [media reports'] emphasis on short, "newsworthy" pieces, the media often only report the results of single studies, and many stories are chosen simply because the results run contrary to current health recommendations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvard School of Public Health|title=The Nutrition Source: Deciphering Media Stories on Diet|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/nutrition-news/media/|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popular magazines and websites often focus on what's new in the world of celebrity health and beauty routines and forgo substantial research in order to bring to the masses what the public are truly interested in; quick, easy-way-out health fixes such as these juice cleanses and detox diets.

Celebrity endorsements are effective due to their high profile presence in the media. Their [[physical attractiveness]] is central to their ability to sell products to an impressionable audience. Celebrities are also effective because they are what many people aspire to be or look like. Celebrities act as symbols of personal desire. "In an attempt to communicate the merits of their product or brand," says Michael A. Kamins, Ph.D., New York University, "advertisers have often chosen to use endorsement as a promotional strategy." Additionally, "the use of celebrity spokespeople has always been a favorite strategy among agencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamins|first=Michael, A.|title=An Investigation into the "Match-Up" Hypothesis in Celebrity Advertising: When Beauty May be Only Skin Deep|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=19|issue=1|pages=4–13|year=1990|jstor=10.2307/4188750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamins informs that advertisers are well aware of how easily celebrities influence consumer habits; it is the combination of their physical appeal and their high status that draws in the public. He explains, "Indeed, a considerable amount of research exists both in the social sciences and in marketing supporting a strategy by showing that a physically attractive source facilitates attitude change toward issues, products, and ad-based evaluations."

Research suggests that there is a link between the product itself and the image of the celebrity. The celebrity, in this case, indeed acts as a symbol of the product. The physical attractiveness of the celebrity endorser improves the appearance of the product, or rather, the advertisement. In simpler terms, it makes a bigger impact on the audience if "the characteristics of the product 'match-up' with the image conveyed by the celebrity," as suggested by Kamins' research. He continues, "This 'match-up' hypothesis suggests that the visual imagery contained in the ad conveys information over and above that contained in explicit verbal arguments." A journal notes that the match up hypothesis "specifies that perceivers distinguish multiple types of good looks, and that in advertising, certain beauty ideals are more appropriately paired with specific products than with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solomon|first=Michael, R. |author2=Richard D. Ashmore |author3=Laura C. Longo|title=The Beauty Match-up Hypothesis: Congruence between Types of Beauty and Product Images in Advertising|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=December 1992|volume=XXI|issue=4|pages=23–24|jstor=10.2307/4188855|doi=10.1080/00913367.1992.10673383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another journal further explains, "In the match-up hypothesis, the message conveyed by the image of the celebrity and the message about the product ought to converge in effective advertisements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahle|first=Lynn R.|author2=Pamela M. Homer |title=Physical Attractiveness of the Celebrity Endorser: A Social Adaptation Perspective|journal=Journal of Consumer Research |date=March 1985|volume=11|issue=4|pages=954–961|jstor=2489220|doi=10.1086/209029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, research also notes that physical attractiveness is the key detail when analyzing [[consumer behavior]]. If a celebrity is less than attractive according to society's standards, the advertising campaign may potentially be less effective. Still, advertisements starring celebrities are generally effective due to their popularity and presence in media.

There are times when physical attractiveness of the celebrity is not relevant, and that is when the product showcased in the advertisement does not claim to enhance the consumer's appearance. Under this circumstance, the "match-up" hypothesis does not apply because the product is not particularly attractive. Attractive products include luxurious sports cars, designer clothing, anti-aging products, beauty products (i.e. foundation that smooths fine lines, blemishes, pigmentation, and promises a flawless canvas onto which the rest of a woman's makeup may be applied), hair care (i.e. shampoos, conditioners, and shine-enhancing serums that boast rare ingredients and professional results), modern-day technology products such as everything Apple produces (iPhone, Mac computers) and the brands that strive to mimic these products' sleek appearances, etc. "Unattractive" products include toilet paper, household cleaning items, groceries and food, personal hygiene products, music, movies, etc. Though, it can be debated that music and movies do not depend on the attractiveness of its performers; attractiveness vs. talent in the respected fields depends on many factors regarding the consumers, such as age and gender.

B. Zafer Erdogan says, "Because of their fame, celebrities serve not only to create and maintain attention, but also to achieve high recall rates for marcoms messages (marketing communication) in today's highly cluttered environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erdogan|first=B. Zafer|title=Celebrity Endorsement: A Literature Review|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|year=1999|volume=15|issue=4|pages=291–314|doi=10.1362/026725799784870379|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1362/026725799784870379#preview|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This serves as proof that advertising agencies use celebrities to cut through the clutter that is [[mass media]]. Having celebrities in their advertising campaigns helps them promote their products in the sense that notable figures are what gets the attention of the public, rather than the product itself.

==The beauty ideal and plastic surgery==
Among the many [[beauty product|beauty]] and health products advertised and media showcasing celebrity beauty as the most desired beauty, is the frustration that comes with consumers using these products and not achieving the results they want. In a psychological study which aimed to examine the correlation of the acceptance of cosmetic surgery and prevalence of celebrity influence, researchers found that there was an extremely significant association between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swami|first=Viren, et all|title=Acceptance of cosmetic surgery and celebrity worship: Evidence of associations among female undergraduates|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=47|issue=8|year=2009|pages=869–872|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886909003134|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Celebrity worship]]" is when a person has formed a strong adoration towards a celebrity and sees him or her as a role model. The study shows that this worship is considered a normal aspect of [[self-identity]] as it is usually formed as the identity is being developed. Worship of the celebrity may give people a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment. The study mentions that "'entertainment-social' celebrity worship reflects the social aspects of parasocial attachment, and is driven by an attraction to a favourite celebrity because of their perceived ability to entertain. For some individuals, a compromised identity structure may lead to psychological absorption (intensive and compulsive feelings) with a celebrity, or what has been termed 'Intense-personal' attitudes. In extreme cases, this absorption may become addictive, leading to 'Borderline-pathological' attitudes and behaviours that serve to maintain an individual's satisfaction with the parasocial attachment."

Additionally, this concept of celebrity worship may be used as symbols exemplary of the person's physical ideal. That is, they believe that their physical attractiveness will bring them thinks equal to or similar to the celebrity's level of popularity and exterior happiness. To them, physical attractiveness will bring that happiness, and cosmetic surgery can help them attain this. The study explains that "celebrities may represent prominent and unique social comparison targets, whose physical attractiveness and condition provide information about socially-idealised standards of beauty."

Notably, celebrity worship makes people more prone to [[mental health]] problems such as high levels of [[neuroticism]], [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and an overall strong sense of worry. Being fixated on how a celebrity looks can increase anxiety because it causes the person to constantly compare themselves to them, thus creating unnecessary worry and high maintenance of their appearance, and eventually depression due to the fact that they cannot look like or be their [[role model]]. These people are likely to seek procedures such as plastic surgery in order to become exaggerated versions of themselves in hopes of becoming as physically appealing as their celebrity role model, and hopefully happier as a result. They consider [[plastic surgery]] a cure, or a fix, for their unhappiness. Therefore, they see it as acceptable.

==The effect of blogs and Internet==
Style blogs showcase slender young women posing in the latest fashions. Young girls see these and want to emulate their style. The Thin Ideal comes into play. [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s popular lifestyle blog/website Goop is geared towards parents, specifically women. She provides spirituality articles, family meal recipes, glimpses into her Hollywood life, and child-raising tips. Women and mothers read her blog and are consumed by the glamorous appeal. Paltrow advises wardrobe changes every season and provides essential-clothing suggestions that are far out of reach for the average women. [[Nylon Magazine]] is a colorful [[fashion magazine]] for [[pre-teens]] and teenagers who aim to live fashionably. The magazine dispenses beauty advice for how you can look like your favorite television star and promotes expression of style. Its influence is prevalent in the [[blogosphere]]. Young women with blogs take photos of themselves in their daily outfits. They often cite Nylon, among other sources, as one of their influences. Kellner states, "Media images help shape our view of the world and our deepest values: what we consider good or bad, positive or negative, moral or evil. Media stories provide the symbols, myths, and resources through which we constitute a common culture and through the appropriation of which we insert ourselves into this culture."&lt;ref name=Kellner/&gt; Fashion and beauty blogs focus on the values of looking a certain way, or what society deems as "stylish." These websites bring together people with the same goals – i.e. looking good – and cultivate a culture in which the beauty myth is prevalent.

In addition to blogs, social networking cites such as Facebook play a role in media influence. Many celebrities and clothing stores have Facebook profiles in which fans subscribe to receive a constant stream of news from these pages on their Facebook news feeds. Celebrities promote their latest films, television appearance, favorite charities, self-endorsed items, and those who are subscribed to them remain in-the-know and are kept up to date of their glamorous, high-profile words. Clothing stores update their pages with photos of their seasonal collections, showcasing attractive young models dressed in their fashions, thus creating images of desire in their impressionable audiences.

Below is a '''list of siteswaps''' or [[juggling pattern]]s by [[siteswap]].

Toss juggling requires more balls than hands.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{cite web|url=http://www.jugglingdb.com/faq/index.php?question=1 |title="1. What is juggling?", ''IJDb'' |accessdate=2016-11-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201042130/http://www.jugglingdb.com/faq/index.php?question=1 |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df= }}. Cited in Rosenberger, Phillip (2011). ''Juggling Basics, Why and How To''.&lt;!--unpaginated--&gt; {{ISBN|9780983339700}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus tricks such as the one ball cascade toss back and forth, 300,&lt;ref name="Examples"&gt;Darley, Vincent (1996). "[http://www.juggling.org/help/siteswap/examples.html Site Swaps: Examples]", ''Juggling.org''. Accessed: October 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, may not be considered valid patterns. Throws back and forth shower style, odd numbers, are the most common one prop practice. Invalid or practice patterns and tricks are marked with an X.

The numbers are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20728493 Juggling by numbers: How notation revealed new tricks]", ''BBC.com'' (BBC article with explanatory video)&lt;/ref&gt;
*0 = "missing"/rest [empty hand]
*1 = pass [between hands]
*2 = hold [one hand/no toss]
*3 = (3-ball) cascade toss [between hands]
*4 = (4-ball) fountain or columns toss [up and into same hand]
*5 = high toss [between hands]
*...
*a = 10 = high columns/fountain toss
*...

Symbols:
{{Div col}}
*Number: Relative height of a toss. 1, 2, 3...
*Brackets []: Multiplex. [333]33.
*Chevrons and vertical bar &lt;|&gt;: Simultaneous and passing patterns.
**P: Pass. &lt;333P|333P&gt;
**Fraction: Pass 1/y beats later. &lt;4.5 3 3 | 3 4 3.5&gt;
*Parentheses (): Synchronous pattern.
** *: Synchronous pattern that switches sides. (4,2x)(2x,4) = (4,2x)*
**x: Toss to the other hand during a synchronous pattern.
{{Div col end}}

==Asynchronous==

A pattern is symmetrical (S) if both hands play the same role and asymmetrical (A) if not. All asynchronous patterns whose periods are odd are symmetrical, and all asynchronous patterns whose periods are even are asymmetrical.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Man vs. Beast''''' is a series of [[sensationalistic]] [[television specials]] aired in the United States by the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[television network]]. The shows were produced by [[Brian Richardson (producer)|Brian Richardson]] and directed by [[Bob Levy (director)|Bob Levy]]. They involve a variety of challenges in which people and animals compete against each other. Although the initial special, ''Man vs. Beast'', was heavily panned by critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Robert Weintraub | date = January 16, 2003 | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2077075/ | title = Aaron Sorkin Mauled by Fox: The disturbing appeal of Man vs. Beast. | publisher = [[Slate.com]] | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[animal rights]] groups,&lt;ref name="born free"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bornfree.org.uk/zoocheck/manvsbeast.shtml | title = Unnatural Animal Acts A Turnoff. | publisher = [[Born Free Foundation]] | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox commissioned a sequel, ''Man vs. Beast 2'', which aired on February 20, 2004.

In 2003, [[ITV Network|ITV]] commissioned [[Granada Productions]] to re-create the American special for British audiences. A six-part series was filmed, hosted by [[John Fashanu]]. However, owing to heavy lobbying by animal rights groups,&lt;ref name="caps"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.captiveanimals.org/news/2003/granada2.htm | title = Man vs Beast – programme may be scrapped | publisher = Captive Animals' Protection Society | accessdate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; transmission of the series was postponed indefinitely.

==Competitions==
The competitions included the following matchups:
*Professional eater [[Takeru Kobayashi]] lost a hot dog eating contest against a [[Kodiak bear]] that did not know it was in an eating competition.
*[[Scott Helvenston]], a [[US Navy SEAL]], won a race against a [[chimpanzee]] through an obstacle course.
*A group of 44 [[dwarfism|dwarfs]] lost a race against an [[Asian elephant]] to see which could pull a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] jet a certain distance first.
*[[Shawn Crawford]], a world-class sprinter, won a [[100 meters|100-metre race]] against a [[giraffe]] but lost against a [[zebra]].
*A [[Sumo]] wrestler lost a [[tug-of-war]] against a large, female [[orangutan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37567">'''Martial arts''' are codified systems and traditions of [[combat]] practiced for a number of reasons such as [[self-defense]], [[war|military]] and [[law enforcement]] applications, physical, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's [[intangible cultural heritage]].

Although the term ''[[:wikt:martial art|martial art]]'' has become associated with the fighting arts of [[East Asia]], it originally referred to the combat systems of [[Europe]] as early as the 1550s. The term is derived from [[Latin (language)|Latin]] and means "arts of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]", the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clements |first=John |title=A Short Introduction to Historical European Martial Arts |journal=Meibukan Magazine |date=January 2006 |issue=Special Edition No. 1 |pages=2–4 |url=http://meibukanmagazine.org/Downloads/MMSpecialEdition1.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318130111/http://www.meibukanmagazine.org/Downloads/MMSpecialEdition1.pdf |archivedate=March 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have argued that '''fighting arts''' or '''fighting systems''' would be more appropriate on the basis that many martial arts were never "martial" in the sense of being used or created by professional warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Donn F. Draeger]] and P'ng Chye Khim | title=Shaolin Lohan Kung-fu |year=1979 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Young boxers fresco, Akrotiri, Greece.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The martial art of [[boxing]] was practiced in the ancient [[Santorini|Thera]].]]

==Variation and scope==
Martial arts may be categorized along a variety of criteria, including:
*Traditional or historical arts vs. contemporary styles of [[folk wrestling]] and modern [[hybrid martial arts]].
*Techniques taught: Armed vs. [[unarmed combat|unarmed]], and within these groups by type of weapon ([[swordsmanship]], [[stick fighting]] etc.) and by type of combat ([[grappling]] vs. [[Strike (attack)|striking]]; [[stand-up fighting]] vs. [[ground fighting]])
*By application or intent: [[self-defense]], [[combat sport]], [[choreographed fight|choreography]] or demonstration of forms, [[physical fitness]], [[meditation]], etc.
*Within [[Chinese tradition]]: [[External martial arts|"external"]] vs. [[Neijia|"internal"]] styles

===By technical focus===
;Unarmed
Unarmed martial arts can be broadly grouped into focusing on [[Strike (attack)|strikes]], those focusing on [[grappling]] and those that cover both fields, often described as [[hybrid martial arts]].

'''[[Strike (attack)|Strikes]]'''
* '''[[Punch (combat)|Punching]]''': [[Boxing]], [[Wing Chun]], [[Karate]]
* '''[[Kick]]ing''': [[Taekwondo]], [[Capoeira]], [[Savate]]
* Others using strikes: [[Muay Thai]], [[Kung Fu]], [[Pencak Silat]]

'''[[Grappling]]'''
* '''[[Throw (grappling)|Throwing]]''': [[Hapkido]], [[Judo]], [[Sumo]], [[Wrestling]], [[Aikido]]
* '''[[Joint lock]]'''/'''[[Chokeholds]]'''/'''[[Submission holds]]''':[[Judo]], [[Jujutsu]], [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]]
* '''[[Pinning hold|Pinning Techniques]]''': [[Judo]], [[Wrestling]], [[Aikido]]

;Armed

The traditional martial arts, which train [[armed combat]], often encompass a wide spectrum of [[melee weapons]], including [[bladed weapon]]s and [[polearms]]. Such traditions include [[eskrima]], [[silat]], [[kalaripayat]], [[Okinawan kobudo|kobudo]], and [[historical European martial arts]], especially those of the [[German Renaissance]]. Many [[Chinese martial arts]] also feature weapons as part of their curriculum.

Sometimes, training with one specific weapon will be considered a style of martial arts in its own right, which is especially the case in [[Japanese martial arts]] with disciplines such as [[kenjutsu]] and [[kendo]] (sword), [[bojutsu]] (staff), and [[kyudo]] (archery). Similarly, modern martial arts and sports include [[modern fencing]], stick-fighting systems like [[canne de combat]] and [[jogo do pau]], and [[modern competitive archery]].

===By application or intent===
;Combat-oriented
{{main|Combat sport|Self-defense}}
;Health-oriented
Many martial arts, especially those from [[Asia]], also teach side disciplines which pertain to medicinal practices. This is particularly prevalent in traditional [[Asian martial arts]] which may teach [[bone-setting]], herbalism, and other aspects of traditional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiflow.com/html/gas_kungfu.htm |title=Internal Kung Fu |publisher=Chiflow.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{anchor|Spirituality}}Spirituality-oriented
Martial arts can also be linked with religion and spirituality. Numerous systems are reputed to have been founded, disseminated, or practiced by monks or nuns.

Throughout Asia, meditation may be incorporated as part of training. In those countries influenced by Hindu-Buddhist philosophy, the art itself may be used as an aid to attaining enlightenment.

[[Japan]]ese styles, when concerning non-physical qualities of the combat, are often strongly influenced by [[Mahayana]] Buddhist philosophy. Concepts like "empty mind" and "beginner's mind" are recurrent. [[Aikido]], for instance, can have a strong philosophical belief of the flow of energy and peace fostering, as idealised by its founder [[Morihei Ueshiba]].

Traditional [[Korea]]n martial arts place emphasis on the development of the practitioner's spiritual and philosophical development. A common theme in most Korean styles, such as [[taekkyeon]] and [[taekwondo]], is the value of "inner peace" in a practitioner, which is stressed to be only achieved through individual meditation and training. The Koreans believe that the use of physical force is only justified through defense.

[[Systema]] draws upon breathing and relaxation techniques, as well as elements of [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] thought, to foster self-conscience and calmness, and to benefit the practitioner in different levels: the physical, the psychological and the spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianmartialart.com/main.php?page=philosophy |title=Philosophy aspects of Systema |publisher=Russian Martial Art - Systema Headquarters |date= |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some martial arts in various cultures can be performed in [[dance]]-like settings for various reasons, such as for evoking ferocity in preparation for battle or showing off skill in a more stylized manner. Many such martial arts incorporate music, especially strong percussive rhythms. (See also [[war dance]].)

[[Chinese martial arts]] originated during the legendary, possibly apocryphal, [[Xia Dynasty]] more than 4000 years ago. It is said the [[Yellow Emperor]] Huangdi (legendary date of ascension 2698&amp;nbsp;BC) introduced the earliest fighting systems to [[China]]. The Yellow Emperor is described as a famous [[general]] who before becoming [[China]]'s leader, wrote lengthy treatises on medicine, [[astrology]] and martial arts. One of his main opponents was [[Chi You]] who was credited as the creator of jiao di, a forerunner to the modern art of [[Chinese wrestling]].

The foundation of modern [[Asian martial arts]] is likely a blend of early [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese]] and [[Indian martial arts]]. During the [[Warring States period]] of [[History of China|Chinese history]] (480-221&amp;nbsp;BC) extensive development in martial philosophy and strategy emerged, as described by [[Sun Tzu]] in ''[[The Art of War]]'' (c. 350&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonshi.com/why.html |title=Sun Tzu Biography and Introduction: Sun Tzu The Art of War and Strategy Site by |publisher=Sonshi.

[[Pankration|Pankratiasts]] fighting under the eyes of a judge. Side B of a [[Panathenaic Games|Panathenaic]] prize [[Panathenaic amphora|amphora]], c. 500&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
In Europe, the earliest sources of martial arts traditions date to [[Ancient Greece]]. [[Ancient Greek Boxing|Boxing]] (''pygme'', ''pyx''), [[Greek wrestling|wrestling]] (''pale'') and [[pankration]]  were represented in the [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] produced [[Gladiator|gladiatorial combat]] as a public spectacle.

A number of historical [[combat manual]]s have survived from the European [[Middle Ages]]. This includes such styles as [[Historical fencing|sword and shield]], [[two-handed swordfighting]]  and other types of [[melee weapons]] besides unarmed combat. Amongst these are transcriptions of [[Johannes Liechtenauer]]'s mnemonic poem on the longsword dating back to the late fourteenth century. Likewise, Asian martial arts became well-documented during the medieval period, [[Japanese martial arts]] beginning with the establishment of the [[samurai]] nobility in the 12th century, [[Chinese martial arts]] with [[Ming dynasty|Ming era]] treatises such as [[Ji Xiao Xin Shu]], [[Indian martial arts]] in medieval texts such as the [[Agni Purana]] and the [[Malla Purana]], and [[Korean martial arts]] from the [[Joseon]] era and texts such as [[Muyejebo]] (1598).

European swordsmanship always had a sportive component, but the [[duel]] was always a possibility until [[World War I]]. Modern [[fencing|sport fencing]] began developing during the 19th century as the French and Italian military academies began codifying instruction. The Olympic games led to standard international rules, with the Féderation Internationale d'Escrime founded in 1913.  Modern boxing originates with [[Jack Broughton]]'s rules in the 18th century, and reaches its present form with the [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules]] of 1867.

===Folk styles===
{{main|Folk wrestling}}
Certain traditional combat sports and fighting styles exist all over the world, rooted in local culture and folklore. The most common of these are styles of [[folk wrestling]], some of which have been practiced since antiquity and are found in the most remote areas. Other examples include forms of [[stick fighting]] and boxing. While these arts are based on historical traditions of folklore, they are not "historical" in the sense that they reconstruct or preserve a historical system from a specific era. They are rather contemporary regional sports that coexist with the modern forms of martial arts sports as they have developed since the 19th century, often including cross-fertilization between sports and folk styles; thus, the traditional Thai art of [[muay boran]] developed into the modern national sport of [[muay Thai]], which in turn came to be practiced worldwide and contributed significantly to modern hybrid styles like [[kickboxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]]. [[Singlestick]], an English martial art can be seen often utilized in [[morris dancing]]. Many European dances share elements of martial arts with examples including Ukrainian [[Hopak]], Polish Zbójnicki (use of [[ciupaga]]), the Czech dance [[odzemek]], and the Norwegian [[Halling (dance)|Halling]].

===Modern history===
{{further|Modern history of East Asian martial arts}}
;Late 19th to early 20th century
The mid to late 19th century marks the beginning of the history of martial arts as modern sports developed out of earlier traditional fighting systems. In Europe, this concerns the developments of [[boxing]] and [[fencing]] as sports. In Japan, the same period marks the formation of the modern forms of [[judo]], [[jujutsu]], [[karate]], and [[kendo]] (among others) based on revivals of [[koryu|old schools]] of [[Edo period]] martial arts which had been suppressed during the [[Meiji Restoration]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Modern [[muay Thai]] rules date to the 1920s. In China, the modern history of martial arts begins in the [[Nanjing decade]] (1930s) following the foundation of the [[Central Guoshu Institute]] in 1928 under the [[Kuomintang]] government.

Western interest in [[Asian martial arts]] arises towards the end of the 19th century, due to the increase in trade between the United States with China and Japan.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Relatively few Westerners actually practiced the arts, considering it to be mere performance. [[Edward William Barton-Wright]], a railway engineer who had studied [[jujutsu]] while working in Japan between 1894 and 1897, was the first man known to have taught Asian martial arts in Europe. He also founded an eclectic style named [[Bartitsu]] which combined [[jujutsu]], [[judo]], wrestling, boxing, savate and [[stick fighting]].

[[Fencing]] and [[Greco-Roman wrestling]] was included in the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].
[[FILA Wrestling World Championships]] and [[Boxing at the Summer Olympics]] were introduced in 1904.
The tradition of awarding [[championship belt]]s in wrestling and boxing can be traced to the [[Lonsdale Belt]], introduced in 1909.

The [[International Boxing Association (amateur)|International Boxing Association]] was established in 1920. [[World Fencing Championships]] have been held since 1921.

As Western influence grew in Asia a greater number of military personnel spent time in China, Japan and South Korea during World War II and the [[Korean War]] and were exposed to local fighting styles. Jujutsu, judo and karate first became popular among the mainstream from the 1950s-60s. Due in part to Asian and Hollywood [[martial arts movies]], most modern American martial arts are either Asian-derived or Asian influenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Martial Arts as Moneymakers|publisher= The New York Times|date=1988-08-28|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/28/business/the-martial-arts-as-moneymakers.html?scp=84&amp;sq=chuck%20norris&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-12-04|first=David|last=Berreby}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term [[kickboxing]] (キックボクシング) was created by the Japanese boxing promoter Osamu Noguchi for a variant of muay Thai and karate that he created in the 1950s. [[American kickboxing]] was developed in the 1970s, as a combination of boxing and karate. [[Taekwondo]] was developed in the context of the [[Korean War]] in the 1950s.

The later 1960s and 1970s witnessed an increased media interest in [[Chinese martial arts]], influenced by martial artist [[Bruce Lee]]. Bruce Lee is credited as one of the first instructors to openly teach [[Chinese martial arts]] to Westerners.&lt;ref name="absolutedefense.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://absolutedefense.net/html/jeet_kune_do.html|title=Jeet Kune Do|publisher=absolutedefense.net|accessdate=2014-05-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717143650/http://absolutedefense.net/html/jeet_kune_do.html|archivedate=2014-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Judo Championships]] have been held since 1956, [[Judo at the Summer Olympics]] was introduced in 1964. [[Karate World Championships]] were introduced in 1970.

Following the "kung fu wave" in [[Hong Kong action cinema]] in the 1970s, a number of mainstream films produced during the 1980s contributed significantly to the perception of martial arts in western [[popular culture]]. These include ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'' (1984) and ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]'' (1988). This era produced some [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] action stars with martial arts background, such as [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] and [[Chuck Norris]].

Also during the 20th century, a number of martial arts were adapted for [[self-defense]] purposes for military [[hand-to-hand combat]]. [[World War II combatives]], [[KAPAP]] (1930s) and [[Krav Maga]] (1950s) in Israel, [[Systema]] in Soviet-era Russia, and [[Sanshou]] in the People's Republic of China are examples of such systems. The [[US military]] de-emphasized hand-to-hand combat training during the [[Cold War period]], but revived it with the introduction of [[LINE (combat system)|LINE]] in 1989.

;1990 to present
During the 1990s [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] became popular and proved to be effective in mixed martial arts competitions such as the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] and [[Pride Fighting Championships|PRIDE]].&lt;ref name=UNCstyles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=LearnUFC.Styles |title=fighting art used in the UFC |publisher=Ufc.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523232346/http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=LearnUFC.Styles |archivedate=2010-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the first [[Pancrase]] event was held.&lt;ref name="bloodyelbow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2014/3/29/5560430/origins-history-rules-early-days-old-pancrase-mma-bas-rutten-shamrock-japanese|title=The origins, history and rules from the early days of Pancrase circa 1993 - Bloody Elbow|publisher=bloodyelbow.com|accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[K-1]] rules of kickboxing were introduced based on 1980s [[Seidokaikan]] karate.

[[Jackie Chan]] and [[Jet Li]] are prominent movie figures who have been responsible for promoting Chinese martial arts in recent years.

With the continual discovery of more [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] fighting manuals, the practice of [[Historical European Martial Arts]] and other [[Western Martial Arts]] are growing in popularity across the United States and Europe.

November 29, 2011, [[UNESCO]] inscribed [[taekkyeon]] onto its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00452|title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention|work=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Varma kalai]], a martial arts concentrating on vital points, was almost dead but is gradually being revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Testing and competition==
Testing or evaluation is important to martial artists of many disciplines who wish to determine their progression or own level of skill in specific contexts. Students often undergo periodic testing and grading by their own teacher in order to advance to a higher level of recognized achievement, such as a different [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] color or title. The type of testing used varies from system to system but may include forms or [[sparring]].
[[File:Steven Ho Martial Arts Kick.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Ho (martial artist)|Steven Ho]] executing a Jump Spin [[Hook Kick]]]]
Various forms and sparring are commonly used in martial art exhibitions and tournaments. Some competitions pit practitioners of different disciplines against each other using a common set of rules, these are referred to as mixed martial arts competitions. Rules for sparring vary between art and organization but can generally be divided into ''light-contact'', ''medium-contact'', and ''full-contact'' variants, reflecting the amount of force that should be used on an opponent.

===Light- and medium-contact===
These types of sparring restrict the amount of force that may be used to hit an opponent, in the case of light sparring this is usually to 'touch' contact, e.g. a punch should be 'pulled' as soon as or before contact is made. In medium-contact (sometimes referred to as semi-contact) the punch would not be 'pulled' but not hit with full force. As the amount of force used is restricted, the aim of these types of sparring is not to [[knock out]] an opponent; a point system is used in competitions.

A referee acts to monitor for fouls and to control the match, while judges mark down scores, as in boxing. Particular targets may be prohibited, certain techniques may be forbidden (such as headbutting or groin hits), and fighters may be required to wear [[Personal protective equipment|protective equipment]]&lt;!-- We need a better article than this to link to --&gt; on their head, hands, chest, groin, shins or feet. Some grappling arts, such as aikido, use a similar method of compliant training that is equivalent to light or medium contact.

In some styles (such as fencing and some styles of taekwondo sparring), competitors score points based on the landing of a single technique or strike as judged by the referee, whereupon the referee will briefly stop the match, award a point, then restart the match. Alternatively, sparring may continue with the point noted by the judges. Some critics of point sparring feel that this method of training teaches habits that result in lower combat effectiveness. Lighter-contact sparring may be used exclusively, for children or in other situations when heavy contact would be inappropriate (such as beginners), medium-contact sparring is often used as training for full contact.

===Full-contact===
{{further|Full-contact}}
Full-contact sparring or competition, where strikes or techniques are not pulled but used with full force as the name implies, has a number of tactical differences from light and medium-contact sparring. It is considered by some to be requisite in learning realistic unarmed combat.&lt;ref name=SB&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.straightblastgym.com/aliveness101.html|title= Aliveness 101|accessdate= 2008-11-03|publisher= Straight Blast gym|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090107052738/http://www.straightblastgym.com./aliveness101.html|archivedate= 2009-01-07|df= }} – An essay on contact levels in training&lt;/ref&gt;

In full-contact sparring, the aim of a competitive match is to [[knock out]] the opponent or to force the opponent to [[submission wrestling|submit]].
Where scoring takes place it may be a subsidiary measure, only used if no clear winner has been established by other means; in some competitions, such as the [[UFC 1]], there was no scoring, though most now use some form of judging as a backup.&lt;ref name=UFC1&gt;{{cite web |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AuvUi2TrSN_ILBVsuNLmsjk9Eo14?slug=dm-earlyufc111207&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns|title= First UFC forever altered combat sports |accessdate=2008-11-03 |publisher= Yahoo! Sports |date =November 12, 2007|author = Dave Meltzer, }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these factors, full-contact matches tend to be more aggressive in character, but rule sets may still mandate the use of protective equipment, or limit the techniques allowed.

Nearly all mixed martial arts organizations such as [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]], [[Pancrase]], [[Shooto]] use a form of full-contact rules as do [[Professional Boxing|professional boxing]] organizations and [[K-1]]. [[Kyokushin]] [[karate]] requires advanced practitioners to engage in bare-knuckled, full-contact sparring allowing kicks, knees and punching although punching to the head is disallowed while wearing only a karate ''gi'' and groin protector. Brazilian jiu-jitsu and judo matches do not allow striking, but are full-contact in the sense that full force is applied in the permitted grappling and submission techniques. Competitions held by the [[World Taekwondo Federation#Sparring|World Taekwondo Federation]] requires the use of [[Headgear (martial arts)|Headgear]] and padded vest, but are full contact in the sense that full force is applied to strikes to the head and body, and win by [[knockout]] is possible.

===Martial sport===
{{see also|Combat sport}}
[[File:050907-M-7747B-002-Judo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Several martial arts, such as [[judo]], are [[Olympic sports]].]]
Martial arts have crossed over into sports when forms of [[sparring]] become competitive, becoming a sport in its own right that is dissociated from the original combative origin, such as with western fencing. The Summer Olympic Games includes judo, taekwondo, western archery, boxing, javelin, wrestling and fencing as events, while [[Wushu (sport)|Chinese wushu]] recently failed in its bid to be included, but is still actively performed in tournaments across the world. Practitioners in some arts such as [[kickboxing]] and Brazilian jiu-jitsu often train for sport matches, whereas those in other arts such as [[aikido]]  generally spurn such competitions. Some schools believe that competition breeds better and more efficient practitioners, and gives a sense of good sportsmanship. Others believe that the rules under which competition takes place have diminished the combat effectiveness of martial arts or encourage a kind of practice which focuses on winning trophies rather than a focus such as cultivating a particular moral character.

The question of "which is the best martial art" has led to inter style competitions fought with very few rules allowing a variety of fighting styles to enter with few limitations. This was the origin of the first [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] tournament (later renamed [[UFC 1|UFC 1: The Beginning]]) in the U.S. inspired by the [[Brazil]]ian [[Vale tudo]] tradition and along with other minimal rule competitions, most notably those from Japan such as [[Shooto]] and [[Pancrase]], have evolved into the [[combat sport]] of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).

Some martial artists compete in non-sparring competitions such as [[Breaking (martial arts)|breaking]] or choreographed routines of techniques such as [[poomse]], [[kata]] and [[aka (burmese)|aka]], or modern variations of the martial arts which include dance-influenced competitions such as tricking. Martial traditions have been influenced by governments to become more sport-like for political purposes; the central impetus for the attempt by the People's Republic of China in transforming Chinese martial arts into the committee-regulated sport of [[Wushu (sport)|wushu]] was suppressing what they saw as the potentially [[subversion (politics)|subversive]] aspects of martial training, especially under the traditional system of family lineages.&lt;ref name="Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fu |first=Zhongwen | title=Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan |origyear=1996|year=2006 |publisher=Blue Snake Books |location=Berkeley, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and fitness benefits==
Martial arts training aims to result in several benefits to trainees, such as their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-5391.2010.01107.x/abstract|title=Effects of martial arts on health status: A systematic review | doi=10.1111/j.1756-5391.2010.01107.x | volume=3|issue=4|journal=Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine|pages=205–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through systematic practice in the martial arts a person's [[physical fitness]] may be boosted (strength, stamina, speed, flexibility, movement coordination, etc.) as the whole body is exercised and the entire muscular system is activated. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
Beyond contributing to physical fitness, martial arts training also has benefits for [[mental health]], contributing to [[self-esteem]], [[self-control]], [[emotional]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] well-being. For this reason, a number of martial arts schools have focused purely on therapeutic aspects, de-emphasizing the historical aspect of self-defense or combat completely.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

According to [[Bruce Lee]], martial arts also have the nature of an [[art]], since there is emotional communication and complete emotional expression.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Self-defense, military and law enforcement applications==
{{Main|Hand-to-hand combat|Self-defense}}
[[File:ArmyMilCombativesChokehold.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[U.S. Army]] Combatives instructor [[Matt Larsen]] demonstrates a [[chokehold]].]]
Some traditional martial concepts have seen new use within modern military training. Perhaps the most recent example of this is [[point shooting]] which relies on [[muscle memory]] to more effectively utilize a [[firearm]] in a variety of awkward situations, much the way an [[iaido]]ka would master movements with their sword.

During the World War II era [[William E. Fairbairn]] and [[Eric A. Sykes]] were recruited by the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) to teach their martial art of [[defendu]] (itself drawing on Western boxing and jujutsu) and pistol shooting to UK, US, and Canadian special forces. The book ''Kill or Get Killed'', written by Colonel [[Rex Applegate]], was based on the defendu taught by Sykes and Fairbairn. Both Fairbairn's ''Get Tough'' and Appelgate's ''Kill or Get Killed'' became classic works on hand-to-hand combat.

Traditional hand-to-hand, knife, and spear techniques continue to see use in the composite systems developed for today's wars. Examples of this include European [[Unifight]], the [[US Army]]'s [[Combatives]] system developed by [[Matt Larsen]], the [[Israeli army]]'s [[KAPAP]]  and [[Krav Maga]], and the [[US Marine Corps]]'s ''[[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]]'' (MCMAP). Unarmed dagger defenses identical to those found in the manual of [[Fiore dei Liberi]] and the [[Codex Wallerstein]] were integrated into the U.S. Army's [[training manual]]s in 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

and continue to influence today's systems along with other traditional systems such as [[eskrima]] and [[silat]].

The rifle-mounted [[bayonet]] which has its origin in the [[spear]], has seen use by the [[United States Army]], the [[United States Marine Corps]], and the [[British Army]] as recently as the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1464411/British-battalion-attacked-every-day-for-six-weeks.html |title= British battalion 'attacked every day for six weeks'|accessdate= 2008-12-11 |author= Sean Rayment|date= 2004-06-13|work= [[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher= [[Telegraph Media Group Limited]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many martial arts are also seen and used in Law Enforcement hand to hand training. For example, the [[Tokyo]] Riot Police's use of [[aikido]].&lt;ref name="Twigger1997"&gt;Twigger, R. (1997): ''Angry White Pyjamas''. London: Phoenix. ({{ISBN|978-0-7538-0858-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Martial arts industry==
Martial arts since the 1970s has become a significant industry, a subset of the wider [[sport industry]] (including [[martial arts films|cinema]] and [[sports television]]).

Hundreds of millions of people worldwide practice some form of martial art.

The wholesale value of martial arts related sporting equipment shipped in the [[United States]] was estimated at 314&amp;nbsp;million USD in 2007; participation in the same year was estimated at 6.9&amp;nbsp;million (ages 6 or older, 2% of US population).&lt;ref&gt;Jack W.

===Equipment===
Martial arts equipment can include that used for conditioning, protection and [[List of martial arts weapons|weapons]]. [[Hojo undō|Specialized conditioning equipment]] can include [[breaking board]]s, dummy partners such as the [[Muk Yan Jong|wooden dummy]], and targets such as [[punching bag]]s and the [[makiwara]]. [[Personal protective equipment|Protective equipment]] for sparring and competition includes [[boxing gloves]] and [[Headgear (martial arts)|headgear]].

===Martial arts fraud===
{{anchor|martial arts fraud}}
[[Asian martial arts]] experienced a surge of popularity in the west during the 1970s, and the rising demand resulted in numerous low quality or fraudulent schools. Fueled by fictional depictions in martial arts movies, this led to the [[ninja craze]] of the 1980s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [[Black Belt Magazine]], June 1999, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also numerous fraudulent ads for martial arts training programs, inserted into comic books circa the 1960s and 1970s, which were read primarily by adolescent boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Heintjes |url=http://cartoonician.com/the-deadliest-ads-alive/ |title=The Deadliest Ads Alive! &amp;#124; Hogan's Alley |publisher=Cartoonician.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the martial arts came to the United States in the seventies, lower ranks ([[kyu]]) began to be given colorful belts to show progress.  This proved to be commercially viable and colored-belt systems were adopted in many martial arts [[degree mill]]s (also known as ''McDojos'' and ''Belt Factories'') as a means to generate additional cash. This was covered in ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'' [[List of Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! episodes#Season 8: 2010|episode "Martial Arts"]] (June 2010).

'''Martin Flood''' (born {{start date|df=yes|1964|07|04}}) is an [[Australia]]n [[quiz show]] contestant who competed and won on the show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (Australian game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', and participated in the short-lived program ''[[The Master (Australian quiz show)|The Master]]''. Flood was an I.T. analyst for [[Westpac]] [[bank]] at the time of winning ''Millionaire''.  He lives in [[New South Wales]] and retired from working altogether six months after the big win.

Harbouring an ambition to become a quiz champion, he studied general knowledge intensively for five years before appearing on the show, collecting information from trivia nights and also analysing past episodes of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Martin Flood made his fortune|url=http://money.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=100347|work=[[Money (magazine)|Money]]|date=April 2006|accessdate=2007-06-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909174302/http://www.money.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=100347|archivedate=9 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' ==
Flood was the second person to win the $1,000,000 major prize on the Australian version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', after [[Rob "Coach" Fulton]]. He won the prize on the 14 November 2005 episode after being asked: "Who was never [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] Man of the Year?" A - [[Adolf Hitler]], B - [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], C - [[Joseph Stalin]] or D - [[Mao Zedong]]. The answer was Mao Zedong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Second Aussie 'Millionaire' winner emerges|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/11/14/1131951103121.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 November 2005|accessdate=2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He answered the question only after using his final lifeline, the 50/50. 

His appearance on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' spawned some controversies, as it was marred by suggestions that he may have cheated.&lt;ref name ="Coughing Millionaire sparks probe"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nine Network's ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' focused on a moment when an audience member coughed as Flood mentioned an answer (creating links to convicted English quiz show cheat [[Charles Ingram]]) and on suggestions that Flood was behaving erratically. Flood, who was unaware of the suggestion until after taping the second episode on which he appeared, was publicly cleared by the network of any improper conduct.&lt;ref name ="No cheat"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flood was the last winner of the original incarnation of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' in Australia. Six further contestants, who then appeared on the ''[[Millionaire Hot Seat|Hot Seat]]'' edition of the show, attempted to succeed him as Australia's Millionaire, and all six failed (the most recent of which was Kevin Short in 2013). That was until 2016 however, when Edwin Daly, a 67-year-old retiree from [[South Australia]], managed to correctly answer the fifteenth and final question for the first time in almost 11 years.

== ''The Master'' ==
Flood was a key member of Australian quiz show ''[[The Master (Australian quiz show)|The Master]]'',&lt;ref name ="Trivia master rises from the ashes"&gt;{{cite news

The show was brought back in December (after the 2006 ratings period had ended) with the six remaining produced episodes going to air at an earlier timeslot of Monday nights at 7:30pm (which ''[[The Weakest Link (Australian game show)|The Weakest Link]]'' had previously occupied from 2001 to early 2002).

== ''Australia's Brainiest Quizmaster'' ==
Flood also participated in this special show which was part of a series spin-off of ''[[Australia's Brainiest]]'' but did not make it past the second round. The show aired on 19 February 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10304">A '''media franchise''', also known as '''multimedia franchise''', is a collection of related [[Media (communication)|media]] in which several derivative works have been produced from an original creative work, such as a [[film]], a work of [[literature]], a [[television program]] or a [[video game]]. The intellectual property from the work can be licensed to other parties or partners for further derivative works and commercial exploitation across a range of media and by a variety of industries for [[merchandising]] purposes.

A media franchise often consists of [[marketing co-operation|cross-marketing]] across more than one medium. For the owners, the goal of increasing profit through diversity can extend the commercial profitability of the franchise and can create strong feelings of identity and ownership in its consumers ([[fandom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jaylemke.squarespace.com/storage/Games-Franchises-CulturalOrder-2005.pdf | title=Critical Analysis across Media: Games, Franchises, and the New Cultural Order | publisher=First International Conference on CDA | date=2004 | accessdate=16 September 2013 | author=Lemke, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aarseth describes the financial logic of cost-recovery for expensive productions by identifying that a single medium launch is a lost opportunity, the timeliness of the production and release is more important than its integrity, the releases should raise brand awareness and the cross-ability of the work is critical for its success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15405710pc0403_4#.UjcTWD-9H-s | title=The Culture and Business of Cross-Media Productions | author=Aarseth, Espen | journal=Popular Communication: the International Journal of Media and Culture | year=2006 | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=203 | doi=10.1207/s15405710pc0403_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Idol]] was a transmedia franchise from its beginnings, with the first season winner [[Kelly Clarkson]] signing with [[RCA Records]] and having the release of ''[[A Moment Like This]]'' becoming a #1 hit on Billboard Hot 100.&lt;ref name=ai&gt;{{cite book | title=Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide | publisher=NYU Press | author=Jenkins, Henry | year=2006 | page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success resulted in a nationwide concert tour, an ''American Idol'' book that made the bestseller list and the film ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]''.&lt;ref name=ai /&gt; A transmedia franchise however is often referred to by the simpler term "media franchise." The term media franchise is often used to describe the popular adaptation of a work into films, like the popular [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' book series]] that was adapted into the five films of ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Bitten by Twilight: Youth Culture, Media, and the Vampire Franchise | publisher=Peter Lang Publishing | author=Click, Melissa | year=2010 | page=12 | isbn=978-1433108945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other neologisms exist to describe various franchise types including '''metaseries'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which can be used to describe works such as [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;Palumbo, Donald. "Asimov's Crusade Against Bigotry: The Persistence Of Prejudice as a Fractal Motif in the Robot/Empire Foundation Metaseries." JOURNAL OF THE FANTASTIC IN THE ARTS 10 (1998): 43-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multimedia franchises usually develop through a character or fictional world becoming popular in one medium, and then expanding to others through [[licensing agreement]]s, with respect to [[intellectual property]] in the franchise's characters and settings. As one author explains, "[f]or the studios, a home-run is a film from which a multimedia 'franchise' can be generated; the colossally expensive creation of cross-media conglomerates predicated on synergistic rewards provides an obvious imperative to develop such products."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Langford, ''Post-classical Hollywood: Film Industry, Style and Ideology Since 1945'', p. 207, {{ISBN|074863858X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The trend later developed wherein franchises would be launched in multiple forms of media simultaneously:

{{quote|"In one of the most celebrated ventures in media convergence, [[The Wachowskis|Larry and Andy Wachowski]], creators of ''[[The Matrix trilogy]]'', produced the game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' (2003) simultaneously with the last two films of the trilogy, shooting scenes for the game on the movie's sets with the movie's actors, and releasing the game on the same day as ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. Likewise, on September 21, 2004, [[Lucasfilm]] jointly released a new DVD box set of the original ''[[Star Wars trilogy]]'' with ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'', a [[combat game]] in which players can reenact battles from all six ''Star Wars'' films. In 2005, Peter Jackson likewise produced his blockbuster film ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' (2005) in tandem with a successful ''King Kong'' game designed by [[Michel Ancel]] and published by Ubisoft. In the last several years, numerous licensed videogame adaptations of major summer and holiday blockbusters were released a few days before or a few days after their respective films, including: all three ''Star Wars films'' (1999–2005); all five ''[[Harry Potter films]]'' (2001–2008); all three ''[[Spider-Man films]]'' (2002–2007); ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (2002); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003); ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'' (2005); ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' (2006); ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' (2007); and ''[[Transformers]]'' (2007). These multimedia franchises have made it more difficult to distinguish the production of films and videogames as separate enterprises"|source=Harry Brown, ''Videogames and Education''.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Harry J. Brown, ''Videogames and Education'' (2008), p. 41, {{ISBN|0765629496}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Development to other forms==
===Fiction===
Long-running film franchises were common in the early studio era, when Hollywood studios had actors and directors under long-term contract. Examples include [[Andy Hardy]], [[Ma and Pa Kettle]], [[Bulldog Drummond]], [[Superman]], [[Tarzan]], and [[Batman]]. The longest-running modern film franchises include [[James Bond]], [[Godzilla]], ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', and ''[[Star Trek]]''. In such cases, even lead actors are often replaced as they age, lose interest, or their characters are killed.

Media franchises tend to cross over from their original media to other forms. Literary franchises are often transported to film, such as [[Nancy Drew]], [[Miss Marple]], and other popular [[detective]]s, as well as popular [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es. Television and film franchises are often expanded upon in [[novel]]s, particularly those in the [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] genres, such as ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. Similarly, fantasy, science fiction films and television shows are frequently adapted into [[animated television series]], video games, or both.

A media franchise does not have to include the same characters or theme, as the brand identity can be the franchise, like [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' or the [[National Lampoon, Incorporated|''National Lampoon'' series]], and can suffer from critical failures even if the media fictional material is unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/how-to-kill-a-major-media-franchise-in-a-decade | title=How To Kill A Major Media Franchise In A Decade | publisher=Buzzfeed | date=12 August 2013 | accessdate=16 September 2013 | author=Bernstein, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-fiction===
[[Non-fiction]] literary franchises include the ''[[...For Dummies]]'' and ''[[The Complete Idiot's Guide to...]]'' [[reference book]]s. An enduring and extensive example of a media franchise is [[Playboy Enterprises]], which began expanding well beyond its successful magazine, ''[[Playboy]]'', within a few years after its first publication, into such enterprises as a modeling agency, several television shows (''Playboy's Penthouse'', in 1959), and even its own [[Playboy TV|television channel]]. Twenty-five years later, Playboy released private clubs and restaurants, movie theaters, [[Playboy Radio|a radio show]], [[direct to video]] films, music and book publishing (including original works in addition to its anthologies of cartoons, photographs, recipes, advice, articles or fiction that had originally appeared in the magazine), footwear, clothing of every kind, jewelry, housewares (lamps, clocks, bedding, glassware), guitars and gambling, playing cards, pinball machines and pet accessories, billiard balls, bedroom appurtenances, enhancements, plus countless other items of merchandise.

'''The Metagame''', or '''game about the game''', is any approach to a [[game]] that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game; uses external factors to affect the game; or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game. 

''Metagaming'' might also refer to a game which functions to create or modify the rules of a sub-game. Thus, we might play a metagame selecting which rules will apply during the play of the game itself.

==Examples==
* A special set of moves in [[chess]] can allow a player to [[scholar's mate|win in four moves]].  Competitor A has been watching Competitor B play chess, and the past five games in a row Competitor B has attempted to use this four-move win.  When Competitor A sits down to play against Competitor B, Competitor A will be metagaming if they play in a way that will give them an advantage if Competitor B repeats this line.
* In modern computer games, particularly in casual, mobile and tablet games, the out-of-game play achievements which give you bonuses in the game itself are considered metagame elements as they are games outside of the real game. Also known as [[Reward system]]s, [[Achievement game]]s, [[augmented reality game]]s and [[gamification]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{Citation 
  | last =Kim
  | first =Amy Jo
  | title =Meta-Game Design: Reward Systems that Drive Engagement
  | year =2010
  | url = http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1012242/Meta-Game-Design-Reward-Systems
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any game with a spectator team that does not participate in gameplay could be prone to metagaming. If a spectator were to reveal information to a team or individual that they could not have gained otherwise, he/she would be metagaming.
* In popular [[trading card games]], such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'', or [[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game|''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' Trading Card Game]] players compete with decks they have created in advance and the "metagame" consists of the deck types that are currently popular and expected to show up in large numbers in a tournament. The knowledge of metagame trends can give players an edge against other participants, both while they are playing by quickly recognizing what kind of deck opponents have and guessing their likely cards or moves, and during the deck building process, by selecting cards that do well against current popular deck types at the possible expense of performance against rarer ones. Another example of metagaming would be bluffing opponents into expecting cards that you do not have, or surprising the competition with novel decks that they may not be prepared for. The secondary market of cards is heavily influenced by metagame trends: cards become more valuable when they are popular, often to the point of scarcity.&lt;ref name="MILLER"&gt;{{Citation  | last =Miller | first =John Jackson | title =Scrye Collectible Card Game Checklist &amp; Gaylord| year =2003 | pages =17 | postscript =. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[fighting game]]s, metagaming may occur at the character select screen. The opposing character has various strengths that can be avoided and weaknesses that can be exploited more easily depending on the character you choose provided you are aware of those strengths and weaknesses (called a "match up"). For a basic example, a character with a projectile attack has the advantage over a grappler who must be close to the opponent to be effective. Match up metagaming is very important in tournament settings. In recent fighting games, blind select has been implemented for online modes. This makes it so that neither player can see what character the other player chose. In tournaments, players have the option to opt for a blind select where they tell a judge in confidence the character they intend to select in the match, making their character choice mandatory. A newer trend in more recently released titles is to allow the selection of multiple characters at once which the player can then switch between on the fly, rendering match-up picking excessively hard and virtually impractical.
* In [[space simulation]] action games like ''[[Star Conflict]]'' or ''[[Star Citizen]]'', metagaming occurs in selecting the ship class, weapons, shields and active ship modules in regard to game mode or the kind of team play. Metagaming in the player vs player mode (PvP) plans and realizes ship builds and teamplay mechanics according to the most damaging weapons, the escapes available to ships, the duration of crowd control effects, etc. The abbreviation ''meta'' may refer to a term in gamer slang for what works currently on the highest competitive level and what is the leading type of ships or multiplayer strategy, for example. 
* Many [[logic puzzles]] allow an analogue of metagaming.  By convention, logic puzzles are only considered well-constructed if they have a unique solution.  When solving a puzzle, one might notice that if a certain candidate symbol were placed in one square, there would be multiple ways to complete another part of the puzzle, and no extra information could possibly decide between them.  Ruling out that candidate on these grounds might be classed as metagaming if the existence of a single solution were merely a convention rather than a rule.
* In the cooperative card game [[Hanabi (card game)|Hanabi]] virtually all the strategy is dependent on metagame, such as the widespread convention that players discard unclued cards from a fixed side of their hand and add new cards from the opposite side. The metagame can go several levels deep. For instance, one may indicate that an unclued card just added to a hand is a playable 3-White by cluing the 4-White in a different player's hand (this is known as "finesse"). But if a player is aware that everyone in the game is familiar with finesse, they may merely ''pretend'' to finesse in order to get some other card played: perhaps it was not a 3-White, but some other card that was nonetheless also playable.
*In repeated, competitive, multiplayer games in which players can team up to gain an advantage, gamers who betray their allies too often may be mistrusted, making it difficult to form partnerships in subsequent games.&lt;ref name="Garfield"&gt;{{Citation

==Games==

===Adaptation to a specific gaming environment===
Another game-related use of the term "metagaming" refers to operation on knowledge of the current strategic trends within a game. This usage is common in games that have large, organized play systems or tournament circuits and which feature customized decks of cards, sets of miniatures or other playing pieces for each player. Some examples of this kind of environment are tournament scenes for tabletop or computer collectible card games like ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' or ''[[Hearthstone (video game)|Hearthstone]]'', tabletop war-gaming such as ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' or ''[[Flames of War]]'', or team-based multiplayer games such as ''[[Star Conflict]]'', ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', and ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. 

The metagame in these environments is often affected by new elements added by the game's developers and publishers, such as new card expansions in card games, or adjustments to character abilities in online games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/18285891/2017-dota-2-pro-reactions-dota-2-patch-700 | title = Pros react to Dota 2 Patch 7.00 | first = Eric | last = Von Allen | date = December 15, 2016 | accessdate = December 29, 2016 | work = [[ESPN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The metagame may also come within player communities as reactions to win over currently-popular strategies, creating ebbs and flows of strategy types over time.

===Computer games===
Recently the term metagame has come to be used{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} by PC Gaming shoutcasters to describe an emergent methodology that is a subset of the basic strategy necessary to play the game at a high level.  The definitions of this term are varied but can include "pre-game" theory, behavior prediction, or "''ad hoc'' strategy" depending on the game being played.  An example of this would be in [[StarCraft]] where a player's previous matches with the same opponent have given them insight into that player's playstyle and may cause them to make certain decisions which would otherwise seem inferior.

===Role-playing games===
{{Main|Metagaming (role-playing games)}}
In [[role-playing game]]s, metagaming is a term often used to describe players' use of assumed characteristics of the game. In particular, metagaming often refers to having an in-game character act on knowledge that the player has access to but the character should not.  For example, tricking [[Medusa]] to stare at a mirror when the character has never heard of Medusa and would not be aware of her petrifying stare. 

For instance, a player might adjust his character's actions if the player has some foreknowledge of the long-term intentions of the [[gamemaster]], or, more commonly, the gamemaster's tendency to have (or lack) mercy on players whose characters do things that would cause them to fail at their objectives. A player changing how they play the game based on their knowledge of the gamemaster would be metagaming.

{{Nihongo|'''''Myself ; Yourself'''''|マイセルフ；ユアセルフ|Maiserufu ; Yuaserufu}}{{ref label|title|a|}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[visual novel]] developed by [[Yeti (Japanese company)|Yeti]] which was released on December 20, 2007 for the [[PlayStation 2]]. ''Myself ; Yourself'' is the second original game published by [[Regista]], the first being ''[[I/O (visual novel)|I/O]]''. [[Takumi Nakazawa]], the main scenario writer for the ''infinity'' series (''[[Ever17]]'', ''[[Remember11]]''), is the principal writer for ''Myself ; Yourself''. Character design for the game is provided by [[Mutsumi Sasaki]], who also produced the original character design for ''[[Memories Off]]'', ''[[Happy Lesson]]'', and ''[[Futakoi]]''. Before the game's release, a [[light novel]] based on the story, written by [[Takumi Nakazawa]], and illustrated by Wadapen, was serialized in the Japanese [[bishōjo]] magazine ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'' between March and November 2007, published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]. An [[anime]] adaptation began airing in Japan on October 3, 2007 on the [[TV Kanagawa]] television network, and contained thirteen episodes. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sequel to the visual novel was developed by the previous staff entitled ''Myself ; Yourself: Sorezore no Finale'' and was released on May 28, 2009 for the PlayStation 2.

==Plot==
''Myself ; Yourself'' is set in 2007 in the fictional town {{Nihongo|Sakuranomori|桜乃杜}} in W Prefecture which is modeled after [[Wakayama Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. The town is in a quiet, rural area on the southern tip of the prefecture and borders the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Sakuranomori is the birthplace of Sana Hidaka, a sixteen-year-old high school student, who grew up with his childhood friends Nanaka Yatsushiro &amp; Aoi Oribe, his best friend Shusuke Wakatsuki, and Shusuke's fraternal [[twin]] sister Shuri Wakatsuki. Sana left Sakuranomori when he was eleven years old, but returns five years later living on his own in the apartment building Aoi's family runs. Sana soon finds out that while some things have stayed the same, there are still just as many things that have changed.

==Characters==
&lt;!-- Anyone who has played the game, please make distinctions between what was in the game, and what was in the anime. --&gt;

===Protagonists===
;{{Nihongo|Sana Hidaka|日高 佐菜|Hidaka Sana|born October 13, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Shinnosuke Tachibana]]}} (regular), [[Madoka Kimura]] (childhood)
:Sana is the main protagonist of the series. He left Sakuranomori during his childhood, and during the beginning of the series he comes back to live by himself in the apartment building owned by Aoi's parents. He apparently had a crush on Nanaka before he left and still holds those feelings for her. He used to play the piano, but he forgot every song except the song Nanaka wrote for him which he says is very important to him. He has a [[Hemophobia|fear of blood]] because he tried to commit suicide during his middle-school years due to constantly being bullied. At the end of the anime series, Sana proposes to Nanaka and she accepts by wearing the proposal ring during her concert.

:In the game, his default romantic partner is Nanaka Yatsushiro, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale".

:{{anime voice|[[Takehito Koyasu]]}} (regular), [[Yūko Sanpei]] (childhood)
:Shūsuke is one of the four childhood friends Sana left behind when he moved, and they renew their friendship on his return. He is Sana's best friend and the only male besides Sana in their circle. He is the younger twin of Shuri Wakatsuki. Yuzuki-sensei refers him as the lucky one of the Wakatsuki twins. When he and Shuri are accused of being lovers, their father decides to send Shuri away to London. When Shuri tells Shūsuke that she cannot stand to be separated from him, they decide to run away together knowing people will think that they have eloped.
:In the game, his default romantic partner is Asami Hoshino, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale". However, in the first game, if Sana takes Shuri's route, Shūsuke will admit that he has romantic feelings for his sister. Even though Shūsuke has these feelings, if playing the game as Shūsuke, there is no Shuri route.

===Heroines===
;{{Nihongo|Nanaka Yatsushiro|八代 菜々香|Yatsushiro Nanaka|born July 29, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Ami Koshimizu]]}}
:Nanaka is one of Sana's childhood friends and seemed to have feelings for Sana. When Sana returns to town after five years, her personality has changed from sweet and caring to a cold and moody demeanor. On meeting again she slaps him, apparently for not recognizing her. In the anime, it is also explained that they had agreed to send letters to one another and that Sana had neglected to do so, while Nanaka had stuffed their mailbox with countless letters begging for help. This may have also provided motivation for the slap. She still seems to have romantic feelings for him as she gets jealous whenever Sana is with another girl (especially Asami).

:Nanaka was a victim of a possible arson shortly after Sana left Sakuranomori, and lost both of her parents in the fire. She managed to escape with only her violin (which she stopped playing and kept only as a memento) and the sakura bracelet that Sana had given her. She claims [[Post-traumatic amnesia|not to remember]] anything of the events of that night. Her uncle and aunt took her in and made efforts to ensure that she didn't try to remember to spare her further pain. Events after Sana's return, however, start triggering buried memories and she comes to remember everything. Her father was unable to cope with the knowledge that her mother had been unfaithful to him with their very close friend a short time prior to their marriage. As a result, Nanaka's father immolated himself and his wife after knocking her senseless when she confirmed that Nanaka was in fact the result of the tryst and not his daughter after all, something that Nanaka's uncle had always suspected. (Nanaka's biological father was also her violin teacher.) Unable to cope with the burden of her returned memories, Nanaka attempts suicide but is discovered in time by Sana, who overcomes his fear of blood to save her. In the last episode of the anime, Sana proposes to her and she accepts.

:In the game, her default romantic partner is Sana, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale". It is also revealed that she and Asami Hoshino are cousins, which surprises Hinako at first. She later comments that she knew there was some kind of a connection between them because they both had the same air to them. Nanaka dreams of becoming a professional violinist, which was inspired by Sana's suggestion as a child.
  
;{{Nihongo|Aoi Oribe|織部 麻緒衣|Oribe Aoi|born August 28, 1990}}
:{{anime voice|[[Tomoko Kaneda]]}}
:Despite the fact that Sana calls her mother his aunt, Aoi and Sana are not related (in Japan it is common to refer to a woman older than oneself as oba-san, which is also the term used for an aunt). Her parents own the apartment building that Sana lives in. Her vision has weakened ever since she entered high school, so she now wears glasses. She loves to read books and is very energetic but clumsy. She has a very high-pitched voice and child-like character, but has a busty physique. Despite being childish, Aoi has a very caring personality, and never fails to aid a friend in need. Her dream is to become a picture-book author. This dream was inspired by Sana.

;{{Nihongo|Shuri Wakatsuki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yetigame.jp/myselfyourself/chara/syuri/syuri.gif|title=Image of Syuri's official romanization|accessdate=2007-09-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928132919/http://www.yetigame.jp/myselfyourself/chara/syuri/syuri.gif|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|若月 朱里|Wakatsuki Shūri|born March 23, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Yukari Tamura]]}}
:Shuri is one of Sana's childhood friends and the older twin of Shūsuke. Yuzuki-sensei refers her as the unlucky Wakatsuki twin. She is the most athletic of all the girls, although she is somewhat lacking when it comes to her figure. Shuri is a very supportive friend and had no trouble reconnecting with Sana, even after his prolonged absence. She also volunteers at the local retirement home and later invites Asami to join her. In the anime, she and Shūsuke run away together, but come back in the final episode to see Nanaka's violin performance.

[[File:Myself ; Yourself heroines.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The heroines of ''Myself ; Yourself'' (from left to right): Nanaka, Aoi, Shuri, Hinako, Yuzuki, and Asami.]]
;{{Nihongo|Hinako Mochida|持田 雛子|Mochida Hinako|born August 5, 1997}}
:{{anime voice|[[Ayumi Murata]]}}, [[Ayano Niina]] (''Sorezore no Finale'')
:Hinako is a ten-year-old girl going on eleven. She has been infatuated with Shūsuke since he saved her from three bullies who had taken her school bag and would not give it back. She wants to know how to become a girl that he will like and asks Sana and Aoi for their help. Hinako's personality is similar  to Aoi's, however being only in the fifth grade, she is more childish. In the last anime episode, it is shown that she is the girlfriend of Asami's cousin, who is five years younger than she is.

;{{Nihongo|Yuzuki Fujimura|藤村 柚希|Fujimura Yuzuki|born December 26, 1982}}
:{{anime voice|[[Megumi Toyoguchi]]}}
:Yuzuki is the twenty-five-year-old homeroom teacher of Sana's class; Shūsuke, Nanaka, and Shuri are also in the same class. It is a well known secret that she rewards her students with caramel candy whenever they do a good job in school, whether it involves assigned duties or favors for her. This habit of rewarding her students with candy originated many years previously when she was still in high school and found a child attempting to perform a flip over a metal bar in the park (revealed to be Sana in the anime). She offered him a caramel as a reward if he succeeded, which, of course, he did.

;{{Nihongo|Asami Hoshino|星野 あさみ|Hoshino Asami|born October 28, 1991}}
:{{anime voice|[[Mai Nakahara]]}}
:Asami is Sana's childhood friend and a second year student. Although she volunteers at the retirement home along with Shuri and seems to have a very gentle personality, she is in fact quite vindictive and  takes revenge on people who hurt her. In the anime, she had a crush on Shuri and when she confessed to her, Shuri said that they should remain friends. Angered, Asami wrote a letter to the school accusing Shuri and her twin of being lovers. She later invites Shuri and Sana to the hospital to visit a sick woman from the retirement home in an attempt to hurt Shuri mentally. To her surprise, Shuri doesn't react as she expected and seems unfazed. The old woman obtains a knife and tries to kill Shuri in a fit of madness (brought on by the death of her granddaughter) but Asami knocks Shuri out of harm's way and is stabbed in her stead. She comes to realize that her hatred of Shuri is unfounded and tries to make amends.
:In the game, her default romantic partner is Shūsuke Wakatsuki, as shown in "Sorezore no Finale". She is also revealed to be Nanaka's cousin.

A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sequel to the visual novel entitled {{Nihongo|''Myself ; Yourself: Sorezore no Finale''|Myself ; Yourself それぞれのfinale}} was developed by the previous production staff and was released in spring 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dps.dengeki.com/2008/11/post_679.html|title=''Myself ; Yourself: Sorezore no Finale'' announcement|publisher=[[ASCII Media Works]]|date=2008-11-27|accessdate=2008-11-27|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225220253/http://dps.dengeki.com/2008/11/post_679.html|archivedate=2009-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features four new scenarios with Nanaka and Asami getting separate scenarios, and there are two duel scenarios with Shuri and Aoi in one, and Hinako and Yuzuki in the other. Several new characters are also introduced.

==Music==
The opening theme for the anime is "Tears Infection" by [[Kaori (voice actress)|Kaori]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-07-24/myself-yourself-anime-airs-in-october-with-kaori-song|title=''Myself;Yourself'' Anime Airs in October with KAORI Song|date=July 24, 2007|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ending theme is {{Nihongo|"Kimi to Yozora to Sakamichi to"|キミと夜空と坂道と}} by [[Kanako Itō]]; the singles for both songs were released on October 24, 2007.

The game's original soundtrack was released with the limited edition release of the game on December 20, 2007; the soundtrack was also used for the anime version.

==Reception==
Stig Høgset from THEM Anime Reviews comments that the anime is similar to ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'' due to both having "a guy who's not a complete loser, who returns to his old town and meets various people, most of them girls or teachers/parents of said girls. Unlike with ''Kanon'', however, these are people he already know{{sic}}." He criticizes the anime for Aoi's "unchanging voice" throughout the flashback, the present and the epilogue that flash forwards ten years into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1035|title=Myself; Yourself|first=Stig|last=Høgset|publisher=THEM Anime Reviews|accessdate=January 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

Onsen Musume are minor goddesses who live in every [[onsen]]. During the day Onsen Musume go to school in [[Odaiba]], Tokyo to learn how to help more people learn about each Musume's respective onsen, and also to learn special arts that help guests relax and smile.

One day they receive a proclamation from Sunahiko, the god who rules over all of the onsen, commanding them to become [[Japanese idol|idols]]. The Onsen Musume form idol groups in order to compete in the newly-created idol tournament.

The main character of the series is Yuina Kusatsu, the Onsen Musume for [[Kusatsu Onsen]]. With eight other Onsen Musume, she forms an idol group called "SPRiNGS". In school the nine members are known as the "weird ones", but as idols they aim to become the best Onsen Musume idol group in Japan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://soranews24.com/2017/03/21/onsen-musume-japanese-hot-springs-turn-into-cute-anime-schoolgirl-idols%E3%80%90video%E3%80%91/|title=Onsen Musume: Japanese hot springs turn into cute anime schoolgirl idols【Video】|date=2017-03-21|work=SoraNews24|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''petting zoo''' (often called, or part of, a "''children's zoo''") features a combination of [[List of domesticated animals|domesticated animals]] and some [[wildlife|wild species]] that are docile enough to touch and feed. In addition to independent petting zoos, also called '''children's farms''' or '''petting farms''', many general [[zoo]]s contain a petting zoo. 

Most petting zoos are designed to provide only relatively placid, [[herbivorous]] domesticated animals, such as [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, or [[Pony|ponies]], to feed and interact physically with safely. This is in contrast to the usual zoo experience, where normally wild animals are viewed from behind safe enclosures where no contact is possible. A few provide wild species (such as [[pythons]] or [[big cat]] cubs) to interact with, but these are rare and usually found outside Western nations.

==History==
In 1938, the [[London Zoo]] included the first ''children's zoo'' in [[Europe]] and the [[Philadelphia Zoo]] was the first in [[North America]] to open a special [[zoo]] just for children.

During the 1990s, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] cities began building petting zoos in many neighborhoods, so that urban children could interact with animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/travel/amsterdam-netherlands-dutch-children-farm-petting-zoo.html|title=The Dutch Way: Tulips, Windmills and Barnyard Animals|last=Siegal|first=Nina|date=2017-03-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals and food==
Petting zoos feature a variety of domestic animals. Common animals include [[sheep]], [[guinea pig]]s, [[goat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[ponies]], [[alpaca]]s, [[llama]]s, [[pig]]s and miniature [[donkey]]s, and a few exotic animals such as [[kangaroos]].

Petting zoos are popular with small children, who will often feed the animals. In order to ensure the animals' health, the food is supplied by the zoo, either from [[vending machine]]s or a kiosk. Food often fed to animals includes grass and crackers, and also in selected feeding areas [[hay]] is a common food. Such feeding is an exception to the usual rule about [[Do not feed the animals|not feeding animals]].

== Mobile petting zoos ==
Some petting zoos are also mobile and will travel to a home for a children's party or event. Many areas have a qualified mobile petting zoo. One of the first mobile petting zoos in Australia (begun in 1992), was Kindifarm. As a result of its popularity, many Australians use the term ''kindy farms'' to describe petting zoos. In Australia, mobile petting zoos are allowed in schools, child care centres and even shopping centres. For many children, a mobile petting zoo is their first opportunity to see and touch an animal.

== Health effects ==
Touching animals can result in the [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission of diseases]] between animals and humans ([[zoonoses]]) so it is recommended that people should thoroughly wash their hands before and after touching the animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.ulster.ac.uk/3804/ Zoonoses associated with petting farms and open zoos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bovinevetonline.com/news/industry/Beware-the-fair-and-petting-zoos-170049516.html Beware The Fair (And Petting Zoos)]&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several outbreaks of ''[[E. coli]]'' etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.about-ecoli.com/ecoli_outbreaks/news/tests-suggest-e-coli-spread-through-air/#.UGXIQWt5lP4 Tests suggest E. coli spread through air]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/godstone-farm-ecoli-outbreak---7059615|title=Children win compensation after Godstone Farm E.coli outbreak|last=Harper|first=Paul|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=getSurrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Performing arts}}
'''Puppetry''' is a form of [[theatre]] or performance that involves the manipulation of [[puppet]]s – [[inanimate]] objects, often resembling some type of human or animal figure, that are animated or manipulated by a human called a [[puppeteer]]. Such a performance is also known as a {{nowrap|'''puppet play'''}}. The puppeteer uses movements of her hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet. The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part. The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppets are typically used in [[storytelling]].

There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made of a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They can be extremely complex or very simple in their construction. The simplest puppets are [[finger puppet]]s, which are tiny puppets that fit onto a single finger, and [[sock puppet]]s, which are formed from a sock and operated by inserting one's hand inside the sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's "mouth". A [[hand puppet]] is controlled by one hand which occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around ([[Punch and Judy]] puppets are familiar examples of hand puppets). A "live-hand puppet" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet. [[Marionette]]s are suspended and controlled by a number of strings, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer.

Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which was first recorded in the 5th century BC in [[Ancient Greece]]. Some forms of puppetry may have originated as long ago as 3000 years [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Puppetry takes many forms, but they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects to tell a story. Puppetry occurs in almost all human societies where puppets are used for the purpose of entertainment through performance, as [[sacred]] objects in [[rituals]], as symbolic [[Effigy|effigies]] in celebrations such as [[carnival]]s, and as a catalyst for social and psychological change in [[transformative arts]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Strings, Hands, Shadows: A Modern Puppet History'', John Bell, Detroit Institute of Art, 2000, {{ISBN|0-89558-156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Puppetry is a very ancient art form, thought to have originated about 4000 years ago.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"&gt;Blumenthal, Eileen, ''Puppetry and Puppets'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-500-51226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puppets have been used since the earliest times to animate and communicate the ideas and needs of human societies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dugan, E.A., ''Emotions in Motion''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians claim that they pre-date actors in theatre.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} There is evidence that they were used in [[Egypt]] as early as 2000 BCE when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to perform the action of kneading bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Wire controlled, articulated puppets made of clay and [[ivory]] have also been found in Egyptian tombs.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Hieroglyphs]] also describe "walking statues" being used in ancient [[Egypt]]ian religious dramas.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Puppetry was practiced in [[ancient Greece]] and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]], dating from the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]], 2.48, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0016,001:2:48&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]], 4.55, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0032,004:4:55&amp;lang=original on Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logan, David, ''Puppetry'', p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Sub-Saharan Africa may have inherited some of the puppet traditions of ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Certainly, secret societies in many African ethnic groups still use puppets (and [[masks]]) in ritual dramas as well as in their healing and hunting ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Today, puppetry continues as a popular form, often within a ceremonial context, and as part of a wide range of folk forms including dance, storytelling, and [[mask|masked performance]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In the 2010s throughout rural Africa, puppetry still performs the function of transmitting cultural values and ideas that in large African cities is increasingly undertaken by formal education, books, cinema, and television.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Asia ===

====East, Southeast and South Asia====
[[File:Traditional Burmese Commandar-in-chief Marionette.JPG|thumb|Traditional Burmese "commander-in-chief" marionette character]]
There is slight evidence for puppetry in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Archaeologists have unearthed one terracotta doll with a detachable head capable of manipulation by a string dating to 2500 BC.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Another figure is a terracotta monkey which could be manipulated up and down a stick, achieving minimum animation in both cases.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14/&gt; The epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', [[Tamil literature]] from the [[Tamil Sangams|Sangam Era]], and various literary works dating from the late centuries BC to the early centuries AD, including [[edicts of Ashoka|Ashokan edicts]], describe puppets.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-14-15&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, pp.14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Works like the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' and the ''[[Kamasutra]]'' elaborate on puppetry in some detail.&lt;ref name=G-m-b-15-16&gt;Ghosh, Massey, and Banerjee, pages 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Javanese ''[[Wayang]]'' theater was influenced by [[India]]n traditions.&lt;ref name=Bell-puppet-46&gt;Bell, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars trace the origin of puppets to India 4000 years ago, where the main character in [[Sanskrit]] plays was known as "Sutradhara",  "the holder of strings".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; ''Wayang'' is a strong tradition of puppetry native of [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Java]] &amp; [[Bali]]. In [[Java]], [[Wayang Kulit Indonesia|wayang kulit]], an elaborate form of shadow puppetry is very popular. Javanese rod puppets have a long history and are used to tell fables from Javanese history. Another popular puppetry form in Indonesia is [[Wayang golek]].

China has a history of puppetry dating back 3000 years, originally in "pi-yung xi", the "theatre of the lantern shadows", or, as it is more commonly known today, [[Shadow theatre|Chinese shadow theatre]]. By the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), puppets played to all social classes including the courts, yet puppeteers, as in Europe, were considered to be from a lower social stratum.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;
In [[Taiwan]], [[budaixi]] puppet shows, somewhat similar to the Japanese Bunraku, occur with puppeteers working in the background or underground. Some very experienced puppeteers can manipulate their puppets to perform various stunts, for example, [[somersault]]s in the air.

[[Japan]] has many forms of puppetry, including the [[bunraku]]. Bunraku developed out of Shinto temple rites and gradually became a highly sophisticated form of puppetry. [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]], considered by many to be Japan's greatest playwright, gave up writing Kabuki plays and focused exclusively on the puppet-only Bunraku plays. Initially consisting of one puppeteer, by 1730 three puppeteers were used to operate each puppet in full view of the audience.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; The puppeteers, who dressed all in black, would become invisible when standing against a black background, while the torches illuminated only the carved, painted and costumed wooden puppets.

[[Image:Rajasthani-puppeteer.jpg|thumb|Puppeteer from [[Rajasthan]] (India)]]
In [[Korea]], the tradition of puppetry is thought to have come from China. The oldest historical evidence of puppetry in Korea comes from a letter written in 982 A.D. from Choe Seung-roe to the King.&lt;ref name="sangsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/768|author=Sang-su, Choe|title=A Study of the Korean Puppet Play|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korean, the word for puppet is "Kkoktugakshi".&lt;ref name="sangsu"/&gt; "Gagsi" means a "bride" or a "young woman", which was the most common form the dolls took. A [[Kkoktugakshi Nori|kkoktugakshi puppet play]] has eight scenes.&lt;ref name="sangsu"/&gt;

[[Thailand]] has [[Hun Krabok]], a rod puppet theatre which is the most popular form of puppetry.

[[Vietnam]] developed the art form of [[water puppetry]], that is unique to that country. The puppets are built out of wood and the shows are performed in a waist high pool. A large rod under the water is used by the puppeteers to support and control the puppets. The appearance is created of the puppets moving over water. The origin of this form of puppetry dates back seven hundred years when the rice fields would flood and the villagers would entertain each other, eventually resulting in puppet show competitions between villages. This led to puppet societies becoming secretive and exclusive.

====India====
{{Main|Puppetry in India}}
India has a long tradition of puppetry. In the ancient Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' there are references to puppets. The [[Rajasthani Puppet]] from India is notable and there are many Indian ventriloquists and puppeteers. The first Indian ventriloquist, Professor Y.K. Padhye, introduced this form of puppetry to India in the 1920s and his son, [[Ramdas Padhye]], subsequently popularised ventriloquism and puppetry. Almost all types of puppets are found in India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccrtindia.gov.in/puppetforms.php|title=Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT)|website=ccrtindia.gov.in|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;String puppets
[[File:Sakhi Kandhei (String puppets of Odisha) at Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum, Pune.JPG|thumb|Sakhi Kandhei (String puppets of Odisha)]]
India has a rich and ancient tradition of string puppets or marionettes. Marionettes having jointed limbs controlled by strings allow far greater flexibility and are, therefore, the most articulate of the puppets. Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are some of the regions where this form of puppetry has flourished. The traditional marionettes of Rajasthan are known as Kathputli. Carved from a single piece of wood, these puppets are like large dolls that are colourfully dressed.  The string puppets of Orissa are known as Kundhei. The string puppets of Karnataka are called Gombeyatta. Puppets from Tamil Nadu, known as Bommalattam combine the techniques of both rod and string puppets.

;Shadow puppets
[[File:Tholpava koothu shadow puppet back stage (1).jpg|thumb|Tholpavakoothu (Kerala)]]
India has a variety of types and styles of shadow puppets. Shadow puppets are flat figures cut out of leather, which has been treated to make it translucent. Shadow puppets are pressed against the screen with a strong source of light behind it. The manipulation between the light and the screen make silhouettes or colourful shadows, as the case may be, for the viewers who sit in front of the screen. This tradition of shadow puppets survives in Orissa. Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. [[Tholpavakoothu]] (or Tolpava Koothu) is a tradition of [[shadow puppetry]] that is unique to [[Kerala]], [[India]].  The shadow theatre of Karnataka is known as Togalu Gombeyatta. These puppets are mostly small in size. The puppets however differ in size according to their social status, for instance, large size for kings and religious characters and smaller size for common people or servants.

;Rod puppets
Rod puppets are an extension of glove-puppets, but often much larger and supported and manipulated by rods from below. This form of puppetry now is found mostly in West Bengal and Orissa. The traditional rod puppet form of West Bengal is known as Putul Nautch. They are carved from wood and follow the various artistic styles of a particular region. The traditional rod puppet of Bihar is known as Yampuri. 
;Glove puppets
Glove puppets, are also known as sleeve, hand or palm puppets. The head is made of either papier mache, cloth or wood, with two hands emerging from just below the neck. The rest of the figure consists of a long flowing skirt. These puppets are like limp dolls, but in the hands of an able puppeteer, are capable of producing a wide range of movements. The manipulation technique is simple the movements are controlled by the human hand the first finger inserted in the head and the middle finger and the thumb are the two arms of the puppet. With the help of these three fingers, the glove puppet comes alive.

The tradition of glove puppets in India is popular in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and Kerala. In Uttar Pradesh, glove puppet plays usually present social themes, whereas in Orissa such plays are based on stories of Radha and Krishna. In Orissa, the puppeteer plays on the ''dholak''with one hand and manipulates the puppet with the other. The delivery of the dialogues, the movement of the puppet and the beat of the dholak are well synchronised and create a dramatic atmosphere. In Kerala, the traditional glove puppet play is called Pavakoothu.

====Afghanistan====
[[Afghanistan]] has produced a form of puppetry known as [[buz-baz]].  During a performance a puppeteer will simultaneously operate a marionette of a [[markhor]] while playing a [[dambura]].

===West Asia===
[[Image:Karagoez davulcu.jpg|110px|thumb|right|Karagoz, Turkish shadow puppetry]]
Middle Eastern puppetry, like its other theatre forms, is influenced by the Islamic culture. [[Karagoz]], the Turkish Shadow Theatre, has widely influenced puppetry in the region and it is thought to have passed from China by way of India. Later, it was taken by the [[Mongols]] from the Chinese and passed to the Turkish peoples of Central Asia. The art of Shadow Theater was brought to [[Anatolia]] by the Turkish people emigrating from Central Asia. Other scholars claim that shadow theater came to Anatolia in the 16th century from [[Egypt]]. The advocates of this view claim that shadow theatre found its way into the Ottoman palaces when [[Selim I|Yavuz Sultan Selim]] conquered Egypt in 1517. He saw shadow theatre performed during a party in his honour and he was said to be so impressed with it that he took the puppeteer back to his palace in [[Istanbul]] where his 21-year -old son, later Sultan [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], developed an interest in the plays.&lt;ref&gt;Mutlu, Hayali Mustafa, ''Tradition Folk The Site''&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, the style of shadow puppetry known as ''khayal al-zill'', a [[metaphor]] translated as "shadows of the imagination" or "shadow of fancy", still survives. This is a shadow play with live music, "the accompaniment of drums, tambourines and flutes...also..."special effects" – smoke, fire, thunder, rattles, squeaks, thumps, and whatever else might elicit a laugh or a shudder from his audience"&lt;ref&gt;Feeney, John, ''Saudi Aramco World'' (article), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iran]], puppets are known to have existed much earlier than 1000 AD, but initially only glove and string puppets were popular .&lt;ref&gt;Floor, Willem, ''The History of Theater in Iran'', {{ISBN|0-934211-29-9}}: Mage 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Other genres of puppetry emerged during the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era (18th and 19th centuries) as influences from Turkey spread to the region. ''Kheimeh Shab-Bazi'' is a traditional Persian puppet show which is performed in a small chamber by a musical performer and a [[storytelling|storyteller]] called a ''morshed'' or ''naghal''. These shows often take place alongside storytelling in traditional tea and coffee-houses (''Ghahve-Khane''). The dialogue takes place between the morshed and the puppets.&lt;ref&gt;Mehr News Agency, [http://www.mehrnews.com www.mehrnews.com], 7 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example of puppetry in Iran is the touring opera ''[[Rostam and Sohrab (opera)|Rostam and Sohrab]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Iran Daily'' [http://www.iran-daily.com www.iran-daily.com], 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Ancient Greece and Rome====
[[File:5016 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Dolls - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 13 2009.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek terracotta puppet dolls, 5th/4th century BC, [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]
Although there are few remaining examples of puppets from [[ancient Greece]], historical literature and archaeological findings shows the existence of puppetry. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word translated as "puppet" is "νευρόσπαστος" (''nevrospastos''), which literally means "drawn by strings, string-pulling",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneuro%2Fspastos νευρόσπαστος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from "νεῦρον" (''nevron''), meaning either "sinew, tendon, muscle, string", or "wire",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dneu%3Dron νεῦρον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and "σπάω" (''spaō''), meaning "draw, pull".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dspa%2Fw σπάω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=neurospast&amp;lang=greek List of Ancient Greek words related to puppetry], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] referred to pulling strings to control heads, hands and eyes, shoulders and legs.&lt;ref&gt;Mulholland, John, ''Practical Puppetry'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]]'s work also contains references to puppetry. The ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the "common people" in the 5th century BC. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of [[Dionysus]] at the [[Acropolis]].&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;

In ancient Greece and [[ancient Rome]] clay dolls, and a few of ivory, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children's tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, and in some cases an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, as it is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings in place of rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were simply toys and not puppets, due to their small size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagecraft.com/puppetry/definitions/historical/chapter1.html Observations - Chapter One&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
;Middle Ages and Renaissance
Italy is considered by many to be the early home of the marionette due to the influence of Roman puppetry. [[Xenophon]] and [[Plutarch]] refer to them.&lt;ref name="Binyon"&gt;Binyon, Helen, ''Puppetry Today'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian church used marionettes to perform [[morality plays]].&lt;ref name="Binyon"/&gt; It is believed that the word '''[[marionette]]''' originates from the little figures of the [[Virgin Mary]], hence the word "marionette" or "Mary doll.&lt;ref&gt;Beaton, Mabel &amp; Les, ''Marionettes: A Hobby for Everyone''.&lt;/ref&gt; Comedy was introduced to the plays as time went by, and ultimately led to a church edict banning puppetry. Puppeteers responded by setting up stages outside cathedrals and became even more [[ribald]] and [[slapstick]]. Out of this grew the Italian comedy called [[Commedia dell'arte]]. Puppets were used at times in this form of theatre and sometimes [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays were performed using marionettes instead of actors.&lt;ref&gt;Suib, Leonard Broadman, Muriel, ''Marionettes Onstage!'', p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sicily]], the sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''. These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. In Sicilian this is called "[[Opera dei pupi]]", or "Opera of the puppets". The "Opera dei pupi" and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorie, the word for storyteller, are rooted in the [[troubadour|Provençal troubadour tradition]], in Sicily during the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the first half of the 13th century.

;18th and 19th centuries
The 18th century was a vital period in the development of all Italian theatre, including the marionette theatre. The rod puppet was mainly of lower-class origin, but the marionette theatre was popular in [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] circles, as a celebration of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The effects, and the artful and complex construction of the puppets, the puppet theatres, and the puppet narratives, were all popular, particularly in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Signorelli, Collezione Maria,  [http://www.collezionemariasignorelli.it/inglese_01_inizio.htm www.collezionemariasignorelli.it].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, the marionettes of [[Pietro Radillo]] became more complex and instead of just the rod and two strings, Radillo's marionettes were controlled by as many as eight strings, which increased control over the individual body parts of the marionettes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====France====
[[Guignol]] is the main character in the French puppet show which has come to bear his name. Although often thought of as children's entertainment, Guignol's sharp wit and linguistic verve have always been appreciated by adults as well, as shown by the motto of a prominent [[Lyon]] troupe: "Guignol amuses children… and witty adults". [[Laurent Mourguet]], Guignol's creator, fell on hard times during the French Revolution, and in 1797 started to practice [[dentistry]], which in those days was simply the pulling of teeth. To attract patients, he started setting up a puppet show in front of his dentist's chair.
[[File:Guignol de Lyon.JPG|thumb|Guignol de Lyon]]

His first shows featured [[Pulcinella|Polichinelle]], a character borrowed from the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]. By 1804 the success was such that he gave up dentistry altogether and became a professional puppeteer, creating his own scenarios drawing on the concerns of his working-class audience and improvising references to the news of the day. He developed characters closer to the daily lives of his Lyon audience, first Gnafron, a wine-loving cobbler, and in 1808 Guignol. Other characters, including Guignol's wife Madelon and the [[Gendarmerie|gendarme]] Flagéolet soon followed, but these are never much more than foils for the two heroes. Guignol's inevitable victory is always the triumph of good over evil.

====Great Britain====
[[File:Burattini ca 1770.jpg|British Puppet theatre (Punch and Judy style), c. 1770|thumb|right]]
The traditional British ''[[Punch and Judy]]'' puppetry traces its roots to the 16th century to the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name="binyon"&gt;Binyon, Helen, ''Puppetry Today'', p.36&lt;/ref&gt; The character of "Punch" derives from the character [[Pulcinella]], which was Anglicized to ''Punchinello''. He is a manifestation of the [[Lord of Misrule]] and [[Trickster]], figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally "Joan", but later became "Judy". In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the familiar ''Punch and Judy'' puppet show which existed in Britain was performed in an easily transportable [[:wikt:booth|booth]]. The British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild in the early 20th century instigated a resurgence of puppetry. Two of the Guild's founders, H. W. Whanslaw and [[Waldo Lanchester]], both worked to promote and develop puppetry with publications of books and literature, mainly focusing on the art of the marionette. Lanchester had a touring theatre and a permanent venue in [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], regularly taking part in the Malvern Festival and attracting the attention of [[George Bernard Shaw]]. One of Shaw's last plays, ''[[Shakes versus Shav]]'', was written for and first performed in 1949 by the company.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

From 1957-1969, [[Gerry Anderson]] produced many television series starring marionettes, starting with [[Roberta Leigh]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Twizzle]]'' and ending with ''[[The Secret Service]]''. Many of these series (the most famous of which was ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'') employed a technique called [[Supermarionation]], which automatically synchronized the pre-recorded character dialogue to the puppets' mouth movements. Anderson returned to puppetry in 1983 with ''[[Terrahawks]]'' and the unaired [[Pilot episode|pilot]] ''[[Space Precinct#Pilot|Space Police]]'' in 1987.

Current British puppetry theatres include the [[Little Angel Theatre]] in [[Islington]], London, [[Puppet Theatre Barge]] in London, [[Norwich Puppet Theatre]], the [[Harlequin Puppet Theatre]], [[Rhos-on-Sea]], Wales, and the Biggar Puppet Theatre, [[Biggar, Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]]. British puppetry now covers a wide range of styles and approaches. [[Don Austen]], a British puppeteer, worked with [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], and also worked on a number of feature films. There are also a number of British theatre companies, including [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]], and [[Green Ginger]], which integrate puppetry into highly visual productions. From 1984 to 1996, puppetry was used as a vehicle for political [[satire]] in the British television series ''[[Spitting Image]]''. Puppetry has also been influencing mainstream theatre, and several recent productions combine puppetry with live action, including ''[[War Horse (play)|Warhorse]]'', at the [[Royal National Theatre]] and ''[[Madama Butterfly|Madam Butterfly]]'' at the [[English National Opera]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

====Netherlands, Denmark, Romania, and Russia====
Many regional variants of Pulcinella were developed as the character spread across Europe. In the Netherlands it is ''Jan Klaassen'' (and Judy is ''Katrijn''); in Denmark ''Mester Jackel''; in Russia ''Petrushka''; and in Romania ''Vasilache''. In Russia, the Central Puppet Theatre in Moscow and its branches in every part of the country enhanced the reputation of the puppeteer and puppetry in general.&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mullholland, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany and Austria====
There is a long tradition of puppetry in Germany and Austria. Much of it derives from the 16th century tradition of the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name="binyon"/&gt; The German version of the British character of 'Punch' is called [[Kasperle]] of Kaspar while Judy is called [[Grete]].&lt;ref name="binyon"/&gt; In the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionette puppets. [[Gluck]], [[Haydn]],&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mulholland, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[de Falla]] and [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]] all composed adult operas for marionettes.

In 1855, [[Count Franz Pocci]] founded the [[Münchner Marionettentheater|Munich Marionette Theatre]]. A German dramatist, poet, painter and composer, Pocci wrote 40 puppet plays for his theatre. [[Albrecht Roser]] has made a considerable impact with his marionettes in [[Stuttgart]]. His characters ''Clown Gustaf'' and ''Grandmother'' are well-known.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppets'' by David Currell, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grandmother'', while outwardly charming, is savagely humorous in her observations about all aspects of society and the absurdities of life.

In [[Lindau]], [[Lindauer Marionettenoper|the Lindau Marionette Opera]] was founded in 2000 by [[Bernard Leismueller]] and [[Ralf Hechelmann]]. The company performs a large number of operas as well as a marionette ballet, ''[[Swan Lake]]''.

In Augsburg, the historic [[Augsburger Puppenkiste|Augsburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1943 by [[Walter Oehmichen]]. It continues to this day along with an adjoining puppet museum under the grandsons of the founder, [[Klaus Marschall]] and [[Juergen Marschall]].

Much earlier in nearby [[Salzburg]], Austria, the [[Salzburg Marionette Theatre]] was founded in 1913 by Professor [[Anton Aicher]] and is world-famous. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre still continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own purpose built theatre until recently under the direction of [[Gretl Aicher]]. It performs mainly operas such as ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and a small number of ballets such as ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppet Theatre'' by David Currell, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed for adults although children are of course welcome.

There is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna.

====Czech Republic====
Marionette puppet theatre has had a very long history in entertainment in [[Prague]], and elsewhere in the Czech Republic. It can be traced deep into the early part of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="dubska"&gt;''Czech Puppet Theatre'' by Alice Dubska, Jan Novak, Nina Malikova and Marie Zdenkova, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Marionettes first appeared around the time of the Thirty Years' War.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; The first noted Czech puppeteer was Jan Jiri Brat, who was born in 1724. He was the son of a local carpenter and created his own puppet theatre.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; Matej Kopecky was the most famous 19th-century Czech puppeteer,&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; and was responsible for communicating the ideas of national awareness.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt;

In 1920 and 1926 respectively, [[Josef Skupa]] created his most famous puppet characters: comical father [[Spejbl]] and his rascal son [[Hurvínek]].&lt;ref&gt;''Practical Puppetry''/John Mulholland, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he set up the first modern professional puppet theatre{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. An important puppet organisation is the [[National Marionette Theatre]] in Prague. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. The production has period costumes and 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies, including Buchty a Loutky ("Cakes and Puppets"), founded by [[Marek Bečka]].&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; Puppets have been used extensively in animated films since 1946.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; [[Jiří Trnka]] was an acknowledged leader in this area.&lt;ref name="dubska"/&gt; [[Miroslav Trejtnar]] is a master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette-making skills.&lt;ref&gt;Puppets in Prague, www.puppetsinprague.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

====19th century====
Throughout this period, puppetry developed separately from the emerging mainstream of actor theatres, and the 'ragged' puppeteers performed outside of theatre buildings at fairs, markets etc. - continuing to be classified along with bandits and gypsies.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; In the 19th century, puppetry faced competition from other forms of theatre such as [[vaudeville]] and [[music hall]], but it adapted to these challenges, for example: by developing stage acts and participating in the new forms of popular theatre, or reinventing itself in other ways and finding audiences at the newly fashionable seaside resorts.

===North America===
The [[Teotihuacan]] culture (Central Mexico) of 600 AD made figurines with moveable arms and legs as part of their funerary rites. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] also used ceremonial puppets.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt;
In 1519, two puppeteers accompanied [[Hernando Cortez]] on his first journey to Mexico. Europeans brought their own puppet traditions with them, but gradually distinctive styles, forms and puppet characters developed in [[North America]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

During the Depression, folk puppeteers traveled with carnivals,  working with their own scripts and with dioramas and marionettes of their own manufacture.

Some advances in 20th-century puppetry have originated in the [[United States]]. Marionette puppetry was combined with television as early as the 1940s, with [[Howdy Doody]] of the United States being a notable marionette in this field. [[Bil Baird]] worked on revitalising marionette theatre and puppetry in the United States. He and his wife, [[Cora Eisenberg]] had their own marionette theatre in New York. [[Ventriloquist]], [[Edgar Bergen]] also made a major contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Funni, Arthur, ''The Radio Years of Bergen and McCarthy'' (Thesis)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s Peter Schumann's [[Bread and Puppet Theater]] developed the political and artistic possibilities of puppet theatre in a distinctive, powerful and immediately recognizable way. At roughly the same time, [[Jim Henson]] was creating a type of soft, foam-rubber and cloth puppet which became known collectively as [[The Muppets|Muppets]]. Initially, through the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and later in ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and on film, these inspired many imitators and are today are recognised almost everywhere. [[Wayland Flowers]] also made a major contribution to adult puppetry with his satirical puppet, [[Madame]].

[[Sid and Marty Krofft]] are two of Americas most well known puppeteers and were mainly known for their live action children's TV series in the 60s and 70s namely [[HR Puffinstuff]] and [[Lidsville]]

Puppets also have been used in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, notably with the character of [[Yoda]]. His voice and manipulation was provided by [[Frank Oz]].

===Australia===
The [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] peoples of Australia have a long tradition of oral storytelling which goes back many thousands of years. They used masks and other objects to convey deep and meaningful themes about morality and nature. Masks were carved from wood and heavily decorated with paint and feathers.

In Australia in the 1960s, [[Peter Scriven]] founded the [[Marionette Theatre of Australia]] and had beautiful marionette productions such as [[The Tintookies]], [[Little Fella Bindi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=163386&amp;search=sad&amp;images=&amp;c=1&amp;s= 98/25/2 Marionette puppet, 'Tintookies Little Fella Bindi', Aboriginal figure, papier mache / wood / cotton / felt / feathers / metal, designed by Colin Garland for the Marionette Theatre of Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 1958-1977 - Powerhouse Museum Collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Explorers]] and [[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]. Bilbar Puppet Theatre, established by [[Barbara Turnbull]] and her husband [[Bill Turnbull (puppeteer)]] toured Australia extensively under the auspices of the [[Queensland Arts Council]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Their puppets are now held at the [[Queensland Performing Arts Centre]], [[Brisbane]]. [[David Poulton]] toured marionette shows via the Queensland Arts Council along his 'Strings and Things' with his wife Sally for many years from the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;'Stutter leads to lifetime with puppets', Sunshine Coast Daily, 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Hamilton (puppeteer)|David Hamilton]], one of the last remaining marionette puppeteers in Australia, tours independently and formerly toured under the auspices of the Queensland Arts Council. Comedian and radio broadcaster [[Jamie Dunn]] was famous for his Muppet-style character, [[Agro (puppet)]] who featured on several [[Seven Network]] television programs throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Formally trained in the [[United States]] by puppeteers from the [[Jim Henson|Jim Henson Company]], [[Brett Hansen]] and his [[Brisbane]] based [[Larrikin Puppets]] company is one of only a few Muppet-style puppeteers actively performing in Australia. [[Cabaret Puppet Theatre]], based in Brisbane's Redlands area, also tours with productions for children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Cabaret Puppet Theatre www.cabaretpuppettheatre.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Melbourne [[Handspan Theatre]] 1977-2002 evolved from humble collective beginnings to evolve a design-rich large theatre format dubbed 'Visual Theatre' and became a hot-house for innovative projects and award-winning multimedia collaborations within Australia and around the world.

[[File:Snuff-scarey-skullies.jpg|[[Snuff Puppets]] Skullies from Scarey|thumb|right]]
A post-graduate course existed at the [[Victorian College of the Arts]], [[University of Melbourne]] in the late 1990s. Australian puppeteer [[Norman Hetherington]] was famous for his marionette, [[Mr. Squiggle]] who featured on an Australian Broadcasting Commission television program for many years from 1 July 1959. The last episode was on 9 July 1999. In every episode he would create several pictures from "squiggles" sent in by children from around the country. [[Richard Bradshaw OAM]] is another famous Australian puppeteer. He is a past President of [[UNIMA Australia]], former artistic director of the Marionette Theatre Company of Australia&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Book of Puppet Theatre'' by David Currell, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; and does shadow puppetry and writing in the field.

[[Rod Hull]] also made a contribution with his puppet [[Emu (puppet)|Emu]]. In the 1960s, Hull presented a children's breakfast television programme in Australia. [[Snuff Puppets]] is one of Australia's modern puppet theatre troupes. Based in [[Melbourne]], their work is full of wild black humour, political and sexual satire and a hand made visually aesthetic. Snuff Puppets has performed in over 15 countries, including tours to major festivals in Asia, South America and Europe. There is an annual winter festival of puppets at the City of Melbourne's ArtPlay and at Federation Square in Melbourne.

From early in the 19th century, puppetry began to inspire artists from the 'high-art' traditions. In 1810, [[Heinrich von Kleist]] wrote an essay 'On the Marionette Theatre', admiring the "lack of self-consciousness" of the puppet. Puppetry developed throughout the 20th century in a variety of ways. Supported by the parallel development of cinema, television and other filmed media it now reaches a larger audience than ever. Another development, starting at the beginning of the century, was the belief that puppet theatre, despite its popular and folk roots, could speak to adult audiences with an adult, and experimental voice, and reinvigorate the high art tradition of actors' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;''Strings, Hands, Shadows: A Modern Puppet History''/John Bell/Chapter 6/Detroit Institute of Art/2000 {{ISBN|0-89558-156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Puppets, a 2002 photo of a lithograph from xerographic direct imaging of two 20th century hand puppets.png|thumb|Puppets, a 2002 photo of a lithograph from xerographic direct imaging of two 20th century hand puppets]]

[[Sergei Obraztsov]] explored the concept of ''kukolnost'' ('puppetness'), despite [[Joseph Stalin]]'s insistence on realism.
Other pioneers, including [[Edward Gordon Craig]] and [[Erwin Piscator]] were influenced by puppetry in their crusade to regalvanise the mainstream. [[Maeterlinck]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], [[Federico García Lorca|Lorca]] and others wrote puppet plays, and artists such as [[Picasso]], [[Alfred Jarry|Jarry]], and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] began to work in theatre.&lt;ref name="blumenthal"/&gt; Craig's concept of the "übermarionette"&amp;mdash;in which the director treats the actors like objects&amp;mdash;has been highly influential on contemporary "object theatre" and "[[physical theatre]]".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[Tadeusz Kantor]] frequently substituted actors for puppets, or combined the two, and conducted each performance from the edge of the stage, in some ways similar to a puppeteer.

Kantor influenced a new formalist generation of directors such as [[Richard Foreman]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] who were concerned with the 'object' in theatrical terms "putting it on stage and finding different ways of looking at it" (Foreman). Innovatory puppeteers such as [[Tony Sarg]], Waldo Lanchester, John Wright, [[Bil Baird]], Joan Baixas, Sergei Obratsov, Philipe Genty, [[Peter Schumann]], [[Dattatreya Aralikatte]], [[Jim Henson]], [[Dadi Pudumjee]], and [[Julie Taymor]] have also continued to develop the forms and content of puppetry, so that the phrase 'puppet theatre' is no longer limited to traditional forms of marionettes, glove, or rod puppets. Directors and companies like Peter Schumann of [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], Bob Frith of [[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]], and Sandy Speiler of [[In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre]] have also combined mask and puppet theatre where the performer, puppets and objects are integrated within a largely visual theatre world that minimises the use of spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;''Experimental Theatre, from Stanislavsky to Peter Brook''/James Roose-Evans, 1970 Studio Vista {{ISBN|0-415-00963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jim Henson Foundation]], founded by puppeteer and [[Muppet]] creator [[Jim Henson]], is a philanthropic, charitable organization created to promote and develop puppetry in the United States. It has bestowed 440 grants to innovative puppet theatre artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Henson Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hensonfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Puppetry troupes in the early 21st-century such as HomeGrown Theatre in [[Boise, Idaho]] continue the [[avant garde]] [[satire|satirical]] tradition for [[millennial]]s.&lt;ref name="Early 21st-century puppetry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/horrific-puppet-affair-finds-humor-in-the-space-between-halloween-and-christmas/Content?oid=8219881 |title=Horrific Puppet Affair Finds Humor in the Space Between Halloween and Christmas  |last=Berry |first=Harrison |date=2017-12-12 |website=Boise Weekly |access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millennial Avant Garde Puppetry"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boiseartsandhistory.org/blog/2017/12/20/creators-makers-and-doers-homegrown-theatre/ |title=Puppetry, Pantomime, &amp; Projections: HomeGrown Theatre's Shortcut to Spectacle |last=Burton |first=Brooke |date=2017-12-20 |website=Boise City Department of Arts &amp; History |access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radical cheerleading''' is a performative style of political activism, derived from mainstream [[cheerleading]]. Radical cheerleading combines elements of peaceful protest or [[non-violent direct action]] with theatrical elements including costuming, spectacle and choreographed dance. Radical cheerleading was created by sisters Cara, Aimee and Colleen Jennings in Miami, Florida, in 1996.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; It grew to become an international movement with squads in the United States, Canada and Europe. Radical cheerleaders create and adapt [[Cheering|cheers]] that promote [[feminism]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nyHS4WyUKEC&amp;lpg=PT158&amp;ots=h1VYipd5FH&amp;dq=radical%20cheerleaders&amp;pg=PT158#v=onepage&amp;q=radical%20cheerleaders&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last=Grindstaff|first=Laura Anne|publisher=SAGE|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-0916-7|location=Los Angeles|page=126|chapter=Cheerleading: The Gender Politics of Contemporary Cheerleading}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Subculture ==
Over time, radical cheerleading developed into a subculture apart from [[cheerleading]]. To understand how radical cheerleading became a culture of its own, it is important to consider the impacts of mainstream cheerleading.

Mainstream cheerleading reached new heights of popularity in the 1990s, as it transformed from a form of entertainment to being understood as an athletic sport. The first Cheerleading World Championship took place in 2001, asserting cheerleading as a competitive sport. Still, cheerleaders were (and often still are) consistently stereotyped as unintelligent, ditzy, and promiscuous, as opposed to true athletes. Regular cheerleaders are often hypersexualized and defined by an idealized female body type. Author Christine Ro writes, "the popular image of cheerleading was still very much of the minimally dressed female cheerleader on the sidelines of a male sports event. This was the image radical cheerleaders seized upon in order to subvert gender messages while serving up peppy support for social justice causes."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/hey-hey-ho-ho-where-did-radical-cheerleaders-go|title=HEY HEY! HO HO! WHERE DID RADICAL CHEERLEADERS GO?|last=Ro|first=Christine|date=August 10, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical cheerleaders reclaimed the identity of the cheerleader and re-shaped mainstream cheerleading to include all bodies, as opposed to certain bodies. They transformed cheerleading from a sideshow into the main event. They shifted the focus of cheerleading from sexualized spectacle to the promotion of larger ideas, like civilian empowerment and political awareness. In these ways, radical cheerleading developed into a distinct culture of its own.

== Gender non-conformity ==
Mainstream cheerleading is marked by heteronormativity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} In contrast, gender non-conformity is a foundation upon which the subculture of radical cheerleading developed. Since its creation, radical cheerleading has been a movement open to all: participants may be male, female, [[transgender]], non-binary or non-gender identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncXeMQUMtPgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=usJqypZj99&amp;dq=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;f=false|title=Cheerleader!: An American Icon|last=Adams|first=Natalie Guice|last2=Bettis|first2=Pamela|publisher=Palgrave|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4039-6184-6|location=New York|pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, radical cheerleaders subvert gender norms through costuming and aesthetics. According to author and radical cheerleader Jeanne Vaccaro, the movement was responsible for "cultivating a queer sensibility."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The subculture’s inclusion of non-gender-conforming individuals creates a space for all bodies, which in turn creates a uniquely accepting community. This is more than just an open-door policy, but an identifying characteristic of the subculture of radical cheerleading, just as relevant to the movement as the leftist messages it asserts.

== Aesthetics ==
Radical cheerleaders reappropriate the aesthetics of cheerleading, sometimes in an ironic fashion. Radical cheerleaders dress in diverse ways. Radical cheerleading is often marked by a DIY aesthetic, with handmade costumes and props. Some radical cheerleaders make [[Pom-pom|pom-poms]] using garbage bags by folding them in half, tying off one side with a rubber band and then cutting strips from the other end. 

Every squad has a unique aesthetic of its own. The Dirty Southern Belles, from Memphis, Tennessee, wear the colors pink and black to cheer for gay pride. The Pirate Cheerleaders, a squad from Milwaukee, wear black skirts with white pleats, and shirts with pirate logos when performing at basement punk shows. The New Paltz Rads, a squad from the State University of New York at New Paltz, sport signature colors black and red.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/were-here-we-cheer-get-used-it-136589|title=We're Here!

== Notable demonstrations ==
[[File:S15 Radical Cheerleading 1.jpg|thumb]]
Radical cheerleaders often perform at political [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], festivals and other feminist events, where they lead protest chants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aR5uGYkTj5UC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=HVwsoN399_&amp;dq=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;f=false|title=Alternative Media and Politics of Resistance: A Communication Perspective|last=Atkinson|first=Joshua D.|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4331-0517-3|location=New York|pages=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical cheerleading is used at demonstrations to promote political messages in a media-friendly, people-friendly way. Radical cheerleaders may also perform on stage at music venues, to bring political issues (as well as entertainment) to an unsuspecting crowd. Chicago's Lickity Split radical cheerleaders frequently used this tactic.

A notable radical cheerleading appearance was at the [[March for Women's Lives]] in [[Washington, DC]] on April 25, 2004. The participants' aim was to raise awareness about the lack of access low-income women have to [[abortion]] clinics.

Another remarkable demonstration took place at a Taco Bell restaurant in Auburn, Alabama in 2001, where radical cheerleaders gathered to protest for fair wages. Dubbed the "Taco Bell Protest," participants explained to police that the purpose of their demonstration was to protest the business relationship between corporate Taco Bell and the Six L's Packing Company, Inc., a firm that pays employees low wages with zero benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/gimme-an-a-6323520|title=Gimme an A!|last=Roe|first=Amy|date=August 2, 2001|work=Broward Palm Beach New Times|access-date=April 2, 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taco Bell Protest serves as an encapsulating example of all that radical cheerleading stands for: peaceful (if not disruptive) demonstration, DIY construction of protest tools/props, an anti-capitalist agenda, and a demand for fair wages, a classic feminist ideal. 

Radical cheerleaders demonstrated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Resistin' Radicatz, a radical cheerleading squad, performed at the 2004 Million Worker March.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cheer content ==
Cheers are usually written from scratch or by rewriting the words of popular and historic songs. The first radical cheer book was published in 1997.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

An example of a radical cheer, led by creator Cara Jennings, performed at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York:

{{Quote|Sound off! I don’t wanna work anymore! What did you say? I said the system doesn’t work anymore! What did you say? I said STOMP, smash the state, Let's liberate, Acknowledge me or go to hell, another womyn to rebel, let's liberate, Stomp, smash the state, let's liberate, organize and raise some hell, act up, unite and rebel!&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;}}

An example of a cheer performed by the Radical Teen Cheer Squad: "We're teens, we're cute, we're radical to boot! We're angry, we're tough, and we have had enough!"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Media ==
While the subculture has received some attention from the media, radical cheerleading receives less media attention than mainstream cheerleading.

In ''Give Me An F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance'', radical cheerleader and Author Jeanne Vaccaro describes the process of archiving radical cheerleading through the examination of cheers, zines, photographs and personal testimony from fellow radical cheerleader Mary Xmas.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/hawksites.newpaltz.edu/dist/1/2245/files/2018/01/Vaccaro_Radical-Cheerleaders-and-Feminist-Performance-289w2x9.pdf|title=Give Me an F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance|last=Vaccaro|first=Jeanne|date=January 2018|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419120655/https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/hawksites.newpaltz.edu/dist/1/2245/files/2018/01/Vaccaro_Radical-Cheerleaders-and-Feminist-Performance-289w2x9.pdf|archive-date=April 19, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech at the National Women's Studies Association in 2004, feminist magazine director [[Lisa Jervis]] placed radical cheerleading within a tradition of playful feminist comment on popular culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In August 2004 the New York City Radical Cheerleaders completed ''Don't Let the System Get You Down—Cheer Up'', a video documentary of the Radical Cheerblock at the March for Women's Lives. The video was released in time to celebrate and honor and inspire the hundreds of radical cheerleaders who converged in New York to protest the Republican National Convention.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Responses ==
Radical cheerleading is a style of performance, and is inherently defined by the element of spectacle. Responses within the media have ranged from positive to negative. Sheila Noone, the editorial director of ''American Cheerleader'' magazine, commented that cheerleaders are involved in an "uphill battle" towards gaining respect,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; asserting that radical cheerleading makes this even more difficult. In contrast, Lauren Jack, member of Harvard University's Cheerleading squad, made the statement that cheerleading is "all about trying to get everyone else excited about your causes, so it's perfect for political activism."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Static trapeze''', also known as '''fixed trapeze''', is a type of circus art performed on the [[trapeze]].  In contrast to the other forms of [[trapeze]], on static trapeze the bars and ropes mainly stay in place.

Most often, the static trapeze is about 1.5 feet wide and the bar is generally 2 inches in diameter.  The ropes are at least two human lengths, as many figures are performed on the ropes above the bar.  The ropes can be made of many materials, including cotton or hemp, and often have a wire woven inside.
It can be performed by a single artist or two partners working together. A single artist will do tricks above and below the bar, the ropes playing just as important a part as the bar. A partner act will involve the partners working together — supporting each other's weight, throwing, lifting and catching each other. 

Self-standing trapezes can be purchased for home use.

[[File:CJ_triple_trapeze_May.jpg|thumb|300px|Triple trapeze at [[Circus Juventas]]]]
'''Multiple trapeze''' is an act entailing the use of more than one [[trapeze]], typically two or three. In these acts, multiple people perform simultaneously.
The most common type of multiple trapeze is a "triple trapeze". A triple trapeze has one long bar, held up by a ropes, basically three trapezes put together, with the middle trapeze sharing the ropes of the other two. Multiple trapeze can also refer to an abstract structure with trapeze like structures, inside which multiple artists may perform.

An experimental cage-like structure was created by  [[Cirque du Soleil]] for their show [[Varekai]], but was ultimately scrapped in production. However, the structure did appear in the 'Making of' documentary, 'Fire Within.'

A '''triple trapeze''' is a type of static (still) [[trapeze]] with three trapezes on one bar. Therefore, there are four ropes connecting this trapeze to its frame, or whatever it is hanging from. Performers specialize in synchronized tricks. One example of a triple trapeze act can be seen in [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s show [[Varekai]].

==Repertoire==
Static trapeze routines are choreographed from a number of standard tricks, movements, and positions, including:

* sitting - generally used to describe sitting on the bar, with your shoulders parallel to the bar, with both legs in front of the bar
* full beats - hanging from the bar with your hands, keeping legs straight and together, bringing feet up to level with the bar and then swinging down, through vertical and back with feet returning up to the level of the bar
* knee beats - hanging from the knees, bringing hands up above the level of the bar, then straightening the body, swinging backward down through the vertical, and back with hands returning above the level of the bar
* catcher's lock (or catches) - hanging upside down, with the bar across the front of the thighs, and the ropes passing inside the bent knees. This is generally a strong position to catch or hold another person (hence the name).

A '''summer park''' is a form of [[amusement park|theme park]] with a [[summer]]time theme, open only during the summertime season. Instead of electricity-generated [[carousel]]s, [[playground]]s and [[swimming pool]] make up most attractions.

In [[Denmark]], several summer parks have been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderful-denmark.com/Jutland-entertainment.html|title=Entertainment in Jutland|publisher=Wonderful Denmark|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sweden]], the phenomenon was booming by the mid and late 1980s. After expanding during the [[Roaring 1980s|economic boom]], a decrease began in the early 1990s during the [[Swedish banking rescue|economc recession]], but also because of the introduction of a wider entertainment market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornmark.se/places_intro.aspx?placeid=98&amp;lang= Övergivna platser - ''Svenska Sommarland]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Exorcist''''' is an American [[horror film|horror]] [[Media franchise|franchise]] consisting of five installments based on the novel ''[[The Exorcist (novel)|The Exorcist]]'', created by [[William Blatty]], and part of [[The Exorcist]] franchise. The films have been distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and [[20th Century Fox]].

The films have grossed over [[United States dollar|$]]661 million at the worldwide box office. Critics have given the films mixed reviews. In 2004, a prequel (''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'') was released. This was the second version of the prequel film made at that time as the first version (directed by [[Paul Schrader]]) was deemed unsatisfactory by the studio upon completion, and the entire project was refilmed by director [[Renny Harlin]]. However, Schrader's version received a limited release in 2005, after Harlin's, and was titled ''[[Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist]]''.     On January 22, 2016, [[20th Century Fox Television]] announced they were developing a [[The Exorcist (TV series)|television series]] of ''The Exorcist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘The Exorcist’ Pilot Ordered at Fox with Modern Twist|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/the-exorcist-tv-series-pilot-fox-1201686653/|last=Prudom|first=Laura|website=Variety.com|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered on September 23, 2016.

===''The Exorcist''===
{{Main|The Exorcist (film)}}
Based on the 1971 novel by [[William Peter Blatty]], ''The Exorcist'' marries three scenarios into one plot.

The film opens with Father Merrin ([[Max von Sydow]]) on an archaeological dig in [[Hatra|Al-hadar]], near [[Nineveh]], in [[Iraq]]. He is alerted that a small carving is found in the dig, resembling a grimacing, bestial creature. After talking to one of his supervisors, he travels to a statue of [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu]]; the small carving resembles the head of the statue. He sees ominous figures and two dogs fight viciously nearby, setting the tone for the rest of the film.

===''Exorcist II: The Heretic''===
{{Main|Exorcist II: The Heretic}}
Father Philip Lamont ([[Richard Burton]]), who is struggling with his faith, is assigned by the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] ([[Paul Henreid]]) to investigate the death of Father Lankester Merrin ([[Max von Sydow]]). Merrin was killed in the first film during the exorcism of [[Regan MacNeil]] ([[Linda Blair]]). The Cardinal informs Lamont (who has had some experience at exorcism, and has been exposed to Merrin's teachings) that Merrin is being investigated posthumously for heresy. Despite approval of the MacNeil exorcism by a bishop, the Church is no longer convinced that MacNeil was truly possessed, and the controversial nature of Merrin's books on the subject are being reconsidered as politically and theologically suspect.

===''The Exorcist III''===
{{Main|The Exorcist III}}
[[Film adaptation|Adapted]] and directed by Blatty from his 1983 novel ''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'', the film stars [[George C. Scott]] and several cast members ([[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]], [[Ed Flanders]], [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] and [[George DiCenzo]]) from Blatty's previous film ''[[The Ninth Configuration]]''. The story takes place 17 years after the events of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and centers on the philosophical police detective William F. Kinderman from the first film. He investigates a series of brutal murders in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] that resemble the ''[[modus operandi]]'' of a serial killer executed about the time of the MacNeil exorcism.

Originally titled '''''Legion''''', the film was drastically changed after rewrites and re-shoots ordered by the studio [[Morgan Creek Productions]].&lt;ref name="A Legion of Interference"&gt;''Fangoria'' #122 (May 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Studio executives demanded the addition of an exorcism sequence, and retitled the film as ''The Exorcist III'' in order to more strongly tie the film to the rest of the franchise. All of the deleted footage is apparently lost.&lt;ref name="tncf"&gt;http://www.theninthconfiguration.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Exorcist: The Beginning''===
{{Main|Exorcist: The Beginning}}
The plot revolves around the crisis of faith suffered by [[Lankester Merrin|Father Merrin]] (Stellan Skarsgård) following the horrific events he witnessed during [[World War II]].

After WWII, Merrin is an [[archaeologist]] in [[Cairo]], when he is approached by a collector of antiquities who asks him to come to a British excavation in the Turkana region of [[Kenya]]. This dig is excavating a [[Christian]] [[Byzantine]] [[Church (building)|church]] from the 5th century—long before Christianity had reached that region. Further, the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after the construction was completed.  Merrin is asked to participate in the dig and find an ancient relic hidden in the ruins before the British do.  Merrin takes the job, but soon discovers that all is not well—something evil lies in the church and is infecting the region.  The local tribesman hired to dig refuse to enter the building, and there are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village.  However, when Merrin, growing suspicious of these rumors, digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, he discovers it is empty.  Meanwhile, the evil grows, turning people against each other and resulting in violence, atrocities, and more bloodshed.

===''Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist''===
{{Main|Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist}}
Many years before the events in ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', the young Father Lankester Merrin (played by Skarsgård, who played the same part in the ''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'') travels to [[East Africa]]. Merrin has taken a sabbatical from the Church and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in small village in occupied Holland during [[World War II]], where he served as parish priest. Near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter.

He meets up with a team of archaeologists, who are seeking to unearth a church that they believe has been buried for centuries. At first, Merrin resists the idea that supernatural forces are in play, but eventually helps them, and the ensuing events result in an encounter with [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu]], the same demon referenced in ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.

==Cut scenes==

===The "spider-walk scene"===
[[Contortionist]] Linda R. Hager was hired to perform the infamous "spider-walk scene" that was filmed on April 11, 1973. Friedkin deleted the scene just prior to the original December 26, 1973 release date because he felt it was ineffective technically. However, with advanced developments in digital media technology, Friedkin worked with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] artists to make the scene look more convincing for the 2000 theatrically re-released version of ''The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen''. Since the original release, myths and rumors still exist that a variety of spider-walk scenes were filmed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://captainhowdy.com/?page_id=38&amp;xdforum_action=viewthread&amp;xf_id=1&amp;xt_id=888&amp;pstart=0# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-09-05 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707002215/http://captainhowdy.com/?page_id=38&amp;xdforum_action=viewthread&amp;xf_id=1&amp;xt_id=888&amp;pstart=0# |archive-date=2012-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite Friedkin's insistence that no alternate version was ever shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.zoom.co.uk/the.exorcist/Html/friedkin_faqs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427112721/http://pages.zoom.co.uk/the.exorcist/Html/friedkin_faqs.htm |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Warner Brothers re-released the [[digitally remastered]] DVD of ''The Exorcist: 25th Anniversary Special Edition''. This DVD includes the special feature BBC documentary, ''The Fear of God: The Making of The Exorcist,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,666953,00.html Collectors' Tribute to the Film that Frightened the World!!! The Exorcist 25th Anniversary Special Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the never-before-seen original non-bloody version of the spider-walk scene. The updated "bloody version" of the spider-walk scene appears in the 2000 re-release of ''The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen'' utilizing CGI technology to incorporate the special effect of blood pouring from Regan's mouth during this scene’s finale.

===''The Exorcist III''===

Despite his misgivings about the studio-imposed reshoots, Blatty is proud of the finished version of ''The Exorcist III'', having said, “It’s still a superior film. And in my opinion, and excuse me if I utter heresy here, but for me it’s a more frightening film than ''The Exorcist''."&lt;ref name="TEOTS"&gt;''The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows'' (Omnibus Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Blatty had hoped to recover the deleted footage from the Morgan Creek vaults so that he might re-assemble the original cut of the film which he said was "rather different" from what was released, and a version of the film fans of the ''Exorcist'' series have been clamouring for. In 2007, Blatty's wife reported on a [[fan site]] that "My husband tells me that it is Morgan Creek's claim that they have lost all the footage, including an alternate opening scene in which Kinderman views the body of Karras in the morgue, right after his fall down the steps." Mark Kermode has stated that the search for the missing footage is "ongoing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/markkermode/2009/01/more_points_of_you_part_two.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An upcoming book titled ''The Evolution Of William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist III: From Concept To Novel To Screen'' by author Erik Kristopher Myers will reveal the whole story behind the film's development, and publish never-before-seen images, the original script, studio notes, various drafts of the story as it has evolved, and interviews with Blatty, Brad Dourif, Mark Kermode, John Carpenter, and many others associated with the film.&lt;ref name="tncf"/&gt; Myers in an interview said that ''The Exorcist III'' "has sort of turned into horror genre’s equivalent to [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', in that it was originally a very classy film that the studio hacked apart and turned into a commercial piece [...] I'm basically trying to chronicle how a film can get away from the auteur and be transformed into a purely commercial product." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cincity2000.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1546&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708154034/http://www.cincity2000.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1546&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Upon its release on December 26, 1973, the film received mixed reviews from critics, “ranging from ‘classic’ to ‘claptrap'."&lt;ref name="Travers"&gt;Travers, Peter and Rieff, Stephanie. ''The Story Behind ‘The Exorcist’'', Pg. 149, Signet Books, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0-451-06207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Kauffmann]], in ''[[The New Republic]]'', wrote, “This is the most scary film I’ve seen in years — the ''only'' scary film I’ve seen in years…If you want to be shaken — and I found out, while the picture was going, that that’s what I wanted — then ''The Exorcist'' will scare the hell out of you.”&lt;ref name="Kauffmann"&gt;Kauffmann, Stanley. ''New Republic'' review reprinted in ''The Story Behind ‘The Exorcist’'', written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 152 - 154, Signet Books, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0-451-06207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that it was “an expert telling of a supernatural horror story…The climactic sequences assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790769.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;query=The+Exorcist |title=The Exorcist|accessdate=2007-11-03|first=|last=|work=Variety | date=January 1, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Castle of Frankenstein]]'', [[Joe Dante]] opined, “[A]n amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic.  Director William Friedkin’s film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see…Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this on the screen before.”&lt;ref name="Dante"&gt;Dante, Joe.  ''Castle of Frankenstein'', Vol 6, No. 2 (Whole Issue #22), pgs. 32-33. Review of ''The Exorcist''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Vincent Canby]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', dismissed ''The Exorcist'' as “a chunk of elegant occultist claptrap…[A] practically impossible film to sit through…it establishes a new low for grotesque special effects...”&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;Canby, Vincent.  ''The New York Times'' review reprinted in ''The Story Behind ‘The Exorcist’'', written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 150 - 152, Signet Books, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0-451-06207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Sarris]] complained that “Friedkin’s biggest weakness is his inability to provide enough visual information about his characters…whole passages of the movie’s exposition were one long buzz of small talk and name droppings…''The Exorcist'' succeeds on one level as an effectively excruciating entertainment, but on another, deeper level it is a thoroughly evil film.”&lt;ref name="Sarris"&gt;Sarris, Andrew. ''[[Village Voice]]'' review reprinted in ''The Story Behind ‘The Exorcist’'', written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 154–158, Signet Books, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0-451-06207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Jon Landau]] felt the film was, “[N]othing more than a religious porn film, the gaudiest piece of shlock this side of [[Cecil B. DeMille]] (minus that gentleman’s wit and ability to tell a story) …”&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;Landau, Jon. ''Rolling Stone'' review reprinted in ''The Story Behind ‘The Exorcist’'', written by Peter Travers and Stephanie Rieff, pgs. 158 - 162, Signet Books, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0-451-06207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, ''The Exorcist''{{’}}s critical reputation has grown considerably. The film currently has an 85% "Certified Fresh" approval rating on the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] website, based on 40 reviews the website collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/exorcist/ |title=''The Exorcist" (1973)|accessdate=2007-11-03|first=|last=|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some critics regard it as being one of the best and most effective [[horror film]]s; admirers say the film balances a stellar script, gruesome effects, and outstanding performances. However, the movie has its detractors as well, including [[Kim Newman]] who has criticized it for messy plot construction, conventionality and overblown pretentiousness, among other perceived defects. Writer [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] provides an extended negative critique in his book length essay ''[[The Devil Finds Work]]''.

'''II:''' Stephen H. Scheuer wrote that ''Exorcist II'' “may just well be the worst sequel in the history of films – a stupefying, boring, vapid and ''non-scary'' follow-up to the box-office champ of 1973...''Exorcist II'' is a disaster on every level – a sophomoric script, terrible editing, worst direction by John Boorman, inevitably coupled with silly acting. In one scene that typifies this lamentable sci-fi horror pic, [Richard] Burton and [James Earl] Jones, two splendid actors, are spouting inane dialogue while Jones is outfitted like a witch doctor.”&lt;ref&gt;Steven H. Scheuer, ''Movies on TV'' (Bantam Books, 1977), p.224&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leslie Halliwell]] described the film as a “highly unsatisfactory psychic melodrama which...falls flat on its face along some wayward path of metaphysical and religious fancy. It was released in two versions and is unintelligible in either.”&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Halliwell, ''Halliwell’s Film Guide: Fifth Edition'' (HarperCollins, 1995), p.370&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] described the film as a “preposterous sequel...Special effects are the only virtue in this turkey.”&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Maltin, ''Leonard Maltin’s 2009 Movie Guide'' (Plume, 2008) p.427&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danny Peary]] dismissed  ''Exorcist II'' as “absurd.”&lt;ref&gt;Danny Peary, ''Guide for the Film Fanatic'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986) p.143&lt;/ref&gt;

While most reviewers responded negatively to the film, [[Pauline Kael]] greatly preferred Boorman's sequel to the original, writing in her review in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that ''Exorcist II'' "had more visual magic than a dozen movies." Since ''Exorcist II's'' initial release, some notable critics and directors have praised the film. [[Kim Newman]] wrote in ''Nightmare Movies'' (1988) that "it doesn't work in all sorts of ways... However, like [[Ennio Morricone|Ennio Morricone's]] mix of tribal and liturgical music, it does manage to be very interesting." Director [[Martin Scorsese]] asserted, "The picture asks: Does great goodness bring upon itself great evil? This goes back to the [[Book of Job]]; it's God testing the good. In this sense, Regan ([[Linda Blair]]) is a modern-day saint — like [[Ingrid Bergman]] in ''[[Europa '51]]'', and in a way, like Charlie in ''[[Mean Streets]]''. I like the first ''Exorcist'', because of the [[Catholic guilt]] I have, and because it scared the hell out of me; but ''The Heretic'' surpasses it. Maybe Boorman failed to execute the material, but the movie still deserved better than it got."&lt;ref name="Scorsese"&gt;Scorsese, Martin. "Martin Scorsese´s Guility Pleasures", ''[[Film Comment]]'', September/October 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Bob McCabe's book ''The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows'' contains a chapter on the film in which Linda Blair said the movie "was one of the big disappointments of my career,"&lt;ref name="Linda Blair 1999 p.165"&gt;Linda Blair, cited in Bob McCabe, ‘’The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows’’ (Omnibus Press, 1999), p.165&lt;/ref&gt; and John Boorman confessed that “The sin I committed was not giving the audience what it wanted in terms of horror...There’s this wild beast out there which is the audience. I created this arena and I just didn’t throw enough Christians into it. People think of cutting and re-cutting as defeat, but it isn’t. As Irving Thalberg said: ‘Films aren’t made, they’re remade.’”&lt;ref&gt;John Boorman, cited in Bob McCabe, ''The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows'' (Omnibus Press, 1999), p.164&lt;/ref&gt; McCabe himself offered no one answer as to why ''Exorcist II'' failed: "Who knows where the blame ultimately lies. Boorman's illness and constant revising of the script can't have helped, but these events alone are not enough to explain the film's almighty failure. Boorman has certainly gone on to produce some fine work subsequently...When a list was compiled to find the fifty worst films of all time, ''Exorcist II: The Heretic'' came in at number two. It was beaten only by [[Ed Wood]]'s ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', a film that generally receives a warmer response from its audience than this terribly misjudged sequel."&lt;ref&gt;Bob McCabe, ‘’The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows’’ (Omnibus Press, 1999), p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

'''III:''' The film met with mixed reviews. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer Vincent Canby said "''The Exorcist III'' is a better and funnier (intentionally) movie than either of its predecessors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE2D81339F93BA2575BC0A966958260 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630054513/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE2D81339F93BA2575BC0A966958260 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=June 30, 2012 | work=The New York Times | first=Vincent | last=Canby | title=Review/Film; Leaving the Devil Out in the Cold | date=August 18, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British film critic [[Mark Kermode]] called it "a restrained, haunting chiller which stimulates the adrenalin and intellect alike."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64113/the-exorcist-iii.html&lt;/ref&gt; However Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave a negative review, stating "If Part II sequels are generally disappointing, Part IIIs are often much, much worse. It can seem as if nothing is going on in them except dim murmurings about the original movie—murmurings that mostly remind you of what isn't being delivered." Gleiberman called ''The Exorcist III'' "an ash-gray disaster" and that it "has the feel of a nightmare catechism lesson, or a horror movie made by a depressed monk.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318049,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=Movie Review: The Exorcist III}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Newman]] claimed that "The major fault in ''Exorcist III'' is the house-of-cards plot that is constantly collapsing."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=2881&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Thomas of ''Los Angeles Times'' gave a mixed review, saying ''Exorcist III'' "doesn't completely work but offers much more than countless, less ambitious films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-20/entertainment/ca-827_1_exorcist-iii | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Movie Reviews | first=Kevin | last=Thomas | date=August 20, 1990 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Matrix''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[action film|action]] [[media franchise]] created by [[The Wachowski Brothers]]&lt;!--Credited as "The Wachowski Brothers". Do not change without consensus. See [[Talk:The Matrix#"The Wachowskis" vs "The Wachowski Brothers"]]. --&gt;, about heroes who fight a desperate war against machine overlords that have enslaved humanity in an extremely sophisticated [[virtual reality]] system. The series is most notable for its two uses of slow motion, which revolutionized action films to come. 

The series began with the feature film ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999), and continued with two sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' (both 2003), all written and directed by The Wachowskis and produced by [[Joel Silver]]. The franchise is owned by [[Warner Bros.]], which distributed the films along with [[Village Roadshow Pictures]]. The latter, along with [[Silver Pictures]] are the two production companies that worked on all three films.

The first film was an important critical and commercial success, winning four [[Academy Awards]], introducing [[popular culture]] symbols such as the [[red pill and blue pill]], and [[The Matrix#Legacy|influencing action filmmaking]]. For those reasons it has been added to the [[National Film Registry]] for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing - National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs {{!}} Library of Congress|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first sequel was an even bigger commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film in history,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Matrix Revolutions Ignites Global Box Office Revolution with $204 Million Opening, Setting a New Record for the Biggest Consecutive 5-Day Opening of All Time {{!}} WarnerMedia|url=http://www.warnermediagroup.com/newsroom/press-releases/2003/11/09/the-matrix-revolutions-ignites-global-box-office-revolution-with|website=www.warnermediagroup.com|accessdate=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Looking back at the Matrix sequels|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/the-matrix/30733/looking-back-at-the-matrix-sequels|work=Den of Geek|accessdate=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a title which it held for 13 years, until it was surpassed by the film [[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=‘Deadpool’ Overtakes ‘Matrix Reloaded’ as Highest-Grossing R-Rated Movie|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/box-office/deadpool-box-office-biggest-r-rated-movie-1201740907/|work=Variety|date=March 29, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2018|language=en-US|first=Brent|last=Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series features a [[cyberpunk]] story of the technological fall of man, in which a self-aware artificial intelligence has wiped most of humanity from the Earth except for those it enslaves in a virtual reality system as a farmed power source, and the relatively few remaining humans who are free of that system. The A.I. agenda is to destroy all humans who are free, considering them a threat/disease.  The story incorporates references to numerous philosophical and religious ideas. Influences include the principles of [[mythology]], [[anime]], and [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action films]] (particularly "[[heroic bloodshed]]" and [[martial arts film|martial arts]] movies). Consistent throughout are the concepts of inter-dependency and love.

The characters and settings of the films are further explored in other media set in the same [[fictional universe]], including animation, comics, and video games. The comic "Bits and Pieces of Information" and ''[[The Animatrix]]'' short film [[The Animatrix#.22The Second Renaissance Part I.22|"The Second Renaissance"]] act as prequels to the films, explaining how the franchise's setting came to be. The video game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' connects the story of the ''Animatrix'' short [[The Animatrix#"Final Flight of the Osiris"|"Final Flight of the Osiris"]] with the events of ''Reloaded'', while the video game ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' is a direct sequel to ''Revolutions''.

As of February 2016, the franchise has generated $3&amp;nbsp;billion in revenue, making it one of the [[List of the highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramascreen.com/international-buyers-put-blooms-suburbicon-on-the-map-paramount-pictures-acquires-the-u-s-rights/|title=International Buyers Put BLOOM’s "Suburbicon" On The Map. Paramount Pictures Acquires The U.S. Rights|website=ramascreen.com|date=February 15, 2016|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, it was reported that Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with new films.

==Setting==
The series depicts a future in which Earth is dominated by artificial intelligence that was created early in the 21st century and [[AI takeover|rebelled against humanity]]. At one point, humans attempted to block out the machines' source of [[solar power]] by covering the sky in thick, stormy clouds. During this time, the machines and mankind were engaged in a massive war in which the machines ultimately emerged the victor. Having no definite source of energy, the machines devised a way to extract humans' [[bioelectricity]] and [[thermal energy]] by growing people in pods, while their minds are controlled by [[cybernetic implant]]s connecting them to a [[simulated reality]] called the Matrix.

The virtual reality world simulated by the Matrix resembles human civilization around the turn of the 21st century (this time period was chosen because it is supposedly the pinnacle of human civilization). The majority of the stories in the ''Matrix'' franchise take place in a vast [[Western World]] unnamed megacity. This environment is practically indistinguishable from reality (although scenes set within the Matrix are presented on-screen with a green tint to the footage, and a general bias towards the color green), and the majority of bluepills - humans connected to the Matrix - are unaware of its true nature. Most of the central characters in the series are able to gain [[superhuman]] abilities within the Matrix by taking advantage of their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its virtual [[physical law]]s.

The virtual world is first introduced in ''[[The Matrix]]''. The ''[[The Animatrix|Animatrix]]'' short film "[[The Second Renaissance]]" and the short comic ''Bits and Pieces of Information'' show how the initial conflict between humans and machines came about, and how and why the Matrix was first developed. Its history and purpose are further explained in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''.

The ''Matrix'' series includes a trilogy of feature films, all of which were written and directed by [[The Wachowskis]] and produced by [[Joel Silver]], starring [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] and [[Hugo Weaving]]. The series was filmed in [[Australia]] and began with 1999's ''[[The Matrix]]'', which depicts the recruitment of hacker [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] into humanity's rebellion against sentient machines. The film was highly successful, earning $460 million worldwide, and becoming the first DVD release in the United States to reach sales of three million copies.&lt;ref name="dvdsales"&gt;''{{cite web|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_press_August_01_00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305104849/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_press_August_01_00.html|archivedate=March 5, 2008|title=Press release – August 1, 2000 – The Matrix DVD: The first to sell 3 million|publisher=Warner Bros., Inc.|work=Whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com|location=Burbank|date=August 1, 2000|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's mainstream success had backed up the initial idea of making a trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1999/voices/columns/reeves-helmers-near-pricey-matrix-sequels-1117750684/|title=Reeves, helmers near pricey ‘Matrix’ sequels|first=Michael|last=Fleming|date=August 24, 1999|work=variety.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', were filmed simultaneously during one [[filmmaking#Production|shoot]] (under the project codename "The Burly Man"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html|title=MATRIX2|first=Steve|last=Silberman|work=wired.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released in two parts in 2003. They tell the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] by a vast machine army. Neo also learns more about the history of the Matrix and his role as The One. The sequels also incorporate more ambitious action scenes and visual effects.

=== Future ===
While making the ''Matrix'' films, the Wachowskis told their close collaborators that at that time they had no intention of making another one after ''The Matrix Revolutions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/content/article/?id=107|title=Don Davis - Interview|work=soundtrack.net|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/11/1052591672027.html|title=Love bug bites the new Matrix - smh.com.au|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2003/11/14/next-neo-thing/amp/|title=Next Neo Thing|date=November 14, 2003|work=ew.com|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dailyhaggis.com/2003/10/28/new-matrix-games-on-the-way/&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, in interviews promoting ''[[Jupiter Ascending]]'', Lilly Wachowski called a return to ''The Matrix'' a "particularly repelling idea in these times", noting the studios' tendency to green-light sequels, reboots, and adaptations over original material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/wachowskis-unfazed-by-negativity-ahead-of-jupiter-ascending-launch-1.1751638|title=Wachowskis unfazed by negativity ahead of 'Jupiter Ascending' launch|first=Derrik J.|last=Lang|work=timescolonist.com|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Lana Wachowski, addressing rumors about a potential [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], said they haven't heard anything, but she believed the studio might be looking to replace them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/wachowskis-jupiter-ascending-interview/|title=The Wachowskis Talk JUPITER ASCENDING, Creating the Chicago Sequence, SENSE8, and More|date=February 4, 2015|work=collider.com|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise, with [[Zak Penn]] in talks to write a treatment, and interest in getting [[Michael B. Jordan]] attached to star. According to the article neither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved at that stage, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/matrix-reboot-works-at-warner-bros-986292|title='The Matrix' Reboot in the Works at Warner Bros.

== ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'' ==
In 2004, [[Warner Home Video]] released ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'', a ten-disc set of the films on [[DVD]]. It included all three films, ''[[The Animatrix]]'', and six discs of additional material, including the documentary film ''[[The Matrix Revisited]]'', the live action footage shot for ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'', and a promotional compilation of ''[[The Matrix Online]]''. For this release, ''The Matrix'' was remastered under the supervision of the Wachowskis and Bill Pope to improve its picture quality and make its coloring closer to that of its sequels. At the request of the Wachowskis, as they explain in a written statement that accompanies the boxset, each of the three films is accompanied by two audio commentaries, one by philosophers who liked the films, and another by critics who did not, with the intention that viewers use them as reference points to form their own opinion. A ''Limited Edition'' of ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'' was also released. It encases the ten discs plus a [[resin]] bust of Neo inside an [[acrylic glass]] box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13432/ultimate-matrix-collection-limited-edition-the/|title=The Ultimate Matrix Collection: Limited Edition|work=dvdtalk.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Ultimate Matrix Collection'' was later also released on [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The HD DVD release added a picture-in-picture video commentary to the three films and the extras the original standalone DVD releases of the films had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/301/matrix_umc.html|title=The Ultimate Matrix Collection HD DVD Review - High-Def Digest|work=highdefdigest.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blu-ray release presented ''The Animatrix'' in high definition for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/300/matrix_umc.html|title=The Ultimate Matrix Collection Blu-ray Review - High Def Digest|work=highdefdigest.com|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical and public response===

While ''The Matrix'' received largely positive reviews, and ''The Matrix Reloaded'' received generally positive reviews,&lt;ref name="rt-matrix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rt-reloaded"/&gt; the critical response to ''The Matrix Revolutions'' was mixed.&lt;ref name="rt-revolutions" /&gt; One major complaint was that it did not give any answers to the questions raised in ''Reloaded''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/reviews/n_9482/index1.html|title=Naval Gazing|work=nymag.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the series an average grade of "A−", "B+", "B" respectively on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="Mcs" /&gt;

And we were like, 'Well, can the audience go through the three movies and experience something similar to what the main character experiences?'&lt;br&gt;So the first movie is sort of typical in its approach. The second movie is deconstructionist, and it assaults all of the things that you thought to be true in the first movie, and so people get very upset, and they're like 'Stop attacking me!' in the same way that people get upset with [[deconstruction|deconstructionist philosophy]]. I mean, [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] and [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], these people upset us. And then the third movie is the most ambiguous, because it asks you to actually participate in the construction of meaning.}}

The ''Matrix'' films makes numerous references to films and literature, and to historical myths and philosophy including [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Messianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[existentialism]], [[obscurantism]], and [[nihilism]]. The films' premise resembles [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave|Allegory of the cave]], [[René Descartes]]'s [[evil demon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reflections on the [[Phenomenon]] versus the [[Noumenon|Ding an sich]], [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'s "[[Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly]]", Marxist social theory and the [[brain in a vat]] thought experiment. Many references to [[Jean Baudrillard]]'s ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' appear in the first film. Baudrillard himself considered this a misrepresentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |title=IJBS |date=October 21, 2010 |work=archive.org |accessdate=March 31, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021010544/http://www.ubishops.ca/BaudrillardStudies/vol2_2/rovira.htm |archivedate=October 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although Lana Wachowski claims the point the reference was making was misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARoKJ00cEZ8|title=Andy Wachowski and Lana Wachowski|first=|last=DePaul Visiting Artists Series|date=May 2, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2017|via=YouTube| time=01:11:34}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similarities to [[cyberpunk]] works such as ''[[Neuromancer]]'' by [[William Gibson]],&lt;ref name="gibson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/English/theory/postmodernism/plans/postmodplansmatrix.html|title=Postmodernism Lesson Plans: The Matrix and Neuromancer|work=purdue.edu|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has described ''The Matrix'' as "arguably the ultimate 'cyberpunk' artifact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/archive/2003_01_28_archive.asp#90244012|title=THE MATRIX: FAIR COP|authorlink=William Gibson|last=Gibson|first=William|work=The William Gibson Blog|date=January 28, 2003|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese director [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' was a strong influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warnervideo.com/matrixevents/wachowski.html|title=Home|work=warnervideo.com|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Joel Silver]] has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for ''The Matrix'' by showing him that anime and saying, "We wanna do that for real."&lt;ref name="silver-anime-1"&gt;[[Joel Silver]], interviewed in "Scrolls to Screen: A Brief History of Anime" featurette on ''[[The Animatrix]]'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="silver-anime-2"&gt;[[Joel Silver]], interviewed in "Making ''The Matrix''" featurette on the ''Matrix'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitsuhisa Ishikawa]] of [[Production I.G]], which produced ''Ghost in the Shell'', noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, "... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that ''The Matrix'' is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios." He stated that since ''Ghost in the Shell'' had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a "promotional tool."&lt;ref name="south bank show"&gt;[[Mitsuhisa Ishikawa]], interviewed in ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', episode broadcast February 19, 2006 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100528022243/http://www.itv.com/page.asp?partid=2701]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities to the 1985 anime film ''[[Megazone 23]]'' have also been noticed, but the Wachowskis claimed to have never seen it.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/larryandychat.html |title=ONLINE CHAT - Larry &amp; Andy Wachowski |date=February 13, 2010 |work=archive.org |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213041503/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/larryandychat.html |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have commented on similarities between ''The Matrix'' and other late-1990s films such as ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'', ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'', and ''[[The Truman Show]]''.&lt;ref name="rogerebert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990331/REVIEWS/903310303/1023|title=The Matrix|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times|suntimes.com]]|quote="The Matrix" recycles the premises of "Dark City" and "Strange Days,"...|date=March 31, 1999|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="channel4review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=105863|title=The Matrix (1999) - Film Review from FilmFour|work=[[Film4]]|publisher=[[Channel Four Television Corporation]]|quote=The film is a perfect product of its time. It is a very modern conspiracy thriller, a film based, like The Truman Show, on the appealingly terrifying notion of a universal conspiracy - that life itself and everything that we know and take for granted are lies. It's also a film steeped in the traditionals of Japanese anime and megamixed philosophy and semiotics (spot the Baudrillard references kids).|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525142638/http://www.film4.com/reviews/1999/the-matrix|archivedate=May 25, 2010|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rowley review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sterow.com/?p=229 |title=What Was the Matrix? |author=Rowley, Stephen |date=June 18, 2003|work=sterow.com|quote=The Matrix was the third in a cycle of movies to arrive in the late nineties with a strikingly similar theme. Like its predecessors from the previous year, Dark City and The Truman Show, it tells the story of a seemingly ordinary man who suddenly finds that his whole life is faked: he is trapped in an artificially created environment designed to keep him in submission. Like the heroes of those earlier movies, Keanu Reeves' Neo starts to realise that he is somehow special, and tries to escape the confines of his prison.|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wachowskis claimed no influence regarding ''Dark City'', but commented about it and ''The Truman Show'' that they thought it was "very strange that Australia came to have three films associated with it that were all about the nature of reality.".&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

Comparisons have also been made to [[Grant Morrison]]'s comic series ''[[The Invisibles]]''; Morrison believes that the Wachowskis essentially plagiarized his work to create the film.&lt;ref name="grantmorrison"&gt;[http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/002657.html "Poor Mojo Newswire: Suicide Girls Interview with Grant Morrison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628091125/http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/002657.html |date=June 28, 2009 }}." URL retrieved July 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wachowskis have responded that they enjoy the comic but weren't inspired by it.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

In addition, the similarity of the films' central concept to a device in the long-running series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' has also been noted. As in the film, the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]] of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Condon, Paul. ''The Matrix Unlocked''. 2003. Contender. p.141-3. {{ISBN|1-84357-093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''Matrix'' film features numerous references to the "[[White Rabbit]]", the "Rabbit Hole" and mirrors, referring to [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,22971,00.html|title=Popular Metaphysics|first=Richard|last=Corliss|date=April 11, 1999|publisher=|accessdate=April 1, 2017|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.org"/

[[Matrixism]] is a [[new religious movement]] inspired by the trilogy. A [[sociologist of religion]] [[Adam Possamai]] describes these types of religions/spiritualities as hyper-real religions due to their eclectic mix of religion/spirituality with elements of [[popular culture]] and their connection to the fluid [[social structures]] of [[late capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.cst.ebooks.datasheet&amp;id=14609 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807055343/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.cst.ebooks.datasheet&amp;id=14609 |archivedate=August 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about whether followers of Matrixism are indeed serious about their practice; however, the religion (real or otherwise) has received attention in the media.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Theyre-all-god-movies/2005/05/18/1116361618786.html|title=They're all god movies, in mysterious ways - National - smh.com.au|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/080615/Mirror/mirror006.html|title=The Sunday Times Sri Lanka|work=sundaytimes.lk|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Wachowskis' [[coming out]] as [[transgender women]] some years after the release of the films, the first film and the pill analogy have also been analyzed in the context of the Wachowskis transgender experiences. In this case, taking the red pill and living out of the Matrix symbolizes exploring one's own [[gender identity]], starting the transition and [[coming out]] as transgender, as opposed to a continued life in the closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@BootlegGirl/bootlegging-the-matrix-ccb8d6442778|title=Bootlegging the Matrix: In Which Bootleg Girl Explains the Matrix Sequels|author=Dr. Eleanor A.

==Legal claims==
In April 2003 Sophia Stewart filed a legal [[complaint]] in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] alleging that the idea of ''[[The Matrix]]'' (and the 1984 film ''[[The Terminator]]'')  were [[plagiarized]] from her own [[film treatment]] entitled "The Third Eye."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=Madison|title=Inside The Billion Dollar Matrix Lawsuit, One of the Internet’s Most Pervasive Legends|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/22/inside-the-billion-dollar-matrix-lawsuit-one-of-the-internets-most-pervasive-hoaxes/|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiewire1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seewood|first1=Andre|title=Sophia Stewart: "The Matrix" Lawsuit – Conspiracy Or Hoax?|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2011/12/sophia-stewart-the-matrix-lawsuit-conspiracy-or-hoax-149399/|website=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court allowed the lawsuit to move forward in 2005,&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Corey|title='Matrix' Lawsuit to Move Forward|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4664150|website=[[NPR]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=24 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Stewart did not attend the hearing. In a 53-page ruling, Judge Margaret Morrow dismissed the case, stating that Stewart and her attorneys "had not entered any evidence to bolster its key claims or demonstrated any striking similarity between her work and the accused directors’ films." &lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=Kemp|title=The Billion-Dollar Myth|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/31/magazine/tm-mothermatrix31|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=31 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ruling, the case became the subject of "Internet legend," with many sources claiming Stewart had actually won the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="indiewire2"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sergio|title=Why Won’t That Story About Sophia Stewart And Her ‘Matrix’ Lawsuit Die?|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2013/04/why-wont-that-story-about-sophia-stewart-and-her-matrix-lawsuit-die-136356/|website=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sophia Stewart Matrix Lawsuit|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/matrix.asp|website=[[Snopes.com]]|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=8 Aug 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Thomas Althouse filed suit in California federal court alleging that ideas for the sequels ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' came from a screenplay he wrote called ''The Immortals.'' In a [[summary judgement]] for the [[defendant]]s, Judge R.

===Animation===
{{Main|The Animatrix}}
In acknowledgment of the strong influence of Japanese [[anime]] on the ''Matrix'' series, ''[[The Animatrix]]'' was produced in 2003 to coincide with the release of ''The Matrix Reloaded''. This is a collection of nine animated short films intended to further flesh out the concepts, history, characters and setting of the series. The objective of ''The Animatrix'' project was to give other writers and directors the opportunity to lend their voices and interpretation to the ''Matrix'' universe; the Wachowskis conceived of and oversaw the process, and they wrote four of the segments themselves, although they were given to other directors to execute. Many of the segments were produced by notable figures from the world of [[Japanese animation]]. Four of the films were originally released on the series' official website, one was shown in cinemas with ''[[Dreamcatcher (2003 film)|Dreamcatcher]]'', one was shown on MTV, MTV2, MTV3, MTV4, and Syfi, and the others first appeared with the DVD release of all nine shorts shortly after the release of ''The Matrix Reloaded''.

===Video games===
On May 15, 2003, the game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' was released in North America concurrently with ''The Matrix Reloaded''. The first of three video games related to the films, it told a story running parallel to ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and featured scenes that were shot during the filming of ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and ''The Matrix Revolutions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/20/technology/from-projector-to-polygons-a-thin-line-between-film-and-joystick.html|title=A Thin Line Between Film And Joystick|date=February 20, 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more ''The Matrix'' video games were released in 2005.

'''''The Monkees''''' is an American [[situation comedy]] that aired on [[NBC]] from September 12, 1966 to March 25, 1968. The series follows the adventures of four young men ([[the Monkees]]) trying to make a name for themselves as a rock 'n roll band. The show introduced a number of innovative new-wave film techniques to series television and won two [[Emmy Award]]s in [[19th Primetime Emmy Awards|1967]], including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]. The program ended on [[Labor Day]] 1968 at the finish of its second season and has received a long afterlife through Saturday morning repeats (CBS and ABC) and syndication, as well as overseas broadcasts; it later enjoyed a 1980s revival, after [[MTV]] aired reruns of the program in 1986.

==Overview==
{{Main|List of The Monkees episodes}}
{{:List of The Monkees episodes}}

The series centered on the adventures of the Monkees, a struggling rock band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] consisting of Micky, Davy, Michael, and Peter. The comic elements of the storyline were provided by the strange and often [[surreal humour|surreal]] encounters that the band would have while searching for their big break.

==Production==

===Conception and casting===
In the early 1960s, aspiring filmmakers [[Bob Rafelson]] and [[Bert Schneider]] had formed [[Raybert Productions]] and were trying to get a foot in the door in Hollywood. They were inspired by the Beatles' film [[A Hard Day's Night (film)|''A Hard Day's Night'']] and decided to develop a television series about a fictional rock and roll group.&lt;ref name="LefcowitzPage7-8"&gt;Lefcowitz (1985), pp.6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Raybert sold the series idea to Screen Gems in April, 1965,&lt;ref name="SandovalPage23"&gt;Sandoval (2005), p.23&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Mazursky]] and [[Larry Tucker (screenwriter)|Larry Tucker]] completed a pilot script by August entitled "The Monkeys".&lt;ref name="SandovalPage25"&gt;Sandoval (2005), p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Rafelson has said that he had the idea for a TV series about a music group as early as 1960, but had a hard time interesting anyone in it until 1965, by which time rock and roll music was firmly entrenched in pop culture.

Trade publications ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' ran an ad on September 8, 1965 seeking "Folk &amp; Roll Musicians-Singers for acting roles in new TV series." As many as 400 hopefuls showed up to be considered as one of "4 insane boys."&lt;ref name="SandovalPage26"&gt;Sandoval (2005), p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen actors from the audition pool were brought back for screen tests,&lt;ref name="MonkeesVHSBox"&gt;Documents reproduced in booklet of VHS box set, Rhino Records, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and Raybert chose their final four after audience research.

[[Micky Dolenz]], son of screen actor [[George Dolenz]], had prior screen experience under the name "Mickey Braddock" as the 10-year-old star of the ''[[Circus Boy]]'' series in the 1950s. He was actively auditioning for pilots at the time and was told about the Raybert project by his agent.&lt;ref name="SandovalPage26"/&gt;

Englishman [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] was a former jockey who had achieved some initial success on the musical stage, appearing with the cast of ''[[Oliver!]]'' on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' the night of the Beatles' live American debut. He was appearing in Columbia Pictures productions and recording for the [[Colpix]] record label and had been identified in advance as a potential star for the series.&lt;ref name="SandovalPage25"/&gt;

Texan [[Michael Nesmith]]'s mother [[Bette Nesmith Graham]] had invented a [[correction fluid]] and founded the company that became [[Liquid Paper]]. He had served a brief stint in the U.S. Air Force and had also recorded for Colpix under the name "Michael Blessing." He was the only one of The Monkees who had come for the audition based on seeing the trade magazine ad. He showed up to the audition with his laundry&lt;ref name="SandovalPage26"/&gt; and impressed Rafelson and Schneider with his laid-back style and droll sense of humor. He also wore a woollen hat to keep his hair out of his eyes when he rode his motorcycle,&lt;ref name="BakerPage10"&gt;Baker (1986), p.10&lt;/ref&gt; leading to early promotional materials which nicknamed him "Wool Hat." The hat remained part of Nesmith's wardrobe, but the name was dropped after the pilot.&lt;ref name="BakerPage10"/&gt;

[[Peter Tork]] was recommended to Rafelson and Schneider by friend [[Stephen Stills]] at his audition.&lt;ref name="SandovalPage26"/&gt; Tork was a skilled multi-instrumentalist who had performed at various Greenwich Village folk clubs before moving west, where he worked as a [[busboy]].&lt;ref name="SandovalPage26"/&gt;

===Development===
[[File:The Monkees 1967.jpg|right|thumb|The Monkees in 1967]]
Rafelson and Schneider wanted the style of the series to reflect [[avant garde]] film techniques—such as improvisation, quick cuts, jump cuts, breaking the [[fourth wall]], and free-flowing, loose narratives—then being pioneered by European film directors. Each episode would contain at least one musical "romp" which might have nothing to do with the storyline. In retrospect, these vignettes now look very much like music videos: short, self-contained films of songs in ways that echoed the Beatles' recent ventures into promotional films for their singles. They also believed strongly in the program's ability to appeal to young people, intentionally framing the kids as heroes and the adults as heavies.&lt;ref name="LefcowitzPage3"&gt;Lefcowitz (1985), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafelson and Schneider hired novice director [[James Frawley]] to teach the four actors improvisational comedy. Each of the four was given a different personality to portray: Dolenz the funny one, Nesmith the smart and serious one, Tork the naive one, and Jones the cute one. Their characters were loosely based on their real selves, with the exception of Tork, who was actually a quiet intellectual. The character types also had much in common with the respective personalities of [[the Beatles]], with Dolenz representing the madcap attitude of [[John Lennon]], Nesmith affecting the deadpan seriousness of [[George Harrison]], Tork depicting the odd-man-out quality of [[Ringo Starr]], and Jones conveying the pin-up appeal of [[Paul McCartney]].

A pilot episode was shot in San Diego and Los Angeles on a shoestring budget—in many scenes the Monkees wore their own clothes. Initial audience tests (which were just then being pioneered) produced very low responses. Rafelson then re-edited the pilot and included some of the screen tests, to better introduce the band members to viewers. (Dolenz was credited in this pilot as "Micky Braddock.") The re-cut pilot tested so well that NBC placed an order for two seasons of episodes. (The edited pilot was broadcast November 14, 1966, as the tenth episode of the first season, with Dolenz credited under his real last name, as for all other episodes.)

===Filming===
''The Monkees'' debuted September 12, 1966, on the NBC television network. The series was sponsored on alternate weeks by [[Kelloggs|Kellogg's Cereals]] and [[Yardley of London]].

The series was filmed by [[Screen Gems]], and many of the same sets and props from [[The Three Stooges]] short films made by the studio were used on ''The Monkees'': A pair of [[pajamas]] with a bunny design on the front that had been worn by [[Curly Howard]] in shorts such as ''[[Cactus Makes Perfect (film)|Cactus Makes Perfect]]'' and ''[[In the Sweet Pie and Pie]]'' were the same ones worn by Peter Tork in various episodes such as "A Coffin Too Frequent" and "Monkee See, Monkee Die".&lt;ref&gt;The Three Stooges Journal, Fall 1987; published by the Three Stooges Fan Club&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce noise on the set during filming, any of the four Monkees who was not needed in front of the cameras was locked into a converted meat locker.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In DVD commentary, Tork noted that this had the added benefit of concealing any marijuana use that might be going on, although he admitted that he was the sole "serious 'head'" of the four of them. (In the 1980s, Tork gave up alcohol and marijuana use and has volunteered time to help people recovering from alcoholism.) In a studio outtake included in the 1990s re-release of ''[[Headquarters (album)|Headquarters]]'', Nesmith quips, before launching into "Nine Times Blue": "Only difference between me and Peter is I'm just ''stone'' legal."{{clarify|date=May 2015}}

Due to the loosely scripted nature of the series, some episodes would come in too short for air. The producers decided to fill time with various "extras", including the Monkees' original screen tests and candid interviews with the group (conducted by Rafelson off-camera); these interviews usually lasted one minute, hence the frequent joke, "We're a minute short as usual," though the episode "Find the Monkees" featured a three-minute epilogue interview (in which the Monkees gave their opinions on the then-recently-occurred [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]]). Although the early episodes contained a [[laugh track]], which was standard practice at the time, the show eventually did not add one, and most of the episodes from Season 2 had no canned laughter. NBC later cited that as one of the reasons for canceling the series.&lt;ref name="Iverson"&gt;Iverson, Paul: "The Advent of the Laugh Track" Hofstra University archives; February 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The theme song to ''The Monkees'', "[[(Theme from) The Monkees]]" (released as the single in some countries in 1967), is one of the group's most well known songs. The line "We're the young generation, and we've got somethin' to say" reflected the new youth counterculture and their desire to give their own opinions on world events and choosing how to live their own lives instead of abiding by the traditions and beliefs of their elders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==The Monkees' "pad"==
{{original research|section|date=May 2015}}
The Monkees resided in a two-story beach house. The address varied in different episodes.
* 1334 Beechwood in “Your Friendly Neighborhood Kidnappers”
* 1424 ???, Malibu, Calif. in “Too Many Girls”
* 1438 North Beechwood according to Davy in “The Case of the Missing Monkee”
* 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, CA according to the telegram in Head
The address 1334 North Beechwood Drive, Hollywood, CA was frequently given in ''[[16 (magazine)|16]]'' magazine as an address to contact [[Screen Gems]] and/or The Monkees. The front of the first floor was a combination of the living room, dining room and kitchen. In the back, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, was an alcove formed by massive floor-to-ceiling bay windows, where the Monkees kept their instruments and rehearsed songs. The walls were covered with various [[kitsch]]y signs and posters, such as the "MONEY IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL" sign near the kitchen, the "SCRUB UP" sign above the kitchen sink, and the "IN CASE OF FIRE, RUN" sign with an arrow pointing to an old-fashioned fire extinguisher near the front door. There were also two doors in the kitchen area; one led to a bathroom, the other to Davy and Peter's bedroom. The second floor (via spiral staircase near the front door) only consisted of Micky and Mike's bedroom. By the second season, the upstairs bedroom was occupied by all four Monkees. Also "residing" with the Monkees was Mr. Schneider, a mannequin who dispensed philosophical advice with the pull of his cord. Mr. Schneider was named after the show's co-producer Bert Schneider and was mostly voiced by main director James Frawley. The boys also had to contend with their bad-tempered landlord Mr. Babbit, who was always yelling at them about various infractions that he thought they were responsible for or threatening to throw them out for not paying the rent.

==Monkeemobile==
{{Main article|Monkeemobile}}
The Monkeemobile was a modified [[Pontiac GTO]] designed and built by designer [[Dean Jeffries]]. The car featured a tilted forward split two-piece [[windshield]], a touring car T-bucket-type [[convertible]] top, modified rear quarter panels and front fenders, exaggerated tail lamps, set of four bucket seats with an extra third row bench where the rear deck should have been, and a [[parachute]]. The [[grille|front grille]] sported the GTO emblem.&lt;ref name="StAntoine-MT"&gt;St. Antoine, Arthur. - [http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/c12_0511_dean_jeffries_interview/index.html "Interview: Dean Jeffries, Hollywood legend"]. - ''[[Motor Trend|Motor Trend Magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KeefeD-PEM-1997"&gt;Keefe, Don. - [http://www.monkees.net/DOCS/MMOBILE.HTM "The History of the MonkeeMobile"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031513/http://www.monkees.net/DOCS/MMOBILE.HTM |date=2008-05-13 }}. - ''Pontiac Enthusiast Magazine''. - (c/o monkees.net) - 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
''The Monkees'' won two Emmy Awards in [[19th Primetime Emmy Awards|1967]]: [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy]] ([[James Frawley]], for the episode "Royal Flush"). Frawley was nominated for the same award the following season (for the episode "The Devil and Peter Tork"). Its win for Comedy Series was considered somewhat of an upset, as it bested long-time favorites ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]'', and ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''.

==Decline and cancellation==
For the first season, in 1966, the series fared well in the ratings, bolstered by several hit records by the band. The Monkees became a huge pop culture sensation. However, the public didn't realize that the show and the band were mostly a generally manufactured television series and that the Monkees themselves did not write or perform much of their own studio music, except to provide the vocals. The only exception were their live performances. When the truth became well known, there was a large backlash by many fans and music critics. NBC responded to the backlash by retooling the show in its second season with the Monkees now writing and performing much of their own music that was much less pop-oriented. In addition, the first season's clean cut looks were replaced by more [[hippy]] looking attire. All this alienated the young fans who then deserted the group. The result was a huge decline in ratings and record sales. By 1967, NBC felt the series had run its course. Coupled with friction within the band itself, the series was cancelled in 1968. The Monkees released three more albums after the series cancellation but they did not chart well.&lt;ref&gt; [http://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-monkees-final-episode/ ultimateclassicrock.com] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndication==
''The Monkees'' enjoyed a resurgence on Saturday morning/afternoon television on [[CBS]] from September 1969 to September 1972 (sponsored by [[General Foods]]' [[Kool-Aid]]), and on ABC from September 1972 to August 1973. To coincide with the releases of ''[[The Monkees Present]]'' and ''[[Changes (The Monkees album)|Changes]]'' albums during this time period, many episodes replaced the older songs with tracks from these recent releases. The 58 episodes were then sold to local markets for syndication in September 1975, where they typically appeared on independent television stations on weekday afternoons (the opening title sequence seen in the syndication package, for all 58 episodes, is from the second season of the original run).

A second, massive resurgence occurred when a ''Monkees'' marathon aired on February 23, 1986 on [[MTV]]. Within months, the 58 episodes were airing regularly throughout the United States on local stations (in edited form), [[Nickelodeon]]/MTV (uncut), as well as Canada on [[MuchMusic]]. Dolenz, Tork and Jones, already reunited for a "20th Anniversary Tour", went from playing small clubs to stadiums as the series caught on, and the tour drew critical praise. The popularity led MTV to create a "reboot" version of the franchise in 1987, ''[[New Monkees]]'', but it flopped and was cancelled after a half season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boone|first1=Brian|title=The Monkees, The Old New Monkees, and New Monkees: How to Destroy A Beloved Franchise|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/11/the-monkees-the-old-new-monkees-and-new-monkees-how-to-destroy-a-beloved-franchise/|website=SplitSider|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series has aired edited versions on [[Antenna TV]], a digital subchannel network that broadcasts classic programming from the 1950s-1990s era. [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] also picked up the series for reruns in spring 2015. [[Fetv|FETV]], a cable and satellite network, began airing the series in December of 2017. In 2018, Canadian superstation [[CHCH-DT|CHCH]] began carrying the series; the station is viewable over-the-air in portions of the United States.

Although [[Rhino Records]] now serves as the underlying rights holder for this series (as they acquired the Monkees' music catalog, TV series and official logo from Raybert and Columbia Pictures in 1994), [[Sony Pictures Television]] remains the television distributor for syndication.

==Legacy==
The TV show ''[[Miami 7]]'', the debut of the British 1990s pop band [[S Club 7]], had a very similar premise. It was the second time that a manufactured band had their own TV show on American television. Likewise, the Nickelodeon sitcom ''[[Big Time Rush (TV series)|Big Time Rush]]'' followed the same basic format and premise, and producers of that show acknowledged ''The Monkees'' as their primary inspiration.&lt;ref name="Play"&gt;Martin, Denise. "Child's Play." ''Los Angeles Times.'' November 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolenz said in a 2007 interview on the [[Roe Conn]] radio program that, while inspiration did come from the Beatles, the band's image was not meant to be a rip-off of them. He said that the Beatles were always depicted as superstars with legions of fans, whereas the Monkees were always depicted as unsigned and struggling to make a buck. This is reflected numerous times throughout the series, such as in the pilot where Mike Nesmith is seen throwing darts at a Beatles poster, and in the episode "Find the Monkees (The Audition)" where the Monkees struggle to see a famous television producer who is looking for a rock act for use in commercial advertisements; in the episode "I Was a 99-Pound Weakling", Micky is tricked into signing onto a bogus weight-training program, but objects by noting, "Where am I gonna get that kind of money? I'm an unemployed drummer." Also in a screen test, a Monkee asks what the Beatles have that they don't have. They sing "Thirteen million dollars!"

When commenting on the death of Davy Jones on February 29, 2012, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine contributor James Poniewozik praised the show: "Even if the show never meant to be more than entertainment and a hit-single generator, we shouldn’t sell ''The Monkees'' short. It was far better TV than it had to be; during an era of formulaic domestic sitcoms and wacky comedies, it was a stylistically ambitious show, with a distinctive visual style, absurdist sense of humor and unusual story structure. Whatever Jones and The Monkees were meant to be, they became creative artists in their own right, and Jones’ chipper Brit-pop presence was a big reason they were able to produce work that was commercial, wholesome and yet impressively weird."&lt;ref name=Poniewozik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title= RIP Davy Jones, The Monkees’ Daydreamboat | journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 2012 | volume= | issue= | pages= | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/29/rip-davy-jones-the-monkees-daydreamboat/?xid=rss-topstories |accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six two-episode VHS volumes of the television series were distributed by Musicvision/RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video between July 15, 1986 and June 25, 1987, taking advantage of the group's twentieth anniversary.

On October 17, 1995, with the Monkees' 30th anniversary looming, Rhino Home Video issued the complete series as a deluxe VHS boxed set, containing all 58 episodes, plus the pilot and the 1969 special, ''[[33⅓ Revolutions Per Monkee]]'', in a total of 21 videotapes, along with a specially created full-color photo book that tells the history of the series, information of each episode and a variety of photographs from the series. First-run issues of the set also included a limited-edition wristwatch. A few months before, on May 22, Columbia House started releasing a Collector's Edition series also collecting all 58 ''Monkees'' episodes and the 1969 special; the one exception being the unaired 1965 ''Monkees'' pilot, which was available only on Rhino's Video Box Set.

Rhino later released individual two-episode VHS volumes of the TV series between March 26, 1996 and April 11, 2000; it would be the last time ''The Monkees'' television show would be distributed on videocassette.

In May and November 2003, [[WarnerMedia|AOL Time Warner Entertainment]]’s [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Home Video]] released the first two seasons of the original television series on DVD for the first time. Rhino Retrovision’s first two seasons DVD releases features the video fully restored and digitally remastered from the original 35mm interpostive film prints and the audio, restored, remastered and remixed in 5.1 Dolby Digital “Rhinophonic” surround sound for superb film quality and optimal audio vitality and for superior home entertainment theater presentation. Seasons 1 and 2 were each released separately, six DVDs for Season 1 and five DVDs for Season 2. Both seasons were re-released by Eagle Rock Entertainment on Sept. 27, 2011.

In honor of The Monkees' 50th anniversary, Rhino released the complete series on Blu-ray for the very first time on July 8, 2016.  It was originally scheduled for released on June 26, 2016 but was subsequently pushed back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Monkees-The-Complete-Series/22187|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613201157/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Monkees-The-Complete-Series/22187|archivedate=2016-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Monkees-The-Complete-Series/22362 New (and 'Final'!)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1978">A '''theatrical production''' is any work of [[theatre]], such as a staged play, musical, comedy or drama produced from a written book or script.

These productions generally feature actors, costumes and sets. The [[History of theatre|history of the theatrical production]] goes back to [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greece]].

Theatrical productions vary in many ways. They can be anything from high school as well as college productions, community theatre productions to summer stock and regional theatre productions all the way to Broadway and Kings Road productions. Today's contemporary theatres produce a variety of plays and musicals that attract very different audiences.

In full theatrical productions there are a great number of people working towards many types of shows. A [[Theatrical producer|producer]] acquires financing, hires staff and oversees everything from the beginning to the end of each show. Theatrical staff is separated by department, which varies from theatre to theatre and production to production depending on needs.

The production will employ front of house and back of house staff. In addition to performers, stage hands, [[stage manager]]s, lighting and [[sound technician]]s, many theatres will hire ushers, concessions workers, janitorial and security in mounting a theatrical production.

Theatrical productions may also involve other types of performance exhibitions, which include improvisational, skit and parody performances which involve varying levels of involvement from off-camera staff or assistants in order to create the production.

In [[comedy]], a '''throwaway line''' (also: '''throwaway joke''' or '''throwaway gag''') is a [[joke]] delivered "in passing" without being the [[punch line]] to a [[comedy routine]], part of the [[wikt:buildup|build up]] to another joke, or (in the context of [[drama]]) there to advance a story or develop a character. Throwaway lines are often [[one-liner joke|one-liner]]s, or [[in-joke]]s, and often delivered in a [[deadpan]] manner.

In [[comic strip]]s ([[Sunday comics]] in particular) throwaway gags are often placed in the throwaway panels of the comic, and are located there so that removing the throwaway panels for space reasons will not destroy the narrative of the central comic.

In [[episodic fiction]], a line intended originally as a throwaway line in one episode may later be [[retconned]] by being incorporated into the [[back-story]] of the main drama, and used to develop the longer-term plot.

| ''Rendering of a planned highway''
|1960
|In 1960, a 49-second vector animation of a car traveling down a planned highway at 110&amp;nbsp;km/h was created at the Swedish [[Royal Institute of Technology]] on the [[BESK]] computer. The short animation was broadcast on November 9, 1961 on national television.&lt;ref name="tekniskamuseet"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.tekniskamuseet.se/lar-dig-mer/kommunikation-och-media/datorhistoriska-nedslag/svensk-datorhistoria-1960-talet/ |title= Svensk datorhistoria – 1960-talet |last= Du Rietz |first= Peter |date= 20 December 2016 |website= Tekniska museet |publisher= Tekniska museet |access-date= 17 January 2017 |quote= In front of the oscilloscope mounted a 35 mm camera with extended magazine on a custom-made stand. The camera was controlled automatically by computer, which sent a signal to the camera when a new image has been fed on the oscilloscope. In the Nordic ADB, who counted a lot and release data stewed, they had realized that they had all the coordinates to draw perspective from the driver's seat. They took as an example of this in the future how the then nyprojekterade motorway towards Nacka, outside Stockholm, would look like. With the camera in front of the oscilloscope, they could snap a picture every twenty meters of the virtual road. The result was a 30 second fictitious trip in the virtual highway at a speed of 110 km/h. The film was transferred to 16 mm format and made in 100 copies. Technical Museum is the only known surviving copy of the film in the collections. On the film roll box says that it is the first computer-drawn film in the world. There is little other evidence that this is actually true, and that this is the world's first computer animation. The film aired on the best time in the TV November 9, 1961 in news program News. |language= Swedish |trans-title= Swedish computer history - 1960s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|XhNT501DsJI|"Världens äldsta datoranimation?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| ''Hummingbird''
|1967
|A ten-minute computer animated film by [[Charles Csuri]] and James Shaffer. This was awarded a prize at the 4th annual International Experimental Film Competition in Brussels, Belgium and in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York City.  The subject was a line drawing of a hummingbird for which a sequence of movements appropriate to the bird were programmed. Over 30,000 images comprising some 25 motion sequences were generated by the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.siggraph.org/artdesign/profile/csuri/artworks/plot/plot9.html |title= Hummingbird, 1967 |last= Csuir |first= Charles |date= |website= ACM SIGGRAPH |publisher= ACM SIGGRAPH |access-date= 17 January 2017 |quote= We completed a ten minute computer animated film entitled Hummingbird. The subject was a line drawing of a hummingbird for which a sequence of movements appropriate to the bird were outlined. Over 30,000 images comprising some 25 motion sequences were generated by the computer. For these, selected sequences were used for the film. A micro-film plotter recorded the images directly to film. To facilitate control over the motion of some sequences, the programs were written to read all the controlling parameters from cards, one card for each frame. Curve fit or other date generating programs were used to punch the parameter decks. We also built a windowing option into our plot subroutine. }} []&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|awvQp1TdBqc|Charles Csuri, Fragmentation Animations, 1968 - 1970: Hummingbird (1968)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Transporter''===
{{Main|The Transporter}}
Frank Martin ([[Jason Statham]]) is a highly skilled driver known only as "The Transporter." He will transport anything, no questions asked, always on time, and he is known as the best in the business. He strictly follows three rules when transporting: Rule Number 1: "Once the deal is made, it is final", Rule Number 2: "No names", and Rule Number 3: "Never open the package." Frank inadvertently breaks his own rule, opens the package and finds a bound and gagged woman.

===''Transporter 2''===
{{Main|Transporter 2}}
Frank is working as the driver/chauffeur for a wealthy family, in the United States. Martin bonds with their young son, whom he drives to school every day. When the boy is kidnapped, Frank must again take action in order to protect his young "package" and his family. Eventually, Martin unravels a scheme involving biological weapons and the nefarious Gianni Chellini. Martin is forced to remove a bomb from the bottom of his car by executing an aerial corkscrew manoeuver underneath a crane. The crane catches the bomb and Martin escapes unharmed. Frank debuts the [[Audi A8 W12]] in this film.

Inspector Tarconi plays an even more prominent role in this film. It is established that he and Frank are now friends, and Tarconi goes as far as to lie to the police to cover for Frank. His cooking prowess is established as well.

===''Transporter 3''===
{{Main|Transporter 3}}
Frank has been pressured into transporting Valentina ([[Natalya Rudakova]]) the kidnapped daughter of Leonid Vasilev ([[Jeroen Krabbé]]), the head of the Environmental Protection Agency for Ukraine, from [[Marseille]] through [[Stuttgart]] and [[Budapest]] until he ends up in [[Odessa]] on the [[Black Sea]]. Along the way, with the help of Inspector Tarconi ([[François Berléand]]), Frank has to contend with the people who strong armed him to take the job, agents sent by Vasilev to intercept him, and the general non-cooperation of his passenger, who he realises is the package mid-way through the film. Despite Valentina's cynical disposition and Frank's resistance to get involved, Frank and Valentina fall for each other, while escaping from one life-threatening situation after another. Martin again drives an armoured [[Audi A8 W12]] in the film, as well as a [[BMX]] bicycle.

==Frank Martin==
{{Main
| Frank Martin (Transporter)
}}
'''Frank Martin''' is the [[protagonist]] of the films and television series. He initially serves as a [[reluctant hero]]. He is portrayed as a former [[Special Forces]] operative who was a team leader of a search and destroy unit. His military background includes operations "in and out of" [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Sudan]]. He retires from this after becoming fatigued and disenchanted with his superior officers. In simple terms, he got tired of seeing his best efforts turned to nothing by the same people paying him to do the job. So he puts his skills to action as a private driver for hire.

{{VG Industry}}
The '''video game industry''' is the [[economic sector]] involved in the [[Video game development|development]], marketing, and [[Video game monetization|monetization of video games]]. It encompasses dozens of [[job]] disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Zackariasson, P. and Wilson, T.L. eds. (2012). ''The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The computer and video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about [[United States dollar|US$]]9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 ([[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] annual report).

Modern [[personal computer]]s owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry: [[sound card]]s, [[graphics card]]s and [[3D graphic accelerator]]s, faster [[CPU]]s, and dedicated co-processors like [[PhysX]] are a few of the more notable improvements.

[[Sound card]]s were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and [[audiophile]]s.&lt;ref name="sndhist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alldidigames.com/video-games-industry-infographics/ | publisher=Didi Games | work=Research on Video Games | author=Bob Johnstone | title=Didi Games | accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, graphics cards were developed for more colors.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; Later, graphic cards were developed for [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) and games; GUIs drove the need for high resolution, and games began using 3D acceleration.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with [[Scan Line Interleave|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]] graphics cards).&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general; however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever-higher speeds.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt;

== Game industry value chain ==
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry [[value chain]] is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:
# Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new titles and seeking returns through licensing of the titles.
# Product and talent layer: includes [[Video game developer|developers]], [[video game designer|designers]] and [[game artist|artists]], who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
# Production and tools layer: generates content [[game tool|production tools]], game development [[Game Middleware|middleware]], [[Game engine|customizable game engines]], and production management tools.
# Distribution layer: or the "[[video game publisher|publishing]]" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
# Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as [[smartphones]]. This layer now includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (e.g. Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or even further Facebook, etc.
# End-users layer: or the users/players of the games.&lt;ref name="newmedia"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disciplines ==
The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: [[game programmer]], [[game designer]], [[level designer]], [[game producer]], [[game artist]] and [[game tester]]. Most of these professionals are employed by [[video game developer]]s or [[video game publisher]]s. However, many [[hobby]]ists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2965/2526#36&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of video games}}

=== 1940s–1960s ===

{{main|Early history of video games|Early mainframe games}}
Prior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.

Many early publicly-available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not "video games", they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 "Nimatron", an electromagentic relay-based [[Nim]]-playing device designed by [[Edward Condon]] and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]],&lt;ref name="Priest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|title=The Priesthood At Play: Computer Games in the 1950s |work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-01-22|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172058/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'', an arcade game of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]],&lt;ref name="CNE"&gt;{{cite news|first=Marlene|last=Simmons|title=Bertie the Brain programmer heads science council |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rKYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pe0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=916,3790974&amp;dq=josef-kates&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=1975-10-09|page=17|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nimrod (computing)|Nimrod]] created by engineering firm [[Ferranti]] for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Replay: The History of Video Games]]|last=Donovan|first=Tristan|publisher=Yellow Ant|date=2010-04-20|isbn=978-0-9565072-0-4|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[cathode ray tube]]&amp;mdash;the core technology behind televisions&amp;mdash;created several of the first true video games. In 1947 Thomas T.

Between the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is ''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], and Wayne Wiitanen.&lt;ref name="Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|title=One, Two, Three, Four I Declare a Space War|work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-08-07|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172136/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of easy-to-program languages like [[BASIC]] for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.

The early part of the decade saw the rise of [[8-bit]] home computing, and [[Homebrew (video games)|home-made games]], especially in Europe (with the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]) and Asia (with the [[NEC PC-8801|NEC PC-88]] and [[MSX]]). This time also saw the rise of [[video game journalism]], which was later expanded to include [[covermount]]ed cassettes and CDs.
In 1983, the [[North American video game crash of 1983|North American industry crashed]] due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as [[Nintendo]],&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt; while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as [[Ocean Software]] and [[Gremlin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html|title=World of Spectrum - Archive - YS Top 100|work=worldofspectrum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the [[Game Boy]] handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against [[Blockbuster Entertainment]], which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.

The 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:
* The widespread adoption of [[compact disc|CD]]-based storage and software distribution
* Widespread adoption of [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based [[operating system]]s, such as the series of [[Amiga OS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]]
* Advancement in 3D graphics technology, as [[Graphics processing unit|3D graphic cards]] became widely adopted, with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] now the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for video game visual presentation
* Continuing advancement of [[CPU]] speed and sophistication
* Miniaturisation of hardware, and mobile phones, which enabled [[mobile gaming]]
* The emergence of the internet, which in the latter part of the decade enabled online co-operative play and [[competitive gaming]]

In 2000s, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as [[Smartphones]], [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Nevertheless, many [[casual game]]s and [[indie game]]s were developed and become popular and successful, such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'' and ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''. Game development for mobile phones (such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a [[Facebook]] game developer, [[Zynga]], has raised in excess of $300 million.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/15/zynga-takes-180-million-venture-round-cue-russian-mafia-jokes/ |title=Zynga Takes $180 Million Venture Round From DST, Others (Cue Russian Mafia Jokes) |publisher=TechCrunch |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not the main driving force, [[independent video games|indie games]] continue to have a significant impact on the industry, with sales of some of these titles such as ''[[Spelunky]]'', ''[[Fez]]'', ''[[Don't Starve]]'', ''[[Castle Crashers]]'', and ''[[Minecraft]]'', exceeding millions of [[United States dollar|dollars]] and over a million users.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurial-insights.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneurial-insights.com/gaming-industry-introduction/|title=The Gaming Industry – An Introduction|work=Entrepreneurial Insights}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|date=February 2017}} The 2010s have seen a larger shift to casual and [[mobile gaming]]; in 2016, the mobile gaming market is estimated to have taken $38 billion in revenues, compared to $6 billion for the console market and $33 billion for personal computing gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-10-24-welcome-to-the-new-era-games-as-media | title = Welcome to the New Era: Games as Media | first = Joost | last = van Dreunen | date = October 24, 2016 | accessdate = October 31, 2016 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Games centered on [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] equipment also arose during this decade.

== Economics ==
Early on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].

As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/|title=Top Gaming Studios, Schools &amp; Salaries|work=Big Fish Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of [[Game Middleware|middleware]] and pre-built [[game engine]]s.  In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Superannuation|title=How Much Does It Cost To Make A Big Video Game?|url=http://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649|website=Kotaku|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game development team has to select a profitable and suitable method [[Video game monetization|to sell or earn money from]] the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Now some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as [[digital distribution|online distribution]], to reduce costs and increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=Why Digital Distribution Is The Future And GameStop Is Not: Taking The Long View On Used Games|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/05/30/why-digital-distribution-is-the-future-and-gamestop-is-not-taking-the-long-view-on-used-games/|website=Forbes|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', which took in over $650 [[United States dollar|USD]] million of sales in the game's first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision "Call of Duty: Black Ops" sets record for Activision"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125022802/http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision |date=January 25, 2011 }}.

The industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams' sizes and reduced the number of [[Triple A (gaming)|high-budget, high-quality titles]] under development. In 2013 [[Richard Hilleman]] of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such titles for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.&lt;ref name="vgchartz20130706"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vgchartz.com/article/251108/ea-aaa-development-in-decline/ | title=EA: AAA Development in Decline | work=VGChartz | date=July 6, 2013 | accessdate=July 8, 2013 | author=D'Angelo, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail ===

The games industry's shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as [[GameStop]], following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as [[Blockbuster (company)|Blockbuster]], [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]], and [[Virgin Megastores]]. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Wingfield |first1=Nick |title=As Downloads Take Over, a Turning Point for the Video Game Industry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-12-20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/technology/as-downloads-take-over-a-turning-point-for-the-video-game-industry.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=GAME launches Belong - is this the future of video games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-12-16 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-15-game-launches-belong-is-this-the-future-of-video-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Suellentrop |first1=Chris |last2=Totilo |first2=Stephen |title=Video Game Retail Sales Decline Despite New Hits |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-10-03 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/arts/video-games/video-game-retail-sales-decline-despite-new-hits.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=What's going wrong at UK games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-21 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-21-whats-going-wrong-at-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- more in this source --&gt; Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=Is the industry's obsession with Day One coming to an end? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-08 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-07-is-the-industrys-obsession-with-day-one-coming-to-an-end |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business.{{r|Eurogamer: trade-in myths}} They figured that sites such as [[eBay]], which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parfitt |first1=Ben |title=Pre-owned price comparison site Trade In Detectives goes live |work=[[MCV UK]] |date=2013-08-07 |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pre-owned-price-comparison-site-trade-in-detectives-goes-live/0119776 |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: trade-in myths"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |title=Myth-busting the murky world of video game trade-ins |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2013-12-18 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-03-myth-busting-the-murky-world-of-video-game-trade-ins |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Video game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.

However, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.

=== Breakaways ===
In the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the "original" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 24, 2005|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=March 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] née [[Infogrames]]).

Activision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.

=== Piracy ===
The industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &amp;#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN2nGrc6?url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware/ |archivedate=February 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Digital rights management]] have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |publisher=BBC News |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to [[Freemium]], where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from [[Cheating in video games|hacked]] (faked) transactions.

=== Creative control ===
On various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html|title=Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9% (2005) from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the video game industry continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621|title=Video game industry growth still strong: study|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.

In the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]:
# A license to develop games for the console
# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console
# A separate license for each game

In addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.

=== Alternatives ===
An alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] model over the [[Internet]].

=== Gaming conventions ===
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The major annual gaming conventions include [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany), the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA),&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=E3 is Obsolete, But it Doesn't Matter|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/06/08/e3-is-obsolete-but-it-doesnt-matter/|publisher=Forbes|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Penny Arcade Expo]], and [[:Category:Video game conventions|others]].

[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany) is a major expo for video games. The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA) is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Other notable conventions and trade fairs include [[Tokyo Game Show]] (Japan), [[Brasil Game Show]] (Brazil), [[EB Games Expo]] (Australia), [[Russian Game Developers Conference|KRI]] (Russia), [[China Digital Entertainment Expo &amp; Conference|ChinaJoy]] (China) and the annual [[Game Developers Conference]]. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with [[BlizzCon]], [[QuakeCon]], [[Nvision]] and the [[X (Xbox show)|X shows]] being prominent examples.

[[Germany]] has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1&amp;nbsp;billion forecast for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-100-countries-by-game-revenues/|title=Top 100 Countries By Game Revenues|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=newzoo.com|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] is Europe's largest gaming expo.

One of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was [[Gütersloh]]-based [[Rainbow Arts]] (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular ''[[Turrican]]'' series of games. The [[Anno (series)|Anno series]] and [[The Settlers|The Settlers series]] are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The [[Gothic series]], [[SpellForce: The Order of Dawn|SpellForce]] and [[Risen (video game)|Risen]] are established RPG franchises. The [[X (game series)|X series]] by [[Egosoft]] is the best-selling space simulation. The [[FIFA Manager (video game series)|FIFA Manager series]] was also developed in Germany. The German action game [[Spec Ops: The Line]] (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany is ''[[Far Cry]]'' (2004) by [[Frankfurt]]-based [[Crytek]], who also produced the topseller ''[[Crysis]]'' and its sequels later.

Other well-known current and former developers from Germany include [[Ascaron]], [[Blue Byte]], [[Deck13 Interactive|Deck13]], [[EA Phenomic|Phenomic]], [[Piranha Bytes]], [[Radon Labs|Radon]], [[Related Designs|Related]], [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] and [[Yager Development]]. Publishers include [[Deep Silver]] ([[Koch Media]]), [[dtp entertainment]], [[Kalypso Media|Kalypso]] and [[Nintendo|Nintendo Europe]]. [[Bigpoint Games]], [[Gameforge]], [[Goodgame Studios]] and [[Wooga]] are among the world's leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.

The [[Japan]]ese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia.

&lt;!-- Generally, games have a greater [[market share]] of total entertainment in Japan than in the West.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} --&gt;
Japanese companies have created some of the largest and most lucrative titles ever made, such as the ''[[Mario]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Metal Gear]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series of games.

&lt;!-- [[Video arcade|Video game arcades]] are still relatively popular in Japan; for every [[arcade game]] released in the US, nine are released in [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The history of the Japanese arcade is very significant in the story of the decline of the American arcade, and in the shape of [[game design]] in general. --&gt;
In recent years, [[video game console|consoles]] and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable [[free-to-play]] games on the [[PC game|PC]] and [[Mobile game|mobile]] platforms.&lt;ref name=economist12&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan fights back|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21566696-two-japanese-firms-are-challenging-world-new-kind-video-game-japan-fights-back|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=capcom_marketdata&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Data|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/market.html|publisher=[[Capcom]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The structure and culture of a Japanese game developer is different from a western one. Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Also, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a "director") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Secondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1992), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} --&gt;

{{main|Video gaming in the United Kingdom}}

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed.&lt;ref name="networkworld1"/&gt; The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-04-04-view-from-the-tower|title=The View From the Tower|publisher=gamesindustry.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' developer, [[Media Molecule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/02/media-molecule-officially-joins-the-playstation-family/ |title=Media Molecule Officially Joins The PlayStation Family – PlayStation.Blog.Europe |publisher=Blog.eu.playstation.com |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Codemasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinkle |first=David |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/05/reliance-big-entertainment-acquires-50-stake-in-codemasters |title=Reliance Big Entertainment acquires 50% stake in Codemasters |publisher=Joystiq |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to some of the world's most successful video game franchises, such as ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', ''[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'', ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt|Colin McRae Dirt]]'' and ''[[Total War (series)|Total War]]''.

The country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Rik |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44996/budget-2012-tax-relief-video-games |title=UK tax relief break |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate= March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector's contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Post comment Name Email Address Comments |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |title=Game industry tax relief plans are shelved |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625151807/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |archivedate=June 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Canada overtakes UK |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/34406/Canada-overtakes-UK-industry-workforce-tally |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
[[Magnavox]] is credited for releasing the first [[video game console]], the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. [[Activision]] was the first developer to create independent/third-party video games. Once the fastest-growing American company, [[Atari]] crashed in spectacular fashion, resulting in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. This resulted in the domination of the Japanese video game industry worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

====Companies====
The U.S. is home to major game development companies such as [[Activision Blizzard]] (''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]''), [[Electronic Arts]] (''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]''), and [[Take-Two Interactive]] ([[Civilization (series)|Civilization]], [[NBA 2K (series)|''NBA 2K'' series]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''). [[ZeniMax Media]] (''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'') is the world's largest privately held video game company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Zenimax+Claims+Carmack+Stole+Oculus+VR+Facebook+Barks+Back/article34869.htm|title=Zenimax Claims Carmack Stole Oculus VR, Facebook Barks Back|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niantic, Inc.|Niantic]] (''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'', ''[[Pokémon Go]]'') is a notable mobile game developer.

[[Valve Corporation]] operates [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest computer gaming platform, with an active user base (~125 million) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (~150 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgchartz.com/|title=VGChartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not specifically focused on games, the largest mobile gaming platforms are operated by [[Google]] ([[Google Play]]), and [[Apple Inc.]] ([[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]), with the majority of mobile revenue coming from Asia.&lt;ref name=idcannie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-idc-portable-gaming-report-2013-q2/|author=App Annie, IDC|title=App Annie &amp; IDC Portable Gaming Report Q2 2013: iOS &amp; Google Play Game Revenue 4x Higher Than Gaming-Optimized Handhelds}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] operates [[Xbox]], the only major game console hardware franchise not controlled by a Japanese company. [[Sony]] established [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] in [[Silicon Valley]] to run [[PlayStation]], the world's largest and longest-running video game console franchise.&lt;ref name=wired-sie&gt;{{cite news|title=Sony Interactive Entertainment Merges PlayStation Biz Units|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/sony-interactive-entertainment/|accessdate=January 26, 2016|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intel]] and [[Nvidia]] are the largest makers of PC graphics chips. [[Advanced Micro Devices]] has become the most important console [[Microprocessor|processor]] vendor, with all three of the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation home consoles]] using AMD [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s, and two of them use AMD [[central processing unit|CPU]]s. Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony were not aware that they were all using AMD processors until all their consoles were announced,&lt;ref name=e12a&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/12/amd-vp-saeid-moshkelani-interview/|work=[[Engadget]]|title=AMD's Saeid Moshkelani on building custom silicon for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Wii U |date=June 12, 2013 |first=Michael |last=Gorman}}&lt;/ref&gt; underscoring the secrecy found within the game industry. Notable game engine developers include [[Epic Games]] ([[Unreal Engine]]) and [[Unity Technologies]] ([[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]).

====Regions====
The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is home to important video game conventions, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), one of the largest video game industry-only events in the world, and [[Penny Arcade Expo]] (PAX West), the largest public video game convention in [[North America]]. The West Coast is also home to many of the major American video game industry companies, particularly the regions of [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Seattle]]. Major game development regions outside of the West Coast include the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Texas]].

====People====
Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/about-esa/industry-facts/|title=Industry Facts|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean [[conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/article/new-study-finds-video-game-players-are-highly-engaged-politically/|title=New Study Finds Video Game Players Are Highly Engaged Politically|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important [[List of video game industry people|game development personalities]] were born in or moved to the United States. Notable developers include [[Ralph H. Baer]] ([[Magnavox Odyssey]], the "Father of Video Games"), [[Jonathan Blow]] (''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]''), [[John D. Carmack]] (''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''), and [[Alexey Pajitnov]] (''[[Tetris]]''). [[Mario]] is named after [[Mario Segale]], a former landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]. Some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] activists, including [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Anita Sarkeesian]], have met extreme resistance from the gaming public in response to the perceived politicizing of their art form.&lt;ref name=TC2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/gamergate-an-issue-with-2-sides/ | title=#GamerGate – An Issue With Two Sides | author= Allum Bokhari | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | accessdate= September 27, 2014|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sports====
The United States recognizes [[eSports]] players as professional athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/07/14/the-u-s-now-recognizes-esports-players-as-professional-athletes/|title=The U.S. Now Recognizes eSports Players As Professional Athletes|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Gaming]] has eSports arenas and studios across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/23/major-league-gaming-announces-its-own-arena-in-columbus-ohio/|title=Major League Gaming announces its own arena in Columbus, Ohio|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Morris University]] has a [[League of Legends]] [[varsity team]], whose members are eligible for [[scholarship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/219522/Illinois_university_makes_League_of_Legends_a_varsity_sport.php |title=Illinois university makes League of Legends a varsity sport|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trends ==
Players become fourth-party developers, allowing for more [[Open-source software|open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Players also create [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.

While this "community of modifiers" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the [[video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt;

The industry has seen a shift towards games with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.

In addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|pages=220–221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, "Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=222|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}}
'''Winter guard''' is an indoor [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]] sport derived from military ceremonies or veterans organizations ceremonies. Unlike traditional [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]], Winter Guard is performed indoors, usually in a gymnasium or an indoor arena. Performances make use of recorded music rather than a live band or orchestra. Winter guard was invented in the United States, which remains the predominant scene for the sport.

Winter Guard ensembles commonly perform at judged competitions officiated by local and regional associations using criteria developed by [[Winter Guard International]]. In most states, they have a cadet guard and high school guard.

==Team roles==

A Winter Guard generally consists of performing members under the direction of an instructional staff. The staff of a winter guard team ("the guard") are drawn from many different specialties, which sometimes overlap: there are equipment instructors (sometimes one for the unit, sometimes broken out into the individual sections), dance instructors, and drill instructors. The equipment instructors create the choreography performed with equipment and teach it to the guard. The dance instructors create and teach the movement [[choreography]] in the show. The drill instructors focus on the position of the guard members relative to one another and to the boundaries of the performance area, in addition to where each member goes at which specific time during the performance. In some cases, all of these roles are fulfilled by one sole director.

A winter guard team usually has a captain, who is one of the performing members who leads and represents the guard. The captain may assume minor administrative duties and lead the team when instructors are not available. The captain is also the representative of the guard during awards ceremonies or retreat.

The number of members on a winter guard team varies widely from five to approximately 45.

==Performance conventions==

The duration of winter guard shows depends on the class in which the guard is performing. In competition settings, each winter guard team is allotted a set amount of time to set up staging (including a vinyl floor if the guard is using one, and any props associated with the performance), place all equipment, perform the show, and remove staging, props, and equipment. Setup and tear-down typically run two minutes each, and performances run around five minutes. Judges impose penalties on teams that run past the allotted time.

Unlike traditional [[Color guard (flag spinning)]] teams, which perform outdoors on a football field or parade route accompanied by a [[marching band]] or [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum corps]], winter guard teams perform indoors to recorded music.

In competitions, winter guard teams are judged in the areas of talent, precision, creativity, and horizontal orchestration (how all the elements create the larger picture/effect). Performances incorporate equipment, props, and dance moves.

Judges must keep a running commentary on a tape recorder or digital recorder. The judges record the score on a designated sheet to be reviewed by the individual guard instructor(s). After every one in a class has competed and their scores have been tallied, if the instructor(s) so choose they may meet with all the judges to discuss in depth why they received the score they did, ways to improve, what they are doing right etc. The goal of all parties involved, is to have the performers, staff, and the programs grow and learn.

==Equipment==

Three primary types of equipment are used in winter guard: flags, rifles, and sabres (other items can be used to demonstrate artistic effects.) Such equipment is used in shows to demonstrate a team's technical ability. Rubber tape, such as electrical tape, is often used to cover the equipment and give it a uniform appearance and protect it from damage during the activity.

===Flags===

The most fundamental piece of equipment in color guard or winter guard shows is the flag. While winter guard flags take many different sizes and shapes, a standard size is a six-foot pole (metal) with a Three-foot "silk", often of a custom design. Smaller flags called "swing flags" are shortened poles with large silks connected to them. These poles are often plastic so they move more fluidly. These flags are often incorporated into the artistic element of the performance, even though they are not practical for tossing or spinning, due to the weight and length of the silk. Other flags may range from 5 feet to 7 feet depending upon the intended effect of the piece of equipment. Longer flags are not practical to spin or toss but generally serve as holders for large pieces of material.

===Rifles===

Shaped similar to actual [[rifle|rifles]], the rifles used in winter guard are made of solid or hollowed-out lightweight wood and weigh 2&amp;ndash;5 pounds (about 1&amp;ndash;2.25 kilograms). Most winter guard rifles have a length of 30&amp;ndash;39 inches (about 76&amp;ndash;99 centimeters) and are composed of seven parts:
# The '''neck''' of the rifle. The neck is where the trigger would be on a firearm rifle. Right-handed drop-spins are performed using the neck of the rifle as the axis for the spin, and the neck is also used in common tosses.
# The '''bolt''' is a long silver or black strip of metal or plastic connected to the body of the rifle by screws, made to look like the [[Bolt (firearms)|bolt]] on a firearm.
# The '''body''' of the rifle is the middle section and the majority of the mass of the rifle.
# The '''strap''', a long [[leather]] strap that reaches from the butt end of the rifle to about two-thirds of the way to the nose of the rifle. The strap has functional and visual purposes, and it is also used to produce a snapping sound. The strap is similar to a firearm's sling.
# The '''swivel''' or '''clip''' is the metal piece that attaches the strap to the body of the rifle. This is the most common location for left-hand placement when executing a regular left-handed toss.
# The final part of the rifle is the '''butt''', the heavier, back end of the rifle.
# The "tip" is at the end of the thin, long part of the rifle and is located on the opposite side of where the "butt" is.

Rifles can be made out of both [[wood]] and [[plastic]]. Some people prefer plastic because they are all the same weight and size, unless you order a bigger or smaller one. Others prefer wood because they're heavier and more durable. They are all exactly the same. Some people prefer wood because it is less slick and they can weight it the way they want to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/.|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plastic Rifles ====
Usually rookies, people new to color guard, will use plastic rifles. They tend to be a little more forgiving and easier to handle. Some people may not like plastic rifles because they can become slick and hard to handle, either when its raining or just from the sweat from the users hands. Some plastic rifles come with a manufacture guarantee that they will not break under normal usage. Because most are made out of a material called [[polyethylene]], this makes the rifle sturdy and harder to break. The material can also be colored so that different teams can use different colored rifles. Sometimes, though, the material can warp after several bad drops which can lead to a bad spin while the rifle is in the air. Plastic rifles may also start to smell after prolonged use, some say that after a long time it will tend to smell like sweat because of the performers hands. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/.|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wooden Rifles ====
Wooden rifles can be hard to use because they are all slightly different and may not be weighted the same, this is why people that are more familiar with rifles use them and not usually rookies. Most wooden rifles are made of either [[Populus|poplar]] or [[aspen]] wood. It is recommended to tape wooden rifles as to keep the ends protected and make it more durable, the tape can also be used for cosmetics. [[Electrical tape]] is the first choice of most winter guards because you can get the tape in whatever color is desired to match the show. Water is the main antagonist to wooden rifles, it can destroy a rifle and make it completely not usable, but if cared for properly and used correctly they can last for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marching.com/spotlight/all-about-accessories/plastic-vs-wooden-rifles/|title=MARCHING.COM: All About Accessories - Plastic vs. Wooden Rifles|website=www.marching.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sabres===

[[Sabre]]s are elegant pieces of equipment used in winter guard. The length of sabres can range from about 30&amp;ndash;39 inches (about 76&amp;ndash;99 centimeters). They can either be plastic, metal, or plastic covered metal- though metal is more commonly used. Some metal sabres on the market are intricately decorated with engravings or etchings along the blade.  These more intricately designed sabres tend to be more expensive.

Sabres have two main parts: the blade and the hilt. The blade has a pointed but dull end, and the length of the blade is dull as well. Some winter guard team members wrap their sabres in electrical tape, as they do with rifles. As with rifles, a piece of black or non-white tape placed near the center of rotation is used as a "spotter", making it easier to locate the fast-moving blade while it is rotating in the air. Sabres are used primarily by more advanced guard members.

==Dance==

[[File:Winter Guard Preview Show 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|2012 Winter Guard Preview Show]]Guard members incorporate many different styles of dance into their shows. The most common styles of dance used are modern, contemporary, lyrical, jazz, and ballet. The different styles of dance are chosen depending on the different types of music chosen and the themes of the shows.  Dance is usually incorporated into the equipment work, and is performed seamlessly throughout the show.

==Winter Guard International==

[[Winter Guard International]] is not only a national competition but it is also an organization that has been around for many years. Unlike other traditional sports the rules and regulations have been changed and altered many times since the activity has started. There are judges who judge separate elements of a show – such as general effect, movement, equipment, and penalty points – and score the groups accordingly.

Because this activity not only exists in the United States but all around the world, major competitions worldwide are sanctioned and managed by Winter Guard International. This is the governing organization that makes and changes the rules and regulations for this activity. The rules that are written by WGI apply to every Winter Guard group competing in the World Championships no matter what country they are from. The World Championships are held every year in the United States. Most recently they have been held at the [[UD Arena|
University of Dayton Arena]] in Dayton, Ohio with some prelims and semi-finals held elsewhere around the Dayton area and Cincinnati area.

The phrase "Sport of the Arts" is frequently associated with WGI. Winter guard is described by saying "it brings music to life through performance in a competitive format."

==Divisions and classes==

Because not every color guard has the same skill level, population, or resources available, WGI uses a class division system to help remedy this.  There are two divisions, '''Scholastic''' and '''Independent'''.  These divisions include the classes (in descending order) Independent: Independent World Class, Independent Open Class, Independent A Class. Scholastic: Scholastic World,  Scholastic Open, Scholastic National A Class, Scholastic Regional A, AA, and AAA. Novice Class and Cadet Class.

Guard teams can be chosen to move to a higher class, but they can only move down a class after a period of inactivity or after a WGI review. For every competition, any team which achieves a score higher than a predetermined threshold is automatically moved up, or "bumped", to the class above its current position, even mid-season.

The '''Scholastic division''' is made up of guards that have members that all attend the same high school or a feeder school of that high school. There are many colleges and universities that sponsor their own winter guards as well, but these guards typically compete as Independent guards. Scholastic guards vary greatly in their ability and resources because they are more dependent on support from sources other than the members themselves, such as their school's band and school funding.

In the Scholastic division, there are three classes: '''Scholastic A''', '''Scholastic Open''', and '''Scholastic World'''. More divisions may exist at the local/regional level, such as Regional A, or Novice. In many places there is also a middle school class, often called '''Cadet'''. Scholastic A teams tend to be a step above the regional level and are the lowest level to compete in WGI. Scholastic Open teams are an intermediate level for competition. The Scholastic World division includes the highest caliber of winter guard teams.

The '''Independent division''' is composed of winter guard teams that do not associate themselves with a school (the exception being university teams). Additionally, these kinds of guards can be much more selective of their members, choosing to be gender-specific or to only have certain numbers of members.

In the Independent division, much like the Scholastic division, there are the three classes: '''Independent A''', '''Independent Open''' and '''Independent World'''.  The breakdown of skill level and placement mirrors that of the Scholastic division. There are age restrictions in the Independent A and Open classes. A member can perform with an Independent A class group if they are 22 or younger as of March 31 of that year. A member can perform with an Independent Open class group if they are 23 or younger as of March 31 of that year.

==Winter guard circuits==

Although the goal of many winter guards is to compete in the WGI World Championships, most guard competitions take place in regional winter guard circuits. One such circuit is the AIA circuit, or Atlantic Indoor Association circuit in which teams across Virginia, Washington D.C., and North Carolina participate. These circuits are loosely organized and may not be formally affiliated with WGI. In many cases the circuits predate WGI by a number of years. For example, the Midwest Color Guard Circuit celebrated their 50th anniversary season in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midwestcolorguard.com/ MidWest Color Guard Circuit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They may also have different competitive structures with additional classes to those in WGI. Circuit classes often will include beginner or novice guards such as '''Cadet''', '''Novice''', '''B''', '''Regional AAA''',  '''Regional AA''', '''Regional A''', and '''Regional Open'''. Circuits generally score using WGI standards and judges whether they are formally affiliated with WGI or not.

In addition, the winter guard activity is growing outside of the United States. In Europe, Color Guard Nederland (Netherlands) (CGN) and Winter Guard United Kingdom (WGUK) have recently affiliated with organizations from France and Germany to form the [[European Indoor Arts Alliance]] (EIAA) with the goal of creating a European Union-wide platform for the growth of the color guard activity in Europe, where the scholastic branch of the activity does not exist.
