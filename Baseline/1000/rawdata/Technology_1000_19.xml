      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1766">'''Andy and Bill's law''' is a statement regarding the relationship between hardware and software upgrades. The law originates from a humorous one-liner told in the 1990s during computing conferences: "what Andy giveth, Bill taketh away." The phrase is a riff upon the business strategies of former [[Intel]] CEO [[Andy Grove]], and former CEO of [[Microsoft]], [[Bill Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/04/19/cz_rk_0419karlgaard.html#8594233740d6|title=Ten Laws Of The Modern World|last=Karlgaard|first=Rich|date=April 19, 2005|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel and Microsoft had entered into a lucrative partnership in the 1980s through to the 1990s, and the standard [[chipset|chipsets]] in Microsoft [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] were Intel brand. Despite the profit Intel gained from the deal, Grove felt that Gates wasn't making full use of the powerful capabilities of Intel chips, and that he was in fact refusing to upgrade his software to achieve optimum hardware performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/07/10/204258/index.htm|title=Why Andy Grove Can't Stop|last=Schlender|first=Brent|date=July 10, 1995|website=FORTUNE Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove's frustration with the dominance of Microsoft software over Intel hardware became public, which spawned the humorous catchphrase; and, later, Andy and Bill's law: that new software will always push ahead of hardware and get credit for the performance of the computer.

A '''barn cleaner''' is a device used to aid in the cleaning of [[tie-stall barn|tie-stall]] and [[stanchion barn]]s. It usually consists of a series of paddles [[chain link]]ed together, that move [[manure]] and other waste through a gutter and into a [[manure spreader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/dairyglossary.html | title=Dairy Glossary | publisher=Environmental Protection Agency | work=Ag 101 | accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cognitive computer''' combines [[artificial intelligence]] and machine-learning algorithms, in an approach which attempts to reproduce the behaviour of the human brain.&lt;ref name="modha-ns1"&gt;Dharmendra Modha (interview), "A computer that thinks", ''New Scientist'' 8 November 2014, Pages 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of [[neural network]] implementations of cognitive convolution and [[deep learning]] is provided by the [[IBM]] company's [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] machine. A subsequent development by IBM is the [[TrueNorth]] microchip architecture, which is designed to be closer in structure to the human brain than the [[von Neumann architecture]] used in conventional computers.&lt;ref name="modha-ns1" /&gt; In 2017 [[Intel]] announced its own version of a cognitive chip in "Loihi", which will be available to university and research labs in 2018.

==Intel Loihi chip==
Intel's self-learning neuromorphic chip, named Loihi, perhaps named after the Hawaiian seamount [[Loihi]], offers substantial power efficiency designed after the human brain. Intel claims Loihi is about 1000 times more energy efficient than the general-purpose computing power needed to train the neural networks that rival Loihi’s performance. 
In theory, this would support both machine learning training and inference on the same silicon independently of a cloud connection, and more efficient than using [[convolutional neural network]]s (CNNs) or [[deep learning]] [[neural network]]s. Intel points to a system for monitoring a person’s heartbeat, taking readings after events such as exercise or eating, and uses the cognitive computing chip to normalize the data and work out the ‘normal’ heartbeat. It can then spot abnormalities, but also deal with any new events or conditions.
{{pov-section|date=March 2018}}
The first iteration of the Loihi chip was made using Intel’s 14&amp;nbsp;nm fabrication process, and houses 128 clusters of 1,024 artificial neurons each for a total of 131,072 simulated neurons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-intel-built-a-neuromorphic-chip/ "Why Intel built a neuromorphic chip". September 29, 2017. www.ZDNet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This offers around 130 million synapses, which is still a rather long way from the human brain's 800 trillion synapses, and behind IBM’s [[TrueNorth]], which has around 16 billion by using  64 by 4,096 cores.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aitrends.com/future-of-ai/intel-unveils-loihi-neuromorphic/ "Intel unveils Loihi neuromorphic chip, chases IBM in artificial brains". October 17, 2017. AITrends.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==IBM TrueNorth Chip==
{{main|TrueNorth}}
The IBM cognitive computers implement learning using [[Hebbian theory]].  Instead of being programmable in a traditional sense within [[machine language]] or a higher level [[programming language]] such a device learns by inputting instances through an [[input device]] that are aggregated within a computational [[convolution]] or [[neural network]] architecture consisting of weights within a parallel memory system.  An early instantiation of such a device has been developed in 2012 under the [[Darpa]] [[SyNAPSE]] program at IBM directed by [[Dharmendra Modha]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014|reason=not detailed in the cited source}}

In 2017 this IBM 64-chip [[array data structure|array]] will contain the processing equivalent of 64 million neurons and 16 billion synapses, yet  each processor consumes just 10 watts of electricity.
Like other neural networks, this system will be put to use in pattern recognition and sensory processing roles. The Air Force wants to combine the [[TrueNorth]] ability to convert multiple data feeds &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;whether it's audio, video or text&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; into machine readable symbols with a conventional supercomputer's ability to crunch data.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
This isn't the first time that IBM's neural chip system has been integrated into cutting-edge technology. August, 2017 [[Samsung]] installed the chips in its Dynamic Vision Sensors enabling cameras to capture images at up to 2,000 fps while using just 300 milliwatts of power.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Criticism==
There are many approaches and definitions for a '''cognitive computer''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schank|first1=Roger C.|last2=Childers|first2=Peter G.|title=The cognitive computer: on language, learning, and artificial intelligence|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|date=1984|isbn=9780201064438|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oFQAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=cognitive+computer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other approaches may be more fruitful than the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Stephen|title=The Cognitive Computer: On Language, Learning, and Artificial Intelligence by Roger C. Schank, Peter Childers (review)|journal=Leonardo|date=1988|volume=21|issue=2|page=210|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/600644/summary|accessdate=13 January 2017|issn=1530-9282}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Specifically, there are critics who argue that a room-sized computer - like the case of Watson - is not a viable alternative to a three-pound human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metaskills: Five Talents for the Robotic Age|last=Neumeier|first=Marty|publisher=New Riders|year=2012|isbn=9780133359329|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also cite the difficulty for a single system to bring so many elements together such as the disparate sources of information as well as computing resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cognitive Computing and Big Data Analytics|last=Hurwitz|first=Judith|last2=Kaufman|first2=Marcia|last3=Bowles|first3=Adrian|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781118896624|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2018 [[World Economic Forum]], there are experts who claim that cognitive systems could adopt the biases of their developers and this was demonstrated in the case of the [[Google]] [[Computer vision|image-recognition]] or computer vision algorithm, which identified [[African Americans]] unfavorably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/18/world-economic-forum-ai-has-a-bias-problem-that-needs-to-be-fixed.html|title=A.I. has a bias problem that needs to be fixed: World Economic Forum|last=Choudhury|first=Saheli Roy|date=2018-09-18|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4057">The '''Collingridge dilemma''' is a methodological quandary in which efforts to influence&lt;!--/contribute to--&gt; or control the further development&lt;!--/impact/..--&gt; of technology face a [[double bind|double-bind problem]]:
* An information problem: impacts cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used.
* A [[Power (philosophy)|power]] problem: control or change is difficult when the technology has become entrenched.
The idea was coined by David Collingridge, The [[University of Aston]], Technology Policy Unit, in his 1980 book ''The Social Control of Technology''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Social Control of Technology'' (New York: St. Martin's Press; London: Pinter) {{ISBN|0-312-73168-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dilemma is a basic point of reference in [[technology assessment]] debates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itas.fzk.de/tatup/092/boeh09a.htm Article] by K. Böhle in TATuP, September 2009, pp. 121-125 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In "This Explains Everything," edited by [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]], technology critic [[Evgeny Morozov]] explains Collingridge's idea by quoting Collingridge himself: "When change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen; when the need for change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult, and time-consuming." &lt;ref&gt;"This Explains Everything" (Harper Perennial, 2013, p.255, {{ISBN|0062230174}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Pacing Problem, the Collingridge Dilemma &amp; [[Technological Determinism]]" by [[Adam Thierer]], a senior research fellow at the [[Mercatus Center]] at [[George Mason University]], the Collingridge dilemma is related to the "pacing problem" in technology regulation. The "pacing problem" refers to the notion that technological innovation is increasingly outpacing the ability of laws and regulations to keep up, first explained in [[Larry Downes]]' 2009 book ''[[The Laws of Disruption]]'', in which he famously states that "technology changes exponentially, but social, economic, and legal systems change incrementally". In Thierer's essay, he tries to correlate these two concepts by saying that "the 'Collingridge dilemma' is simply a restatement of the pacing problem but with greater stress on the social drivers behind the pacing problem and an implicit solution to 'the problem' in the form of preemptive control of new technologies while they are still young and more manageable."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techliberation.com/2018/08/16/the-pacing-problem-the-collingridge-dilemma-technological-determinism/|title=The Pacing Problem, the Collingridge Dilemma &amp; Technological Determinism|date=2018-08-16|work=Technology Liberation Front|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely-adopted solution to Collingridge dilemma is the "[[Precautionary principle|Precautionary Principle]]", the belief that new innovations should not be embraced "until their developers can prove that they will not cause any harm to individuals, groups, specific entities, cultural norms, or various existing laws, norms, or traditions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If they fail to do so, this innovation should be "prohibited, curtailed, modified, junked, or ignored". &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=What technology wants|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|publisher=Viking Press|year=2010|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach received criticisms from technology critics like [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] who believe the contour of such principle is ill-defined&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and such principle is biased against anything new because it drastically elevates threshold for anything innovative. According to American philosopher [[Max More]], the Precautionary Principle "is very good for one thing—stopping technological progress...not because it leads in bad directions, but because it leads in no direction at all."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

}}
A [[railway]] or [[railroad]] is a [[Track (rail transport)|track]] where the vehicle travels over two [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] [[steel]] [[I-beam|bars]], called [[Rail profile|rails]]. The rails   support and guide the wheels of the vehicles, which are traditionally either [[train]]s or [[tram]]s. Modern [[light rail]] is a relatively new innovation which combines aspects of those two modes of transport. However fundamental differences in the track and wheel design are important, especially where trams or light railways and trains have to share a section of track, as sometimes happens in congested areas.

== Terminology ==
 [[File:Flanged wheel.jpg|thumb|300px|A flanged wheel on a train]]

Both trams and trains  have [[flange]]d iron [[wheel]]s with a horizontal section transferring the vehicle  weight to the rail and a vertical flange "inboard" to guide the vehicle along the rail using its inside edge.

==Difference in technique in curves==
[[Tram|Rail vehicle]] wheels are usually mounted on a solid [[axle]], so they turn at the same speed. When a vehicle turns the outer wheel has to travel further than the inner wheel. On a road vehicle, this is usually achieved by allowing the wheels to move independently, and fixing the front wheels in an arrangement known as [[Ackermann steering geometry]].

Trains and trams can turn corners without wheel-slip because the outer horizontal part of the wheels has a slightly [[Cone (geometry)|tapered]] [[Rim (wheel)#Railroad usage|rim]]. The guide [[flange]] (ridge) is on the inside to prevent the vehicle from slipping sideways off the rails. The horizontal (cone-shaped) rim makes contact with the slightly [[wiktionary:convex|convex]] top of a steel [[Rail profile|rail]] in different (horizontal) places so that the outer wheel has a larger effective diameter than the inner wheel.

With both tram and train wheels, this happens naturally because the tires are cone shaped sloping surfaces: the inside diameter is a few millimeters larger than the outside. As the track starts to curve, the train tries to run straight. The wheel flange presses against the side of the curved rail so the "contact point" between rail and wheel moves a few [[millimeter]]s outwards, making the effective diameter of the outer wheel temporarily larger, and equally opposite: the effective diameter of the inner wheel effectively becomes temporarily smaller. This technique works well on large-radius curves which are [[cant (road/rail)|canted]], but not as well on tight curves and railway [[Railroad switch|switches]] (also known as "points"). This is because the [[Track geometry|geometry]] or cant of the track is more difficult to optimize for every possible combination of vehicle and direction of travel.

City trams often use tight curves - sometimes with a [[Minimum railway curve radius|radius]] of much less than about {{convert|20|m|1}}, and canting may be impossible because the surface is shared with road vehicles or [[pedestrian zones]] or [[sidewalk]]s, so the track often has to be flush with the [[road surface]] or pavement. In sharp curves, the rail grooves are sometimes made very shallow&lt;!-- Yea right, who rolls those? --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}, which causes the outer wheel to temporarily ride up onto the edge of its flange. This increases the wheel diameter and the curve can be taken more easily. In extreme cases, the rail has a groove so that the rim of the flange can take most of the weight, the "out-board" tire (on the outer radius of the outer rail) acting as no more than a vertical plate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} &lt;!-- This sounds like nonsense --&gt;

In contrast, a train wheel is almost never designed to transfer weight through the flange rim, and some train wheels may be damaged if this should happen even once.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} &lt;!-- This sounds like nonsense --&gt;

The point where two straight but intersecting railroads cross is called a [[Railroad turnout#Frog .28common crossing.29|frog]]. A groove through each rail allows the wheel flanges to pass through the intersecting rails. Without countermeasures each wheel would dip into the groove and strike the frog point gap causing unacceptable wear. The point where two tracks join and the vehicle can take one of two directions is called a [[railway switch]]. This works on the same principle, except that the inner rail is almost continuous and the outer rail has a gap for the flange to pass through.

With a train this problem is solved by using a wide tire. Train [[Rail profile|rails]] usually cross at a shallow [[angle]]. In the middle of the interchange there is a supporting frog. The tire is guided on each side by guide rails and some portion of the tire always maintains rail contact. This method is not feasible with trams and light railways.{{According to whom|date=July 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Tram tires are generally narrower than train tires. Trams use bigger crossing angles and tighter [[Minimum railway curve radius|curve radii]] are more likely than for train tracks. To cope with this difficulty the wheels of trams temporarily transfer the weight of the tram onto the flange to reduce wear on both the frog point and the horizontal surface of the tram wheels. Train wheels are not designed to bear such weight on their flanges.&lt;!-- That's all nonsense --&gt;{{According to whom|date=July 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

A tram wheel which runs on the flange rather than on the horizontal tyre has a larger effective diameter, so the distance travelled per revolution is greater. On the outside track of the curve this is an advantage. It may be necessary to compensate the inner wheel or allow for some slippage. Modern trams and trams tend to have thicker and wider tires which allow for a greater (horizontal) conical section and so greater effective diameter variation and turning ability.

== Interoperability problems ==
[[Image:TreinTramwielprofiel.svg|thumb|200px|Difference in form and profile of the wheel and the rail of a train (left, blue) and a tram (right, green).]]
At the [[Junction (rail)|junctions]] of [[Track (rail transport)|train tracks]], the gap in the frog or switch rail is wide. &lt;!-- and deep.  Because train wheels are larger and wider and the flanges do not have to carry vertical loads, they can be designed to cope with gaps in the rail which might defeat the smaller tram-wheels.  this sounds like pure nonsense --&gt;  So [[tram]]s can be accommodated.
&lt;!-- Since tram flanges are generally unable to carry the weight of the vehicle, a tram with traditional wheels cannot drive on train rails without "falling into the gap" designed for the flanges of train cars on the crossing line. Modern [[light rail]], [[tram]], or [[tram-train]] equipment, using tram rails in city centers, and on interurban sections of train railroads now have interoperable flanges combined with wide tires. {{Clarify|date=May 2014}}--&gt;
&lt;!--what is an interoperable flange? this sounds like pure nonsense --&gt;

The main problem with a train on tram rails is the relatively narrow width of frog and switch gaps and [[Groove (engineering)|channels]] of the [[groove rail]]s designed to accommodate the narrow flanges of tram wheels &lt;!-- on the crossing line --&gt;. The wider flanges of train wheels increase the risk of derailment at these points. On routes where train carriages are driven on tram tracks (as in the past in parts of [[Trams in The Hague|The Hague]]), wider &lt;!-- and deeper --&gt; grooves  are required as a compromise that is practical as wide grooved [[girder rail]] is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wirthrail.com/en/product_girder.htm Wirth Girder Rail]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skelton-metals.com/railsections_eurogirderguardrail.htm Grooved or girder rail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231441/http://www.skelton-metals.com/railsections_eurogirderguardrail.htm |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantictrack.com/international/espanol/pdf/MRT_Brochure.pdf MRT Track &amp; Services Co., Inc / Krupp, T and girder rails, scroll down.]&lt;/ref&gt; A larger [[structure gauge]] would also be required &lt;!-- , requiring greater care and lower speeds for both types of vehicle.  this sounds like pure nonsense --&gt;  This was also done in [[Pacific Electric|Los Angeles]] and in [[British Columbia Electric Railway|Vancouver]] as well as elsewhere in North America. The usually or normally limited structure gauge, and [[Minimum railway curve radius|tight curves]], on tram tracks will also prevent [[train]]s from using tram tracks.

In North America the groove would have to be a minimum of {{convert|2+1/8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wide and by extension, the maximum distance between the inside faces of the guard flanges of the grooved rails can be no more than {{convert|52+1/4|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}, see below.

 Design tolerances
 Design tolerances that affect the lateral displacement of the body include the following:	
1. Lateral tolerance between wheels and rails	
Two types of flanges are permitted on railroad wheels - narrow and wide. The maximum
lateral movement T1 possible for a new wheel set centered on in-gage track is a function of
the flange type and is determined by the following formula:	
CAUTION: Use only English Units in Formulas in this Recommended Practice	

 T1 = .5[gt-(gw+2fn)]
 = .59375” ({{convert|0.59375|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=output only}})  for narrow-flange wheels
 = .375" ({{convert|0.375|in|mm|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) for wide-flange wheels	

Where: gt = standard track gage at a point “5/8” ({{convert|5/8|in|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) below top of rail = 56.5" ({{convert|56.5|in|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=output only}})
 
gw = minimum gage of wheel set between backs of flanges = 53” ({{convert|53|in|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=output only}})
 
fn = minimum thickness of new wheel flange = 1.15625” ({{convert|1.15625|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) for narrow flange or = 1.375" ({{convert|1.375|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) for wide flange

Rural and suburban lines can be made compatible for use by several types of vehicles. For example, the [[narrow gauge railway]] used by [[Charleroi Metro]] in [[Belgium]] is ridden by trams, but the tracks are built to train track standards.&lt;!-- which does not permit the vertical load to be borne by the flange --&gt;&lt;!-- Nonsense --&gt; Trams nonetheless run smoothly on the old [[Vicinal tramway|NMVB]] tram net in [[Anderlues]], where shallow groove rails are used{{According to whom|date=September 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}. Between The Hague and [[Rotterdam]], an old railway line was converted for [[RandstadRail]] into a route able to carry both the [[Rotterdam Metro]], which uses vehicles built to train standards as well as [[Trams in The Hague|The Hague trams]] which uses vehicles built to tram standards. The [[Electroliner]]s which ran out of [[Chicago]] on the [[Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad]], and afterwards on the [[Norristown High Speed Line]], were another example.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8092">'''COSMOS''' stands for "'''COSMetic Organic and Natural Standard'''", which sets certification requirements for [[Organic product|organic]] and [[Natural product|natural]] [[cosmetics]] products in the [[Europe]]. The standard is recognized globally by the [[cosmetic industry]]. By adhering to specific guidelines, cosmetics marketers can use COSMOS signatures, which are registered [[trademark]]s, on packaging to confirm the products meet minimum industry requirements to be considered organic or natural.&lt;ref name="Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alex|first1=Cosper|title=Understanding COSMOS - the COSMetics organic and natural standard|url=https://www.desjardin.fr/en/blog/understanding-cosmos-the-cosmetics-organic-and-natural-standard|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2002 five European organisations responsible for setting organic and natural cosmetics [[International standard|standard]]s met at a trade show to share ideas for broader standards to be used globally. These five COSMOS members are:

* BDIH (Germany)
* Cosmebio (France)
* [[Ecocert]] Greenlife SAS (France)
* ICEA (Italy)
* [[Soil Association]] (Great Britain)
Over 1,600 [[manufacturer]]s who sell over 25,000 products across over 45 countries follow the standard, according to Cosmos-standard.org. About 85% of the certified cosmetics industry uses COSMOS signatures on its products.

Although the five members differed on certain standards separately, they were able to smooth out differences to create a harmonised international standard that was first published in 2010. At this time the five members formed a non-profit international association overseeing the standard. In June 2010 the COSMOS-standard AISBL was awarded [[Royal Assent]] from [[Belgium#Politics|Belgian authorities]]. The documents published with the standard include:

* The Control Manual: describes how the control systems works
* The Labeling Rules: explains how to use COSMOS labels
* The Technical Guide: additional information&lt;ref name="The COSMOS-standard"&gt;{{cite web|title=The COSMOS-standard|url=https://cosmos-standard.org/the-cosmos-standard/|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosper-Understanding-COSMOS" /&gt;

==Certification and Labeling Process==

There are four main [[certification]] signatures that comprise the COSMOS-standard, which are for ORGANIC, NATURAL, COSMOS CERTIFIED and COSMOS APPROVED products. Here are six steps to gaining approval of product labeling within the certification process:

# The authorized COSMOS-standard certification body must first approve of the product specification. 
# 
# The applicant must submit their proposed product labeling to the certification body and await approval. Generic label designs for certain single-ingredient product are acceptable if the design is consistent for all products.
# 
# In the event the product specification is not approved first, the labeling can only get provisional approval.
# 
# Only after full approval of the labeling is granted by the certification body can the manufacturer print the labelling. The certification process must be completed before the labels can be used commercially. 
# 
# If the manufacturer needs to make changes to the product or labeling after gaining certification, they must notify the certification body and wait for written approval or a certificate update. Further approval from the certification body will be needed if the manufacturer makes changes to the organic percentage of the ingredients. The vendor will also have to make an amendment to the ingredients. 
# 
# Before the product can be launched, the labeling must be approved by the certification body and the product must be listed on the COSMOS-standard certificate. Printing labels without first getting approval can lead to certification withdrawal if the certification body determines the products and labels are non-compliant.&lt;ref name="CosmosStandard-PDF"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Cosmetics organic and natural standard Version 2.0 – 21st October 2013|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/cosmos-standard-v2-21102013.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Technical"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Technical Guide Version 2.11 09/05/2017|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cosmos20technical20guide20v2-1120090517202.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Labeling Requirements==

Manufacturers and marketers are only allowed to use COSMOS terms and signatures for products authorized by the certification body. The certification body must be identified on product labels if it is not clearly mentioned anywhere else on the product. In cases in which the label size restricts product labeling, the certification body may allow flexibility as long as the product maintains the general principles of the Labeling Guide. The firm must at least mention the nature of the certification (such as organic or natural) and the identity of the certification body.&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Labeling"&gt;{{cite web|title=COSMOS-standard Labelling Guide Version 2.4 – 28 June 2017|url=https://cosmosstandard.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/cosmos-standard20labelling20guide20v2-420280617.pdf|publisher=COSMOS-standard AISBL|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product Identification==

Marketers are allowed to use the COSMOS terms and signatures on company letterhead and websites under certain conditions. All the products of a brand must be certified organic in order for the company to make the claim they are "COSMOS ORGANIC certified." Otherwise, the firm must be clear that only specific products have been certified organic. In other words, the use of the terms and signatures must not be misleading to the consumer.

Essentially, the labelling must clearly and accurately describe the product, which must comply with the standard. The marketer must avoid listing ingredients or naming the product in a way that implies it contains certain ingredients that are not present. Any use or branding of the term "organic," for example, must comply with the organic standard and not be confusing to the consumer.

The [[labeling]] must not confuse the terms "organic" and "natural," which have separate definitions and certifications based on the way the products and ingredients are processed. If a brand sells several organic products and a few natural products, they must make it clear in their labeling and marketing the differences. The firm must also be clear if some of its products have no certification at all. In other words, in order for a company to promote itself as "COSMOS ORGANIC certified," its entire range of products must meet the organic standard and be certified.

Companies are not allowed to use [[logo]]s or seals that may mislead customers into believing the products are COSMOS certified.&lt;ref name="CosmosStandard-PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COSMOS-Labeling" /&gt;

'''Critical technical practice''' is [[critical theory]] based approach towards technological design proposed by [[Phil Agre]] where [[critical theory|critical]] and [[cultural studies|cultural]] theories are brought to bear in the work of designers and [[engineer]]s. One of the goals of critical technical practice is to increase awareness and critical reflection on the hidden assumptions, ideologies and values underlying technology design.

== Pedagogy of Critical Technical Practice ==
 
A different fork of Critical Technical Practice from Agre’s root (Agre, 1997) was initiated at the former Centre for Cultural Studies between 2007-2017, Goldsmiths, University of London as a way to examine, the live techno-social aspects of contemporary digital culture. This stream of Critical Technical Practice (CTP) at its most broad use can be described as the formation of thought and action that incorporates art as a method of enquiry. This is a compacted intellectual form, that makes the space between the technical, theory and practice ambiguous. A typical digital culture class would make/explore things, attempting to explain the phenomena caught in the lens of a project or proposition. 
 
An example of a class may clarify this approach. We might propose that the class create a simple (DOS) denial of service attack on a test remote server by learning to code computers for the first time. It is empowering for students to find out how quickly they can code. The class would learn how to do this from T.J. Connor’s book Violent Python. After the group had reached a self-satisfied tingle of radicalism the group would be asked to look up the author and would find that Connor is a top grade US Military expert. The group would then look at the books distribution and market penetration and be encouraged to question the affective logics, politics and culture of the book, reflect on why the workshop had been constructed the way it was, and their own learning in different registers of technicality, politics of information and personal critic and empowerment was achieved. 
 
Critical Technical Practice then is not necessarily a reduction of phenomena to literature or a system of logics, but can instead be thought of as knowledge incorporated into a thing that the class created, look at or pointed too, through revealing a certain type of gaze.  A prerequisite of Critical Practice is that incorporates this form of gaze is thinking through the formation of oneself as a thinker, actor in the world. Enquiring into one's pre-existence helps understand the structuring of potential that has informed what one has become, what one could easily recognise, and what one could easily achieve. This is not a summation of limit but an acknowledgement of the hard work needed to escape a pre-existence, as it may relate to the four pillars of repression, class, gender, sexuality and race. The situated knowledge of family and friends, their relation to making things, to popular culture, to oral histories, to struggles with money or law, reading, writing and speaking, all inform this process. 
 
To this end, CTP is partially related to a schizoanalysis of Foucault's question  “What are we today?” (Foucault 1984: pp. 42ff.) The class is always encouraged to unfold what conditions, constrain, control, resist, govern, determine this moment and not another? What patterns of recognition are we privileging and why does it blind us to others? How does language restrict us at the very moment we are able to say something? How can this engagement be born anew in every instance?

A '''cyber-dissident''' is a professional journalist, an activist or [[citizen journalist]] who posts news, information, or commentary on the [[internet]] that implies criticism of a [[government]] or [[regime]].

The practice of cyber-dissidence may have been inaugurated by Dr. Daniel Mengara, a [[Gabon]]ese scholar and activist living in political exile in [[New Jersey]] in the United States. In 1998, he created a website in French whose name ''Bongo Doit Partir'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bdpgabon.org Bongo Doit Partir]'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;/ref&gt; was clearly indicative of its purpose: it encouraged a revolution against the then 29-year-old regime of [[Omar Bongo]] in Gabon. The original URL, http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/|title=Bongo Doit Partir - Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau|website=www.globalwebco.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to redirect to http://www.bdpgabon.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdpgabon.org|title=Bongo Doit Partir - Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau|website=www.bdpgabon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 2000. Inaugurating what was to become common current-day practice in the politically involved [[blogosphere]], this movement's attempt at rallying the Gabonese around revolutionary ideals and actions has ultimately been vindicated by the 2011 [[Tunisia]]n and [[Egypt]]ian revolutions, where the Internet has proved to be an effective tool for instigating successful critique, opposition and revolution against dictators.

At least two [[Non-profit organizations|nonprofit organizations]] are currently working to raise awareness of the contributions of cyber-dissidents and to defend them against the [[human rights]] violations to which some of them are subjected:  [[Global Voices Online]] and [[Reporters Without Borders]].  The latter has released a ''Handbook For Bloggers and Cyber-Dissidents''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001152614/https://rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542|title=Reporters sans frontières - Handbook for bloggers and cyber-dissidents|archivedate=1 October 2005|publisher=|url=https://rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a roster of currently imprisoned cyber-dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206155535/http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=119|title=Reporters sans frontières - Cyberdissidents imprisoned|archivedate=6 February 2007|publisher=|url=http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee to Protect Bloggers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216041912/http://committeetoprotectbloggers.org/|title=Committee to Protect Bloggers|archivedate=16 December 2008|publisher=|url=http://committeetoprotectbloggers.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4278241.stm|title=Global blogger action day called|date=22 February 2005|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions where [[Print media|print]] and [[Broadcast media|broadcast]] media are tightly controlled, [[Anonymity|anonymous]] online postings by cyber-dissidents may be the only source of information about the experiences, feelings, and opinions of ordinary citizens.  This advantage may be offset by the difficulty in assessing the [[good faith]] and accuracy of reports originating from anonymous sources.

Recently, social-media tools have been widely credited with igniting pervasive social upheavals, some of which have even brought down governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=John G.|date=2014-01-01|title=Sartre and Cyber-Dissidence: The Groupe en Fusion and the Putative We-Subject|url=https://www.berghahnjournals.com/abstract/journals/sartre-studies/20/1/ssi200102.xml|journal=Sartre Studies International|language=en-US|volume=20|issue=1|doi=10.3167/ssi.2014.200102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution==
{{Main|Political repression of cyber-dissidents}}

===Gabon===
In July 2003, [[Amnesty International]] reported the arrest of five Gabonese known to be members of the cyber-dissident group ''Bongo Doit Partir''. The five members were detained for three months (See: Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/001/2003/en|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/004/2003/en|title=Document|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===China===
In 2003, [[Cai Lujun]] was imprisoned for posting a series of articles online under the pen name "盼民主"("expecting for democracy") criticizing the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/index.phpd?showsingle=45625] Cai Lujun, Imprisoned for Posting Internet Articles, Released at End of Sentence&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
In 2006, several [[blog]]gers in Egypt were arrested for allegedly defaming the president [[Hosni Mubarak]] and expressing critical views about Islam &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6164798.stm Egypt arrests another blog critic], ''[[BBC News]]'', 20 November 2006.  Retrieved on 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
In 2005, Mohamad Reza Nasab Abdolahi was imprisoned for publishing an open letter to [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]]; Mohamad's pregnant wife and other bloggers who commented on Mohamad's treatment were also imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, A. (2005), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4111330.stm Not just critics], ''[[BBC News]]'', 20 June 2005.  Retrieved on 29 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
When Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2006 called on his nation's women to have more children, journalist Vladimir Rakhmankov published a satiric article on the Internet calling Putin "''the nation's [[phallus|phallic symbol]]''". Rakhmankov was found guilty of offending Vladimir Putin, and fined by the court of the region he lived in to the sum equal of 680 USD. The overall story served as a good adversiting for Rakhmanov's article, that was republished by numerous Russian sources afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdf.ru/digest/digest/digest298e.shtml#part|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211509/http://www.gdf.ru/digest/digest/digest298e.shtml#part|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 September 2007|title=GLASNOST DEFENSE FOUNDATION'S DIGEST No. 298|date=27 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/6/DF7B2E15-2F9F-4A8B-AAF0-A7622F0D33F7.html Russia: 'Phallic' Case Threatens Internet Freedom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111065759/http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/6/DF7B2E15-2F9F-4A8B-AAF0-A7622F0D33F7.html |date=11 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1071549.html|title=U.S. Media Watchdog Criticizes Russia|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Russian bloggers has supposed in 2003, that Russian state security service [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]], the main successor to the [[KGB]], created special teams of people who appear on various blogs to [[harass]] and [[intimidate]] [[political blog]]gers and thus effectively prevent free discussion of undesirable subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vestnik.com/issues/2003/0430/win/polyanskaya_krivov_lomko.htm|title=Анна ПОЛЯНСКАЯ, Андрей КРИВОВ, Иван ЛОМКО: ВИРТУАЛЬНОЕ ОКО СТАРШЕГО БРАТА [WIN]|website=www.vestnik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They referred to such tactics are known as "[[active measures]]". A Russian critic of this theory has noted in 2003, that security services have more important tasks than flooding in forums.&lt;ref name="Usup"&gt;[http://old.russ.ru/politics/20030426-yusup-pr.html Conspiracy theory], by Alexander Yusupovskiy, Russian Journal, 25 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The [[Digital Freedom Network]] has pointed out cases of imprisoning cyber-dissidents in Vietnam, such as the 2004 case of [[Pham Que Dong]], a former [[Vietnam People's Army|People's Army]] colonel, military [[historian]] who had quit the Communist Party in 1999.  For publicly discussing issues related to corruption in the official structures and encouraging democratic reforms, he was charged with "abuse of democratic freedoms" and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Digital Freedom Network]] 30 July 2004: [http://www.dfn.org/VietnamsHumanRights.shtml Vietnam's Human Rights Situation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080737/http://www.dfn.org/VietnamsHumanRights.shtml |date=28 September 2007 }} by [[Alicia Burns]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1566">The '''DigRF''' working group was formed as a [[Mobile Industry Processor Interface|MIPI Alliance]] (MIPI) [[working group]] in April 2007. The group is focused on developing specifications for wireless mobile [[RFIC]] to base-band IC ([[BBIC]]) interfaces in mobile devices.

The group's current charter is split into short-term and long-term development efforts. The short-term development will focus on a specification targeted for completion by end of 2007 for [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]] and [[WiMax]] [[air interface]] standards. The longer term development will focus on future air interface standards which promise further improvements in high speed, data optimized traffic. In addition, the future work will seek to harmonize efforts with the MIPI's [[PHY]] and [[UniPro]] working groups.

These specifications will describe the logical, electrical and timing characteristics of the digital RF-BB Interface with sufficient detail to allow physical implementation of the interface, and with sufficient rigor that implementations of the interface from different suppliers are fully compatible at the physical level.

There is DigRF version v1.12 for usage in GSM/EDGE handsets, which was specified in 2004. DigRF v3.09 from the year 2006 with its 312 Mbit/s can additionally handle [[UMTS]]. The present DigRF v4 draft offers Gbit/s bandwidth for LTE and WiMax.

'''Digital detox''' refers to a period of time during which a person refrains from using electronic connecting devices such as smartphones and computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/digital_detox|title=digital detox {{!}} Definition of digital detox in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as an opportunity to reduce stress, focus more on social interaction and connection with nature in the physical world. Claimed benefits include increased [[mindfulness]], lowered anxiety, and an overall better appreciation of one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/digital-detox_n_5589474|title=Here's One Big Sign It's Time To Reevaluate Your Relationship With Your Phone|date=2014-07-16|work=HuffPost|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francesbooth/2014/06/13/how-to-do-a-digital-detox/#67da105b65a4|title=How To Do A Digital Detox|last=Booth|first=Frances|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;There have been many stories where a digital detox has lead to a more refreshed feeling along the people involved. They described there digital detox as a "getaway" in some aspect. When people get caught up in how much they need to do, the overuse of technology becomes prevalent. This even becomes the case in a social context; people want to make sure they're up to date on the latest news stories, Instagram posts, political tweets etc. and to do this, they need to stay plugged in. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Brown, Sally (Feb 2014). "Switch off: feel chained to your smartphone? Perhaps you're in need of a digital detox" (PDF). ''sallybrowntherapy.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smartphones, laptops, and tablets, combined with the increasing wireless Internet accessibility, enable technology users to constantly be connected to the digital world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Morrison, S., &amp; Gomez, R. (2014). "Pushback: The Growth of Expressions of Resistance to Constant Online Connectivity" (PDF). In iConference 2014 Proceedings (p. 1-15).&lt;/ref&gt;Constant online connectivity may have a negative impact on the users’ experience with electronic connecting devices and result in a wish to temporarily refrain from communication technology usage.

In one study in Mind, 95% of those interviewed said their mood improved after putting down their phones to spend time outside, changing from depressed, stressed, and anxious to more calm and balanced. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/enhance-your-wellbeing/environment/nature-and-us/how-does-nature-impact-our-wellbeing|title=How Does Nature Impact Our Wellbeing? {{!}} Taking Charge of Your Health &amp; Wellbeing|website=Taking Charge of Your Health &amp; Wellbeing|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivations behind digital detoxing vary. In some cases, the motivation is negative emotional responses to the technology usage, such as dissatisfaction or disappointment of the technology device and its functions. In other cases, users see the technology as a distracting factor that consumes time and energy and wants to take back control over their everyday lives. Some people have moral, ethical or political reasons to refrain from technology usage. Furthermore, a concern of developing addictive behavior in terms of tech addiction or [[Internet addiction disorder]] is one of the motivations for disconnecting for a period of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;This excessive technology usage can be considered an addiction. It's said that around 50% of smartphone users check their account 5 minutes prior to going to bed and within 5 minutes post waking up. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.adgully.com/smartphone-owners-increasingly-obsessed-with-their-devices-deloitte-study-63842.html|title=Smartphone owners in India are increasingly obsessed with their devices: Deloitte Mobile Consumer Survey 2015|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant engagement with digital connecting devices at the workplace is claimed to lead to increased stress levels and reduce productivity. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ayyagari|first=Ramakrishna|last2=Grover|first2=Varun|last3=Purvis|first3=Russell|date=2011|title=Technostress: Technological Antecedents and Implications|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41409963|journal=MIS Quarterly|volume=35|issue=4|pages=831–858|doi=10.2307/41409963}}&lt;/ref&gt;Certain characteristics of the technology make it more difficult to distinguish work from leisure. Moreover, being continually connected increases the number of interruptions at work. Allowing employees to disconnect for a part of the day in order to truly focus on their work without disturbance from colleagues is claimed to be beneficial to the productivity and work environment. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''To combat the effects of constant digital exposure, there are digital detox retreats held for select numbers of people. It's an average of 12 people per week getting detoxed for a little less than $600 dollars including flights.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In certain cultures, constant work is encouraged and taking breaks are sometimes even discouraged. This is due to the idea that a break equals a lack of productivity. In the Indian culture, this is extremely prevalent; there have even been studies to back these ideas up. It's said that more than half of Indians check their work and social emails constantly. Even while vacationing, about 30% admitted that they had an irresistible urge to check and post on social media. There is also a significant estimated 30% difference between people being willing to leave their laptops at home compared to people being willing to leave their smartphones at home. It's admitted that if work wasn't a factor a lot of Indians wouldn't constantly be on their devices and stay unplugged. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcquest.com/time-digital-detox/|title=Time for Digital Detox - PCQuest|date=2018-01-10|work=PCQuest|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connecting devices’ multitasking character has a serious impact on the learning ability. Multitasking implies operating on a surface level, which only involves the short-time memory. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/10540261/screen-time-ipad-tablet-digital-detox-difital-addiction.html|title=Switch off – it’s time for your digital detox|last=Smith|first=Julia Llewellyn|date=2013-12-28|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;Using multiple connecting devices as learning platforms is therefore not beneficial. A reduction of information choices enables the brain to focus more on the quality of the information rather than the hastiness of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/9_1/brabazon9_1.html|title=Time for a digital detox? - Tara Brabazon - Fast Capitalism 9.1|website=www.uta.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12339">'''Document automation''' (also known as '''document assembly''') is the design of systems and [[workflow]]s that assist in the creation of [[electronic document]]s. These include logic-based systems that use segments of pre-existing text and/or data to assemble a new document. This process is increasingly used within certain industries to assemble legal documents, contracts and letters. Document automation systems can also be used to automate all conditional text, variable text, and data contained within a set of documents.

Automation systems allow companies to minimize data entry, reduce the time spent proof-reading, and reduce the risks associated with [[human error]]. Additional benefits include: time and financial savings due to decreased paper handling, document loading, storage, distribution, postage/shipping, faxes, telephone, labor and waste.

== Document assembly ==
The basic functions are to replace the cumbersome manual filling in of repetitive documents with template-based systems where the user answers software-driven interview questions or data entry screen. The information collected then populates the document to form a good first draft'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/2/170 Article: Disrupting Conventional Law Firm Business Models using Document Assembly] Mountain, Int J Law Info Tech., 2006; 0: eal019v1&lt;/ref&gt; Today's more advanced document automation systems allow users to create their own data and rules (logic) without the need for programming.

While document automation software is used primarily in the [[law|legal]], [[financial services]], and [[risk management]] industries, it can be used in any industry that creates transaction-based documents.  A good example of how document automation software can be used is with [[commercial mortgage]] documents. A typical commercial mortgage transaction can include several documents including:
* [[promissory note]]
* environmental indemnity
* [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]]
* [[mortgage law|mortgage]]
* [[guaranty]]
Some of these documents can contain as many as 80 to 100 pages, with hundreds of optional paragraphs and data elements. Document automation software has the ability to automatically fill in the correct document variables based on the transaction data. In addition, some document automation software has the ability to create a document suite where all related documents are encapsulated into one file, making updates and collaboration easy and fast. Established companies in this field includes the likes of Contract Express from Thomson Reuters

Simpler software applications that are easier to learn can also be used to automate the preparation of documents, without undue complexity. For example, Pathagoras holds itself out as a 'plain text, no fields allowed' document assembly system. Clipboard managers allow the user to save frequently-used text fragments, organize them into logical groups, and then quickly access them to paste into final documents.

== In supply chain management ==
There are many documents used in [[logistics]]. They are called: [[invoice]]s, [[packing list]]s/slips/sheets (manifests), content lists, pick tickets, arrival acknowledgement [[form (document)|form]]s/[[reports]] of many types (e.g. [[MSDS]], damaged goods, returned goods, detailed/summary, etc.), [[import]]/[[export]], [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]], [[bill of lading]] (BOL), etc. These documents are usually the [[contracts]] between the [[consignee]] and the [[consignor]], so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary, like a [[third party logistics]] company (3PL) and [[governments]]. [[Document]] handling within [[logistics]], [[supply chain management]] and [[distribution center]]s is usually performed [[manual labor]] or semi-automatically using [[bar code scanner]]s, [[software]] and tabletop [[laser printer]]s. There are some [[manufacturer]]s of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed [[wallet]]/pouch to the [[shipping container]] (usually a flexible [[polybag]] or [[corrugated fiberboard]]/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems. Protection of Privacy and [[Identity Theft]] are major concerns, especially with the increase of [[e-Commerce]], [[Internet]]/[[Online shopping]] and [[Shopping channel]] (other, past references are catalogue and [[mail order]] shopping) making it more important than ever to guarantee the correct document is married or associated to the correct order or shipment every time. Software that produce documents are: [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]], [[Warehouse management system|WMS]], [[Transportation management system|TMS]], legacy [[middleware]] and most accounting packages.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

A number of research projects have looked into wider [[standardization]] and automation of documents in the [[Freight transport|freight industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efreightproject.eu/default.aspx|title=e-FREIGHT is an Integrated project within the EU's 7th Framework programme|publisher=e-Freight|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530094924/http://www.efreightproject.eu/default.aspx|archivedate=30 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[IATA]].

== In legal services ==
The role of automation technology in the production of legal documents has been widely recognised. For example, [[Richard Susskind]]’s book ‘The End of Lawyers’ looks at the use of document automation software that enables clients to generate employment contracts and Wills with the use of an online interview or decision tree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/blogs/in-business-blog/who039s-afraid-computer-generation Article Who's afraid of computer generation?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231175351/http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/blogs/in-business-blog/who039s-afraid-computer-generation |date=2010-12-31 }} Eduardo Reyes (Thursday 28 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Susskind regards Document Assembly as one of 10 '[[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]]' that are altering the face of the legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;The End of Lawyers?: Rethinking the Nature of Legal Services Richard Susskind OBE Oxford University Press, USA (January 15, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In large law firms document assembly systems are increasingly being used to systemise work, such as complex term sheets and the first drafts of credit agreements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information-age.com/channels/information-management/features/1307743/part_3/swift-justice.thtml Article: Swift Justice] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713034239/http://www.information-age.com/channels/information-management/features/1307743/part_3/swift-justice.thtml |date=July 13, 2011 }} Pete Swabey (20 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk/content/view/31/50/ Article: Client services - Distance relationships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102162255/http://www.legaltechnologyjournal.co.uk/content/view/31/50/ |date=2010-11-02 }} Marc-Henri Chamay Legal Technology Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

These and other sites are incorporating artificial intelligence into their document automation software.&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt;

== In insurance ==
Insurance policies and certificates, depending on the type, policy documents can also be hundreds of pages long and include specific information on the insured.  Typically, in the past, these insurance document packets were created by a) typing out free-form letters, b) adding pre-printed brochures c) editing templates and d) customizing graphics with the required information, then manually sorting and inserting all the documents into one packet and mailing them to the insured. The various documents included in one packet could include the following kinds of documents:
* Welcome letter
* Contract
* Certificate
* State-specific policy documents
* Listing of items insured and insurance amounts
* Amendments
* Riders
* ID card
* Company information
* Marketing material (other products)

A lot of work can go into putting one packet together.  In most policy admin systems, the system will generate some kind of policy statement as a starting point but might need to be customized and enhanced with other required materials.

[[File:CB Unix Manuals.jpg|thumb|The multi-volume programmer's manual to a 1975 operating system called [[CB UNIX]]]]
'''Documentation''' is a set of [[Document|documents]] provided on paper, or [[online]], or on [[digital media|digital]] or [[analog media]], such as [[audio tape]] or [[CD]]s. Examples are user guides, white papers, on-line help, quick-reference guides.  It is becoming less common to see paper (hard-copy) documentation.  Documentation is distributed via websites, software products, and other on-line applications.

Professionals educated in this field are termed documentalists. This field changed its name to [[information science]] in 1968, but some uses of the term documentation still exists and there have been efforts to reintroduce the term documentation as a field of study.

== Principles for producing documentation ==

While associated [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards are not easily available publicly, a guide from other sources for this topic may serve the purpose.&lt;ref name=agd&gt;{{cite web|last=N/A |first= |authorlink= |title=Guide to Documentation |work= |publisher= |year=2003 |url=http://www.somers.k12.ct.us/common/guide_to_doc.pdf |format= |doi= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729135707/http://www.somers.k12.ct.us/common/guide_to_doc.pdf |archivedate=29 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name=agds&gt;{{cite web

=== Procedures and techniques ===

The procedures of documentation vary from one sector, or one type, to another. In general, these may involve document drafting, formatting, submitting, reviewing, approving, distributing, reposting and tracking, etc., and are convened by associated [[Standing operating procedure|SOP]]s in a regulatory industry. It could also involve creating content from scratch. Documentation should be easy to read and understand. If it's too long and too wordy, it may be misunderstood or ignored. Clear, Short, Familiar words should be used to a maximum of 15 words to a sentence. Only gender hyper neutral word should be used and cultural biases should be avoided. Procedures should be numbered when they are to be performed.&lt;ref name=grdp&gt;{{cite web

== Producing documentation ==

Technical writers and corporate communicators are professionals whose field and work is documentation. Ideally, technical writers have a background in both the subject matter and also in writing and managing content (information architecture). Technical writers more commonly collaborate with subject matter experts (SMEs), such as engineers, technical experts,  medical professionals, or other types of clients to define and then create content (documentation) that meets the user's needs. Corporate communications includes other types of written documentation that is required for most companies.

=== Specializing documentation ===

* [[Marketing Communications]] (MarCom): MarCom writers endeavor to convey the company's value proposition through a variety of print, electronic, and social media.  This area of corporate writing is often engaged in responding to proposals.
* [[Technical Communication]] (TechCom): Technical writers document a company's product or service.  Technical publication include user guides, installation an configuration manuals, and troubleshooting/repair/replace procedures.
* [[Legal Writing]]: This type of documentation is often prepared by attorneys or paralegals who could be in private practice or retained as corporate council.
* Compliance documentation: This type of documentation codifies [[Standard Operating Procedures]] (SOPs), for any regulatory compliance needs, as for safety approval, taxation, financing, technical approval, etc.

=== Indexing ===

* [[Database index|Index (database)]]
* [[Index (search engine)]]

== Documentation in computer science ==
{{main|Software documentation}}
The following are typical software documentation types
* Request for Proposal ([[RFP]])
* Requirements/ [[Statement of work]]/ Scope of Work (SOW)
* Software Design and Functional Specification
* System Design and Functional Specifications
* Change Management, Error and Enhancement Tracking
* [[User Acceptance Testing]]
* [[Man page|Manpages]]
* [[Perl Programming Documentation|Perldocs]]

The following are typical hardware and service documentation types
* [[Computer network diagram|network diagrams]]
* network maps
* [[datasheet]] for IT systems (Server, Switch, e.g.)
* Service Catalog and Service Portfolio ([[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]])

Documentation include such as feasibility report, technical documentation, operational documentation, log book, etc.

=== Tools for documenting software ===
There are many types of software and applications used to create documentation.

SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER (SDF)

A common type of software document written by software engineers in the simulation industry is the SDF. When developing software for a simulator, which can range from embedded avionics devices to 3D terrain databases by way of full motion control systems, the engineer keeps a notebook detailing the development "the build" of the project or module. The document can be a wiki page, MS word document or other environment.  They should contain a ''requirements'' section, an ''interface'' section to detail the communication interface of the software.  Often a ''notes'' section is used to detail the proof of concept, and then track errors and enhancements. Finally, a ''testing'' section to document how the software was tested.  This documents conformance to the client's requirements. The result is a detailed description of how the software is designed, how to build and install the software on the target device, and any known defects and work-arounds. This build document enables future developers and maintainers to come up to speed on the software in a timely manner, and also provides a roadmap to modifying code or searching for bugs.

SOFTWARE FOR NETWORK INVENTORY AND CONFIGURATION ([[CMDB]])

These software tools can automatically collect data of your network equipment. The data could be for inventory and for configuration information. The [[ITIL|ITIL Library]] requests to create such a database as a basis for all information for the IT responsible. It's also the basis for IT documentation. Examples include XIA Configuration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.centrel-solutions.com/xiaconfiguration/|title=XIA Configuration Network Documentation Tool|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Documentation in criminal justice ==

"Documentation" is the preferred term for the process of populating criminal databases.  Examples include the [[National Counter-terrorism Center]]'s [[Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment]] ("TIDE"), [[sex offender registries]], and gang databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rader Brown|first=Rebecca|title=The Gang's All Here: Evaluating the Need for a National Gang Database|journal=Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems|year=2009|volume=42|pages=293–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentation in Early Childhood Education ==
Documentation, as it pertains to the Early Childhood Education field, is "when we notice and value children's ideas, thinking, questions, and theories about the world and then collect traces of their work (drawings, photographs of the children in action, and transcripts of their words) to share with a wider community" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/909907917|title=Pedagogical documentation in early childhood : sharing children's learning and teachers' thinking|last=Susan,|first=Stacey,|isbn=9781605543925|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|oclc=909907917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thusly, documentation is a process, used to link the educator's knowledge and learning of the child/children with the families, other collaborators, and even to the children themselves.  

Documentation is an integral part of the cycle of inquiry - observing, reflecting, documenting, sharing and responding. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Pedagogical documentation, in terms of the teacher documentation, is the "teacher's story of the movement in children's understanding".  &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;According to Stephanie Cox Suarez in 'Documentation - Transforming our Perspectives', "teachers are considered researchers, and documentation is a research tool to support knowledge building among children and adults" &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pz.harvard.edu/resources/documentation-transforming-our-perspectives|title=Documentation: Transforming our Perspectives {{!}} Project Zero|website=www.pz.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentation can take many different styles in the classroom.  The following exemplifies ways in which documentation can make the 'research', or learning, visible:

# Documentation Panels (bulletin-board-like presentation with multiple pictures and descriptions about the project or event).
# Daily Log (a log kept every day that records the play and learning in the classroom)
# Documentation developed by or with the children (when observing children during documentation, the child's lens of the observation is used in the actual documentation)
# Individual Portfolios (documentation used to track and highlight the development of each child)
# Electronic Documentation (using apps and devices to share documentation with families and collaborators)
# Transcripts or Recordings of Conversations (using recording in documentation can bring about deeper reflections for both the educator and the child)
# Learning Stories (a narrative used to "describe learning and help children see themselves as powerful learners" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;)
# The Classroom as Documentation (reflections and documentation of the physical environment of a classroom). &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Documentation is certainly a process in and of itself, and it is also a process within the educator.  The following is the development of documentation as it progresses for and in the educator themselves:

* Develop[s] habits of documentation
* Become[s] comfortable with going public with recounting of activities
* Develop[s] visual literacy skills
* Conceptualize[s] the purpose of documentation as making learning styles visible, and
* Share[s] visible theories for interpretation purposes and further design of curriculum. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecrp.uiuc.edu/v13n2/index.html|title=ECRP. Vol 13 No 2|website=ecrp.uiuc.edu|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept for the so-called Dyson–Harrop satellite begins with a long metal wire loop pointed at the sun. This wire is charged to generate a cylindrical magnetic field that snags the electrons that make up half the solar wind. These electrons get funnelled into a metal spherical receiver to produce a current, which generates the wire's magnetic field – making the system self-sustaining. Any current not needed for the magnetic field powers an infrared laser trained on satellite dishes back on Earth, designed to collect the energy. Earth's air does not absorb infra-red light, so the system would be highly efficient. Back on the satellite, the current has been drained of its electrical energy by the laser – the electrons fall onto a ring-shaped sail, where incoming sunlight can excite them enough to keep the satellite in orbit around the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19497-out-of-this-world-proposal-for-solar-wind-power/|title=Out-of-this-world proposal for solar wind power|date=2010-09-24|last=Choi|first=Charles|work=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively small Dyson–Harrop satellite using a 1-centimetre-wide copper wire 300 metres long, a receiver 2 metres wide and a sail 10 metres in diameter, sitting at roughly the same distance from the sun as the Earth, could generate 1.7 megawatts of power – enough for about 1000 family homes in the US. Larger sizes could produce far greater amounts of power, even exceeding the current usage of Earth. Satellites could be placed anywhere in the solar system, and networks of satellites could combine to generate terawatts of power.

The purpose of '''electro-mechanical modeling''' is to model and [[Computer simulation|simulate]] an [[electro-mechanical]] system, such that its physical parameters can be examined before the actual system is built. Parameter estimation and physical realization of the overall system is the major design objective of Electro-Mechanical modeling. Theory driven mathematical model can be used or applied to other system to judge the performance of the joint system as a whole. This is a well known &amp; proven technique for designing large control system for industrial as well as academic multi-disciplinary complex system. This technique is also being employed in MEMS technology recently.

==Different types of mathematical modelling==

The modeling of purely mechanical systems is mainly based on the Lagrangian which is a function of the generalized coordinates and the associated velocities. If all forces are derivable from a potential, then the time behavior of the dynamical systems is completely determined. For simple mechanical systems, the Lagrangian is defined as the difference of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.

There exists a similar approach for electrical system. By means of the electrical co-energy and well defined power quantities, the equations of motions are uniquely defined. The currents of the inductors and the voltage drops across the capacitors play the role of the generalized coordinates. All constraints, for instance caused by the Kirchhoff laws, are eliminated from the considerations. After that, a suitable transfer function is to be derived from the system parameters which eventually governs the behavior of the system.

In consequence, we have quantities (kinetic and potential energy, generalized forces) which determine the mechanical part and quantities (co-energy, powers) for the description of the electrical part. This offers a combination of the mechanical and electrical parts by means of an energy approach. As a result, an extended Lagrangian format is produced.

The UNI is recognized by the Italian State and by the European Union, and represents Italian legislative activity at the [[International Standards Organization]] (ISO) and [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN).

Piero Torretta is the president of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = La governance - UNI - ENTE ITALIANO DI NORMAZIONE|url = http://www.uni.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1618&amp;Itemid=2423|website = www.uni.com|accessdate = 2015-07-14|first = Simona|last = Pauletti}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
The UNI was formed in 1921 with the initials "UNIM" in the face of demands for standardization of mechanical engineering at the time. At the 1928 [[General Confederation of Italian Industry]] (Confindustria) it was promoted to include all sectors of industry, becoming the current UNI.

==Description==
The main tasks of UNI are:

* develop new standards in collaboration with all stakeholders;
* represent Italy in standardization activities internationally (ISO) and within Europe (CEN) in order to promote the harmonization of standards;
* publish and disseminate technical standards and editorial products related to them.

The UNI also avails of federated entities for specific fields of competence. Between them in the field of standardization in the field of computer science is relevant UNINFO, which is the UNI, the areas of competence, at the ISO, the ISO / IEC JTC1 (ISO / IEC Joint Technical Committee) and the CEN.

Other federated entity UNI is the CTI, Italian Committee thermo energy and environment, which deals with the legislative activity in the areas of heating technology and the production and utilization of thermal energy, both nationally and internationally, where he, on behalf of UNI, the work of numerous groups CEN and ISO detaining, for some of these, the relative answering techniques.

The most important federated entity UNI is today the Italian Gas Committee (CIG) that deals with regulation of the sector gas, nationally and internationally and cooperates with many Italian and European institutions in the same sector. Currently this committee is working on several initiatives with strong impact on national energy issues, such as the introduction of biomethane in transport networks and distribution of natural gas, the European project on the quality of gas, the project of smart meters for natural gas.

The published standards can significantly affect the safety of workers, the public, or the environment, that the government refer to them recalling them in documents legislative and attributing to them some level of cogency.

==UNI standard designation==
The designation of a UNI [[Technical standard|standard]] shows its origin (# denotes a number):
* ''UNI #'' is used for Italian standards with primarily domestic significance or designed as a first step toward international status. 
*''UNI EN #'' is used for the Italian edition of European standards.
*''UNI ISO #'' is used for the Italian edition of ISO standards.
*''UNI EN ISO #'' is used if the standard has also been adopted as a European standard.

In the second case, the most significant factor, which is determined by the temperature, is the mobility of the structural defects such as grain boundaries, point vacancies, line and screw dislocations, stacking faults and twins in both crystalline and non-crystalline solids. The movement or displacement of such mobile defects is thermally activated, and thus limited by the rate of atomic diffusion.&lt;ref name="Dav"&gt;Davidge, R.W.

Although the term is used in the field of optics to describe [[light]] and other [[electromagnetic wave]]s, dispersion in the same sense can apply to any sort of wave motion such as [[acoustic dispersion]] in the case of sound and seismic waves, in [[gravity wave]]s (ocean waves), and for telecommunication signals along [[transmission line]]s (such as [[coaxial cable]]) or [[optical fiber]].}}

It is thus the [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of the [[spatial frequency]]. Wavelength is usually determined by considering the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same [[phase (waves)|phase]], such as crests, troughs, or [[zero crossing]]s and is a characteristic of both traveling waves and [[standing wave]]s, as well as other spatial wave patterns.&lt;ref name=Seaway&gt;

For thousands of years, devices have been used to measure and keep track of [[time]]. The current [[sexagesimal]] [[Numeral system|system]] of time [[systems of measurement|measurement]] dates to approximately 2000&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Domini|{{sc|bc}}]]&lt;!--See talk page--&gt; from the  [[Sumer]]ians.

The  Egyptians divided the day into two 12-hour periods, and used large [[obelisk]]s to track the movement of the [[sun]]. They also developed [[water clock]]s, which were probably first used in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]], and later outside Egypt as well; they were employed frequently by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], who called them ''clepsydrae''. The [[Zhou dynasty]] is believed to have used the outflow water clock around the same time, devices which were introduced from [[Mesopotamia]] as early as 2000{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.

Other ancient timekeeping devices include the [[candle clock]], used in [[ancient China]], [[ancient Japan]], [[England]] and Mesopotamia; the [[Sundial#Shepherd dials – Timesticks|timestick]], widely used in [[India]] and [[Tibet]], as well as some parts of [[Europe]]; and the [[hourglass]], which functioned similarly to a water clock.  The [[sundial]], another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day.  It is not so useful in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as the seasons change (if the [[gnomon]] was not aligned with the [[Earth's axis]]).

The earliest known clock with a [[water-power]]ed [[escapement]] mechanism, which transferred [[rotational energy]] into intermittent motions,&lt;ref name="Samual l. Jackson 18f."&gt;David Landes: "Revolution in Time: Clocks and the Making of the Modern World", rev. and enlarged edition, Harvard University Press, Cambridge 2000, {{ISBN|0-674-00282-2}}, p.18f.&lt;/ref&gt; dates back to 3rd century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} in [[ancient Greece]];&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2000|pp=343–369 (356f.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science and technology in China|Chinese engineers]] later invented clocks incorporating [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century,&lt;ref name="needham 411"/&gt; followed by [[Inventions in medieval Islam|Iranian engineers]] inventing water clocks driven by [[gear]]s and [[Maintaining power|weights]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=Hassan/&gt;

The first [[mechanical clock]]s, employing the [[verge escapement]] mechanism with a [[Balance wheel|foliot]] or [[balance wheel]] timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the [[pendulum clock]] was invented in 1656.  The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century.

The pendulum clock remained the most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when [[quartz oscillator]]s were invented, followed by [[atomic clock]]s after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of [[microelectronics]] in the 1960s made [[quartz clock]]s both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and [[wristwatch]]es.

Atomic clocks are far more accurate than any previous timekeeping device, and are used to calibrate other clocks and to calculate the [[International Atomic Time]]; a [[standardized]] civil system, [[Coordinated Universal Time]], is based on atomic time.

Egyptian shadow clocks divided [[Daytime (astronomy)|daytime]] into 12 parts with each part further divided into more precise parts.&lt;ref name="One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt"/&gt; One type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon.&lt;!--Why?--&gt; Obelisks functioned in much the same manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the [[summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice|winter]] [[solstice]]s.&lt;ref name=bruton/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html |title=Earliest Clocks |work=A Walk Through Time |accessdate=2 April 2008 |publisher=NIST Physics Laboratory| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080315060613/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/early.html| archivedate=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, was similar in shape to a bent [[T-square]]. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The ''T'' was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at [[noon]], so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=barnett&gt;Barnett, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Although accurate, shadow clocks relied on the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/hourglass.html |title= How does an hourglass measure time? |accessdate=31 March 2008|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians therefore developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Berlev, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings on the side of the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of [[pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep I]] (1525–1504{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philbin, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt; Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using [[Plumb-bob|plumb-lines]] called [[merkhet]]s. In use since at least 600{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, two of these instruments were aligned with [[Polaris]], the north [[pole star]], to create a north–south [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the ''merkhets''.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time in History"&gt;Whitrow, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water clock]]s, or clepsydrae, were commonly used in [[Ancient Greece]] following their introduction by [[Plato]], who also invented a water-based [[alarm clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor |first=J.

The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a [[siphon]]. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm.&lt;ref name=answers.com /&gt; The Greeks and [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]] regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations.

[[File:Aerides Athens 2.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Tower of the Winds]] in [[Athens]], Greece, a 1st-century-BC [[clocktower]] from the period of [[Roman Greece]]]]
In Greek tradition, clepsydrae were used in [[court]]; later, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] adopted this practice, as well. There are several mentions of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', [[Plato]] says that "Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on".&lt;ref name="Water clocks in court"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H8YOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Greek and Roman Technology: A Sourcebook|last=Humphrey|first=John William|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=518–519|accessdate=11 April 2008|isbn=0-415-06136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mention occurs in [[Lucius Apuleius]]' ''[[The Golden Ass]]'': "The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief witness for the prosecution to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom I did not know. He was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Transformations of Lucius, Otherwise Known as The Golden Ass|last=Apuleius|first=Lucius|others=Translated by Robert Graves|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|year=1951|page=54|authorlink3=Apuleius|isbn=0-374-50532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. Another consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre, which was floated on water. Time was kept by observing how long the bowl took to fill with water.&lt;ref name="Waterclockhistory"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rees, Abraham |title=Rees's clocks, watches, and chronometers (1819–20); a selection from the Cyclopaedia, or Universal dictionary of arts, sciences, and literature |publisher=C.

Although clepsydrae were more useful than sundials—they could be used indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as accurate; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QcE2pBCLE8C&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Empires of Time: Calendars, Clocks, and Cultures|last=Aveni|first=Anthony F.|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2000|isbn=1-86064-602-6|accessdate=22 June 2008|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making the reading of the clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by [[water pressure]]: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman [[horology|horologists]] beginning in 100{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, and improvements continued to be made in the following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Collier, James Lincoln |title=Clocks |publisher=Benchmark Books |location=[[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], NY |year=2003 |page=25 |isbn=0-7614-1538-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 270{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} and {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}500, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] ([[Ctesibius]], [[Hero of Alexandria]], [[Archimedes]]) and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[horology|horologists]] and [[astronomer]]s began developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity was aimed at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang [[bell (instrument)|bells]] and [[gong]]s, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed [[astrology|astrological]] models of the universe.

Although the Greeks and Romans did much to advance water clock technology, they still continued to use shadow clocks.

[[File:Ancient water clock used in qanat of gonabad 2500 years ago.JPG|thumb|Ancient Persian clock]]
[[File:میرآب.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of the scene of a water clock manager (MirAab), Iran]]
According to [[Callisthenes]], the [[Persia]]ns were using [[water clock]]s in 328{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from [[qanat]]s to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in [[Iran]], especially in [[Zeebad]], dates back to 500{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the ''[[Nowruz]]'', ''Chelah'', or ''[[Yaldā]]'' – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.&lt;ref name=Qanat&gt;[http://www.aftabir.com/articles/view/science_education/technical/c3c1183387267p1.php/%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D9%88-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%86 Conference of Qanat in Iran – water clock in Persia 1383], in Persian&lt;/ref&gt;

Water clocks, or ''Fenjaan'', in Persia reached a level of accuracy comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a [[qanat]] or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt; Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"&gt;[http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 سايه‌ي شهرداري نجف‌آباد بر كهن‌ترين «ساعت آبي»‌ شهر] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429163019/http://amordadnews.com/neveshtehNamyesh.aspx?NId=6010 |date=April 29, 2014 }} Amordad News (in Persian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The fenjaan was a big pot full of water and a bowl with small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar.&lt;ref name="Fenjaan"/&gt;

The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as ''khaneh fenjaan''. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a ''staryab'' or [[astrolabe]], but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.&lt;ref name=Qanat/&gt;

===Ancient and medieval China===
{{See also|History of science and technology in China|Su Song}}
[[Joseph Needham]] speculated that the introduction of the outflow clepsydra to China, perhaps from [[Mesopotamia]], occurred as far back as the 2nd millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, during the [[Shang Dynasty]], and at the latest by the 1st millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. By the beginning of the [[Han Dynasty]], in 202{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, the outflow clepsydra was gradually replaced by the inflow clepsydra, which featured an indicator rod on a float. To compensate for the falling [[pressure head]] in the reservoir, which slowed timekeeping as the vessel filled, [[Zhang Heng]] added an extra tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Around 550 AD, Yin Gui was the first in China to write of the overflow or constant-level tank added to the series, which was later described in detail by the inventor [[Shen Kuo]]. Around 610, this design was trumped by two [[Sui Dynasty]] inventors, Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai, who were the first to create the balance clepsydra, with standard positions for the [[steelyard balance]].&lt;ref name=needham&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |pages=479–480 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Needham states that:
{{quote|text=...&amp;nbsp;[the balance clepsydra] permitted the seasonal adjustment of the pressure head in the compensating tank by having standard positions for the counterweight graduated on the beam, and hence it could control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night. With this arrangement no overflow tank was required, and the two attendants were warned when the clepsydra needed refilling.&lt;ref name=needham/&gt;}}

==Timekeeping innovations in medieval and pre-modern periods==
The term '[[clock]]' encompasses a wide spectrum of devices, ranging from [[wristwatch]]es to the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. The English word ''clock'' is said to derive from the [[Middle English]] ''clokke'', [[Old French|Old North French]] ''cloque'', or [[Middle Dutch]] ''clocke'', all of which mean ''[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]'', and are derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''clocca'', also meaning bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=clock |title=Clock Etymology |accessdate=27 April 2008|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Clock|title=Merriam-Webster Online: Clock|accessdate=20 June 2008|work=[[Webster's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/31/C0413100.html |accessdate=4 December 2007 |edition=Fourth |isbn=0-395-82517-2 |author=executive editor, Joseph P.

Throughout history, clocks have had a [[Watch#Power sources|variety of power sources]], including [[gravity]], [[Spring (device)|springs]], and [[electrical power|electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[St Edmundsbury Borough Council]] |url=http://www.stedmundsbury.gov.uk/sebc/visit/mechanicaltimekeeping.cfm|title=Mechanical Timekeeping|accessdate=10 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704065329/http://www.stedmundsbury.gov.uk/sebc/visit/mechanicaltimekeeping.cfm|archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nistrevolution /&gt; Mechanical clocks became widespread in the 14th century, when they were used in medieval [[monastery|monasteries]] to keep the regulated schedule of prayers. The clock continued to be improved, with the first [[pendulum clock]] being designed and built in the 17th century.

===Candle clocks===
{{Main|Candle clock}}
[[Image:Kerzenuhr.jpg|thumb|right|A [[candle clock]]]]
The earliest mention of [[candle clock]]s comes from a Chinese poem, written in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}520 by You Jianfu. According to the poem, the graduated candle was a means of determining time at night. Similar candles were used in Japan until the early 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm |title=History of Time |accessdate=8 April 2008 |last=Flamer |first=Keith |year=2006|work=International Watch Magazine|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162954/http://www.iwmagazine.com/education_history.cfm|archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The candle clock most commonly mentioned and written of is attributed to King [[Alfred the Great]]. It consisted of six candles made from 72&amp;nbsp;[[pennyweight]]s of wax, each {{convert|12|in|cm}} high, and of uniform thickness, marked every inch (2.54&amp;nbsp;cm). As these candles burned for about four hours, each mark represented 20&amp;nbsp;minutes. Once lit, the candles were placed in wooden framed glass boxes, to prevent the flame from extinguishing.&lt;ref name="alfred"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |url=http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |title=Clockworks: Candle clock |accessdate=16 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126001057/http://kids.britannica.com/clockworks/t_candle.html |archivedate=November 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sophisticated candle clocks of their time were those of [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206. One of his candle clocks included a [[Dial (measurement)|dial]] to display the time and, for the first time, employed a [[Bayonet mount|bayonet fitting]], a [[Fastener|fastening mechanism]] still used in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 12: Machines of the East|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwGfw1YW9Js|accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Routledge Hill]] described Al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows:

{{quote|The candle, whose rate of burning was known, bore against the underside of the cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish at the bottom of the candle. No other candle clocks of this sophistication are known.&lt;ref name=Hill2/&gt;}}

[[Image:Oil-lamp clock00.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[oil-lamp clock]]]]

A variation on this theme were [[oil-lamp clock]]s. These early timekeeping devices consisted of a graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.

===Incense clocks===
{{Main article|Incense clock}}
In addition to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, [[incense clock]]s were used in the [[Far East]], and were fashioned in several different forms.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Incense]] clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the [[Shōsōin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eastern Magnificence and European Ingenuity: Clocks of Late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8bXxHSZkWssC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA209,M1|last=Pagani|first=Catherine|page=209|isbn=0-472-11208-2|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its characters are not Chinese, but [[Devanagari]].&lt;ref name="Schafer"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QerLX9x8pIkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA160,M1|title=The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of T'ang Exotics|pages=160–161|last=Schafer|first=Edward|year=1963|isbn=0-520-05462-8|publisher=[[University of California Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in [[Buddhist]] ceremonies, [[Edward H. Schafer]] speculated that incense clocks were invented in [[India]].&lt;ref name="Schafer"/&gt; Although similar to the candle clock, incense clocks burned evenly and without a flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer for indoor use.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~echang/Class/public/report.html |title=Visualizing Video Streams using Sand Glass Metaphor |author1=Chang, Edward |author2=Lu, Yung-Hsiang |publisher=Stanford University |date=December 1996|accessdate=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several types of incense clock have been found, the most common forms include the [[incense stick]] and incense seal.&lt;ref name="Burning rates"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XDwZ9WZ3oBIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA55,M1|title=Of Time, Passion, and Knowledge: Reflections on the Strategy of Existence|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|last=Fraser|first=Julius|pages=55–56|year=1990|isbn=0-691-02437-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msi /&gt; An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations;&lt;ref name=msi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msichicago.org/scrapbook/scrapbook_exhibits/time/educ_pages/act_incenseclock.html |title=Time Activity: Incense Clock |accessdate=29 April 2008 |publisher=Museum of Science and Industry |location=Chicago |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704105617/http://www.msichicago.org/scrapbook/scrapbook_exhibits/time/educ_pages/act_incenseclock.html |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most were elaborate, sometimes having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that a certain amount of time had elapsed.

Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance,&lt;ref name="Burning rates"/&gt; these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals.&lt;ref name="Bedini103"&gt;Bedini, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it&lt;ref name="Burning rates"/&gt; into which incense was placed.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; These clocks were common in China,&lt;ref name="Bedini103"/&gt; but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan.&lt;ref name="Bedini187"/&gt; To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails.

While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the [[Song dynasty]]. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Bedini, pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.&lt;ref name="Bedini187"&gt;Bedini, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sundials===
{{Main|Sundial}}
[[Image:SevillaGlorietaDelReloj01.JPG|thumb|A 20th-century [[sundial]] in [[Seville]], [[Andalusia]], Spain]]
Sundials had been used for timekeeping since [[Ancient Egypt]]. Ancient dials were nodus-based with straight hour-lines that indicated unequal hours—also called temporary hours—that varied with the seasons. Every day was divided into 12&amp;nbsp;equal segments regardless of the time of year; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. The [[sundial]] was further developed by [[Islamic astronomy|Muslim astronomers]]. The idea of using hours of equal length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu'l-Hasan [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in 1371, based on earlier developments in [[trigonometry]] by [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī]] (Albategni). Ibn al-Shatir was aware that "using a [[gnomon]] that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year". His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept appeared in Western sundials starting in 1446.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the sundial |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |accessdate=2 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010044606/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353 |archivedate=October 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Sundial And Geometry|first=Lawrence|last=Jones|journal=North American Sundial Society|volume=12|issue=4|date=December 2005|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the acceptance of [[heliocentrism]] and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the [[Renaissance]], when they were built in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Mayall, Margaret W. |author2=Mayall, R.

===Hourglass===
{{Main|Hourglass}}
Since the [[hourglass]] was one of the few reliable methods of measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting ''Allegory of Good Government'', by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], from 1338.&lt;ref&gt;Frugoni p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[It] was made in the image of the round heavens and on it were shown the lunar mansions in their order, the equator and the degrees of the heavenly circumference. Water, flowing into scoops, turned a wheel automatically, rotating it one complete revolution in one day and night. Besides this, there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made to move in circling orbit&amp;nbsp;... And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It permitted the exact determinations of the time of dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters. All these motions were brought about by machinery within the casing, each depending on wheels and shafts, hooks, pins and interlocking rods, stopping devices and locks checking mutually.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000817/081712eo.pdf |title=The mechanical clock |work=[[UNESCO Courier]] |accessdate=16 April 2008 | date=October 1988|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Yi Xing's clock was a [[water clock]], it was affected by temperature variations. That problem was solved in 976 by [[Zhang Sixun]] by replacing the water with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which remains liquid down to {{convert|-39|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Zhang implemented the changes into his [[clock tower]], which was about {{convert|10|m}} tall, with escapements to keep the clock turning and bells to signal every quarter-hour. Another noteworthy clock, the elaborate Cosmic Engine, was built by [[Su Song]], in 1088. It was about the size of Zhang's tower, but had an automatically rotating [[armillary sphere]]—also called a celestial globe—from which the positions of the stars could be observed. It also featured five panels with [[mannequins]] ringing gongs or bells, and tablets showing the time of day, or other special times.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt; Furthermore, it featured the first known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]] in horology.&lt;ref name="needham 411"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Joseph |last=Needham |authorlink=Joseph Needham|year=1986 |title=Science and Civilization in China |volume=4 |journal=Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2: Mechanical Engineering |location=Taipei |publisher=Caves Books, Ltd |page=411 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally built in the capital of [[Kaifeng]], it was dismantled by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin army]] and sent to the capital of [[Fanyang|Yanjing]] (now [[Beijing]]), where they were unable to put it back together.

===Clock towers===
{{Main|Clock tower}}
{{See also|Turret clock|Striking clock}}
[[Clock tower]]s in [[Western Europe]] in the Middle Ages were also sometimes [[striking clock]]s. The most famous original still standing is possibly [[St Mark's Clock]] on the top of [[St Mark's Clocktower]] in [[St Mark's Square (Venice)|St Mark's Square]] in [[Venice]], assembled in 1493 by the clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from [[Reggio Emilia]]. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called ''Due Mori'' (''Two [[Moors]]''), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the [[Prague Astronomical Clock]] by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš) – according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker [[Mikuláš of Kadaň]] and mathematician [[Jan Šindel]]. The allegorical parade of animated sculptures rings on the hour every day.

A sophisticated water-powered astronomical clock was built by [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206. This [[castle clock]] was a complex device that was about {{convert|11|ft|m}} high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the [[zodiac]] and the solar and lunar paths, and a pointer in the shape of the [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] which travelled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart and causing doors to open, each revealing a [[mannequin]], every hour.&lt;ref name=Hill2&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill|Routledge Hill, Donald]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''[[Scientific American]]'', May 1991, pp. 64–9 ([[cf.]] [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering]) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305162155/http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm |date=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard R.

The religious necessities and technical skill of the medieval monks were crucial factors in the development of clocks, as the historian [[Thomas Woods]] writes:
{{quote|text=The monks also counted skillful clock-makers among them. The first recorded clock was built by the future [[Pope Sylvester II]] for the German town of [[Magdeburg]], around the year 996.

[[Salisbury cathedral clock]], dating from about 1386, is one of the oldest working clocks in the world, and may be the oldest.  It still has most of its original parts,&lt;ref name="Salisbury"&gt;{{cite web| title= Oldest Working Clock, Frequently Asked Questions, Salisbury Cathedral|url= http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/visitor.faqs.php?id=23|accessdate= 4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its original [[verge and foliot]] timekeeping mechanism is lost, having been converted to a [[pendulum]], which was replaced by a replica verge in 1956.  It has no dial, as its purpose was to [[Striking clock|strike a bell]] at precise times.&lt;ref name="Salisbury"/&gt; The wheels and gears are mounted in an open, box-like iron frame, measuring about {{convert|1.2|m|ft}} square. The framework is held together with metal dowels and pegs.  Two large stones, hanging from pulleys, supply the power. As the weights fall, ropes unwind from the wooden barrels.

During the Middle Ages, clocks primarily served religious purposes; the first employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In [[Dublin]], the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood on top of the [[Tholsel]] (the city court and council chamber).&lt;ref name="Dublin60"&gt;Clarke, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of its kind to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand.&lt;ref name="Dublin60"/&gt; The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks.&lt;ref name="Bottomley34"&gt;Bottomley, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; A 1435 example survives from [[Leeds castle]]; its face is decorated with the images of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[St George]].&lt;ref name="Bottomley34"/&gt;

Early clock dials showed hours: the display of minutes and seconds evolved later. A clock with a minutes dial is mentioned in a 1475 manuscript,&lt;ref name=haencyc /&gt; and clocks indicating minutes and seconds existed in [[Germany]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;p. 209, ''A history of mechanical inventions'', Abbott Payson Usher, Courier Dover Publications, 1988, {{ISBN|0-486-25593-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Timepieces which indicated minutes and seconds were occasionally made from this time on, but this was not common until the increase in accuracy made possible by the pendulum clock and, in watches, by the spiral balance spring. The 16th-century astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] used clocks with minutes and seconds to observe stellar positions.&lt;ref name=haencyc&gt;p. 529, "Time and timekeeping instruments", ''History of astronomy: an encyclopedia'', John Lankford, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8153-0322-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was not just a matter of fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the [[waistcoat]] was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]], the consort to [[Queen Victoria]], introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as [[bracelet]]s, for women.&lt;ref name="Evolu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=THe Evolution of the Wristwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

During the [[Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin &amp; Webb]] began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at the Sudan in 1898]] and ramped up production for the Boer War a few years later.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

[[File:First Battle of Passchendaele - barrage map (colour balance).jpg|thumb|right|Planning map for an Allied creeping barrage at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] – a tactic that required precise synchronisation between the artillery and infantry.]]
These early models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, but by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company, Dimier Frères &amp; Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], an early aviator, asked his friend, a French [[watchmaker]] called [[Louis Cartier]], to design a watch that could be useful during his flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lego Mindstorms NXT Hacker's Guide|last=Prochnow|first=Dave|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2006|isbn=0-07-148147-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches. His Rolex wristwatch of 1910 became the first such watch to receive certification as a chronometer in Switzerland and it went on to win an award in 1914 from [[Kew Observatory]] in [[Richmond, Surrey|Richmond]], west London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|author=John E. Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed in the air as much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British [[War Office|War Department]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Paul|title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight|publisher=Hyperion Press|year=2004|isbn=0-7868-8571-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cortjump1.jpg|thumb|A ''Cortébert'' wristwatch from the 1920s.|left]]
The company H. Williamson Ltd., based in [[Coventry]], was one of the first to capitalize on this opportunity. During the company's 1916 [[Annual general meeting|AGM]] it was noted that "...the public is buying the practical things of life. Nobody can truthfully contend that the watch is a luxury. It is said that one soldier in every four wears a wristlet watch, and the other three mean to get one as soon as they can." By the end of the War, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch, and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on – the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that "...the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire." Within a decade, sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches.&lt;ref name="Evolu" /&gt;

====Equation clock====
{{Main|Equation clock}}
In the late 17th and 18th Centuries, [[equation clock]]s were made, which allowed the user to see or calculate apparent [[solar time]], as would be shown by a [[sundial]]. Before the invention of the pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the [[equation of time]] made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.

Andrewes (2006) notes: "In the 16th century Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] and his contemporaries tried to use clocks for scientific purposes, yet even the best ones were still too unreliable. Astronomers in particular needed a better tool for timing the transit of stars and thereby creating more accurate maps of the heavens. The pendulum proved to be the key to boosting the accuracy and dependability of timekeepers. [[Galileo Galilei]], the Italian physicist and astronomer, and others before him experimented with pendulums, but a young Dutch astronomer and mathematician named Christiaan Huygens devised the first pendulum clock on Christmas Day in 1656. (...) Pendulum clocks were about 100 times as accurate as their predecessors, reducing a typical gain or loss of 15 minutes a day to about a minute a week. News of the invention spread rapidly, and by 1660 English and French artisans were developing their own versions of this new timekeeper. &lt;br/&gt; In 1675 Huygens devised his next major improvement, the spiral balance spring. (...) The spiral balance spring revolutionized the accuracy of watches, enabling them to keep time to within a minute a day. This advance sparked an almost immediate rise in the market for watches, which were now no longer typically worn on a chain around the neck but were carried in a pocket, a wholly new fashion in clothing." |date=1 February 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was "the most ingenious watchmaker of all time" (in [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]'s own words).&lt;ref&gt;Gindikin, Simon; Shuchat, Alan (2007).

Innovations to the mechanical clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th.&lt;ref name="Davies434"/&gt; In the 1580s, the Italian [[polymath]] [[Galileo Galilei]] investigated the regular swing of the [[pendulum]], and discovered that it could be used to regulate a clock.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pockets"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies |first=Eryl |title=Pockets: Inventions |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London |year=1995 |isbn=0-7513-5184-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt; The first pendulum clock was designed and built by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]], in 1656.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt; Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10&amp;nbsp;seconds, very accurate for their time.&lt;ref name=nistrevolution/&gt;

In [[England]], the manufacturing of pendulum clocks was soon taken up.&lt;ref name="histworld"/&gt; The [[longcase clock]] (also known as the [[grandfather clock]]) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the [[anchor escapement]] mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa072801a.htm |title=The History of Mechanical Pendulum Clocks and Quartz Clocks |work=about.com |year=2012 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in about 1670.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Technology: From the Earliest Times to A.D. 1900|last=Derry|first=T.

To avoid the need for a very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39&amp;nbsp;inches) long to the center of the bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain|first=Marshall|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/clock.htm|title=How Pendulum Clocks Work|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement also introduced the pendulum suspension spring in 1671. The concentric minute hand was added to the clock by [[Daniel Quare]], a London clock-maker, and the Second Hand was introduced.

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were another major contributor to the development of pendulum clocks in the 17th and 18th centuries, having had an "unusually keen appreciation of the importance of precision".&lt;ref name="Woods100"&gt;Woods, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods103"&gt;Woods, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In measuring an accurate one-second pendulum, for example, the Italian astronomer Father [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] persuaded nine fellow Jesuits "to count nearly 87,000 oscillations in a single day".&lt;ref name="Woods103"/&gt; They served a crucial role in spreading and testing the scientific ideas of the period, and collaborated with contemporary scientists, such as Huygens.&lt;ref name="Woods100"/&gt;

Like pendulum clocks, [[balance spring|spiral-hairspring]] [[watch]]es were early precision timekeeping devices.]]

The invention of the [[mainspring]] in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first [[pocketwatch]]es by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the [[balance spring]] was added to the [[balance wheel]] in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist [[Robert Hooke]] (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the actual inventor of the [[balance spring]]. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day.  The addition of the balance spring made the balance wheel a [[harmonic oscillator]] like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed [[resonant frequency]] and resisted oscillating at other rates.  This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day,&lt;ref name="nistrevolution"/&gt; resulting in the addition of the [[Clock face|minute hand]] to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://atena.beic.it/webclient/DeliveryManager?pid=13458392&amp;search_terms=DTL59|title=Acta Eruditorum|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1737|isbn=|location=Leipzig|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Like the invention of [[pendulum clock]], Huygens' spiral [[hairspring]] ([[balance spring]]) system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern [[watchmaking]] industry.

In 1675, Huygens and [[Robert Hooke]] invented the [[spiral balance]], or the hairspring, designed to control the oscillating speed of the [[balance wheel]]. This crucial advance finally made accurate [[pocket watch]]es possible.&lt;ref name="Pockets"/&gt;  This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10&amp;nbsp;minutes per day, similar to the effect of the pendulum upon mechanical clocks.&lt;ref name="NIST" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Milham | first= Willis I. | title=Time and Timekeepers | year=1945 | publisher=MacMillan | location=New York | isbn=0-7808-0008-7|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great English clockmaker, [[Thomas Tompion]], was one of the first to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.&lt;ref name="histworld"&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY OF CLOCKS|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&amp;HistoryID=ac08&amp;gtrack=pthc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rev. [[Edward Barlow (priest)|Edward Barlow]] invented the rack and snail striking mechanism for [[striking clock]]s, which was a great improvement over the previous mechanism. The [[repeater (horology)|repeating clock]], that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] invented the [[Escapement#Deadbeat escapement|deadbeat escapement]] for clocks in 1720.

[[Marine chronometer]]s are clocks used at sea as [[time standard]]s, to determine [[longitude]] by [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref name=marinechrono/&gt;
A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would have to keep the time of a fixed location—usually [[Greenwich Mean Time]]—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock.&lt;ref name=marinechrono&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nawcc.org/museum/nwcm/galleries/marine/marine.htm |title=Marine Chronometers Gallery |accessdate=20 May 2008 |publisher=[[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manitoba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html |title=Science News – The Marine Chronometer |accessdate=20 May 2008 |first=Jérôme |last=Marchildon |publisher=[[Manitoba Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919035618/http://www.manitobamuseum.ca/sg_marine.html|archivedate=September 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longitudeprize&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |title=Chronometers, precision watches, and timekeepers |publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]] |location=[[Greenwich]] |accessdate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029165741/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/index.cfm/category/chronometers |archivedate=October 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.

[[Image:MIH-film12 color cerrected denoise.jpg|thumb|right|A twin-barrel box chronometer.]]
After the [[Scilly naval disaster of 1707]] where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large [[longitude prize|prize]] of £20,000, equivalent to millions of pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by [[Yorkshire]] carpenter [[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.

In 1735 Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.

The chronometer was trialled in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds.&lt;ref name=gould&gt;{{cite book|author=Gould, Rupert T.|authorlink=Rupert Gould|title=The Marine Chronometer.

The first accurate atomic clock, a [[caesium standard]] based on a certain transition of the [[caesium-133]] atom, was built by [[Louis Essen]] in 1955 at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;

==Clock and watch-making industry==
{{Main article|Clockmaking|Watchmaking}}
[[Image:MontreGousset001.jpg|thumb|A [[pocket watch]]]]
The first professional clockmakers came from the [[guild]]s of [[locksmith]]s and [[jeweller]]s. Clockmaking developed from a specialized craft into a mass production industry over many years.&lt;ref name="Davies435" /&gt;

[[Paris]] and [[Blois]] were the early centres of clockmaking in France. French clockmakers such as [[Julien Le Roy]], clockmaker of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], were leaders in case design and ornamental clocks.&lt;ref name="Davies435"&gt;Davies, Norman; p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; Le Roy belonged to the fifth generation of a family of clockmakers, and was described by his contemporaries as "the most skillful clockmaker in France, possibly in Europe". He invented a special repeating mechanism which improved the precision of clocks and watches, a face that could be opened to view the inside clockwork, and made or supervised over 3,500&amp;nbsp;watches. The competition and scientific rivalry resulting from his discoveries further encouraged researchers to seek new methods of measuring time more accurately.&lt;ref name="Leroy"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Getty Center]]|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=556 |title=Julien Le Roy |accessdate=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1794 and 1795, in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], the French government briefly mandated [[decimal time|decimal clocks]], with a day divided into 10&amp;nbsp;hours of 100&amp;nbsp;minutes each.&lt;ref name="Alder"&gt;Alder, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomer and mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], among other individuals, modified the dial of his pocket watch to decimal time.&lt;ref name="Alder"/&gt; A clock in the [[Palais des Tuileries]] kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread.&lt;ref name="Alder162"&gt;Alder, pp. 150–162&lt;/ref&gt; Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the [[metric system]], and it was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Alder162"/&gt;

In Germany, [[Nuremberg]] and [[Augsburg]] were the early clockmaking centers, and the [[Black Forest]] came to specialize in wooden [[cuckoo clocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Antiques|last=Shull|first=Thelma|publisher=C. E. Tuttle Co.|year=1963|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pocketwatch movement.png|thumb|left|220px|An antique pocket watch movement, from an 1891 encyclopedia.]]
The English became the predominant clockmakers of the 17th and 18th centuries. The main centres of the British industry were in the [[City of London]], the [[West End of London]], [[Soho]] where many skilled French [[Huguenot]]s settled and later in [[Clerkenwell]]. The [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] was established in 1631 as one of the [[Livery Companies]] of the City of London.

[[Thomas Tompion]] was the first English clockmaker with an international reputation and many of his pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] who invented the deadbeat escapement, orrery and mercury [[pendulum]], and his pupil [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] who created the first [[lever escapement]]. Famous clockmakers of this period included [[Joseph Windmills]], Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and [[Christopher Pinchbeck]] who invented the alloy [[Pinchbeck (alloy)|pinchbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22169|title=Clock and Watch-Making|publisher=British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later famous horologists included [[John Arnold (watchmaker)|John Arnold]] who made the first practical and accurate modern watch by refining Harrison's chronometer, [[Thomas Earnshaw]] who was the first to make these available to the public, [[Daniel Quare]], who invented a repeating watch movement, a portable barometer and introduced the concentric minute hand.

Quality control and standards were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By the rise of [[consumerism]] in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London, however by the mid-19th century the industry had gone into steep decline from Swiss competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=England: Where watchmaking all began|url=http://www.watchpro.com/england-where-watchmaking-all-began/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switzerland established itself as a clockmaking center following the influx of [[Huguenot]] craftsmen, and in the 19th century, the Swiss industry "gained worldwide supremacy in high-quality machine-made watches". The leading firm of the day was [[Patek Philippe]], founded by [[Antoni Patek]] of [[Warsaw]] and [[Adrien Philippe]] of [[Bern]].&lt;ref name="Davies435"/&gt;

For each product group there is a specific implementation rule, which is set by the [[China|Chinese]] [[authorities]].

== Content of the Implementation Rules ==
The Implementation Rules include 12 or 13 [[chapters]], which determine the scope of the product [[certification]]. The following table provides an overview of the most common contents of the Implementation Rules:
# Scope
# Terms and definitions
# Standards for certification
# Certification pattern
# Individual product units
# Certification commission
# Certification procedure
# Certificates
# Approval procedure
# Certification logo
# Fees
# Responsibilities
# Certification rules &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnca.gov.cn/cnca/rdht/qzxcprz/jcjggljg/4731.html |publisher=Chinese Authority|title= 承担强制性产品认证工作的认证机构及其业务范围 (business scope of certification bodies undertaken product certifications) |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Update of the Implementation Rules ==
In 2014, the Implementation Rules have been updated, so that from 2015 some changes have come into effect. For example, some product groups, which were previously grouped under one Implementation Rule, are now divided and subject to some different Implementation Rules. Furthermore, new products have been added, which are now subject to the mandatory certification. Further factory levels were introduced, so that the companies that carry out a product certification will be assigned a level (A-D) in future. Companies that receive particularly positive results on their products certification will receive level A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.qz-online.de/news/normen-richtlinien/artikel/vier-aenderungen-bei-ccc-zertifizierungen-1063117.html?search.highlight=ccc-zertifizierung|publisher=QZ-Online|title= Vier Änderungen bei CCC-Zertifizierungen |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Infrastructure''' refers to the fundamental facilities and systems serving a country, city, or other area,&lt;ref&gt;. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/infrastructure Infrastructure | Define Infrastructure at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; including the services and facilities necessary for its [[economy]] to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) | first2=Steven M. | last2=Sheffrin | authorlink2 = Steven M.

In general, it has also been defined as "the physical components of interrelated systems providing [[Commodity|commodities]] and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal [[quality of life|living conditions]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fulmer|first=Jeffrey|title=What in the world is infrastructure?|journal=PEI Infrastructure Investor|year=2009|issue=July/August|pages=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ferry Building at night.jpg|thumb|upright=1.85|[[San Francisco Ferry Building]] at night]]
There are two general types of ways to view infrastructure, hard or soft. [[Hard infrastructure]] refers to the physical networks necessary for the functioning of a modern industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.laohamutuk.org/econ/14TLDPM/InfraCSOen.pdf|title=Civil Society Comments on Infrastructure Strategic Sector|last=Hamutak|first=Luta|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes roads, bridges, railways, etc. [[Soft infrastructure]] refers to all the institutions that maintain the [[Economy|economic]], health, social, and cultural standards of a country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This includes educational programs, parks and recreational facilities, law enforcement agencies, and emergency services.

The word infrastructure has been used in English since 1887 and in French since 1875, originally meaning "The installations that form the basis for any operation or system".&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/infrastructure (accessed: April 24, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opendb.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendb.net/element/19099.php|title=Soft Infrastructure – Definition|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723233028/http://www.opendb.net/element/19099.php|archivedate=2011-07-23|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was imported from [[French language|French]], where it means ''[[subgrade]]'', the native material underneath a constructed pavement or railway. The word is a combination of the [[Latin]] prefix "infra", meaning "below" and many of these constructions are underground, for example, tunnels, water and gas systems, and [[railways]]. The army use of the term achieved currency in the United States after the formation of [[NATO]] in the 1940s, and by 1970 was adopted by [[Urban planning|urban planners]] in its modern civilian sense.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Lewis [http://hakpaksak.wordpress.com/2008/09/22/the-etymology-of-infrastructure-and-the-infrastructure-of-the-internet/ The Ecology of Infrastructure and the Infrastructure of the Internet], blog ''Hag Pak Sak'', posted September 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
A 1987 [[United States National Research|US National Research Council]] panel adopted the term "public works infrastructure", referring to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...&amp;nbsp;both specific functional modes – highways, streets, roads, and bridges; mass transit; airports and airways; water supply and water resources; wastewater management; solid-waste treatment and disposal; electric power generation and transmission; telecommunications; and hazardous waste management – and the combined system these modal elements comprise.  A comprehension of infrastructure spans not only these public works facilities, but also the operating procedures, management practices, and development policies that interact together with societal demand and the physical world to facilitate the transport of people and goods, provision of water for drinking and a variety of other uses, safe disposal of society's waste products, provision of energy where it is needed, and transmission of information within and between communities."&lt;ref&gt;''Infrastructure for the 21st Century'', [[Washington, D.C.]]: National Academy Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The OECD also classifies communications as a part of infrastructure.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;OECD [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/25/43860714.pdf Economic Infrastructure. Common Reporting Standard (CRS) Codes] 2 pages, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Society of Civil Engineers publish a "Infrastructure Report Card" which represents the organizations opinion on the condition of various infrastructure every 2–4 years.&lt;ref name=asce17&gt;[http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2017-Infrastructure-Report-Card.pdf 2017 Infrastructure Report], 112pp, American Society of Civil Engineers, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of |2017}} they grade 16 categories, namely Aviation, Bridges, Dams, Drinking Water, Energy, Hazardous Waste, Inland Waterways, Levees, Parks &amp; Recreation, Ports, Rail, Roads, Schools, Solid Waste, Transit and Wastewater.&lt;ref name=asce17/&gt;{{rp|4}}

=== Personal ===
A way to embody personal infrastructure is to think of it in term of human capital.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/12990/1/Survey_infra_def.pdf|title=Public infrastructure: definition, classification and measurement issues|last=Torrisi|first=Gianpiero|date=January 2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human capital]] is defined by the Encyclopedia Britannica as “intangible collective resources possessed by individuals and groups within a given population".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-capital|title=Human capital {{!}} economics|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of personal infrastructure is to determine the quality of the economic agents’ values. This results in three major tasks: the task of economic proxies’ in the economic process (teachers, unskilled and qualified labor, etc.); the importance of personal infrastructure for an individual (short and long-term consumption of education); and the social relevance of personal infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Institutional ===
Institutional infrastructure branches from the term "economic constitution". According to Gianpiero Torrisi, Institutional infrastructure is the object of economic and legal policy. It compromises the grown and sets norms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It refers to the degree of actual equal treatment of equal economic data and determines the framework within which economic agents may formulate their own economic plans and carry them out in co-operation with others.

=== Material ===
Material infrastructure is defined as “those immobile, non-circulating capital goods that essentially contribute to the production of infrastructure goods and services needed to satisfy basic physical and social requirements of economic agents".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are two distinct qualities of material infrastructures: 1) Fulfillment of social needs and 2) Mass production. The first characteristic deals with the basic needs of human life. The second characteristic is the non-availability of infrastructure goods and services.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Economic ===
According to the business dictionary, economic infrastructure can be defined as "internal facilities of a country that make business activity possible, such as communication, transportation and distribution networks, financial institutions and markets, and energy supply systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/economic-infrastructure.html|title=What is economic infrastructure? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic infrastructure support productive activities and events. This includes roads, highways, bridges, airports, water distribution networks, sewer systems, irrigation plants, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Social ===
Social infrastructure can be broadly defined as the construction and maintenance of facilities that support social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aberdeen-asset.fr/en/thinkingaloud/investment-clarity/what-is-social-infrastructure|title=What is social infrastructure? {{!}} ThinkingAloudUK {{!}} Thinking Aloud|website=www.aberdeen-asset.fr|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social infrastructures are created to increase social comfort and act on economic activity. These being schools, parks and playgrounds, structures for public safety, waste disposal plants, hospitals, sports area, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Core ===
Core assets provide essential services and have monopolistic characteristics.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncpers.org/files/Conference%20Docs/Public%20Safety/2014%20Handouts/Robert%20Pease_Tuesday.pdf|title=Infrastructure Investment Opportunities for Public Safety Plans|last=Pease|first=Bob|date=October 28, 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors seeking core infrastructure look for five different characteristics: Income, Low volatility of returns, Diversification, Inflation Protection, and Long-term liability matching.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Core Infrastructure incorporates all the main types of infrastructure. For instance; roads, highways, railways, public transportation, water and gas supply, etc.

=== Basic ===
Basic infrastructure refers to main railways, roads, canals, harbors and docks, the electromagnetic telegraph, drainage, dikes, and land reclamation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It consist of the more well-known features of infrastructure. The things in the world we come across everyday (buildings, roads, docks, etc).

=== Complementary ===
Complementary infrastructure refers to things like light railways, tramways, gas/electricity/water supply, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To complement something, means to bring to perfection or complete it. So, complementary infrastructure deals with the little parts of the engineering world the brings more life. The lights on the sidewalks, the landscaping around buildings, the benches for pedestrians to rest, etc.

==Related concepts==
The term ''infrastructure'' may be confused with the following overlapping or related concepts.

[[Land improvement]] and [[land development]] are general terms that in some contexts may include infrastructure, but in the context of a discussion of infrastructure would refer only to smaller scale systems or works that are not included in infrastructure, because they are typically limited to a single [[Real property|parcel of land]], and are owned and operated by the land owner. For example, an irrigation canal that serves a region or district would be included with infrastructure, but the private irrigation systems on individual land parcels would be considered land improvements, not infrastructure. Service connections to municipal service and public utility networks would also be considered land improvements, not infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;''Land improvement'', Online BusinessDictionary.com, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/land-development.html (accessed January 31, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Land development'', Online BusinessDictionary.com, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/land-development.html (accessed January 31, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[public works]] includes government-owned and operated infrastructure as well as public buildings, such as schools and court houses. Public works generally refers to physical assets needed to deliver [[public services]]. Public services include both infrastructure and services generally provided by government.

==Ownership and financing==
{{Main|Infrastructure and economics}}
Infrastructure may be owned and managed by [[government]]s or by private companies, such as sole [[public utility]] or [[rail transport|railway]] companies. Generally, most roads, major airports and other ports, water distribution systems, and sewage networks are publicly owned, whereas most energy and telecommunications networks are privately owned.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Publicly owned infrastructure may be paid for from taxes, tolls, or metered user fees, whereas private infrastructure is generally paid for by metered user fees.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Major investment projects are generally financed by the issuance of long-term [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Government-owned and operated infrastructure may be developed and operated in the [[private sector]] or in [[public-private partnership]]s, in addition to in the [[public sector]]. {{as of|2008}} in the United States for example, public spending on infrastructure has varied between 2.3% and 3.6% of GDP since 1950.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/11/19/business/economy/19leonhardt_graphic.ready.html "Money for Public Projects"], November 19, 2008 (accessed January 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[List of financial institutions that invest in infrastructure|financial institutions invest in infrastructure]].

==Types==

===Engineering and construction===
[[Engineers]] generally limit the term "infrastructure" to describe [[fixed assets]] that are in the form of a large network; in other words, [[hard infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Efforts to devise more generic definitions of infrastructures have typically referred to the network aspects of most of the structures, and to the accumulated value of investments in the networks as assets.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} One such definition from 1998 defined infrastructure as the network of assets "where the system as a whole is intended to be maintained indefinitely at a specified standard of service by the continuing replacement and refurbishment of its components".&lt;ref&gt;Association of Local Government Engineers New Zealand: "Infrastructure Asset Management Manual", June 1998. Edition 1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil defense and economic development===
{{see also|Civil defense by country}}
[[Civil defense]] planners and [[Development economics|developmental economists]] generally refer to both hard and soft infrastructure, including [[public services]] such as [[schools]] and [[hospitals]], [[emergency services]] such as police and fire fighting, and basic [[financial services]]. The notion of [[infrastructure-based development]] combining long-term infrastructure investments by government agencies at central and regional levels with [[public private partnership]]s has proven popular among economists in Asia (notably [[Singapore]] and [[China]]), mainland Europe, and Latin America.

===Military===
[[Military]] infrastructure is the buildings and permanent installations necessary for the support of military forces, whether they are stationed in bases, being deployed or engaged in operations. For example, barracks, headquarters, airfields, communications facilities, stores of military equipment, port installations, and maintenance stations.&lt;ref&gt;D.O.D. Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, 2001 (rev. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green===
{{main|Green infrastructure}}
Green infrastructure (or blue-green infrastructure) highlights the importance of the natural environment in decisions about [[land use planning]].&lt;ref&gt;The Conservation Fund, Arlington, VA. [http://www.greeninfrastructure.net/ "Green Infrastructure".] Accessed 2009-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Annapolis, MD. [http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gidoc/gidoc.html ''Maryland's Green Infrastructure Assessment: A Comprehensive Strategy for Land Conservation and Restoration.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309184735/http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gidoc/gidoc.html |date=2008-03-09 }} May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular there is an emphasis on the "life support" functions provided by a network of natural [[ecosystem]]s, with an emphasis on [[interconnectivity]] to support long-term [[sustainability]]. Examples include clean [[water]] and healthy soils, as well as the more [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] functions such as [[recreation]] and providing shade and shelter in and around towns and cities. The concept can be extended to apply to the management of [[stormwater]] runoff at the local level through the use of natural systems, or engineered systems that mimic natural systems, to treat polluted [[urban runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C., et al., [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_intentstatement.pdf ''Green Infrastructure Statement of Intent.''] 2007-04-19. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512021555/http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_intentstatement.pdf |date=May 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA et al. [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_action_strategy.pdf "Managing Wet Weather with Green Infrastructure: Action Strategy 2008."] January 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512021449/http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/gi_action_strategy.pdf |date=May 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxism===
In [[Marxism]], the term "infrastructure" is sometimes used as a synonym for "base" in the [[dialectic]] synthetic pair ''[[base and superstructure]]''. However, the Marxist notion of "base" is broader than the non-Marxist use of the term "infrastructure", and some soft infrastructure, such as laws, governance, regulations, and standards, would be considered by Marxists to be part of the superstructure, not the base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/marx_karl.htm Marx, Karl Heinrich (1818–1883)], accessed January 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications===
Communications infrastructure is the informal and formal channels of communication, [[political]] and [[social network]]s, or beliefs held by members of particular groups, as well as [[information technology]], software development tools. Still underlying these more conceptual uses is the idea that infrastructure provides organizing structure and support for the system or organization it serves, whether it is a city, a nation, a corporation, or a collection of people with common interests. Examples include [[IT infrastructure]], research infrastructure, terrorist infrastructure, employment infrastructure and tourism infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==In the developing world==
According to researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]], the lack of infrastructure in many [[developing countries]] represents one of the most significant limitations to [[economic growth]] and achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)]]. Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive, especially in such areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely populated countries in [[Africa]]. It has been argued that infrastructure investments contributed to more than half of Africa's improved growth performance between 1990 and 2005, and increased investment is necessary to maintain growth and tackle [[poverty]]. The returns to investment in infrastructure are very significant, with on average thirty to forty percent returns for [[telecommunications]] (ICT) investments, over forty percent for [[electricity]] generation, and eighty percent for [[roads]].&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Christian K.M. Kingombe 2011. [https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6311.pdf Mapping the new infrastructure financing landscape]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional differences===
The demand for infrastructure, both by consumers and by companies is much higher than the amount invested.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; There are severe constraints on the supply side of the provision of infrastructure in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Peter McCawley (2010), '[http://apel.anu.edu.au/pdf/24-1/Articles/mccawley.pdf Infrastructure Policy in Developing countries'], ''Asian-Pacific Economic Literature'', 24(1), May. See also Asian-Pacific Economic Literature Policy Brief No 19, May 2010, on '[http://apel.anu.edu.au/pdf/24-1/Policy/mccawley.pdf Infrastructure policy in developing countries in Asia'].&lt;/ref&gt; The infrastructure financing gap between what is invested in [[Asia-Pacific]] (around US$48 billion) and what is needed (US$228 billion) is around US$180 billion every year.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In [[Latin America]], three percent of [[GDP]] (around US$71 billion) would need to be invested in infrastructure in order to satisfy demand, yet in 2005, for example, only around two percent was invested leaving a financing gap of approximately US$24 billion.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In Africa, in order to reach the seven percent annual growth calculated to be required to meet the MDGs by 2015 would require infrastructure investments of about fifteen percent of GDP, or around US$93 billion a year. In [[fragile state]]s, over thirty-seven percent of GDP would be required.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

===Sources of funding===
The source of financing varies significantly across sectors. Some sectors are dominated by government spending, others by [[development aid|overseas development aid (ODA)]], and yet others by private investors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  In California, infrastructure financing districts are established by local governments to pay for physical facilities and services within a specified area by using property tax increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=California Land Use and Planning Law|last=Barclay|first=Cecily|last2=Gray|first2=Matthew|publisher=Solano Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1938166112|edition=35|location=California|pages=585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to facilitate investment of the private sector in developing countries' infrastructure markets, it is necessary to design risk-allocation mechanisms more carefully, given the higher risks of their markets.&lt;ref&gt;Koh, Jae Myong (2018) ''Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects'', Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spending money that comes from the government is less than it used to be. Compared to the global GDP percentages, The United States is tied for second-to-last place, with an average percentage of 2.4%. This means that the government spends less money on repairing old infrastructure and or on infrastructure as a whole. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/10/20/large-economic-gains-can-come-from-mundane-improvements-in-policy|title=Large economic gains can come from mundane improvements in policy|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], governments spend around US$9.4 billion out of a total of US$24.9 billion. In [[irrigation]], governments represent almost all spending. In [[transport]] and [[energy]] a majority of investment is government spending. In [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] and [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]], the private sector represents the majority of capital expenditure. Overall, between them aid, the private sector, and non-[[OECD]] financiers exceed government spending. The private sector spending alone equals state capital expenditure, though the majority is focused on ICT infrastructure investments. External financing increased in the 2000s (decade) and in Africa alone external infrastructure investments increased from US$7 billion in 2002 to US$27 billion in 2009. [[China]], in particular, has emerged as an important investor.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

[[Internet]] technologies are used for cause-related [[fundraising]], [[community building]], [[lobbying]], and [[organizing (management)|organizing]]. A digital activism campaign is "an
organized public effort, making collective claims on a target authority, in which civic initiators or supporters use digital media."&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-activism.org/download/1270/ Edwards, Frank, Philip N.

== Types ==
Sandor Vegh divides online activism into three main categories: '''Awareness/advocacy''', '''organization/mobilization''', and '''action/reaction'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KHCjMkNRAkYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=sandor%20vegh%20online%20activism%20categories&amp;ots=NvYT6OGWNj&amp;sig=vT1cUU7btaEJh4kHpNpW459UzCs#v=onepage&amp;q=sandor%20vegh%20online%20activism%20categories&amp;f=false|title=Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice|first1=Martha|last1=McCaughey|first2=Michael D.|last2=Ayers|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other ways of classifying types of online activism, such as by the degree of reliance on the Internet. Thus, Internet sleuthing or hacking could be viewed as purely online forms of activism, whereas the Occupy Wall Street movement was only partially online.

The Internet is a key resource for independent activists, or E-activists, particularly those whose message may run counter to the mainstream. "Especially when a serious violation of [[human rights]] occurs, the Internet is essential in reporting the atrocity to the outside world."&lt;ref&gt;"Classifying Forms of Online Activism: The Case of Cyberprotests Against the World Bank" in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and PRACTICE,'' Eds. Ayers, Michael D., [[Martha McCaughey|Mccaughey, Martha]], pp. 72-73. Copyright 2003, Routledge, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; [[Listserv]]s like BurmaNet and Freedom News Group help distribute news that would otherwise be inaccessible in these countries.

Internet activists also pass on E-petitions to be sent to the government and public and private organizations to protest against and urge for positive policy change in areas from the [[arms industry|arms trade]] to [[animal testing]]. Many non-profits and charities use these methods, emailing petitions to those on their email list and asking people to pass them on. The Internet also enables organizations such as [[NGO]]s to communicate with individuals in an inexpensive and timely manner. Gatherings and [[protest]]s can be organized with the input of the organizers and the participants. [[Lobbying]] is also made easier via the Internet, thanks to [[e-mail bomb|mass e-mail]] and its ability to broadcast a message widely at little cost. Vegh's concept of organization/mobilization, for example, can refer to activities taking place solely online, solely offline but organized online, or a combination of online and offline. Mainstream [[social networking websites|social-networking sites]], most noticeably [[Facebook.com]], are also making e-activist tools available to their users.  An active participatory culture is enabled by the communities on social networking sites because they permit communication between groups that are otherwise unable to communicate. In the article "Why We Argue about Virtual Community: A Case Study of the Phish.net Fan Community," Nessim Watson stresses the necessity of communication in online communities. He even goes as far as to say that "Without ongoing communication among its participants, a community dissolves". The constant ability to communicate with members of the community enriches online community experiences and redefines the word community.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Nessim "Why We Argue about Virtual Community: A Case Study of the Phish.net Fan Community" pp. 103-104. SAG Publications 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[denial-of-Service attack]]s, the taking over and vandalizing of a website, uploading [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], and sending out [[e-mail bomb]]s (mass e-mailings) are also examples of Internet activism. For more examples of these types of subversive action, see [[hacktivism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Classifying Forms of Online Activism" in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice,'' pp. 71-95.

===Hashtag activism===
{{Main article|Hashtag activism}}
Hashtag activism is the use of [[hashtag]]s for fighting or supporting a cause through the usage of social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29047/hashtag-activism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use has been associated with the [[2014 Chibok kidnapping]], with hopes that it would help keep the story in the news and raise international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/10/michelle-obama-nigeria-presidential-address | title=Michelle Obama raises pressure over kidnapped schoolgirls | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hashtag itself has received 2 million retweets.

One example of the powerful rise of hashtag activism can be seen in the black feminist movement's use of hashtags to convey their cause. The famous hashtag "IamJada" was an internet backlash to the mocking "#Jadapose" that went viral, ensuing after a sixteen-year-old girl Jada Smart was photographed following her gang rape &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Digital Defense: Black Feminists Resist Violence With Hashtag Activism|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, a hashtag was employed to convey a powerful anti-rape message.

== Development processes ==

Exploring the dynamics of online activism for expressing resistance to a powerful organization, a [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772714000426 study] published in [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-organization/ Information and Organization] developed a critical mass approach to online activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghobadi, S., Clegg, S.|title=‘these days will never be forgotten’: Critical Mass Approach to Online Activism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772714000426|website=Information and Organization|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.infoandorg.2014.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were integrated in a four-year longitudinal process model that explains how online activism started, generated societal outcomes, and changed over time. The model suggests that online activism helped organize collective actions and amplify the conditions for revolutionary movements to form. Yet, it provoked elites’ reactions such as Internet filtering and surveillance, which do not only promote self-censorship and generate digital divide, but contribute to the ultimate decline of activism over time. The process model suggests a complex interplay among stakeholders’ interests, opportunities for activism, costs and outcomes that are neither foreseen nor entirely predictable. The authors challenge universal access to the Internet as a convenient and cost-free forum for practicing social activism by organizational stakeholders (customers, employees, outside parties). In fact, the technology enablers of social activism also enable its filtering and repression and thus more extreme states of information asymmetry may result in which powerful elites preserve their status and impose a greater digital divide.

In one study, a discussion of a developmental model of political mobilization is discussed. By citizens joining groups and creating discussion, they are beginning their first stage of involvement. Progressively, it is hoped that they will begin signing petitions online and graduating to offline contact as long as the organization provides the citizen with escalating steps of involvement (Vitak et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Vitak, J., Zube, P., Smock, A., Carr, C. T., Ellison, N., &amp; Lampe, C. (2011). It's Complicated: Facebook Users' Political Participation in the 2008 Election. Cyberpsychology, Behavior &amp; Social Networking, 14(3), 107-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of the mass media's centrality has been highly contested, with some people arguing that it promoted the voices of marginalized groups while others believe it sends forth the messages of the majority alone, leaving minority groups to have their voices robbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Apparently They Don’t Like Succinct and Articulate’: Journalists, Activists, and the Battle over News|journal=Soundbitten: The Perils of Media-Centered Political Activism|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of early activism ==
One of the earliest known uses of the Internet as a medium for activism was that around Lotus MarketPlace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpsr.org/prevsite/conferences/cfp91/culnan.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1990, [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] announced a [[direct mail marketing|direct-mail marketing]] [[database]] product that was to contain name, address, and spending habit information on 120 million individual U.S. citizens. While much of the same data was already available, privacy advocates worried about the availability of this data within one database. Furthermore, the data would be on [[CD-ROM]], and so would remain fixed until a new CD-ROM was issued.

In response, a mass e-mail and E-bulletin-board campaign was started, which included information on contacting [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] and [[form letter]]s. Larry Seiler, a [[New England]]-based computer professional, posted a message that was widely reposted on newsgroups and via e-mail: "It will contain a LOT of personal information about YOU, which anyone in the country can access by just buying the discs. It seems to me (and to a lot of other people, too) that this will be a little too much like [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|big brother]], and it seems like a good idea to get out while there is still time."Over 30,000 people contacted Lotus and asked for their names to be removed from the database. On January 23, 1991, Lotus announced that it had cancelled MarketPlace.&lt;ref&gt;Gurak, L.J. (1997). Persuasion and Privacy in Cyberspace: The Online Protests over Lotus MarketPlace and the Clipper Chip. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a survey article about online activism around the world, from [[Croatia]] to the [[United States]], appeared in ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine, with several activists being quoted about their projects and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The earliest example of mass emailing as a rudimentary form of [[DDoS]] occurred on Guy Fawkes Day 1994, when the [[Intervasion of the UK]] began email-bombing John Major's cabinet and UK parliamentary servers in protest against the [[Criminal Justice Bill]], which outlawed outdoor rave festivals and "music with a repetitive beat"

In 1995–1998, Z magazine offered courses online through Left Online University, with lessons on "Using the Internet for Electronic Activism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/pen-l@galaxy.csuchico.edu/msg06511.html |title=(PEN-L:700) USE the INTERNET to CHANGE THE WORLD: An Online Course for Activists |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=1995-10-08 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of [[cyber-dissidence]] and activism per se, that is, in its modern-day form, may have been inaugurated by Dr. Daniel Mengara, a Gabonese scholar and activist living in political exile in New Jersey in the United States. In 1998, he created a Website in French whose name ''Bongo Doit Partir'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bdpgabon.org/ Bongo Doit Partir]'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;/ref&gt; was clearly indicative of its purpose: it encouraged a revolution against the then 29-year-old regime of Omar Bongo in Gabon. The original URL, http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/ |title=Bongo Doit Partir &amp;#124; Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau |publisher=Globalwebco.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to redirect to http://www.bdpgabon.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdpgabon.org |title=Bongo Doit Partir &amp;#124; Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau |publisher=Bdpgabon.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 2000. Inaugurating what was to become common current-day practice in the politically involved blogosphere, this movement's attempt at rallying the Gabonese around revolutionary ideals and actions has ultimately been vindicated by the 2011 Tunisian and Egyption revolutions, where the Internet has proven to be an effective tool for instigating successful critique, opposition, and revolution against dictators. In July 2003, Amnesty International reported the arrest of five Gabonese known-to-be members of the cyber-dissident group ''Bongo Doit Partir''. The five members were detained for three months (See: Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/001/2003/en |title=Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2003-08-12 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/004/2003/en |title=Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2003-10-15 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Another well-known example of early Internet activism took place in 1998, when the [[Mexico|Mexican]] rebel group [[EZLN]] used decentralized communications, such as cell phones, to network with [[developed world]] activists and help create the [[anti-globalization]] group [[Peoples Global Action]] (PGA) to protest the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-bulletin.org/IBMEF_1_word%206%20files/pablo_rev.htm |title=A world of many worlds |publisher=Iran-bulletin.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PGA continued to call for "global days of action" and rally support of other anti-globalization groups in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/en/pgainfos/history.htm |title=www.agp.org – Brief history of PGA |publisher=Nadir.org |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a worldwide network of Internet activist sites, under the umbrella name of [[Indymedia]], was created "for the purpose of providing grassroots coverage of the WTO protests in [[Seattle]]" in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/static/about.shtml |title=Independent Media Center – www.indymedia.org – ((( i ))) |publisher=Indymedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line --&gt; |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2005/03/11/17262451.php |title=Media Activism, Indymedia History, Mar. 11, 2005 |publisher=Indybay.org |date=2005-03-11 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Jackie|date=2001|title=Globalizing Resistance: The Battle of Seattle and the Future of Social Movements|url=|journal=Mobilization: An International Journal|volume=6(1)|pages=1-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dorothy Kidd quotes Sheri Herndon in a July 2001 telephone interview about the role of the Internet in the anti-[[WTO]] protests: "The timing was right, there was a space, the platform was created, the Internet was being used, we could bypass the corporate media, we were using [[open publishing]], we were using [[multimedia]] platforms. So those hadn't been available, and then there was the beginning of the [[anti-globalization movement]] in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;"Indymedia.org: A New Communications Common in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice'' pp. 59.

In the UK, in 1999, the Government introduced a new employment tax called IR35. One of the first online trade associations was created to campaign against it. Within weeks they had raised £100,000 off the Internet from individuals who had never even met. They became a fully formed trade association called the Professional Contractors Group, which two years later had 14,000 members all paying £100 each to join. They presented the first ever e-petition to Parliament and organized one of the first flash mobs when using their database, to their surprise and others, 1,000 came in their call to lobby Parliament. They later raised £500,000 from the Internet to fund an unsuccessful High Court challenge against the tax, though ultimately they secured some concessions. Their first external affairs director, Philip Ross, has written a history of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomtofreelance.blogspot.co.uk/ Freedom to Freelance – the online revolution and the fight against IR35] (Philip Ross, Lulu June 2012), {{ISBN|978-1-4717-3575-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engagement in the practice of strategic voting was another development that came with Internet activism. People coordinated their vote pairing by entering their contact information into an online database, thereby reducing cost completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digitally Enabled Social Change: Activism in the Internet Age|last=Earl|first=Jennifer|last2=Kimport|first2=Katrina|publisher=MIT Press|year=2011|isbn=9780262015103|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The possibilities of online activism ==

Internet activism has had the effect of causing increased collective action among people, as found by Postmes and Brunsting (2002), who discovered a tendency among internet users to rely on internalized group memberships and social identities in order to achieve social involvement online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rodrigo_Sandoval_Almazan/publication/264827018_Towards_cyberactivism_20_Understanding_the_use_of_social_media_and_other_information_technologies_for_political_activism_and_social_movements/links/565bcad908aeafc2aac622a0.pdf|title=Towards cyberactivism 2.0?

The Internet is "tailor-made for a populist, insurgent movement," says [[Joe Trippi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slais.ubc.ca/courses/libr500/06-07-wt1/www/M_Holle-WWW/votepairing.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204150800/http://www.slais.ubc.ca/COURSES/libr500/06-07-wt1/www/M_Holle-WWW/votepairing.htm |archivedate=2008-02-04 |format=PDF |title=Citizen 2.0: How the Internet Shapes Citizen Participation}}&lt;/ref&gt; who managed the [[Howard Dean presidential campaign, 2004|Howard Dean campaign]]. In his campaign memoir, ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,'' Trippi notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Internet's] roots in the [[open-source]] [[ARPAnet]], its [[hacker culture]], and its decentralized, scattered architecture make it difficult for big, establishment candidates, companies and media to gain control of it. And the establishment loathes what it can't control. This independence is by design, and the Internet [[community]] values above almost anything the distance it has from the slow, [[homogeneous]] stream of [[United States|American]] commerce and culture. Progressive candidates and companies with forward-looking vision have an advantage on the Internet, too. [[Television]] is, by its nature, a nostalgic [[Media (communication)|medium]]. Look at [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|Ronald Reagan's campaign]] ads in the 1980s – they were masterpieces of nostalgia promising a return to America's past glory and [[prosperity]]. The Internet, on the other hand, is a forward-thinking and forward-moving medium, embracing change and pushing the envelope of [[technology]] and [[communication]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Use in political campaigns ===

When discussing the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]] candidates, Carol Darr, director of the [[Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet]] at [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], said of the candidates which benefited from use of the Internet to attract supporters: "They are all charismatic, outspoken mavericks and insurgents. Given that the Internet is interactive and requires an affirmative action on the part of the users, as opposed to a passive response from TV users, it is not surprising that the candidate has to be someone people want to touch and interact with."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.meetup.com/archives/000456.html  "Website Reels In Political Newbies"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20031005042314/http://press.meetup.com/archives/000456.html |date=2003-10-05 }} Hanstad, Chelsie Salisbury, Bill Pioneer Press, St. Paul, MO accessed February 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A more decentralized approach to campaigning arose, in contrast to a top-down, message-focused approach usually conducted in the mainstream. "The mantra has always been, 'Keep your message consistent. Keep your message consistent,'" said John Hlinko, who has participated in Internet campaigns for [[MoveOn.org]] and the electoral primary campaign of [[Wesley Clark]]. "That was all well and good in the past. Now it's a recipe for disaster ... You can choose to have a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] structure that's really doctrinaire and that's really opposed to grassroots. Or you can say, 'Go forth. Do what you're going to do.' As long as we're running in the same direction, it's much better to give some freedom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.meetup.com] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040924185855/http%3A//press.meetup.com/|date=2004-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-thirds of Internet users under the age of 30 have a SNS, and during the 2008 election, half of them used a SNS site for candidate information (Hirzalla, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Hirzalla, F., van Zoonen, L., &amp; de Ridder, J. (2011). Internet Use and Political Participation: Reflections on the Mobilization/Normalization Controversy. Information Society, 27(1), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-traditional activism ===

The Internet has become the catalyst for protests such as [[Occupy Wall Street]] and the [[Arab Spring]] as those involved have increasingly relied on social media to organize and stay connected.
In [[Myanmar]], online news paper Freedom News Group has leaked some government corruption and fuel to protests.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/nyregion/wall-street-occupiers-protesting-till-whenever.html?_r=1&amp;ref=occupywallstreet | work=The New York Times | first1=N.

In 2017, the [[Sleeping Giants]] cyberactivist group, among others, launched a boycott campaign against controversial, conservative webpage [[Breitbart News]], getting more than 2,000 organizations to remove it from ad buys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40411086/activists-push-back-against-the-platforms-that-quietly-empower-hate-groups|title=Activists Are Pushing Back Against Tech Platforms That Quietly Empower Hate Groups|date=2017-05-09|work=Fast Company|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/boycott-breitbart-lyft-hewlett-packard-t-mobile-autodesk-uber-amazon/|title=Lyft, HP won't advertise on Breitbart.

=== Corporate activism ===
Corporations are also using Internet activist techniques to increase support for their causes. According to Christopher Palmeri with ''BusinessWeek'' Online, companies launch sites with the intent to positively influence their own public image, to provide negative pressure on competitors, to influence opinion within select groups, and to push for policy changes.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Palmeri, [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_02/c3865004_mz003.htm Up Front: How To Make A Corporate Cause Click], BusinessWeek Online, January 12, 2004.  retrieved October 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clothing manufacturer, [[American Apparel]] is an example: The company hosts a website called [[Legalize LA]] that advocates [[immigration reform]] via blog, online advertising, links to news stories and educational materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanapparel.net/contact/legalizela/ |title=Legalize LA subpage |publisher=Americanapparel.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723013143/http://americanapparel.net/contact/legalizela/ |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news

Corporate methods of information dissemination is labelled "[[astroturfing]]," as opposed to "grassroots activism," due to the funding for such movements being largely private.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/2.01/960105-astroturf.html Anderson, Walter T.

=== Religious activism ===

[[Cybersectarianism]] is a new organizational form which involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader.  Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders.  Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Thornton, "The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era. " In Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., ''Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance'' (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental activism===
One of the earliest books on activism was Don Rittner's "Ecolinking - Everyone's Guide to Online Environmental Information," Published by Peachpit Press in 1992.  Rittner, an environmental activist from upstate New York, spent more than 20 years researching and saving the Albany Pine Barrens.  He was a beta tester for America Online and ran their Environmental Forum for the company from 1988 to when it launched in 1990.  He took his early environmental knowledge and computer savvy and wrote what was called the bible of the online environmental community.  It showed new Net users how to get online, find environmental information, connect to environmentalists around the world, and how to use those resources to save the planet.

=== Sexual Assault activism ===
Activism against sexual assault can be led on the internet, where individuals may feel comfortable talking about controversial topics. One such movements is the #NotGuilty movement. This movement began in April 2015 with Ione Wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://notguiltycampaign.co.uk/about/|title=About - #NotGuilty|work=#NotGuilty|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shared a "letter to her attacker" in her college paper. The letter described how she was sexually assaulted and how she chose to respond and build from that point in her life. At the end of the letter she urged readers to send a letter back describing their own sexual assault experience with the hashtag #notguilty. She received so many letters from locals that she decided to create a website, this caused global attention and inspired many to share their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wells|first=Ione|title=How we talk about sexual assault online|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/ione_wells_how_we_talk_about_sexual_assault_online|language=en|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Me Too movement]] is a similar movement that started in Hollywood. [[Tarana Burke]] created the phrase to "empower women through empathy" and [[Alyssa Milano]] helped spread the use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://metoomvmt.org/|title=You Are Not Alone|last=Alone|first=You Are Not|website=You Are Not Alone|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/19/the-woman-behind-me-too-knew-the-power-of-the-phrase-when-she-created-it-10-years-ago/|title=The woman behind ‘Me Too’ knew the power of the phrase when she created it — 10 years ago|last=Ohlheiser|first=Abby|date=2017-10-19|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase was first used to demonstrate the amount of sexual assault that happens to young actresses and actors in Hollywood. It soon spread to apply to all forms of sexual assault, especially in the work place. These movements were intended to create an outlet for men and women to share their experiences with those with similar views without blame or guilt. They brought widespread attention to sexual assault and caused much controversy about changes that should be made accordingly. &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fonda|first=Jane|date=January 1, 2018|title=After #metoo|url=|journal=Nation|volume=306|pages=22-25|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism around movements such as these centers on concerns about whether or not participants are being dishonest for their own gain or are misinterpreting acts of kindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://womensenews.org/2018/01/beware-the-metoo-backlash-it-masks-ugly-lies-about-women/|title=Beware the #MeToo Backlash—It Masks Ugly Lies About Women|work=Women's eNews|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on everyday political discussions ==

According to some observers, the Internet may have considerable potential to reach and engage opinion leaders who influence the thinking and behavior of others. According to the Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet, what they call "Online Political Citizens" (OPCs) are "seven times more likely than average citizens to serve as opinion leaders among their friends, relatives and colleagues… Normally, 10% of Americans qualify as Influentials. Our study found that 69% of Online Political Citizens are Influentials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdi.org/UploadedFiles/political%20influentials.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407090353/http://www.ipdi.org/UploadedFiles/political%20influentials.pdf |archivedate=2004-04-07 |format=PDF |title=Political Influentials in the 2004 Presidential campaign |publisher=Institute for Politics, Democracy and the Internet, Graduate School of Political Management |date=February 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information communication technologies ==
Information communication technologies (ICTs) make communication and information readily available and efficient. There are millions of Facebook accounts, Twitter users and websites, and one can educate oneself on nearly any subject. While this is for the most part a positive thing, it can also be dangerous. For example, people can read up on the latest news events relatively easily and quickly; however, there is danger in the fact that apathy or fatigue can quickly arise when people are inundated with so many messages, or that the loudest voice on a subject can often be the most extreme one, distorting public perception on the issue.

These social networks which occupy ICTs are simply modern forms of political instruments which pre-date the technological era.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Laura|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|year=2010|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can now go to online forums or Twitter instead of town hall meetings. People can essentially mobilize worldwide through the Internet. Women can create transnational alliances and lobby for rights within their respective countries; they can give each other tips and share up-to-date information. This information becomes "hyper textual", available in downloadable formats with easy access for all.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt; The UN organizations also use "hyper textual" formats. They can post information about upcoming summits, they can post newsletters on what occurred at these meetings, and links to videos can be shared; all of this information can be downloaded at the click of a button.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt; The UN and many other actors are presenting this information in an attempt to get a certain message out in the cyber sphere and consequently steer public perception on an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Laua|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|year=2010|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With all this information so readily available, there is a rising trend of "slacktivism" or "clicktivism".  While it is positive that information can be distributed so quickly and efficiently all around the world, there is negativity in the fact that people often take this information for granted, or quickly forget about it once they have seen it flash across our computer screens.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt;  Viral campaigns are great for sparking initial interest and conversation, but they are not as effective in the long term—people begin to think that clicking "like" on something is enough of a contribution, or that posting information about a current hot topic on their Facebook page or Twitter feed means that they have made a difference.

== Fundraising capability ==

The Internet has also made it easier for small donors to play a meaningful role in financing political campaigns. Previously, small-donor fundraising was prohibitively expensive, as costs of printing and postage ate up most of the money raised.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}} Groups like [[MoveOn.org|MoveOn]], however, have found that they can raise large amounts of money from small donors at minimal cost, with credit card transaction fees constituting their biggest expense. "For the first time, you have a door into the political process that isn't marked 'big money,' " says Darr. "That changes everything.

== Ethical Considerations ==
With [[internet]] technology vastly changing existing and introducing new mechanisms by which to attain, share and employ information, internet activism raises ethical issues for consideration. Proponents contend internet activism serves as an outlet for social progress but only if personal and professional ethics are employed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/articles_papers_reports/770|title=Ethics in Online Activism: False Senses of Social Action or Effective Source of Change?|last=Jaber|first=Rimah|date=February 22, 2016|work=Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs|access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of online activism claim new information and communications technologies help increase the political power of activist groups that would otherwise have less resources. Proponents along this line of thinking claim the most effective use of online activism is its use in conjunction with more traditional or historical activism activities.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Pickerill, "Rethinking political participation: Experiments in internet activism in Australia and Britain." Curtin University of Technology, July, 2002. Retrieved 2017-3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, critics worry about facts and beliefs becoming indistinct in online campaigns and about "sectors of online activism [being] more self-interested than socially interested."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These critics warn against the manipulation commonplace to online activism for private or personal interests such as exploiting charities for monetary gain, influencing voters in the political arena and inflating self-importance or effectiveness. In this sense, the ethical implication is that activism becomes descriptive rather than transformative of society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  One of these reviewers suggests seven pitfalls to beware of in internet activism: "self-promotion at the expense of the movement... unsolicited bulk [[email]]... [[Hacktivism]]... violating [[copyright]]... nagging... violating privacy... and being scary." &lt;ref&gt;Tom Head, "A Short Guide to the Ethics and Etiquette of Online Activism." Pearson, August 4, 2010. Retrieved 2017-3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ethical criticisms against the prevalence of online activism are further discussed in the criticisms section of this article.

== Criticism ==

=== Demographic issues ===
Critics argue that Internet activism faces the same challenges as other aspects of the [[digital divide]], particularly the [[global digital divide]]. Some say it gives disproportionate representation to those with greater access or technological ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shulman.ucsur.pitt.edu/doc/Papers/gendiff.pdf |title=IRMJ01mcmanus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210154058/http://shulman.ucsur.pitt.edu/doc/Papers/gendiff.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen |first=Jakob |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/digital-divide.html |title=Digital Divide: The Three Stages (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox) |publisher=Useit.com |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups that may be disadvantaged by the move to activist activity online are those that have limited access to technologies, or lack the technological literacy to engage meaningfully online; these include ethnic and racial minorities, those of lower socioeconomic status, those with lower levels of education, and the elderly.

A study looked at the impact of Social Networking Sites (SNS) on various demographics and their political activity. Not surprisingly college students used SNS for political activity the most but this was followed by a more unlikely group, those that had not completed high school. In addition the probability for non-White citizens to consume political information was shown to be higher than that of Whites. These two outcomes go in the face of normal predictors of political activity. Despite these surprising findings older generations, men and whites showed the highest levels of political mobilization. Acts of political mobilization, such as fundraising, volunteering, protesting require the most continued interest, resources and knowledge (Nam, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Nam, T. (2011). Whose e-democracy? The democratic divide in American electoral campaigns. Information Polity: The International Journal of Government &amp; Democracy in the Information Age, 16(2), 131-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real debate? ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;The experience of the echo chamber is easier to create with a computer than with many of the forms of political interaction that preceded it," Sunstein told the ''[[New York Times]]''. "The discussion will be about strategy, or [[horse race journalism|horse-race issues]] or how bad the other candidates are, and it will seem like debate. It's not like this should be censored, but it can increase acrimony, increase extremism and make mutual understanding more difficult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Scott Duke Harris of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' noted that "the Internet connects [all sides of issues, not just] an ideologically broad anti-war constituency, from the leftists of [[Act Now to Stop War and End Racism|ANSWER]] to the pressed-for-time '[[soccer moms]]' who might prefer [[moveon.org|MoveOn]], and conservative activists as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216042234/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archivedate=2003-02-16 |format=PDF |title=Scott Duke Harris: Anti-war Movement Marshals Forces Online |author=Scott Duke Harris |date=February 3, 2003 |quote=The Internet connects an ideologically broad anti-war constituency, from the leftists of A.N.S.W.E.R. to the pressed-for-time "soccer moms" who might prefer MoveOn, and conservative activists as well. And for its part, MoveOn is itself part of an anti-war coalition that includes the NAACP, the Sierra Club, the National Organization for Women and the National Council of Churches.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern, according to University of California professor Barbara Epstein, is that the Internet "allows people who agree with each other to talk to each other and gives them the impression of being part of a much larger network than is necessarily the case." She warns that the impersonal nature of communication by computer may actually undermine the human contact that always has been crucial to social movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216042234/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archivedate=2003-02-16 |format=PDF |title=Scott Duke Harris: Anti-war Movement Marshals Forces Online |author=Scott Duke Harris |date=February 3, 2003 |quote=All the Internet traffic may represent an "echo chamber" of virtual activism rather than meaningful protest, warns Barbara Epstein, a University of California-Santa Cruz professor of the history of consciousness. The Internet, she says, "allows people who agree with each other to talk to each other and gives them the impression of being part of a much larger network than is necessarily the case."  The impersonal nature of communication by computer, Epstein suggests, may have a more insidious effect, undermining important human contact that always has been crucial to social movements. During the Vietnam War, "a large sector of a generation got drawn in, in a very personal way. They went to a protest because their roommate was going. The movement became the center of social life. It became the most exciting place on campus."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern, expressed by author and law professor [[Cass Sunstein]], is that online political discussions lead to "[[cyberbalkanization]]"—discussions that lead to fragmentation and polarization rather than consensus, because the same medium that lets people access a large number of news sources also enables them to pinpoint the ones they agree with and ignore the rest.

=== Moving to offline action ===

Famed activist [[Ralph Nader]] has stated that "the Internet doesn't do a very good job of motivating action", citing that the [[United States Congress]], corporations and [[the Pentagon]] do not necessarily "fear the civic use of the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lasar |first=Matthew |url=https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/05/ralph-nader-internet-not-so-hot-at-motivating-action.ars |title=Ralph Nader: Internet not so hot at "motivating action" |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethan Zuckerman]] talks about "[[slacktivism]]", claiming that the Internet has devalued certain currencies of activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.causebuilder.info |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124121745/http://www.causebuilder.info/ |archivedate=2012-11-24 |title=Causebuilder Resources and Information |publisher=Causebuilder.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens may "like" an activist group on [[Facebook]], visit a website, or comment on a blog, but fail to engage in political activism beyond the Internet, such as volunteering or canvassing. This critique has been criticized as Western-centric, however, because it discounts the impact this can have in authoritarian or repressive contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV2E2T9GFaE |title=Cyberactivism and the Arab Revolt: Battles Waged Online and Lessons Learned (Part 1 of 9) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Courtney C. Radsch]] argued that even this low level of engagement was an important form of activism for [[Arab]] youth because it is a form of free speech, and can spark mainstream media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bakerinstitute.org/publications/ITP-pub-CyberactivismAndWomen-051712.pdf |title=Unveiling the Revolutionaries: Cyberactivism and Women's Role in the Arab Uprisings|author=Radsch, Courtney|publisher=Rice University | date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slacktivism ===

Scholars are divided as to whether the Internet will increase or decrease political participation, including online activism. Those who suggest political participation will increase believe the Internet can be used to recruit and communicate with more users, and offers lower-costs modes of participation for those who lack the time or motivation to engage otherwise. Those concerned that the Internet will decrease activism argue that the Internet occupies free time that can no longer be spent getting involved in activist groups, or that Internet activism will replace more substantial, effortful forms of in-person activism.

=== Clicktivism ===

Another criticism is clicktivism. According to techopedia, clicktivism is a controversial form of digital activism. Proponents believe that applying advertising principles such as A/B testing increases the impact of a message by leveraging the Internet to further its reach. Opponents believe that clicktivism reduces activism to a mere mouse-click, yielding numbers with little or no real engagement or commitment to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Janssen |first=Cory |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/28184/clicktivism |title=What is Clicktivism? - Definition from |publisher=Techopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Micah M. White]] argues, "Political engagement becomes a matter of clicking a few links. In promoting the illusion that surfing the web can change the world, clicktivism is to activism as McDonalds is to a slow-cooked meal. It may look like food, but the life-giving nutrients are long gone."&lt;ref name="commondreams1"&gt;{{cite web|last=White |first=Micah |url=https://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/08/12-4 |title=Clicktivism is Ruining Leftist Activism |publisher=Common Dreams |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that political engagement becomes a matter of clicking a few links and neglects the vital, immeasurable inner-events and personal epiphanies that great social ruptures are actually made of. It reduces activism to a mere mouse click.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bath.ac.uk/hss-placements/2012/12/02/clicktivism/ |title=Humanities &amp; Social Sciences' Placements |publisher=Blogs.bath.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Micah M. White]] goes on to argue that "... clicktivism reinforces the fear of standing out from the crowd and taking a strong position. It discourages calling for drastic action. And as such, clicktivism will never breed social revolution. To think that it will is a fallacy. One that is dawning on us".&lt;ref name="commondreams1" /&gt;

=== State repression ===

In ''Net Delusion'', author Evgeny Morozov argues against cyberutopianism. He describes how the Internet is successfully used against activists and for the sake of state repression.&lt;ref&gt;Morozov, E. (2011). The Net Delusion The Dark Side of Internet Freedom. New York: Public Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Canadian Engineer Iron Ring.jpg|thumb|200px|Iron Ring, stainless steel version, circa 2004]]

The '''Iron Ring''' is a ring worn by many [[Canadians|Canadian]]-trained [[engineer]]s, as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and [[engineering ethics|ethics]] associated with their profession. From a concept originated in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironring.ca Origin of the Iron Ring concept]&lt;/ref&gt; the ring is presented to graduates in a closed ceremony known as [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]],&lt;ref name="ritual"&gt;"[http://www.ironring.ca/background.php The Calling of an Engineer]", ''[[The Corporation of the Seven Wardens]]'', Retrieved November 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HPa&gt;Petroski 2012, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;  developed with the assistance of English poet [[Rudyard Kipling]].&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt;

The ring symbolizes the pride which engineers have in their profession, while simultaneously reminding them of their humility. The ring serves as a reminder to the engineer and others of the engineer's obligation to live by a high standard of professional conduct. It is not a symbol of qualification as an engineer – this is determined by the provincial and territorial licensing bodies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.camp1.ca/wordpress/?page_id=2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material and design ==

The Iron Ring is made from either [[iron]] or [[stainless steel]].&lt;ref name="ringceremony"/&gt; The first ceremony awarding the ring was held in 1925, under the supervision of [[Herbert E. T. Haultain]], professor of mining engineering  at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=HPa /&gt;

The rings are given in ceremonies held at individual universities, each assigned one of 26 camps of the [[Corporation of the Seven Wardens]]. Because iron deteriorates turning the finger black and making the ring fit more loosely, all camps except [[Toronto]] have stopped conferring rings made of iron and have switched to stainless steel rings.  At the Toronto camp, the individual ceremonies held at the [[University of Toronto]], [[University of Ottawa]], [[Ryerson University]], [[York University]] and the [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]], continue to provide recipients with a choice of rings made of iron or stainless steel.

Many incorrectly believe that the rings are made from the steel of a beam from the first [[Quebec Bridge]], which collapsed during construction in 1907. Seventy-five construction workers died in the collapse which was attributed to poor planning and design by the overseeing engineers.&lt;ref name="iron_ring"&gt;"[http://www.eir.ca/engineers/ironring.php?link=4 The Iron Ring ]", Engineer-in-Residence, ''[[Professional Engineers Ontario]]'', Retrieved November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rudyard Kipling]], who wrote the ritual obligation,&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt; indicated that the Ring as an allegory in itself be rough, not smoothed, and hammered, and as a ring have no beginning nor end.  There is no evidence that there is any particular history in the source of "Cold Iron" (from the Calling of the Engineer ceremony) for the Ring, nor any intention that there should have been. Remnants of the Quebec Bridge legend still exist in Canada.&lt;ref name=HPa /&gt;&lt;ref name="ringceremony"&gt;J. Jeswiet, "[http://www.networx.on.ca/~njdevil/mainpage/E_Eng/Academic/jj-ring.htm Information Relevant to the Iron Ring Ceremony]", November 22, 2001; Retrieved November 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iron Ring is worn on the [[little finger]] ("[[pinky ring|pinky]]") of the working (dominant) hand.&lt;ref name="ringceremony"/&gt; There, the facets act as a sharp reminder of one's obligation while the engineer works, because it could drag on the writing surface while the engineer is drawing or writing. This is particularly true of recently obligated engineers, whose rings bear sharp, unworn, facets. Protocol dictates that the rings should be returned by retired engineers or by the families of deceased engineers.  Some camps offer previously obligated or "experienced" rings, but they are now rare due to medical and practical complications.

The Ring itself is small and understated, designed as a constant reminder, rather than a piece of jewelry. The Rings were originally hammered manually with a rough outer surface.  The modern machined ring design is unique, a reminder of the manual process. Twelve half-circle facets are carved into the top and bottom of the outer surface, with the two sets of facets offset rotationally by fifteen degrees.

The [[Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]] is the ceremony where Iron Rings are given to graduating engineers who choose to obligate themselves to the highest professionalism and humility of their profession. It is a symbol that reflects the moral, ethical and professional commitment made by the engineer who wears the ring.  The ceremonies are private affairs with no publicity. Invitations to attend are extended to local engineering alumni and professional engineers by those who are scheduled to participate. For some schools, the invitation to witness the ceremony is open to anyone in the engineering profession, and non-obligated engineers may not participate in the ritual.  Some graduating engineers choose to receive a ring passed on from a relative or mentor, giving the ceremony a personal touch.

== Adoption in the United States ==
[[File:Order of the Engineer Ring (Macro).jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|An example of a plain stainless steel band issued by the [[Order of the Engineer]] in the United States]]

Based upon the success of the Iron Ring in Canada, a similar program was created in the [[United States]], where the [[Order of the Engineer]]&lt;ref name="order"&gt;"[http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/ About The Order]", ''[[Order of the Engineer]]'', Retrieved November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1970. The organization conducts similar ring ceremonies at a number of U.S. colleges, in which the recipient signs an "Obligation of the Engineer"&lt;ref name="oblige"&gt;"[http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Leadership_Training_-_New/OBLIGATION.pdf Obligation of the Engineer]", ''[[American Society of Civil Engineers]]''; Retrieved November 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and receives a stainless steel [[Engineer's Ring]] (which, unlike the Canadian Iron Ring, can be smooth and not faceted). The first such ceremony occurred on June 4, 1970, at the [[Cleveland State University]] under the supervision of Lloyd Chancy.&lt;ref name=HPb&gt;Petroski 2012, p.175-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialized engines/engine middle-ware==
{{Unsourced-section|date=January 2018}}
Some features may be integrated into engines. For instance for trees and foliage a special "engine" is available, [[SpeedTree]], that does just that (or could be integrated into general engines). The [[Euphoria (software)|Euphoria]] character's 3D animating engine can be used independently but is integrated in the [[Rockstar Advanced Game Engine]] and the game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''.

==Co-existence==

Older technologies substantially co-existing with newer technologies include:
* [[Hammer]]s have not been displaced by [[nail gun]]s
* Long-distance travel by [[railroad]]s and [[highway]] has to some degree been displaced by [[airplane]], but not entirely - especially in countries adopting [[high-speed rail]]
* [[Ferry]] travel has not been completely displaced by [[bridge]]s and airplanes
* [[Ford (crossing)|Fords]] are still used for rural roads, though [[bridge]]s have replaced them for most roads in most developed countries
* [[Postal mail]] continues to be used alongside [[email]], but with substantial decreases in personal correspondence outside of special occasions, due to the availability of [[text message]]s and [[email]].
* [[Shield]]s co-exist with [[bulletproof vest]]s, and are used by [[riot police]]. Lighter-weight and stronger materials are available compared to ancient wooden and bronze shields, including clear plastic shields and bulletproof shields mounted on firing platforms.
* [[Analog watch]]es are still widely used for reasons of fashion and personal preference despite the availability of [[digital watch]]es which can be made much lighter and with [[smart watch]] capabilities.
* [[Pneumatic tube]]s for passenger transport have been used in [[atmospheric railway]] to provide motive power, like a [[Cable car (railway)|cable car]] system.  [[Vactrain]] systems, where the entire passenger compartment travels through an evacuated tube, never became operational, but are still being investigated for high-speed transport.
* [[Fireplace]]s are still used for primary heat in some houses in developed countries, though [[furnace]]s, [[electric heat]], and other modern [[HVAC]] systems are less polluting, can be better controlled, and can also provide cooling.
* [[Hot water bottle]]s continue to be used along with [[electric blanket]]s and [[heating pad]]s.

|[[Bach Digital]]
|[[Johann Sebastian Bach]]
|
|Bach Digital is a digital library consisting of Johann Sebastian Bach's autograph manuscripts and original parts. Using advanced search options of works or sources, one can find high-resolution scans of the autograph manuscripts, as well as performance parts used by Bach and his copies of works by other composers.
The autograph manuscripts and original sources from the collections of all of the participating partners – the Berlin State Library, the Bach-Archiv Leipzig and the Saxon State Library – Dresden State and University Library – will be digitized by 2011, thereby encompassing 90% of the worldwide remaining manuscripts. Further autograph manuscripts from other collections should be integrated at a later date.

According to recent research, combined shipments of devices including PCs, tablets, ultramobiles and mobile phones are projected to reach 2.5 billion units in 2014, a 7.6 percent increase from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van der Meulen|first1=Rob|title=Gartner Says Worldwide Traditional PC, Tablet, Ultramobile and Mobile Phone Shipments On Pace to Grow 7.6 Percent in 2014|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2645115|website=Gartner.com|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This trend, which is expected to continue to grow, is being driven by users who utilize more than one device. In fact, today the average user has 3+ different devices that they use for work purposes on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=2013 Mobile Workforce Adoption Trends|journal=Forrester Research|date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These mobile devices entering the enterprise has led to over 60% of information workers working outside of a traditional office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Application and Collaboration Workforce Survey|journal=Forrester Research Inc’s Business Technographics|date=Q4 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the shift to mobility seems to be growing, it is causing problems for both the end user and IT department. End users don’t feel they are equipped to work outside of the office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Telecom and Mobility Workforce Survey|journal=Forrester Business Technographics|date=Q2 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and IT is forced to manage the security risks presented by data and applications leaving the corporate network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Security Survey|journal=Forrester Business Technographics|date=Q2 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address these challenges, organizations are looking to mobile workspace technology that can provide users access to their corporate applications, files and services while maintaining security for their IT department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Natalie|title=CIOs: Focus On The Individual (Are You Ready For User-Centric IT?)|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/netapp/2014/06/19/cio-user-centric-it/|website=https://www.forbes.com/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Bowker, senior analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group said, "Mobile workspaces are playing a key role in addressing the new organizational imperative around secure mobility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citrix Customers Transform Their Businesses with Mobile Workspace Solutions|url=http://investors.citrix.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=834155|publisher=Citrix|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==

'''Applications''' 
[[Microsoft]] (particularly [[Microsoft Office]]) have been the dominant office software suite for enterprise along with numerous other [[Windows Applications|Windows applications]]. Newer to the market is the growth of [[SaaS|Software-as-a-Service]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kanaracus|first1=Chris|title=Gartner: SaaS market to grow 17.9 percent to $14.5 billion|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/gartner-saas-market-grow-179-percent-145-billion-189583|website=InfoWorld.com|publisher=InfoWorld|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and web-based applications such as [[Salesforce.com]], [[LinkedIn]] and [[Evernote]]. Additionally, mobile applications have seen growth of 200% from 2011 to 2012, a trend that is expected to continue into 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile Applications Futures 2013-2017|url=http://www.portioresearch.com/en/major-reports/current-portfolio/mobile-applications-futures-2013-2017.aspx|website=www.portioresearch.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mobile workspace includes access to all types of applications (Windows, mobile, web, SaaS, and HTML5-based) from the user device.

'''Data'''
Files access is important for business productivity as well as business collaboration. A user’s mobile workspace must give a user access to all of their corporate data and allow for this data to be accessible on multiple devices. This requirement for file sync and sharing has led to the growth of many online sharing options&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClure|first1=Terri|title=Market Landscape Report: Online File Sharing and Collaboration in the Enterprise|url=http://www.esg-global.com/linkservid/E5D25DD4-98E8-DC8E-62DD9C6B0817F426/showMeta/0/|website=esg-global.com|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Citrix Sharefile, Dropbox, Google Drive, [[Box (company)|Box]], and [[iCloud]].

'''Collaboration''' 
Due to factors like globalization, telecommuting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biro|first1=Meghan|title=Telecommuting Is The Future of Work|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghanbiro/2014/01/12/telecommuting-is-the-future-of-work/|website=Forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employees working outside of traditional offices, collaboration tools are becoming increasingly important.  Collaboration tools include [[electronic communication]], [[Web conference|online web-conferencing]], [[file sharing]] and [[social collaboration|social collaboration software]].

'''Network access'''
People now work from all locations – the office, a coffee shop, the airport, their homes – yet still require access to their content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meister|first1=Jeanne|title=The Death Of The Office: What Happens When The Workspace Is Mobile, On-Demand And All About Networking|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2013/11/06/the-death-of-the-office-what-happens-when-the-workspace-is-mobile-on-demand-and-all-about-networking/|website=Forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When outside the office, people still need access to resources behind the firewall generally requiring VPN access. A mobile workspace allows secure access to apps, data and services no matter where the user is or what type of network they are using (LAN, WAN, 3G/4G, etc.).

'''Cloud'''
As [[cloud computing]] becomes more popular, IT organizations are looking to the cloud to host more services than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Columbus|first1=Louis|title=Predicting Enterprise Cloud Computing Growth|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2013/09/04/predicting-enterprise-cloud-computing-growth/|website=Forbes|publisher=forbes.com|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IT departments now can choose where to host their apps, data, desktops, etc. in the most appropriate location whether that’s on-premises in a datacenter or a private, public or [[hybrid cloud]]. Users need access to these resources from their mobile workspace.

'''Any device'''
Research suggests that mobile devices are set to outnumber the total number people on earth by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobiles 'to outnumber people next year', says UN agency|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-22464368|website=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As device types and manufacturers continue to grow, users still need to access their mobile workspace irrespective of device type, operating system or manufacturer.

'''Mobiles for Development (M4D)''', a more specific iteration of [[Information and Communication Technologies for Development]] (ICT4D), refers to the use of [[mobile technologies]] in [[International development|global development]] strategies.  Focusing on the fields of international and socioeconomic development and human rights, M4D relies on the theory that increased access to mobile devices acts as an integral cornerstone in the promotion of overall societal development.

Once viewed as an item of luxury and privilege, [[mobile phones]] and devices have become a near necessity throughout the developed and developing world alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aker|first=J|author2=Mbiti, I|title=Mobile phones and economic development in Africa|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|year=2010|volume=24|issue=3|pages=207–232|jstor=20799163|doi=10.1257/jep.24.3.207}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 2007 [[United Nations]] study, over two thirds of the world’s mobile phones are owned and utilized within [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blumenstock|first=Joshua Evan|author2=Eagle, Nathan|title=Divided We Call: Disparities in Access and Use of Mobile Phones in Rwanda|journal=Information Technologies and International Development|year=2012|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1–16|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA298504149&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=utoronto_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=6c19c711135ec1dc2de19c74d3a41126|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With less-developed wired infrastructure and the high cost associated with its modernization and implementation, the adoption of cellular technologies can be attributed to a necessary [[leapfrogging]] of traditional telephony and communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wired/Wireless Internet Communications: Third International Conference, WWIC|year=2005|publisher=Springer|page=117|author=Heijenk, Geert|chapter=Interference-Based Routing in Multi-hop Wireless Infrastructures|author2=Liu, Fei|editor=Braun, Torsten|accessdate=3 February 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3dojYnyBIgC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=wired+infrastructure&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0c7ONovckg&amp;sig=7jpum-Gi8AKOJ8BYlKcYn5BHzIw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P8D8UrTrNsHJygHKyYHwBw&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, the unsound and undependable electrical infrastructure of many developing countries does not cater well to mass hardwired ICT adoption.  The portability, battery power, and flexibility of mobile technologies is well suited to the common pursuits and lifestyles of those residing in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Katharine|author2=Cull, Tracy|title="Ten Seeds": How Mobiles Have Contributed to Development in Women-Led Farming Cooperatives in Leshotho|journal=Information Technologies &amp; International Development|date=Spring 2013|volume=9|issue=1|pages=37–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This mass adoption of ICTs and mobile phones as well the increased quality and expanse of signal coverage within many developing countries has led to increased academic, socioeconomic, and political attention as the various impacts of the M4D movement continue to expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vincent|first=Katharine|author2=Cull, Tracy|title="Ten Seeds": How Mobiles Have Contributed to Development in Women-Led Farming Cooperatives in Lesotho|journal=Information Technologies &amp; International Development|date=Spring 2013|volume=9|issue=1|pages=37–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to the predictable developmental outcomes of mobile adoption including increased economic agency, unforeseen progress has been experienced in the forms of individual empowerment, female agency, as well as familial and community growth.

The opportunities for effective mass mobilization and aggregation of information and data offered by developmental movements utilizing cellular telephones and other mobile devices such as [[Tablet computer|tablets]] have been widely featured in the mass media and academia.  Literature on this matter is being steadily produced as developing countries continue to adopt mobile technologies at a remarkable rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key ICT indicators for developed and developing countries and the world (totals and penetration rates)|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx|accessdate=2 March 2014|author=International Telecommunication Union|format=Spreadsheet|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile accessibility and use ==

Recent developments in [[mobile communication]] and computation technologies have led to the expansion of [[mobile phone]], [[smartphone]], [[tablet computer]], and [[netbook]] ownership.  Typically marketed to the developed world as supplementary to standard [[laptops]] and [[desktop computers]], these electronic products often offer lower price points to the consumer.  This lower price point caters well to developing countries and their rapidly evolving markets for ICT expansion and adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crothers|first=Brooke|title=Netbooks get faster but less popular, at least in the U.S.|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-57349750-64/netbooks-get-faster-but-less-popular-at-least-in-the-u.s/|accessdate=2 March 2014|newspaper=CNET|date=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These mobile devices come equipped with basic mobile communications hard and software such as [[WiFi]] and [[3G]] services which allow users to connect to the Internet via mobile and wireless networks without having to secure a landline or an expensive broadband connection via [[DSL]], [[cable Internet]] or [[fiber optics]].  This leapfrogging movement towards the acceptance and implementation of mobile technologies made the Internet and modern digital telecommunications more accessible to people, particularly those in emerging markets and developing countries.

According to [[International Telecommunication Union]], mobile ICTs have emerged as the primary form of technology that will offer a bridge within the [[digital divide]].  Data collected by the ITU shows the trajectory of mobile technologies as their adoption out-paces and even replaces the adoption of desktop computers and standard laptops.

The International Telecommunication Union estimates that as of 2013, approximately 6.8 billion [[List of countries by number of mobile phones in use|mobile-cellular subscriptions]] are held worldwide, 5.2 billion of which are held in developing countries.&lt;ref name="itu.int"&gt;{{cite web|title=Key ICT Indicators for Developed and Developing Countries and the World|url=http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx|publisher=ITU|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These numbers stand in stark contrast to the penetration rate of [[List of countries by number of telephone lines in use|fixed-telephone subscriptions]] which stand at approximately 1.2 billion worldwide, a small margin over half of which belong to the developing world.&lt;ref name="itu.int"/&gt;

The following table displays key ICT indicators for developed and developing countries as well as world totals from 2010 to 2013:

The trends displayed in the table above are further supported by the successful sales reports of technology companies selling mobile technologies in emerging markets within developing countries.  Some multinational computer manufacturers like Acer and Lenovo are marketing more affordable netbooks to emerging markets such as those in China, Indonesia and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pinola|first=Melanie|title=Acer Says It Will Continue Making Netbooks|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/245163/acer_says_it_will_continue_making_netbooks.html|publisher=PC World|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crothers|first=Brooke|title=Netbooks get faster but less popular, at least in the U.S.|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-57349750-64/netbooks-get-faster-but-less-popular-at-least-in-the-u.s/|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=CNet|date=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile leapfrogging ==

Originally a concept used in reference to economic growth theories and industrialization, [[leapfrogging]] has more recently been used in the context of sustainable development for developing countries within world development theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumpeter|first=J|title=Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy|date=1942|publisher=Harper|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Technological leapfrogging refers to the acceleration of development through the skipping of low-grade, less efficient, and more costly technologies and industries in favour of the direct adoption of more effective and advanced technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinmueller|first=W. E.|title=ICTs and the possibilities for leapfrogging by developing countries|journal=International Labour Review|date=2001|volume=140|issue=2|page=194|url=http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=ICTs+and+the+possibilities+for+leapfrogging+by+developing+countries&amp;rft.jtitle=International+labour+review&amp;rft.au=Steinmueller%2C+W.+Edward&amp;rft.date=2001&amp;rft.pub=Blackwell&amp;rft.issn=0020-7780&amp;rft.eissn=1564-913X&amp;rft.volume=140&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=193&amp;rft.epage=210&amp;rft.externalDocID=336367392|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of M4D, the trajectory of the rapid mass adoption of mobile technologies can be attributed to the "mobile leapfrog effect", whereby many developing countries have been seen to bypass traditional routes of wired telephony and broadband infrastructure and development, opting instead for the immediate appropriation of wireless cellular and broadband technology.&lt;ref name=Shade&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shade|first=Leslie|title=Mobilizing for Development: Promises, Perils, and Policy Implications in M4D|date=2013|editor1-first=Susan|editor1-last=Ilcan}}&lt;/ref&gt;    This mobile leapfrogging can be attributed to the lengthy process and high cost of wired infrastructure implementation.  Additionally, as seen in mobile adoption in the Arab States, wired infrastructure that predates mobile technology is often old, outdated, and incapable of data transmission, "the basic requirement for implementing [[Digital subscriber line|Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)]] services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamade|first=Samir|title=The Impact of Mobile Technology on Low-Income Communities in Lebanon|journal=Digest of Middle East Studies|year=2012|volume=21|issue=1|pages=24–38|doi=10.1111/j.1949-3606.2012.00125.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile ICT platforms and their wide adoption in developing countries serves as an ideal example of leapfrog technology and current practices of leapfrogging within the sustainable development of developing countries.  By enabling developing countries to “leapfrog” over legacy technologies of the wired telephone and Internet service of the 20th century and embrace the mobile technologies of the 21st century, opportunities to bridge the [[Digital divide]] have been argued to become more prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Limits of Leapfrogging|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10650775|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=The Economist|date=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of ICT in Advancing Growth in Least Developed Countries: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities 2011|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ldc/turkey/docs/The_Role_of_ICT_in_Advancing_Growth_in_LDCs_Trends_Challenges_and_Opportunities.pdf|publisher=International Telecommunication Union|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile hacking ==

The term ‘mobile hack’ refers to the use-based practices of mobile technology that goes beyond the use intended by the creators of the device.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamade|first=Samir|title=The Impact of Mobile Technology on Low-Income Communities in Lebanon|journal=Digest of Middle East Studies|date=2012|volume=12|issue=1|pages=24–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Often used in order to circumvent the high cost of mobile ownership and use, mobile hacks have become common practice in many developing countries.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Mobile hacks have also proven to be widespread in the adoption of mobile technologies in developing countries.  Device sharing, the ‘Missed Call’ technique, and the transferring of mobile credits has allowed for individuals who were previously isolated from digital communication the opportunity to economically engage in the networked community.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Device sharing, most commonly the sharing of mobile telephones, refers to the practice of sharing a mobile device between a number of individuals either within a family or a community.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Missed call' technique refers to the establishment of a [[code]] that works around connection charges by utilizing a specified number of rings prior to cutting a call.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This method avoids call charge and uses discreet codes to convey messages.  This technique goes against the [[profit model]]s of [[Mobile network operator|mobile service providers]] and allows for individuals to communicate messages in a cost-effective manner.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the transfer of mobile credits, mobile device owners are able to use credits of an amount specified by their service provider as a means of monetary transaction.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By sending credits to another's mobile device, an exchange of cash can be made in situations that it is necessitated.&lt;ref name=Hamade&gt;{{cite journal|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social impacts ==

According to the ITU's report "Measuring the Information Society," mobile phones and other mobile ICT devices are seen to be replacing standard laptops and desktop computers as the main platform for Internet and ICT access and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring the Information Society|url=http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/backgrounders/general/pdf/5.pdf|publisher=International Telecommunications Union|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This increased access to and use of mobile phones offers individuals a handheld communication platform that can assist in expanding the level of citizen agency in the development of local and international social, economic, and political endeavours. It also offers individuals the opportunity to form social, economic, and political communities, regardless of geographic location, and provides an at-hand device that allows individuals to fight against human rights abuses from the ground.  Organizations such as [http://www.digital-democracy.org/ Digital Democracy] (Dd) and the [http://www.dvb.no Democratic Voice of Burma] offers users the ability to report, compile, and disseminate news and information about human rights violations in order to effectuate global attention and action.&lt;ref name="Shade, Leslie 2013 340–360"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mobilities, Knowledge, and Social Justice|year=2013|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Kingston|isbn=978-0-7735-8882-0|pages=340–360|author=Shade, Leslie|chapter=Mobilizing for Development: Promises, Perils, and Policy Implications of M4D|editor=Ilcan, Suzan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the establishment and fostering of mobile [[citizen]]s within developing countries, a "[[bottom of the pyramid]]" corporate approach has been encouraged in order to "convert poverty into a business opportunity that benefits everyone."&lt;ref name="Shade, Leslie 2013 340–360"/&gt;

== Case studies ==

* [[Nigeria]]: Statistics regarding mobile phone adoption and coverage in Nigeria estimate that new subscribers are signing up for mobile phone services at a rate of approximately 1/second with approximately 90% of sub-Saharan Africa equipped with mobile service coverage.&lt;ref name=Blumenstock&gt;{{cite web|last=Blumenstock|first=Joshua Evan|title=Essays on the Economic Impacts of Mobile Phones in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/35/26/3526521.html|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In correlation with this mass adoption and widespread geographic coverage, the ITU estimates that 77% of individuals in Nigeria over the age of 15 who own a mobile device use mobile technologies such as their personal mobile phones to access the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring the Information Society|url=http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/backgrounders/general/pdf/5.pdf|publisher=International Telecommunication Union|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In comparison to the 13% who access the Internet through traditional laptops and desktop computers, the importance and potential impact of mobile telephony, information, and communications technologies is perceptible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* [[South Africa]]: According to a 2012 [[UNAIDS]] study, approximately 18% of the population of South Africa between the ages of 15 and 49 are infected with [[HIV/AIDS]].  This high [[prevalence rate]] along with South Africa’s weak state health infrastructure and disparate system of rural clinics has promoted a difficult environment in which to monitor and ensure effective treatment of the disease.&lt;ref name=Kinkade&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinkade|first=Sheila|author2=Katrin Verclas|title=Wireless Technology for Social Change: Trends in Mobile Use by NGOs|journal=Access to Communication Publication Series|date=2008|volume=2|pages=1–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The introduction of mobile technology has allowed for home-based care, medical advice, and counseling for HIV/AIDS patients.  Programs such as [https://www.cell-life.org/ Cell-Life]’s “Aftercare” have introduced the use of mobile telephones for the documentation and reporting of a patient’s medical status and [[Defined daily dose|drug dosage adherence]].&lt;ref name=Kinkade&gt;{{cite journal|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The information that is produced is stored in a database in order to facilitate future care options and to inform on the severity and prevalence of the South African AIDS epidemic according to region.&lt;ref name=Kinkade&gt;{{cite journal|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerning the patient, “Aftercare” aims to diminish the risk of a patient contracting high levels of toxicity in their system due to inaccurate dosage of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|anti-retroviral treatment]] drugs.&lt;ref name=Kinkade&gt;{{cite journal|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== M4D in health ===

According to a report by [[InfoDev]], “[h]ealth conditions in rural areas are generally poorer, and access to information, services, and supplies is most limited.”&lt;ref name="Kinkade"/&gt;   With the rapid worldwide adoption of mobile technology, a range of health-related areas such as the improvement of [[public health]] information dissemination, the facilitation of remote consultation, diagnosis, and treatment, the sharing of a patient’s health information between health professional, and the monitoring and increased efficiency of public health systems have adopted and benefited from mobile based practices.&lt;ref name="Kinkade"/&gt;

Studies have suggested that the use of mobile capabilities such as [[text message]] reminders regarding [[Defined daily dose|dosage information]] and the increased communication between health professionals has allowed for increased effectiveness in treatment and control of disease.&lt;ref name="Vodafone Group"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vodafone Group|title=The Role of Mobile Phones in Increasing Accessibility and Efficiency in Health Care|journal=Vodafone Group Policy Paper Series|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cases of mobile technology being effectively piloted and utilized in the area of public health exhibits the promise of M4D programs and practices in the spheres of health prevention and medical care for the world’s developing nations.

The following lists a sampling of programs utilizing M4D strategies for the improvement of public health in developing countries around the world:

* [[Academy for Educational Development|Academy for Educational Development’s]] [http://www.healthnet.org/ Satellife] program – A non-profit program exploring the increased potential of a health workers’ ability to diagnose and treat illnesses due to the information that can be delivered over mobile networks of health professionals.&lt;ref name="Kinkade"/&gt;
* [http://www.cell-life.org/ Cell-Life] – Cell-Life is an [[NGO]] engaging in development programs that promote and assist in the collection of medical data on mobile devices in order to better disseminate information and promote better patient and public health management.  In conjunction with [[Columbia University]]'s [[International Center for AIDS Care and Treatment Programs – ICAP|International Center for AIDS Care and Treatment Programs]], Cell-Life is working on the development of mobile technology based [[Behaviour change method|behaviour change communications]] (BCC) that aims to address the increasing incidence of HIV as well as morbidity and mortality rates amongst the South African homosexual population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SMS Based HIV &amp; AIDS Behaviour Change Communications for MSM in South Africa - ICAP Project|url=https://www.cell-life.org/projects/sms-based-hiv-aids-behaviour-change-communications-for-msm-in-south-africa-icap-project/|publisher=Cell-Life|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Their campaigns [https://www.cell-life.org/projects/sms-based-hiv-aids-behaviour-change-communications-for-msm-in-south-africa-icap-project/ 'HealthSmart' and 'Just-Tested'] aim to promote safer sexual practices and provide information pertaining to HIV prevention and care through the use of [[SMS]].  The [[World Health Organization]] has also partnered with Cell-Life in order to evaluate the use of mobile phones in reference to medical abortion in Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;ref name=m-assist&gt;{{cite web|title=m-assist: Mobile in Medical Abortion|url=http://www.cell-life.org/projects/m-assist/|publisher=Cell-Life|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The m-assist project "aimed to assess whether the combination of information, self-assessment and support provided via mobile phones would reduce the need for follow-up visits by clients; enhance the experience of MA; reduce demands on MA providers; and increase post-abortion knowledge and uptake of contraception."&lt;ref name="m-assist"/&gt;   Through the use of SMS, women were coached through the process of [[Medical abortion|MA]], asked to self-assess their completion of MA, and were offered family planning information.&lt;ref name="m-assist"/&gt;  Cell-Life also runs programs without external partnerships.  Cell-Life's program Red aims to offer South African youth easy access to HIV/AIDS related information in order to improve levels of knowledge pertaining to prevention.&lt;ref name=Red&gt;{{cite web|title=Red|url=http://www.cell-life.org/projects/red/|publisher=Cell-Life|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Red also aims through the use of mobile platforms to create a private, affordable, and easily accessible space in which those suffering from or affected by HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Red"/&gt;

== Affiliated programs ==

The ability to mobilize data aggregation to the mobile-carrying public offers NGOs a valuable resource for their efforts for social, political, economic, and environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinkade|first=Sheila|title=Wireless Technology for Social Change|year=2008|publisher=UN Foundation-Vodafone Group Foundation Partnership|location=Washington, DC and Berkshire, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to a study published by the Vodafone Group Foundation and the UN Foundation Partnership, of a sample of over 500 NGOs, “eighty-six per cent used mobiles, with 99 per cent characterizing its utility positively, with one-quarter of those citing it as a ‘revolutionary’ technology and another one-third calling it indispensable for their work.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinkade|first=Sheila|title=Wireless Technology for Social Change|year=2008|publisher=UN Foundation-Vodafone Group Foundation Partnership|location=Washington, DC and Berkshire, UK|page=6|url=http://www.dochas.ie/Shared/Files/4/Trends_in_mobile_use_by_NGOs[2].pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The benefits perceived by M4D initiatives include their "ability to mobilize and aggregate information and data more effectively and to a wider audience" as well as their time-saving qualities in the fields of social justice, environmental conservation, global health and humanitarian assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shade|first=Leslie|title=Mobilizing for Development: Promises, Perils, and Policy Implications of M4D|year=2013|editor1-first=Suzan|editor1-last=Ilcan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following lists organizations engaging in M4D strategies and programming:

* [[GSMA|GSMA Mobile for Development]]
* [[United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force|United Nations ICT Task Force]]
* [[FrontlineSMS]]
* [[Fahamu]]
* [[SOAWR|Solidarity for African Women’s Rights]] [http://www.soawr.org/en/about/ (SOAWR)]

== Criticisms and challenges ==

The potential for the expansion and replication of M4D projects has been recognized as vital to the overall success of this development practice.&lt;ref name=Kinkade&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinkade|first=Sheila|author2=Katrin Verclas|title=Wireless Technology for Social Change: Trends in Mobile Use by NGOs|journal=Access to Communication Publication Series|date=2008|volume=2|pages=1–60|publisher=The Vodafone Group Foundation and the UN Foundation Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sharing and exchange of information and technical advancements can allow for easier and less costly adoption in other developing countries however, many of the organizations creating and implementing M4D projects act within 'innovation silos'.&lt;ref name="Kinkade"/&gt; This siloing of information threatens to create and solidify boundaries between organizations and mobile development projects.

The environmental implications of increased mobile usage can be seen in the form of the large [[Electronic waste|electronic waste dumps]] found in many of the developing countries meant to benefit from M4D programs and policies.

In addition, it has been argued that the introduction of mobile information and communication technologies could result in the proliferation of the [[Matthew effect]], whereby the "rich get richer."  In the case of mobile adoption, the inequalities of wealth considered encompass both economic and knowledge-based wealth.  Despite the benefits attributed to the adoption and use of mobile ICTs for development purposes, the information and communication resources in question have been initially created and adopted within already developed countries.&lt;ref name=Pearce&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Katy E.|author2=Ronald E. Rice|title=Digital Divides from Access to Activities: Comparing Mobile and Personal Computer Internet Users|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2013|volume=63|pages=721–744|doi=10.1111/jcom.12045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Even though eventually almost everyone might benefit from a resource such as the Internet, those with the most resources (status, cognition, education, income, access) adopt first, have and gain more skills, and use more and different activities more effectively.  They thus obtain earlier and more benefits, thereby ''increasing'', rather than ''reducing'', knowledge gaps in society.&lt;ref name=Pearce&gt;{{cite journal|page=722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also problematic is the potential for mobile hardware and software development in developing countries to become a purely for-profit endeavour.  As stated by a UN Foundation-Vodafone Group Foundation Partnership publication, "the potential for scaling up 'mobile for good' initiatives may come with identifying commercial incentives."&lt;ref name="Kinkade"/&gt;  The free and open source software applications that have been developed and implemented by various NGOs in developing countries as well as the ad-hoc communal use of mobile devices could be threatened by the prospective monetization of the mass markets available in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mobilities, Knowledge, and Social Justice|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Kingston|isbn=978-0-7735-8882-0|pages=340–360|author=Shade, Leslie|chapter=14.

'''A Near-Field Magnetic Induction communication system''' is a short range wireless physical layer that communicates by coupling a tight, low-power, non-propagating magnetic field between devices.  The concept is for a transmitter coil in one device to modulate a magnetic field which is measured by means of a receiver coil in another device.

== Background: technical concepts ==
Near-field magnetic induction  (NFMI) communication systems differ from other [[wireless communications]] in that most conventional wireless RF systems use an antenna to generate, transmit, and propagate an electromagnetic wave. In these types of systems all of the transmission energy is designed to radiate into free space. This type of transmission is referred to as [[Electromagnetic radiation#Near and far fields|"far-field."]]

According to [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's equation]] for a radiating wire, the power density of far-field transmissions attenuates or rolls off at a rate proportional to the inverse of the range to the second power (1/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or −20&amp;nbsp;dB per decade. This slow attenuation over distance allows far-field transmissions to communicate effectively over a long range. The properties that make long range communication possible are a disadvantage for short range communication systems.

The NFMI system uses a short range (less than 2 meters).

The standard modulation schemes used in typical RF communications ([[amplitude modulation]], [[phase modulation]], and [[frequency modulation]]) can be used in near-field magnetic induction system

NFMI systems are designed to contain transmission energy within the localized magnetic field. This magnetic field energy resonates around the communication system, but does not radiate into free space. This type of transmission is referred to as "near-field." The power density of near-field transmissions is extremely restrictive and attenuates or rolls off at a rate proportional to the inverse of the range to the sixth power (1/r&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) or −60&amp;nbsp;dB per decade.

In current commercial implementations of near-field communications, the most commonly used [[Carrier wave|carrier frequency]] is 13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz and has a wavelength (λ) of 22.1 meters. The crossover point between [[Near-field communication|near-field and far-field]] occurs at approximately λ/2π. At this frequency the crossover occurs at 3.52 meters, at which point the propagating energy from the NFMI system conforms to the same propagation rules as any far-field system; rolling off at −20&amp;nbsp;dB per decade. At this distance the propagated energy levels are −40&amp;nbsp;dB to −60&amp;nbsp;dB (10,000 to 1,000,000 times) lower than an equivalent intentional far-field system.

Near-field magnetic induction technology has been in use nearly exclusively by the company FreeLinc. Using NFMI to create a secure wireless communication between two-way radio accessories.  This is done by creating a magnetic communication "bubble" around headsets, speaker-microphones and radios. This magnetic bubble has a radius of approximately 1.5 meters, is immune from radio frequency (RF) interference and virtually secure from eavesdropping.  An eavesdropper would have to be standing next to the radio, within the magnetic bubble, to intercept wireless transmissions to and from a microphone or headset.

[[File:Serial Podcast.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]'' podcast being played through an [[iPhone]]]]

A '''podcast''' or generically '''netcast''', is an [[episode|episodic]] series of [[digital media|digital]] [[Digital audio|audio]] or [[Digital video|video]] [[Computer file|files]] which a user can [[download]] in order to listen to. It is often available for subscription, so that new episodes are automatically [[download]]ed via [[web syndication]] to the user's own local computer, mobile application, or [[portable media player]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/podcast |title=Definition of Podcast |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was originally suggested by [[Ben Hammersley]] as a [[portmanteau]] of "[[iPod]]" (a brand of [[portable media player|media player]]) and "[[broadcast]]".&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/podcast |title=Definition of podcast in English |website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=padding&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p038m811|title=The man who accidentally invented the word 'podcast' |last=Sawyer |first=Miranda |authorlink=Miranda Sawyer |date=November 20, 2015 |website=[[BBC Radio 4]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017|format=MP3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The files distributed are in audio format, but may sometimes include other file formats such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] or [[EPUB]]. Videos which are shared following a podcast model are sometimes called [[Podcast#Video podcasts|video podcasts]] or vodcasts.

The generator of a podcast maintains a central list of the files on a [[server (computing)|server]] as a [[web feed]] that can be accessed through the [[Internet]]. The listener or viewer uses special [[client (computing)|client]] [[application software|application]] [[software]] on a computer or media player, known as a [[List of podcatchers|podcatcher]], which accesses this web feed, checks it for updates, and downloads any new files in the series. This process can be automated to download new files automatically, which may seem to users as though new episodes are broadcast or "[[Push technology|pushed]]" to them. Files are stored locally on the user's device, ready for [[Online and offline|offline]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k1967&amp;pageid=icb.page23750 |title=Podcast Production |website=[[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710232048/http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k1967&amp;pageid=icb.page23750 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |quote=...&amp;nbsp;This code enables specially designed software to locate and track new versions or episodes of a particular podcast&amp;nbsp;... |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different mobile applications available for people to use to subscribe and to listen to podcasts. Many of these applications allow users to download podcasts or to stream them on demand as an alternative to downloading. Many podcast players (apps as well as dedicated devices) allow listeners to skip around the podcast and control the playback speed.

Some have labeled podcasting as a [[Technological convergence|converged medium]] bringing together audio, [[World Wide Web|the web]], and [[portable media player]]s, as well as a [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive technology]] that has caused some individuals in the radio business to reconsider established practices and preconceptions about audiences, consumption, production, and distribution.&lt;ref name="Willipod"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Richard |date=May 1, 2006 |title=Will the iPod Kill the Radio Star?

Podcasts are usually free of charge to listeners and can often be created for little to no cost, which sets them apart from the traditional model of "[[Gatekeeper|gate-kept]]" media and production tools. Podcast creators can monetize their podcasts by allowing companies to purchase [[advertising|ad]] time, as well as via sites such as [[Patreon]], which provides special extras and content to listeners for a fee. Podcasting is very much a [[Horizontalidad|horizontal]] media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshminds.net/2011/07/horizontal-media-how-social-media-has-changed-journalism/ |title='Horizontal media' - how social media has changed journalism |last=Stratmann |first=Jo |date=July 20, 2011 |website=[[FreshMinds]] |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; form – producers are consumers, consumers may become producers, and both can engage in conversations with each other.&lt;ref name="Willipod" /&gt;

==Name==
"Podcast" is a [[portmanteau]] word, formed by combining "[[iPod]]" and "[[Broadcasting|broadcast]]".&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; The term "podcasting" as a name for the nascent technology was first suggested by [[The Guardian]] columnist and [[BBC]] journalist [[Ben Hammersley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia |title=Why online radio is booming |last=Hammersley |first=Ben  |authorlink=Ben Hammersley |date=February 12, 2004 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who invented it in early February 2004 while "[[wikt:pad out|padding out]]" an article for The Guardian newspaper.&lt;ref name= padding/&gt; Despite the etymology, the content can be accessed using any computer or similar device that can play media files. Use of the term "podcast" predated Apple's addition of formal support for podcasting to the iPod, or its [[iTunes]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4631051.stm |title=Apple brings podcasts into iTunes |date=June 28, 2005 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for podcasting include "net cast", intended as a vendor-neutral term without the loose reference to the Apple iPod. This name is used by shows from the [[TWiT.tv]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/FAQ |title=FAQ - The Official TWiT Wiki |website=[[TWiT.tv]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources have also suggested the [[backronym]] "portable on demand" or "POD", for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/create-your-own-podcast-what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-podcaster |title=Create your own podcast: What you need to know to be a podcaster |website=[[Microsoft Windows]] |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225095312/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/create-your-own-podcast-what-you-need-to-know-to-be-a-podcaster |archivedate=2015-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of podcasting}}

Former [[MTV]] [[VJ (media personality)|video jockey]] [[Adam Curry]], in collaboration with [[Dave Winer]] – co-author of the [[RSS]] specification – is credited with coming up with the idea to automate the delivery and syncing of textual content to portable audio players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/21/entertainment/ca-podfather21 |title='Podfather' plots a radio hit of his own |last=Miller |first=Martin |date=May 21, 2006 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.voices.com/resources/articles/podcasting/history-of-podcasting |title=The Origins of Podcasting |last=Ciccarelli |first=Stephanie |date=April 4, 2015 |website=[[Voices.com]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Podcasting History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/podcasting1.htm |title=How Podcasting Works § Podcasting History |last=Watson |first=Stephanie |date=March 26, 2005 |website=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Podcasting, once an obscure method of spreading information, has become a recognized medium for distributing audio content, whether for corporate or personal use. Podcasts are similar to [[radio program]]s, but they are audio files. Listeners can play them at their convenience, using devices that have become more common than portable broadcast receivers.

The first application to make this process feasible was iPodderX, developed by August Trometer and Ray Slakinski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/technology_1/internet/1112804661/podcast/ |title=Podcast |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630060559/http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/technology_1/internet/1112804661/podcast/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |website=redOrbit |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, audio podcasts were doing what was historically accomplished via radio broadcasts, which had been the source of radio [[Talk radio|talk shows]] and [[All-news radio|news programs]] since the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Podcasting History" /&gt; This shift occurred as a result of the evolution of internet capabilities along with increased consumer access to cheaper hardware and software for audio recording and editing.

In October 2003, Matt Schichter launched his weekly chat show ''The BackStage Pass''. [[B.B. King]], [[Third Eye Blind]], [[Gavin DeGraw]], [[The Beach Boys]], and [[Jason Mraz]] were notable guests the first season. The hour long radio show was recorded live, transcoded to 16kbit/s audio for dial-up online streaming. Despite a lack of a commonly accepted identifying name for the medium at the time of its creation, ''The Backstage Pass'' which became known as ''Matt Schichter Interviews''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/matt-schichter-interviews/id1110551911?mt=2|title=Matt Schichter Interviews by Scared Goose Productions on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly believed to be the first podcast to be published online.

In August 2004, Adam Curry launched his show ''[[Daily Source Code]]''. It was a show focused on chronicling his everyday life, delivering news, and discussions about the development of podcasting, as well as promoting new and emerging podcasts. Curry published it in an attempt to gain traction in the development of what would come to be known as podcasting and as a means of testing the software outside of a lab setting. The name ''Daily Source Code'' was chosen in the hope that it would attract an audience with an interest in technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geoghegan |first1=Michael W.|last2=Klass |first2=Dan |date=November 4, 2007 |title=Podcast Solutions: The Complete Guide to Audio and Video Podcasting |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkAzn9TfL9gC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage |publisher=[[Apress]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-59059-905-1 |page=4 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Daily Source Code'' started at a grassroots level of production and was initially directed at podcast developers. As its audience became interested in the format, these developers were inspired to create and produce their own projects and, as a result, they improved the code used to create podcasts. As more people learned how easy it was to produce podcasts, a community of pioneer podcasters quickly appeared.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;

In June 2005, [[Apple Inc|Apple]] released [[iTunes]] 4.9 which added formal support for podcasts, thus negating the need to use a separate program in order to download and transfer them to a mobile device. While this made access to podcasts more convenient and widespread, it also effectively ended advancement of podcatchers by independent developers. Additionally, Apple issued [[cease and desist]] orders to many podcast application developers and service providers for using the term "iPod" or "Pod" in their products' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/09/24/with-pod-on-lockdown-apple-goes-after-podcast/ |title=With "pod" on lockdown, Apple goes after "podcast" |last=Blass |first=Evan |date=September 24, 2006 |website=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Podcasting icon.svg|thumb|The logo used by Apple to represent podcasting in its iTunes software.]]

Within a year, many podcasts from public radio networks like the [[BBC]], [[CBC Radio One]], [[NPR]], and [[Public Radio International]] placed many of their radio shows on the iTunes platform. In addition, major local radio stations like [[WNYC]] in New York City and [[WHYY-FM]] radio in Philadelphia, [[KCRW]] in Los Angeles placed their programs on their websites and later on the iTunes platform.

Concurrently, [[CNET]], ''[[This Week in Tech]]'', and later [[Bloomberg Radio]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'', and other for-profit companies provided podcast content, some using podcasting as their only distribution system.

===IP issues in trademark and patent law===
====Trademark applications====
Between February 10 and 25 March 2005, Shae Spencer Management, LLC of [[Fairport, New York]] filed a trademark application to register the term "podcast" for an "online prerecorded radio program over the internet". On September 9, 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) rejected the application, citing [[Wikipedia]]'s podcast entry as describing the history of the term. The company amended their application in March 2006, but the USPTO rejected the amended application as not sufficiently differentiated from the original. In November 2006, the application was marked as abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=78564869&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=documentSearch |title=Podcast trademark rejection documents |website=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 20, 2005, known trademarks that attempted to capitalize on podcast included: ePodcast, GodCast, GuidePod, MyPod, Pod-Casting, Podango, PodCabin, Podcast, Podcast Realty, Podcaster, PodcastPeople, Podgram PodKitchen, PodShop, and Podvertiser.&lt;ref name="Podcasting History" /&gt;

By February 2007, there had been 24 attempts to register trademarks containing the word "PODCAST" in the United States, but only "PODCAST READY" from ''Podcast Ready, Inc.'' was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?state=4810:al4odh.4.1&amp;f=toc&amp;a_search=&amp;p_s_ALL=PODCAST |title=List of US podcast trademarks |website=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apple trademark protections====
On September 26, 2004, it was reported that [[Apple Inc.]] had started to crack down on businesses using the string "POD", in product and company names. Apple sent a [[cease and desist]] letter that week to Podcast Ready, Inc., which markets an application known as "myPodder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.podcastready.com/info.php?section=8&amp;page=41 |title=Podcast Ready Receives Cease &amp; Desist from Apple Computer |last=Holliman |first=Russell |date=September 26, 2006 |website=Podcast Ready |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005015828/http://www.podcastready.com/info.php?section=8&amp;page=41 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers for Apple contended that the term "pod" has been used by the public to refer to Apple's music player so extensively that it falls under Apple's trademark cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2343732,00.asp |title=Apple's Legal Team Going After 'Pod' People |last=Heater |first=Brian |date=March 24, 2009 |website=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such activity was speculated to be part of a bigger campaign for Apple to expand the scope of its existing [[iPod]] trademark, which included trademarking "IPOD", "IPODCAST", and "POD".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2006/09/25/podcast-trademark-controversy/ |title=Podcast Trademark Controversy |last=Longo |first=Jeffrey |date=September 25, 2006 |website=[[MacRumors]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16, 2006, the Apple Trademark Department stated that "Apple does not object to third-party usage of the generic term 'podcast' to accurately refer to podcasting services" and that "Apple does not license the term". However, no statement was made as to whether or not Apple believed they held rights to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/theglobalgeekpodcast/309396084/sizes/l/ |title=Copy of the letter from Apple Trademark Department |author=Global Geek Podcast |website=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal Audio lawsuits====
[[Personal Audio LLC (patent holding company)|Personal Audio]], a company referred to as a "[[patent troll]]" by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]],&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/help-save-podcasting |title=Help Save Podcasting! |last=Nazer |first=Daniel |date=May 30, 2013 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed a patent on podcasting in 2009 for a claimed invention in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US8112504 |title=System for disseminating media content representing episodes in a serialized sequence |website=[[Google Patents]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Personal Audio started suing high-profile podcasters for royalties,&lt;ref name="EFF" /&gt; including ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'' and the ''[[HowStuffWorks]]'' podcast. US Congressman [[Peter DeFazio]]'s previously proposed "SHIELD Act" intended to curb patent trolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/podcasting-community-faces-patent-troll-threat-eff-wants-help |title=Podcasting Community Faces Patent Troll Threat; EFF Wants to Help |last=Samuels |first=Julie |date=February 5, 2013 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |quote=Personal Audio is claiming that it owns a patent that covers podcasting technology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] filed a petition with the US Trademark Office to invalidate the Personal Audio patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/cases/eff-v-personal-audio-llc |title=EFF v. Personal Audio LLC |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation announced that Adam Carolla had settled with Personal Audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/good-bad-and-ugly-adam-carollas-settlement-podcasting-troll |title=The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Adam Carolla’s Settlement with the Podcasting Troll |last=Nazer |first=Daniel |date=August 18, 2014 |website=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2015, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office invalidated five provisions of Personal Audio's podcasting patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/04/10/how-the-government-just-protected-your-favorite-podcasts/ |title=How the government just protected some of your favorite podcasts |last=Fung |first=Brian |date=April 10, 2015 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
===Enhanced podcasts===
An '''enhanced podcast''' can display images synchronized with audio. These can contain chapter markers, [[hyperlink]]s, and artwork, all of which is synced to a specific program or device. When an enhanced podcast is played within its specific program or device, all the appropriate information should be displayed at the same time and in the same window, making it easier to display materials.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Podcast novels===
A '''podcast novel''' (also known as a '''serialized audiobook''' or '''podcast audiobook''') is a [[Literature|literary]] format that combines the concepts of a podcast and an [[audiobook]]. Like a traditional [[novel]], a podcast novel is a work of long literary fiction; however, this form of the novel is recorded into episodes that are delivered online over a period of time and in the end available as a complete work for download. The episodes may be delivered automatically via [[RSS]], through a website, blog, or another syndication method. These files are either listened to directly on a user's computer or loaded onto a portable media device to be listened to later.

The types of novels that are podcasted vary from new works from new authors that have never been [[Printing|printed]],&lt;ref name="myb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ki0pE7i7FM |title=Marketing your book in the internet age |author=Creative Choices |date=August 6, 2009 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aftv"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/books/01podb.html |title=Authors Find Their Voice, and Audience, in Podcasts |last=Newman |first=Andrew Adam |date=March 1, 2007 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to well-established authors that have been around for years,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} to classic works of literature that have been in print for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4532526.stm |title=Christmas Carol gets free podcast |date=December 15, 2005 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://librivox.org/short-story-collection-001/ |title=Short Story Collection Vol. 001 |website=[[LibriVox]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same style as an audiobook, podcast novels may be elaborately narrated with separate voice actors for each character and sound effects, similar to a [[Radio drama|radio play]]. Other podcast novels have a single narrator reading the text of the story with little or no sound effects.

Podcast novels are distributed over the [[Internet]], commonly on a [[Blog|weblog]]. Podcast novels are released in episodes on a regular schedule (e.g., once a week) or irregularly as each episode is released when completed. They can either be downloaded manually from a website or blog or be delivered automatically via [[RSS]] or another method of syndication.  Ultimately, a serialized podcast novel becomes a completed [[audiobook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1872381,00.html |title=Podcasting Your Novel: Publishing's Next Wave? |last=Florin |first=Hector |date=January 31, 2009 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some podcast novelists give away a free podcast version of their book as a form of promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Take-my-book-It-s-free-3288454.php |title=Take my book. It's free |last=Cadelago |first=Chris |date=April 5, 2008 |website=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some such novelists have even secured publishing contracts to have their novels printed.&lt;ref name="myb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aftv" /&gt; Podcast novelists have commented that podcasting their novels lets them build audiences even if they cannot get a publisher to buy their books. These audiences then make it easier to secure a printing deal with a publisher at a later date. These podcast novelists also claim the exposure that releasing a free podcast gains them makes up for the fact that they are giving away their work for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/free-really-can-make-you-money-a-dialogue-with-moses-siregar-iii/ |title="Free" Really Can Make You Money – A Dialogue With Moses Siregar III |last=Gaughran |first=David |date=September 5, 2011  |website=Let’s Get Digital |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video podcasts===
[[File:The Crab Nebula NASA.ogv|thumb|A video podcast on the [[Crab Nebula]] by [[NASA]]]]

A '''video podcast''' (sometimes shortened to "'''vodcast'''") includes [[video clip]]s. [[Web television]] series are often distributed as video podcasts.

''[[Dead End Days]]'' (2003–2004) is commonly believed to be the first video podcast. That serialized [[Black comedy|dark comedy]] about zombies was broadcast from 31 October 2003 through 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-video-podcast.htm |title=What is a Video Podcast? |website=wiseGEEK |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the spread of the [[Internet]] and the use of Internet broadband connection [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], which helps to identify various applications, a faster connection to the Internet has been created and a wide amount of communication has been created. Video podcasts have become extremely popular online and are often presented as short video clips, usually excerpts of a longer recording. Video clips are being used on pre-established websites, and increasing numbers of websites are being created solely for the purpose of hosting video clips and podcasts. Video podcasts are being streamed on intranets and extranets, and private and public networks, and are taking communication through the Internet to new levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.inxpo.com/from-association-meetings-to-corporate-events-video-is-everywhere/ |title=From Association Meetings to Corporate Events, Video is Everywhere |last=Shiao |first=Dennis |date=March 17, 2011 |website=INXPO |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most video clips are now submitted and produced by individuals.{{Nonspecific|date=December 2012}} Video podcasts are also being used for web television, commonly referred to as Web TV, a rapidly growing genre of digital entertainment that uses various forms of [[new media]] to deliver to an audience both reruns of shows or series and content created or delivered originally online via broadband and mobile networks, web television shows, or web series. Examples include [[Amazon Video]], [[Hulu]], and [[Netflix]].  Other types of video podcasts used for web television may be short-form, anywhere from 2–9 minutes per episode, typically used for advertising, video blogs, amateur filming, journalism, and convergence with traditional media.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Video podcasting is also helping build businesses, especially in the sales and marketing sectors. Through video podcasts, businesses both large and small can advertise their wares and services in a modern, cost-effective way. In the past, big businesses had better access to expensive studios where sophisticated advertisements were produced, but now even the smallest businesses can create high-quality media with just a camera, editing software, and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/podcasting4.htm |title=How Podcasting Works § Video Podcasts |last=Watson |first=Stephanie |date=March 26, 2005 |website=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a two-year study, 2012-2013, conducted by a South African university a question was raised; over the years of podcast development, is podcasting socially inclusive. The results of this study concluded with minor quarks, podcasting is socially inclusive.&lt;ref name="Golden Age"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berry |first=Richard |date=November 2015 |title=A Golden Age of Podcasting?

===Oggcast===
An '''oggcast''' is a podcast recorded and distributed exclusively in the [[Vorbis]] audio codec with the [[Ogg]] [[Digital container format|container format]], and/or other similarly free codecs/formats.&lt;ref name="Djere"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://djere.com/node/183 |title=The Definition of An Oggcast |last=Djere |first=Rex |date=December 25, 2011 |website=Djere |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072050/https://djere.com/node/183 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a podcast distributed both in the non-free [[MP3]] format and the free [[Ogg]] format would not technically meet the definition of an oggcast. In contrast, a podcast distributed in both the Vorbis and [[Speex]] codecs would meet the strict definition of an oggcast. The term oggcast is a combination of the word "ogg" from the term [[Ogg Vorbis]], and the syllable "cast", from "[[Broadcasting|broadcast]]".

The term was coined for the fifth season of the ''Gnu World Order'' by [[Klaatu (podcaster)|Klaatu]] in 2010, when the show declared itself "the world's first oggcast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnuworldorder.info/audiophile/archive/season5/index5.html |title=The Bad Apples - The World's First OGGcast! |website=Gnu World Order |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the show was one of the few that released only in free formats, with no MP3 feed as an option. This gave way to other shows using the term, with hosts gathering in the {{Freenode|oggcastplanet}} [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel on the [[Freenode]] network to compare notes.

''[[The Linux Link Tech Show]]'', one of the longer running Linux podcasts still in production, has a program in the Ogg Vorbis format in its archives from January 7, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tlltsarchive.org/archives/tllts_14-01-07-04.ogg |title=The Linux Link Tech Show |last=Washko |first=Dann |last2=Fessenden |first2=Linc |date=January 7, 2004 |website=TLLTS Archive |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oggcasters tend to be broadcasters who prefer not to use audio and video codecs that have patent and/or licensing restrictions, such as the [[MP3]] codec.&lt;ref name="Djere" /&gt;

Recording and distributing podcasts in the Ogg Vorbis audio format has advantages. [[Mozilla]] [[Firefox]] and [[Google Chrome]] web browsers both support playing Vorbis files directly in the browser without requiring plugins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Mozilla-Firefox-3-1-on-It-039-s-Way-to-Setting-Web-Video-Standard-91432.shtml |title=Mozilla Firefox 3.1 on Its Way to Setting Web Video Standard |last=Constantin |first=Lucian |date=August 5, 2008 |website=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-chrome-gets-html-video-support/ |title=Google Chrome gets HTML video support |last=Shankland |first=Stephen |date=May 28, 2009 |website=[[CNET]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorbis may produce better audio quality with a smaller file size than alternative codecs such as [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or MP3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eskimo.com/~nanook/knowledge/oggvorbis.html |title=Ogg Vorbis - An Alternative to MP3 |website=Eskimo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202172710/http://www.eskimo.com/~nanook/knowledge/oggvorbis.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has not been proven conclusively. Ogg Vorbis is not bound by patents and is considered "free software" in the sense that no corporate entity owns the rights to the format. Some people feel that this is a safer container for their multimedia content for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/playogg/en/ |title=PlayOgg! |website=[[Free Software Foundation]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, oggcasters can generally not reach as wide of an audience as more traditional podcasters. This is mainly due to the lack of native Ogg Vorbis support in [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]] and Apple's [[Safari web browser]], and the lack of Ogg Vorbis support in many mobile audio devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wewantogg.com/ |title=Ogg Vorbis Support for Internet Explorer and Safari |website=We Want Ogg |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918203524/http://www.wewantogg.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oggcast Planet maintains a central list of oggcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://monsterb.github.io/ocp/ |title=Oggcast Planet |author=monsterb |website=Oggcast Planet |date=March 14, 2010 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political podcast===
{{Further|Political podcast}}

A '''political podcast''' focuses on current events, lasts usually a half hour to an hour, often with a relaxed and conversational tone, and features journalists and politicians and pollsters and writers and others with credentials in the [[public sphere]]. Most political podcasts have a host-guest interview format and are broadcast each week based on the news cycle. Political podcasts have blossomed in the past few years in the [[United States]] because of the long election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/conservative-podcasts-ricochet/ |title=You Heard Right: Conservatives Get Their Very Own Podcast Network |last=Locke |first=Charley |date=July 6, 2016 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |quote= ...&amp;nbsp;this election cycle is bringing listeners an unprecedented spate of opinionated incredulity.

===Podguide===
A '''podguide''' is an enhanced [[audio tour]] podcast.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is a single [[audio file]] where each chapter displays a picture and a number of what to look at a certain stopover. The numbers correspond to the numbers on a map that can be downloaded via the link incorporated into the artwork of the chapters in the podguide. Podguides are in the [[m4a]] format and can only be listened to through [[iTunes]] or an [[iPod]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is like a soundseeing tour but with pictures and a map, so users can take the tour themselves.

Communities use collaborative podcasts to support multiple contributors podcasting through generally simplified processes, and without having to host their own individual feeds. A community podcast can also allow members of the community (related to the podcast topic) to contribute to the podcast in many different ways. This method was first used for a series of podcasts hosted by the Regional Educational Technology Center at [[Fordham University]] in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} [[Anders Gronstedt]] explores how businesses like [[IBM]] and [[Dell EMC|EMC]] use podcasts as an employee training and communication channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gronstedt |first=Anders |date=June 2007 |title=Employees Get an Earful |url=https://hbr.org/2007/06/employees-get-an-earful |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gronstedt |first=Anders |date=May 3, 2007 |title=Basics of Podcasting |url=http://gronstedtgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Infoline_Gronstedt_Basics_of_Podcasting.pdf |publisher=[[Association for Talent Development|ASTD]] |isbn=1-56286-488-2 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The podcast industry is very profitable. Over 50 million people listen to podcasts each month. A small, yet efficient number of listeners are also podcast creators. Creating a podcast is reasonably inexpensive. It requires just a microphone, laptop or other personal computer, and a room with some sound blocking. Podcast creators tend to have a good listener base because of their relationships with the listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Smith |first=Steve |date=November 22, 2016 |title=Podcasts: Can They Hear Us Now |url=http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/Column/Follow-the-Money/Podcasts-Can-They-Hear-Us-Now-114172.htm |magazine=EContent |publisher=[[Information Today, Inc.]] |volume=39 |issue=8 |page=9 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Transhumanism}}

'''Postgenderism''' is a social, political and cultural movement which arose from the eroding of the cultural, biological, psychological and social role of gender, and an argument for why the erosion of binary gender will be liberatory.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[George Dvorsky|Dvorsky, George]]|title=Postgenderism: Beyond the Gender Binary|year=2008|url=http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2008/03/postgenderism-beyond-gender-binary.html|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Postgenderists argue that gender is an arbitrary and unnecessary limitation on human potential, and
foresee the elimination of involuntary biological and psychological gendering in the human species
as a result of social and cultural evolution and through the application of [[neurotechnology]], [[biotechnology]] and [[Assisted reproductive technology|assistive reproductive technologies]].&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[George Dvorsky|Dvorsky, George]]|title=Postgenderism: Beyond the Gender Binary|year=2008|url=http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2008/03/postgenderism-beyond-gender-binary.html|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of postgenderism argue that the presence of [[gender roles]], [[social stratification]], and [[gender differences|cogno-physical disparities and differences]] are generally to the detriment of individuals and society. Given the radical potential for advanced assistive reproductive options, postgenderists believe that sex for [[sexual reproduction|reproductive]] purposes will either become obsolete, or that all post-gendered humans will have the ability, if they so choose, to both carry a pregnancy to term ''and'' 'father' a child, which, postgenderists believe, would have the effect of eliminating the need for definite genders in such a society.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

==Cultural roots==
Postgenderism as a cultural phenomenon has roots in [[feminism]], [[masculism]], along with the [[androgyny]], [[metrosexual]]/[[technosexual]] and [[transgender]] movements. However, it has been through the application of [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosophy that postgenderists have conceived the potential for actual morphological changes to the members of the human species and how future humans in a postgender society will reproduce. In this sense, it is an offshoot of transhumanism, [[posthumanism]],&lt;ref name="Ferrando 2014"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Ferrando | first=Francesca |title = Is the Post-Human a Post-Woman? Robots, Cyborgs and the Futures of Gender| journal=European Journal of Futures Research | volume=2 |year = 2014 |url =  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40309-014-0043-8| accessdate=2016-06-22| doi=10.1007/s40309-014-0043-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[futurism]].&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

One of the earliest expressions of postgenderism was [[Shulamith Firestone]]'s ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]''. It argues, &lt;blockquote&gt;[The] end goal of feminist revolution must be, unlike that of the first feminist movement, not just the elimination of [[male privilege]] but of the sex distinction itself: genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally. (A reversion to an unobstructed pansexuality Freud's 'polymorphous perversity'—would probably supersede hetero/homo/bi-sexuality.) The reproduction of the species by one sex for the benefit of both would be replaced by (at least the option of) artificial reproduction: children would born to both sexes equally, or independently of. either, however one chooses to look at it; the dependence of the child on the mother (and vice versa) would give way to a greatly shortened dependence on a small group of others in general, and any remaining inferiority to adults in physical strength would be compensated for culturally.&lt;ref&gt;The Dialectic of Sex, publ. The Women's Press, 1979. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another important and influential work in this regard was [[socialist feminism|socialist feminist]] [[Donna Haraway]]'s essay, "[[A Cyborg Manifesto]]: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century", in Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature (New York; Routledge, 1991), pp.&amp;nbsp;149–181. In this work, Haraway is interpreted as arguing that women would only be freed from their biological restraints when their reproductive obligations were dispensed with. This may be viewed as Haraway expressing belief that women will only achieve true liberation once they become [[postbiological]] organisms, or postgendered.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;  However, Haraway has publicly stated that their use of the word "post-gender" has been grossly misinterpreted.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Dale Carrico|Carrico, Dale]]|title="Post-Gender" or Gender Poets? |year=2008|url=http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2008/04/post-gender-or-gender-poets.html|accessdate=2008-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postgenderism is also often used by [[George Dvorsky]] to describe the diverse social, political, and cultural movement that affirm the voluntary elimination of gender in the human species by applying advanced biotechnology and assisted reproductive technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|last=Aggrawal|first=Anil|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|isbn=9781420043082|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Dvorsky wrote with [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] that "dyadic gender roles and [[sexual dimorphism]] are generally to the detriment of individuals and society" and that "greater biological fluidity and psychological [[androgyny]] will allow future persons to explore both masculine and feminine aspects of [[personality]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness|last=Anderson|first=Reynaldo|last2=Jones|first2=Charles|publisher=exington Books|year=2015|isbn=9781498510509|location=Lanham, MD|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Postgenderists are not exclusively advocates of androgyny, although most believe that a "mixing" of both masculine and feminine traits is desirable—essentially the creation of androgynous individuals who exhibit the best of what males and females have to offer in terms of physical and psychological abilities and proclivities. Just what these traits are exactly is a matter of great debate and conjecture.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

Postgenderism is not concerned solely with the physical sex or its assumed traits. It is focused on the idea of eliminating or moving beyond gendered identities. In a traditional gender construct one is either a man or woman, but in postgenderism one is neither a man nor woman nor any other assumed gender role. Thus an individual in society is not reduced to a gender role but is simply an agent of humanity who is to be defined (if at all) by one's actions.

However, not all postgenderists are against the existence of gender roles in some form; some only argue for the deemphasization of gender roles. People in this form of postgender world would be able to identify as a gender if they decided to, but identifying as one would not be mandatory, and gender roles would have little bearing on how people actually act or are treated in society.

==Future technologies==

In regard to potential assistive reproductive technologies, it is believed that reproduction can continue to happen outside of conventional methods, namely [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] and [[artificial insemination]]. Advances such as [[human cloning]], [[parthenogenesis]] and [[artificial womb]]s may significantly extend the potential for human reproduction.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

Many argue that [[posthuman]] space will be more virtual than real. Individuals may consist of [[mind transfer|uploaded minds]] living as data patterns on [[supercomputer]]s or users engaged in completely [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive virtual realities]]. Postgenderists contend that these types of existences are not gender-specific thus allowing individuals to morph their [[Avatar (virtual reality)|virtual appearances]] and sexuality at will.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt;

==Sexuality==

Postgenderists maintain that a genderless society does not imply the existence of a species uninterested in [[sex]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. It is thought that sexual relations and interpersonal intimacy can and will exist in a postgendered future, but that those activities may take on different form.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"/&gt; For example, this theory raises the relationship between gender and technologies such as the latter's role in the dismantling of the conventional gender order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Designing and Conducting Gender, Sex, and Health Research|last=Oliffe|first=John|last2=Greaves|first2=Lorraine|publisher=SAGE|year=2011|isbn=9781412982436|location=Los angeles, CA|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postgenderism, however, is not directly concerned with the physical action of sex or with sexuality. It is believed to offer a more egalitarian system where individuals are classified according to factors such as age, talents, and interests instead of gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Feminism==
In the 1970 book ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'', [[radical feminist]] [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote that differences in biological reproductive roles are a source of [[gender inequality]]. Firestone singled out pregnancy and childbirth, making the argument that an [[artificial womb]] would free "women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|title=What Do Artificial Wombs Mean for Women?|url=http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2012/02/23/what-do-artificial-wombs-mean-women/|newspaper=RH Reality Check|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Christine|title=Why Not Artificial Wombs?|url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/TNA03-Rosen.pdf|newspaper=The New Atlantis|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8356">'''Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling''' ('''ROOM''') is a [[domain specific language]].

ROOM was developed in the early 1990s for modeling [[Real-time system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehmanns.de/shop/mathematik-informatik/226929-9780471599173-real-time-object-oriented-modeling Summary of the book "Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling"]&lt;/ref&gt; The initial focus was on [[telecommunication]]s, even though ROOM can be applied to any event-driven real-time system.

ROOM was supported by [[ObjecTime Developer]] (commercial) and is now implemented by the official [[List of Eclipse projects|Eclipse project]] [[eTrice]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/etrice eTrice - ROOM Open Source Tool]&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Unified Modeling Language#UML 2.x|UML2]] was defined (version 2 of [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] with real time extensions), many elements of ROOM were taken over.

== Concepts and Key Notions of ROOM ==

ROOM is a modeling language for the definition of software systems. It allows the complete [[automatic programming|code generation]] for the whole system from the model. ROOM comes with a textual as well as with a graphical notation.
Typically the generated code is accompanied with manually written code, e.g. for graphical user interfaces ([[GUI]]).
The code is compiled and linked against a runtime library which provides base classes and basic services (e.g. messaging).

ROOM describes a software system along three dimensions: structure, behavior and inheritance. The following sections will explain these three aspects in more detail.

=== Structure ===

The structural view in ROOM is composed of ''actors'' or ''capsules''. Actors can communicate with each other using ''ports''. Those ports are connected by ''bindings''. Actors do [[message passing|exchange messages]] [[asynchronous communication|asynchronously]] via ports and bindings.
To each port a unique ''protocol'' is assigned. A protocol in ROOM defines a set of outgoing and a set of incoming messages.
Ports can be connected with a binding if they belong to the same protocol and are conjugate to each other. That means that one port is sending the outgoing messages of the protocol and receiving the incoming ones. This port is called the ''regular'' port.
Its peer port, the ''conjugated'' port, receives the outgoing messages and sends the incoming ones of the protocol.
In other words, a port is the combination of a ''required'' and a ''provided interface'' in a ''role'' (since one and the same protocol can be used by several ports of an actor).

[[File:Structure of AnActorClass.jpg|thumb|Example of a structure diagram]]

An actor can contain other actors (as a [[object composition|composition]]). In ROOM these are called ''actor references'' or ''actor refs'' for short.
This allows to create structural hierarchies of arbitrary depth.

The actor's ports can be part of its interface (visible from the exterior) or part of its structure (used by itself) or both.
Ports that are part of the interface only are called ''relay ports''.
They are directly connected to a port of a sub actor (they are delegating to the sub actor).
Ports that are part of the structure only are called ''internal end ports''.
Ports that belong to both, structure and interface, are called ''external end ports''.

=== Behavior ===

Each actor in ROOM has a behavior which is defined by means of a hierarchical [[finite-state machine]], or just state machine for short.
A state machine is a [[directed graph]] consisting of nodes called ''states'' and edges called ''transitions''.
State transitions are triggered by incoming messages from an internal or external end port.
In this context the messages sometimes are also called ''events'' or ''signals''.
If a transition specifies a certain ''trigger'' then it is said to ''fire'' if the state machine is in the source state of the transition and a message of the type specified by the trigger arrives. Afterwards the state is changed to the target state of the transition.

[[File:ROOM Behavior Diagram.jpg|thumb|ROOM behavior diagramm (state machine as a state chart)]]

During the state change certain pieces of code are executed. The programmer (or modeler) can attach them to the states and transitions.
In ROOM this code is written in the so called ''detail level language'', usually the target language of the code generation.
A state can have ''entry code'' and ''exit code''. During a state change first the exit code of the source state is executed.
Then the ''action code'' of the firing transition is executed and finally the entry code of the target state.
A typical part of those codes is the sending of messages through ports of the actor.

State machines in ROOM also have a graphical notation similar to the [[UML state machine|UML state charts]]. An example is shown in the diagram in this section.

A state machine can also have a hierarchy in the sense that states can have sub state machines. Similar to the structure this can be extended to arbitrary depth.
For details of the semantics of hierarchical state machines we refer to the original book.&lt;ref&gt;Bran Selic, Garth Gullekson, Paul T. Ward: "Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling", New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-471-59917-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important concept in the context of state machines is the execution model of ''run-to-completion''. That means that an actor is processing a message completely before it accepts the next message. Since the run-to-completion semantics is guaranteed by the execution environment, the programmer/modeler doesn't have to deal with classical thread synchronization. And this despite the fact that typical ROOM systems are highly concurrent because of the asynchronous communication.
And maybe its worth to stress that the asynchronous nature of ROOM systems is not by accident but reflects the inherent asynchronicity of e.g. the machine being controlled by the software. Definitely this requires another mind set than the one that is needed for functional programming of synchronous systems.
But after a short while of getting accustomed it will be evident that asynchronously communicating state machines are perfectly suited for control software.

=== Inheritance ===

Like other [[object-oriented programming|object oriented programming languages]] ROOM uses the concept of [[class (computer programming)|classes]].
Actors are classes which can be instantiated as [[object-oriented programming|objects]] several times in the system.
Of course each instance of an actor class is in its own state and can communicate with other instances of the same (and other) classes.

Similar to other modern programming languages ROOM allows [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] of actor classes.
It is a single inheritance as an actor class can be derived from another actor class (its ''base class'').
It inherits all features of the base class like ports and actor refs, but also the state machine.
The derived actor class can add further states and transitions to the inherited one.

=== Layering ===

A last powerful concept of ROOM is ''layering''. This notion refers to the vertical layers of a software system consisting of services and their clients. ROOM introduces the notions of ''service access point (SAP)'' for the client side and ''service provision point (SPP)'' for the server side. From the point of view of an actor implementation the SAPs and SPPs work like ports. Like ports they are associated with a protocol. But other than ports they don't have to (and even cannot) be bound explicitly.
Rather, an actor is bound to a concrete service by a ''layer connection'' and this binding of a service is propagated recursively to all sub actors of this actor.
This concept is very similar to [[dependency injection]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4920">'''ShapeWriter''' (previously known as '''Shorthand-Aided Rapid Keyboarding (SHARK)''') was a keyboard text input method for tablet, handheld PCs, and mobile phones invented by [[Shumin Zhai]] and [[Per Ola Kristensson]] at [[IBM Almaden Research Center]] and the Department of Computer and Information Science at [[Linköping University]].

Using ShapeWriter text entry software, a user draws words on a [[graphical keyboard]] using a pen. Instead of tapping the keys, the user draws a [[pen gesture]] that connects all the letters in the desired word. After some usage the user learns the movement pattern for the commonly used words and can write them faster than is possible on a traditional [[virtual keyboard]].

The first system described by Shumin Zhai and Per Ola Kristensson (2003) was only a prototype system that could recognize about 100 pen gestures for the top 100 words used in the English language. It used a [[handwriting recognition]] [[algorithm]] that relied on [[dynamic programming]] to recognize the word patterns drawn from a lexicon. The next version described by Per Ola Kristensson and Shumin Zhai (2004) has a fundamentally different [[recognition engine]] that can recognize 50,000 - 60,000 words with low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]]. This system introduced the notion that every word in a large lexicon should be possible to write by tracing the letters. It is this system that was the basis for the software release on IBM alphaWorks that is generally associated with the term "ShapeWriter".

ShapeWriter was acquired by [[Nuance Communications]], and taken off the market in 2010.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.androidcentral.com/shapewriter-being-pulled-market-get-it-while-you-still-can&lt;/ref&gt; its technology presumably incorporated as part of Nuance's FlexT9 app in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuancemobilelife.com/apps/flext9/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2011/06/nuance-flext9-gives-you-four-android-input-methods-in-one-app/&lt;/ref&gt;

==iPhone==
ShapeWriter was made available for the iPhone approximately in 2008 and was revised several times (including ShapeWriter Lite and ShapeWriter Pro or Plus) before being pulled due to its sale to [[Nuance Communications]] (see following entry).

Those who purchased the iPhone version continued to use it and it also functioned on iPads v. 1 and 2 until 2013.

As of 2013 it no longer functions on iOS devices and is no longer available in Apple's App Store.

==Android==
ShapeWriter software was made available as a free application for [[Android (operating system)]] smartphones through the [[Android Market]]. As a touchscreen keyboard replacement, it had over 50,000 users on Android worldwide. It was available only for Android OS versions 1.6 or higher. ShapeWriter for Android was available in 7 European languages including English, Spanish, and German. There was also a Beta release for Android 1.5 phones including the [[HTC Hero]] and [[Droid Eris]].

ShapeWriter, Inc. was purchased by [[Nuance Communications]] and the ShapeWriter software was removed from the Android Market indefinitely on June 20, 2010.

'''Technological rationality''' or '''technical rationality''' is a philosophical idea postulated by the  [[Frankfurt School]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] in his 1941 article, "Some Implications of Modern Technology", published first in the journal Studies in Philosophy and Social Sciences, Vol. IX. It gained mainstream repute and a more holistic treatment in his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]''. 

It posits that [[Rationality|rational]] decisions to incorporate [[technology|technological]] advances into society can, once the technology is ubiquitous, change what is considered rational within that society.

The '''technology adoption lifecycle''' is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical [[normal distribution]] or "bell curve". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "[[innovators]]", followed by "[[early adopters]]". Next come the '''early majority''' and '''late majority''', and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "Laggards" or "phobics." For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service.

The [[demographic]] and [[psychological]] (or "[[psychographic]]") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by the North Central Rural Sociology Committee, Subcommittee for the Study of the Diffusion of Farm Practices, by agricultural researchers Beal and Bohlen in 1957.&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
The report summarized the categories as:&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
* [[innovators]] – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented
* [[early adopter]]s – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous
* early majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours
* late majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active
* laggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated

The model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century.

==Adaptations of the model==
The model has spawned a range of adaptations that extend the concept or apply it to specific domains of interest.

In his book ''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'', [[Geoffrey Moore]] proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. He suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (innovators/early adopters), and the vertical markets.

Disruption as it is used today are of the [[Clayton M. Christensen]] variety. These disruptions are not s-curve based. 

In [[educational technology]], Lindy McKeown has provided a similar model (a pencil metaphor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm Pencil metaphor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128192012/http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) describing the [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] uptake in education. In [[medical sociology]], Carl May has proposed [[normalization process theory]] that shows how technologies become embedded and integrated in health care and other kinds of organisation.

Wenger, White and Smith, in their book ''Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities'', talk of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process.&lt;ref&gt;

Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.&lt;ref&gt; Rayna, Thierry, Striukova, Ludmila and Landau, Samuel, Crossing the Chasm or Being Crossed Out: The Case of Digital Audio Players (March 7, 2009). International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 36-54, July-September 2009. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One way to model product adoption&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis. (2008) [http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture04.pdf Science of the Web] lectures at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; is to understand that people's behaviours are influenced by their peers and how widespread they think a particular action is. For many format-dependent technologies, people have a non-zero payoff for adopting the same technology as their closest friends or colleagues. If two users both adopt product A, they might get a payoff ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; if they adopt product B, they get ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. But if one adopts A and the other adopts B, they both get a payoff of&amp;nbsp;0.

A threshold can be set for each user to adopt a product. Say that a node v in a graph has d neighbors: then v will adopt product A if a fraction p of its neighbors is greater than or equal to some threshold. For example, if v's threshold is 2/3, and only one of its two neighbors adopts product A, then v will not adopt A. Using this model, we can deterministically model product adoption on sample networks.

==History==
The technology adoption lifecycle is a [[sociological]] model that is an extension of an earlier model called ''the diffusion process'', which was originally published in 1957 by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and [[Everett M. Rogers]] at [[Iowa State University]] and which was originally published only for its application to [[agriculture]] and [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957&gt;{{cite journal

Beal, Rogers and Bohlen together developed a model called ''the diffusion process''&lt;ref&gt;Beal, George M., Everett M. Rogers, and Joe M. Bohlen (1957) "Validity of the concept of stages in the adoption process." ''Rural Sociology'' 22(2):166–168.&lt;/ref&gt; and later, Everett Rogers generalized the use of it in his widely acclaimed book 1962 ''[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of Innovations]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovations'', Glencoe: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (now in its fifth edition{{cn|date=November 2016}}), describing how new ideas and technologies spread in different cultures. Others have since used the model to describe how innovations spread between states in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Robert L. (1985). "Diffusion Research Traditions and the Spread of Policy Innovations in a Federal System" ''Publius'' 15 (Fall): 1–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Inventions need to be cited as being particularly important or significant, as in one of THE most important inventions ever, NOT just that it is an invention, or else it will be removed ---&gt;
The '''timeline of historic inventions''' is a chronological list of particularly important or significant technological [[invention]]s and the people who created the inventions.

''Note:'' Dates for inventions are often controversial. Inventions are often invented by several inventors around the same time, or may be invented in an impractical form many years before another inventor improves the invention into a more practical form. Where there is ambiguity, the date of the first known working version of the invention is used here.
{{HistOfTech}}

==Earliest inventions==
{{further information|Outline of prehistoric technology}}
The dates listed in this section refer to the earliest evidence of an invention found and dated by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] (or in a few cases, suggested by indirect evidence). Dates are often approximate and change as more research is done, reported, and seen. Older examples of any given technology are found often. The locations listed are for the site where the earliest solid evidence has been found, but especially for the earlier inventions there is little certainty how close that may be to where the invention took place.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women in computing''' have shaped the evolution of [[information technology]]. They were among the first programmers in the early-20th century, and contributed substantially to the industry. As technology and practices altered, the role of women as programmers has changed, and the recorded history of the field has downplayed their achievements.

Since the 18th century, women have developed scientific computations, including [[Nicole-Reine Lepaute]]'s prediction of [[Halley's Comet]], and [[Maria Mitchell]]'s computation of the motion of [[Venus]]. The first [[algorithm]] intended to be executed by a computer was designed by [[Ada Lovelace]] who was a pioneer in the field. [[Grace Hopper]] was the first person to design a [[compiler]] for a [[programming language]]. Throughout the 19th and early-20th century, and up to [[World War II]], programming was predominantly done by women; significant examples include the [[Harvard Computers]], codebreaking at [[Bletchley Park]] and engineering at [[NASA]].

After the 1960s, the "soft work" that had been dominated by women evolved into modern [[software]], and the importance of women decreased. The gender disparity and the lack of women in computing from the late 20th century onward has been examined, but no firm explanations have been established. Nevertheless, many women continued to make significant and important contributions to the IT industry, and attempts were made to readdress the gender disparity in the industry. In the 21st century, women held leadership roles in multiple tech companies, such as [[Meg Whitman]], president and chief executive officer of [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]], and [[Marissa Mayer]], president and CEO of [[Yahoo!]] and key spokesperson at [[Google]].

"Tedious" computing and calculating was seen as "women's work" through the 1940s{{Sfn|Mundy|2017|p=21}} resulting in the term "kilogirl", invented by a member of the [[Applied Mathematics Panel]] in the early 1940s.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=24}} A kilogirl of energy was "equivalent to roughly a thousand hours of computing labor."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=24}} While women's contributions to the United States war effort during [[World War II]] was championed in the media, their roles and the work they did was minimized.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=455-456}} This included minimizing the complexity, skill and knowledge needed to work on computers or work as human computers.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=455-456}} During WWII, women did most of the ballistics computing, seen by male engineers as being below their level of expertise.{{Sfn|Light|1999|p=460}}  [[Black women]] computers worked as hard (or more often, twice as hard) as their white counterparts, but in segregated situations.{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=47-48}} By 1943, almost all people employed as computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}}

NACA expanded its a pool of women human computers in the 1940s.{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} NACA recognized in 1942 that "the engineers admit themselves that the girl computers do the work more rapidly and accurately than they could."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1943 two groups, segregated by race, worked on the east and west side of [[Langley Air Force Base]].{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} The black women were the [[West Area Computers]].{{Sfn|Shetterly|2016|p=39}} Unlike their white counterparts, the black women were asked by NACA to re-do college courses they had already passed and many never received promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a24429/hidden-figures-real-story-nasa-women-computers/|title=The True Story of 'Hidden Figures' and the Women Who Crunched the Numbers for NASA|last=Blitz|first=Matt|date=February 3, 2017|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=October 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adele Mildred Koss, who had worked at UNIVAC with Hopper, started work at [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC) in 1965.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} There she developed algorithms for graphics, including graphic storage and retrieval.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}}

[[Mary K. Hawes]] of [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroghs Corporation]] set up a meeting in 1959 to discuss the creation a computer language that would be shared between businesses.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} Six people, including Hopper, attended to discuss the philosophy of creating a common business language (CBL).{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} Hopper became involved in developing [[COBOL]] (Common Business Oriented Language) where she innovated new symbolic ways to write computer code.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=7}} Hopper developed programming language that was easier to read and "self-documenting."{{Sfn|Ceruzzi|1998|p=92}} After COBOL was submitted to the [[CODASYL]] Executive Committee, Betty Holberton did further editing on the language before it was submitted to the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] in 1960.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} IBM were slow to adopt COBOL, which hindered its progress but it was accepted as a standard in 1962, after Hopper had demonstrated the compiler working both on UNIVAC and RCA computers.{{sfn|Marx|2004|p=60}} The development of COBOL led to the generation of compilers and generators, most of which were created or refined by women such as Koss, Nora Moser, Deborah Davidson, Sue Knapp, Gertrude Tierney and [[Jean E. Sammet]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=73}}

Sammet, who worked at IBM starting in 1961 was responsible for developing the programming language, [[FORMAC]].{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} She  published a book, ''Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals'' (1969), which was considered the "standard work on programming languages," according to Denise Gürer {{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}} It was "one of the most used books in the field," according to ''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Times]]'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24510360/|title=Computer Authority to Speak Here|last=|first=|date=April 9, 1972|work=The Times|access-date=October 13, 2018|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1961 and 1963, [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret Hamilton]] began to study software reliability while she was working at the US SAGE air defense system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/margaret-hamilton/|title=Margaret Hamilton|last=|first=|date=|website=Computer History Museum|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, she was responsible for programming the software for the onboard flight software on the [[Apollo program|Apollo mission]] computers.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/margaret-hamilton-nasa-apollo/|title=Her Code Got Humans on the Moon—And Invented Software Itself|last=Harvey IV|first=Harry Gould|date=13 October 2015|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hamilton had completed the program, the code was sent to [[Raytheon]] where "expert seamstresses" called the "Little Old Ladies" actually hardwired the code by threading copper wire through magnetic rings.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Each system could store more than 12,000 words that were represented by the copper wires.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

In 1964, the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] announced a "White-Hot" revolution in technology, that would give greater prominence to IT work. As women still held most computing and programming positions at this time, it was hoped that it would give them more positive career prospects.{{sfn|Hicks|2017|p=14}} In 1965, [[Mary Kenneth Keller|Sister Mary Kenneth Keller]] became the first American woman to earn a doctorate in computer science.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=180}} Keller helped develop [[BASIC]] while working as a graduate student at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], where the university "broke the 'men only' rule" so she could use its computer science center.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=180-181}}

[[Christine Darden]] began working for NASA's computing pool in 1967 having graduated from the [[Hampton Institute]].{{sfn|Edwards|Harris|2016|p=50}} Women were involved in the development of [[Whirlwind I|Whirlwind]], including [[Judy Clapp]].{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}} She created the prototype for an air defense system for Whirlwind which used radar input to track planes in the air and could direct aircraft courses.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=177}}

In 1969, [[Elizabeth J. Feinler|Elizabeth "Jake" Feinler]], who was working for [[Stanford University|Stanford]], made the first Resource Handbook for [[ARPANET]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=112}} This led to the creation of the ARPANET directory, which was built by Feinler with a staff of mostly women.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=113}} Without the directory, "it was nearly impossible to navigate the ARPANET."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=116}} 

By the end of the decade, the general demographics of programmers had shifted away from being predominantly women, as they had before the 1940s.{{sfn|Hicks|2017|p=1}} Though women accounted for around 30 to 50 percent of computer programmers during the 1960s, few were promoted to leadership roles and women were paid significantly less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76-77}} ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' ran an article in the April 1967 issue about women in programming called "The Computer Girls."{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=75}} Even while magazines such as ''Cosmopolitan'' saw a bright future for women in computers and computer programming in the 1960s, the reality was that women were still being marginalized.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76}}

In the early 1970s, Pam Hardt-English led a group to create a computer network they named Resource One and which was part of a group called [[Project One (San Francisco)|Project One]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=100}} Her idea to connect Bay Area bookstores, libraries and Project One was an early prototype of the [[Internet]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=76}} To work on the project, Hardt-English obtained an expensive [[SDS 940|SDS-940]] computer as a donation from TransAmerica Leasing Corporation in April 1972.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=98}} They created an electronic library and housed it in a record store called Leopold's in Berkeley.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=101}} This became the Community Memory database and was maintained by hacker, [[Jude Milhon]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=102}} After 1975, the SDS-940 computer was repurposed by Sherry Reson, Mya Shone, Chris Macie and Mary Janowitz to create a social services database and a Social Services Referral Directory.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=104-105}} Hard copies of the directory, printed out as a subscription service, were kept at city buildings and libraries.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=106-107}} The database was maintained and in use until 2009.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=107}}

In the early 1970s, Elizabeth "Jake" Feinler, who worked on the Resource Directory for ARPANET, and her team created the first [[WHOIS]] directory.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=119}} Feinler set up a server at the [[Domain name registry|Network Information Center]] (NIC) at Stanford which would work as a directory that could retrieve relevant information about a person or entity.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=119}} She and her team worked on the creation of [[Domain name|domains]], with Feinler suggesting that domains be divided by categories based on where the computers were kept.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=120}} For example, military computers would have the domain of .mil, computers at educational institutions would have .edu.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=120-121}} Feinler worked for NIC until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/elizabeth-jake-feinler/|title=Before Google and GoDaddy, There Was Elizabeth Feinler|last=Metz|first=Cade|date=June 18, 2012|work=WIRED|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jean E. Sammet served as the first woman president of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM), holding the position between 1974 and 1976.{{Sfn|Gürer|1995|p=179}}

[[Adele Goldberg (computer scientist)|Adele Goldberg]] was one of seven programmers that developed [[Smalltalk]] in the 1970s, and wrote the majority of the language's documentation. It was one of the first [[object-oriented programming languages]] the base of the current [[graphic user interface]],&lt;ref name=goldberg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/muiseum/goldberg/goldberg_page.htm|title=Adele Goldberg|publisher=[[University of Maryland, College Park]]|accessdate=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has its roots in the 1968 [[The Mother of All Demos]] by [[Douglas Engelbart]]. Smalltalk was used by Apple to launch [[Apple Lisa]] in 1983, the first personal computer with a GUI, and a year later its [[Macintosh]]. Windows 1.0, based on the same principles, was launched a few months later in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/11/engelbart_celebration/|title=The Mother of All Demos — 150 years ahead of its time|work=The Register|date=December 11, 2008|accessdate=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/tracing-the-origins-of-the-macintosh/|title=Tracing the Origins of the Macintosh|work=CNet|first=Dan|last=Farber|date=January 21, 2014|accessdate=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, women such as Paulson and Sue Finley wrote programs for the [[Voyager program|Voyager mission]].{{Sfn|Holt|2016|p=247}} Voyager continues to carry their codes inside its own memory banks as it leaves the [[Solar System|solar system]].{{Sfn|Holt|2016|p=283-284}} In 1979, [[Ruzena Bajcsy]] founded the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception (GRASP) Lab at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fi.edu/laureates/ruzena-bajcsy|title=Ruzena Bajcsy|date=January 15, 2014|work=The Franklin Institute|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-70s, [[Joan Margaret Winters]] began working at IBM as part of a "human factors project," called SHARE.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; In 1978, Winters was the deputy manager of the project and went on to lead the project between 1983 and 1987.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; The SHARE group worked on researching how software should be designed to consider [[Human Factors in Engineering and Design|human factors]].&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

[[Erna Schneider Hoover]] developed a computerized switching system for telephone calls that would replace switchboards.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; Her software patent for the system, issued in 1971, was one of the first software patents ever issued.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

By the 1990s, computing was dominated by men. The proportion of female computer science graduates peaked in 1984 around 37 per cent, and then steadily declined.

In the 21st century, several attempts have been made to reduce the gender disparity in IT and get more women involved in computing again. A 2001 survey found that while both sexes use computers and the internet in equal measure, women were still five times less likely to choose it as a career or study the subject beyond standard secondary education.{{sfn|Frieze|Quesenberry|2015|p=15}} Journalist [[Emily Chang (journalist)|Emily Chang]] said a key problem has been [[personality test]]s in job interviews and the belief that good programmers are introverts, which tends to self-select the stereotype of an antisocial white male nerd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/17/sexual-harassment-silicon-valley-emily-chang-brotopia-interview|title=Why sexism is rife in Silicon Valley|first=Emily|last=Chang|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 17, 2018|accessdate=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
