      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2875">'''Advancing Secondary Science Education thru Tetrahymena''' ([[Asset (disambiguation)|ASSET]]) is an [[organization]] at [[Cornell University]] that is dedicated to expanding the use of the protist ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' in K-12 classrooms.  They are funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] through the SEPA (Science Education Partnership Award) Program.  Although their name includes the word "secondary," they have worked in recent years to develop materials for students in elementary, middle and high schools.  The group develops modules, which are stand-alone labs or lessons that can be inserted into the curriculum of a class at the discretion of the teacher.

==Modules==

Modules are designed to be stand-alone lessons that fit into and compliment a life [[science]] curriculum.  The ASSET program ships all the equipment that is needed to complete the modules to the [[teacher]] in a reusable plastic container, at ASSET's expense. The teacher who requested the materials can use them for up to two weeks.  At the end of the two weeks, the teacher uses a pre-paid return label to send the materials back in the same container.  Some materials, such as live cells, may be sent separately to provide for a chance for the [[culture]] to be established in the teacher's classroom.

===Science Modules===

ASSET has created fifteen science modules, each of which addresses a particular topic relevant to life science education in [[United States]] school curricula.

====Cannibalism and Interspecefic Predation====

This module utilizes two species of ''[[Tetrahymena]]'':  ''Tetrahymena thermophilia'' and ''Tetrahymena vorax''.   In the lab, an extract, called [[stomatin]], is made from the thermophilia, then placed into the vorax culture.  There, it induces a transformation from the microstome form to the macrostome form in T. vorax.  This transformation is most notable by a marked increase in the size of the cell (doubling or sometimes more), the resorption of the microstomal oral apparatus and the construction of a much larger macrostomal oral apparatus.  This transformation allows the macrostomal T. vorax cells to prey on T. thermophilia, but also to cannibalize the microstomes of their own species.&lt;ref name="vorax paper"&gt;[http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/14/2089.long] In the polymorphic ciliate Tetrahymena vorax, the non-selective phagocytosis seen in microstomes changes to a highly selective process in macrostomes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and Society Modules===

ASSET has also created five science and society modules, which are designed to integrate social studies and science education into one unit.

===Elementary School Modules===

'''''Annals of Philosophy''''' was a [[learned journal]] founded in 1813 by the Scottish chemist [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]]. It shortly became a leader in its field of commercial scientific periodicals.{{sfn|Morrell|2004}} Contributors included &lt;!--[[Friedrich Christian Accum]], --&gt;[[John George Children]],{{sfn|Bettany|1887}} [[Edward Daniel Clarke]],{{sfn|Wroth|1887}}  &lt;!--[[William Daniel Conybeare]], --&gt;[[Sir Philip Crampton, 1st Baronet|Philip Crampton]],{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, p 170}}{{sfn|Bettany|1888}} [[Alexander Crichton]],{{sfn|Boase|1888}}  [[James Cumming (chemist)|James Cumming]],{{sfn|Bettany|1888a}} &lt;!--[[Michael Faraday]], --&gt;[[John Herapath]],{{sfn|Goodwin|1891}}  [[William George Horner]],{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VI, pp 281 – 283}} &lt;!--[[Agnes Ibbetson]], --&gt;[[Thomas Dick Lauder]],{{sfn|Henderson|1892}}  [[John Miers (botanist)|John Miers]],{{sfn|Boulger|1894}} [[Matthew Paul Moyle]],{{sfn|Boase|1894}} [[Robert Porrett]],{{sfn|Hartog|1896}}  [[James Thomson (minister)|James Thomson]],{{sfn|Carlyle|1898}} and [[Charles Wheatstone]].{{sfn|Thompson|1899}}

Thomson edited it until 1821, when he was succeeded in 1821 by [[Richard Phillips (chemist)|Richard Phillips]]. The journal was bought by [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Richard Taylor]] in 1827, and closed down for the benefit of the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Harden|1898}}

The ''Annals of Philosophy'' were issued monthly following a standard pattern. Often the first article was a biographical article (10 pages) on a living or recently deceased scientist. This was then followed by a series of extended pieces (5-10 pages) on particular topics, sometimes by eminent authors. Then there were shorter news items and correspondence. Summaries followed: first of the proceedings of learned bodies (Royal Society, Linnean, French Institute -if available: the [[Napoleonic Wars]] made communications with the continent difficult at first,{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol III, pp iii – iv}} etc.), then of patents, and finally of new books. The last section was a [[meteorological]] journal. Every six months a title page, index, and preface were issued which could be bound before the six monthly issues to make a half-yearly volume.{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, p iii}}  Including front matter, volumes were just under 500 pages each.{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, pp v–viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol II, pp iv – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol III, pp v – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol IV, pp v – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol V, pp vi – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VI, pp iii – vii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VII, pp iii – vii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VIII, pp iii – vii}}

{{Science|applied}}
'''Applied science''' is the application of existing scientific knowledge to practical applications, like [[technology]] or inventions.

Within [[natural science]], disciplines that are [[basic science]], also called '''pure science''', develop basic ''[[information]]'' to 
predict and perhaps explain and understand phenomena in the natural world. Applied science is the use of scientific processes and knowledge as the means to achieve a particular practical or useful result. This includes a broad range of applied science related fields from [[engineering]], [[business]], [[medicine]] to [[early childhood education]].

Applied science can also apply [[formal science]], such as [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], as in [[epidemiology]]. [[Genetic epidemiology]] is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods.

==Applied research==
Applied research is the practical application of [[science]]. It accesses and uses accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, [[State (polity)|state-]], [[Commerce|business-]], or [[customer|client-]]driven purpose.  Applied research is contrasted with [[pure research]] (basic research) in discussion about research ideals, methodologies, programs, and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|last = Roll-Hansen|first = Nils|url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/62f0/dced123c24c7bc89b7d0d72bfcf885634a43.pdf|title = Why the distinction between basic (theoretical) and applied (practical) research is important in the politics of science|date=April 2009|accessdate = September 13, 2018|format = PDF|publisher = The London School of Economics and Political Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Applied research deals with solving practical problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=a definition of applied research |url=http://www.lbl.gov/Education/ELSI/research-main.html |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818065432/http://www.lbl.gov/Education/ELSI/research-main.html |archivedate=August 18, 2011 }}{{Link note|note = The site appears to be available, but returns a 'forbidden' response, suggesting that only certain IP ranges or recognized accounts might have access.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally employs [[empirical]] methodologies. Because applied research resides in the messy real world, strict research protocols may need to be relaxed. For example, it may be impossible to use a [[random sample]]. Thus, transparency in the [[methodology]] is crucial. Implications for interpretation of results brought about by relaxing an otherwise strict canon of methodology should also be considered.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Since applied research has a provisional close-to-the-problem and close-to-the-data orientation, it may also use a more provisional [[conceptual framework]] such as [[working hypotheses]] or pillar questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M.

==Branches of applied science==
{{Outline|Outline of applied science#Branches of applied science}}

Engineering fields include [[thermodynamics]], [[heat transfer]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[statics]], [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[mechanics of materials]], [[kinematics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[materials science]], [[earth sciences]], [[engineering physics]].

[[Medical sciences]], for instance [[medical microbiology]] and [[clinical virology]], are applied sciences that apply [[biology]] toward medical knowledge and inventions, but not necessarily medical technology, whose development is more specifically [[biomedicine]] or [[biomedical engineering]].

==In education==
In Canada, the Netherlands and other places the [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (BASc) is equivalent to the [[Bachelor of Engineering]], and is classified as a professional degree.  The BASc tends to focus more on the application of the engineering sciences.  In Australia and New Zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degree.

In [[Education in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom's educational system]], Applied Science refers to a suite of "vocational" science qualifications that run alongside "traditional" [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] or [[A-Level]] Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/An%20invisible%20revolution_Applied%20Science%20in%20the%2014_19%20curriculum.pdf|format=pdf |title=Applied Science - an invisible revolution? |first=Jim |last=Donnelly |publisher=[[Nuffield Foundation]]|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Science courses generally contain more coursework (also known as portfolio or internally assessed work) compared to their traditional counterparts. These are an evolution of the GNVQ qualifications that were offered up to 2005.
These courses regularly come under scrutiny and are due for review following the Wolf Report 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-00031-2011 |title=Review of Vocational Education - The Wolf Report|first=Alison|last=Wolf |date=March 2011 |docket=DFE-00031-2011|publisher=Department for Education and Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
however, their merits are argued elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first=Jacqueline|last=Bell|first2=Jim|last2=Donnelly|title=Positioning Applied Science In Schools: Uncertainty, Opportunity and Risk in Curriculum Reform |url=http://www.education.leeds.ac.uk/research/files/78.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003001238/http://www.education.leeds.ac.uk/research/files/78.pdf|format=pdf|archive-date=3 October 2011|agency=Centre for Studies in Science &amp; Mathematics Education |publisher=University of Leeds |date=2007 |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] offers an [[Minor (academic)|undergraduate minor]] as well as [[Master of Science]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees in "applied science." Courses and research cover varied fields including [[neuroscience]], [[optics]], [[materials science and engineering]], [[nondestructive testing]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/ |publisher=William &amp; Mary |title=Applied Science |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, the Bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of Cornell-Technion $100 million in City capital to construct the universities' proposed Applied Sciences campus on Roosevelt Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Mayor Bloomberg, Cornell President Skorton and Technion President Lavie announce historic partnership to build a new applied sciences campus on Roosevelt Island |url=http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2011b%2Fpr444-11.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 |location= |publisher=The City of New York |agency=Office of the Mayor |date=19 December 2011 |access-date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biodynamic agriculture''' is a form of alternative agriculture very similar to [[organic farming]], but it includes various [[esoteric]] concepts drawn from the ideas of [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861–1925).&lt;ref name=networks&gt;{{cite book |title=Power of Narrative in Environmental Networks |chapter=Chapter 6: Narratives of Nature and Science in Alternative Farming Networks |vauthors=Lejano RP, Ingram M, Ingram HM |publisher=MIT Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780262519571 |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PaullJ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paull|first=John|title=Attending the First Organic Agriculture Course: Rudolf Steiner's Agriculture Course at Koberwitz, 1924 |journal=European Journal of Social Sciences |year=2011 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=64–70 |url=http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ad657ada-c977-4305-92a6-27439c4a7d5d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially developed in 1924, it was the first of the organic agriculture movements.&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt; It treats [[soil fertility]], plant growth, and livestock care as [[ecology|ecologically]] interrelated tasks,&lt;ref name=OrgAg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duram2010&gt;{{cite book |pages=347–49 |last=Ikerd |first=John |chapter=Sustainability, Rural |editor=Leslie A.

Biodynamics has much in common with other organic approaches – it emphasizes the use of [[manure]]s and [[compost]]s and excludes the use of artificial chemicals on soil and plants. Methods unique to the biodynamic approach include its treatment of animals, crops, and soil as a single system, an emphasis from its beginnings on local production and distribution systems, its use of traditional and development of new local breeds and varieties. Some methods use an [[astrology|astrological]] sowing and planting calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodynamie-services.fr/_ressources/document/fichiers/26/agenda-2015-engl-2-.pdf 2015 Biodynamic Lunar and Planetary Calendar]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}; Desmond Ansel Jolly, Isabella Kenfield, ''California's New Green Revolution: Pioneers in Sustainable Agriculture'', University of California Small Farm Program 2008, p. 114; [[Carl F.

No difference in beneficial outcomes has been scientifically established between certified biodynamic agricultural techniques and similar organic and [[integrated farming]] practices. Biodynamic agriculture lacks strong scientific evidence for its efficacy and has been labeled a [[pseudoscience]] because of its overreliance upon esoteric knowledge and mystical beliefs.&lt;ref name=demarc/&gt;

==History==
=== Origin of a theory ===
[[Image:Steiner um 1905.jpg|thumb|[[Rudolf Steiner]], occultist philosopher and founder of "anthroposophic agriculture", later known as "biodynamic".]]
Biodynamics was the first modern organic agriculture.&lt;ref name=PaullJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Traditional agriculture employed organic practices in the absence of any alternative.&lt;/ref&gt; Its development began in 1924 with a series of eight lectures on agriculture given by philosopher [[Rudolf Steiner]] at [[Kobierzyce|Schloss Koberwitz]] in [[Lower Silesia|Silesia]], Germany (now [[Kobierzyce]] in Poland).&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/22491/17/22491.pdf "Koberwitz (Kobierzyce); In the footseps of Rudolf Steiner'"], Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania, 109 (Autumn), pp. 7–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/22976/27/22976.pdf "Breslau (Wrocław): In the footsteps of Rudolf Steiner"], Journal of Bio- Dynamics Tasmania, 110: 10–15.&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures, the first known presentation of [[organic agriculture]],&lt;ref name=PaullJ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paull|first=John|title=Attending the First Organic Agriculture Course: Rudolf Steiner's Agriculture Course at Koberwitz, 1924 |journal=European Journal of Social Sciences |year=2011 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=64–70 |url=http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ad657ada-c977-4305-92a6-27439c4a7d5d}}&lt;/ref&gt; were held in response to a request by farmers who noticed degraded soil conditions and a deterioration in the health and quality of crops and livestock resulting from the use of chemical fertilizers.&lt;ref name="Introduction"&gt;Diver (1999), [http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/biodynamic.html#intro "Introduction"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526054008/http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/biodynamic.html#intro |date=2011-05-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 111 attendees, less than half of whom were farmers, came from six countries, primarily Germany and Poland.&lt;ref name=PaullJ/&gt; The lectures were published in November 1924; the first English translation appeared in 1928 as ''The Agriculture Course''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paull|first=John|date=2011|title=The secrets of Koberwitz: the diffusion of Rudolf Steiner's agriculture course and the founding of biodynamic agriculture|url=http://www.jsrp.ro/content/JSRP-Nr3_PAULL|journal=Journal of Social Research &amp; Policy|volume=2|issue=1|pages=19–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner emphasized that the methods he proposed should be tested experimentally. For this purpose, Steiner established a research group, the "Agricultural Experimental Circle of Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners of the General Anthroposophical Society".&lt;ref name=AusOA&gt;Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/26110/7/26110.pdf A history of the organic agriculture movement in Australia.] In: Bruno Mascitelli, and Antonio Lobo (Eds.) Organics in the Global Food Chain. Connor Court Publishing, Ballarat, ch.3, pp. 37–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1924 and 1939, this research group attracted about 800 members from around the world, including Europe, the Americas and Australasia.&lt;ref name=AusOA/&gt; Another group, the "Association for Research in Anthroposophical Agriculture" (''Versuchsring anthroposophischer Landwirte''), directed by the German agronomist Erhard Bartsch, was formed to test the effects of biodynamic methods on the life and health of soil, plants and animals; the group published a monthly journal, ''Demeter''.&lt;ref name=Paull2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paull, John |year=2011 |title=Biodynamic Agriculture: The Journey from Koberwitz to the World, 1924–1938|url=http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:304a24bf-3961-4798-b13c-9e0a1e2aa339|journal=Journal of Organic Systems |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=27–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartsch was also instrumental in developing a sales organisation for biodynamic products, [[Demeter International|Demeter]], which still exists today. The Research Association was renamed the Imperial Association for Biodynamic Agriculture (''Reichsverband für biologisch-dynamische Wirtschaftsweise'') in 1933. It was dissolved by the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist regime]] in 1941. In 1931 the association had 250 members in Germany, 109 in Switzerland, 104 in other European countries and 24 outside Europe. The oldest biodynamic farms are the Wurzerhof in Austria and Marienhöhe in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Koepf and Bodo von Plato "Die biologisch-dynamische Wirtschaftsweise im 20.Jahrhundert", Dornach, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]]'s text, ''Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening'', was published in five languages – English, Dutch, Italian, French, and German; this became the standard work in the field for several decades.&lt;ref name=Paull2011/&gt; In July 1939, at the invitation of [[Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne]], Pfeiffer travelled to the UK and presented the [[Betteshanger]] Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne's farm in Kent.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19511/1/Paull2011BetteshangerJOS.pdf "The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming"], Journal of Organic Systems, 6(2):13–26.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference has been described as the 'missing link' between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming because, in the year after Betteshanger, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, ''Look to the Land'', in which he coined the term 'organic farming' and praised the methods of Rudolf Steiner.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger/&gt; In the 1950s, Hans Mueller was encouraged by Steiner's work to create the organic-biological farming method in Switzerland; this later developed to become the largest certifier of organic products in Europe, ''Bioland''.&lt;ref name=OrgAg/&gt;{{rp|5}}

===Geographic developments===

Today biodynamics is practiced in more than 50 countries worldwide and in a variety of circumstances, ranging from temperate arable farming, viticulture in France, cotton production in Egypt, to silkworm breeding in China.&lt;ref name=OrgAg2&gt;Florian Leiber, Nikolai Fuchs and Hartmut Spieß, "Biodynamic agriculture today", in Paul Kristiansen, Acram Taji, and John Reganold (2006), ''Organic Agriculture: A global perspective'', Collingwood, AU: CSIRO Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}}  [[Demeter International]] is the primary certification agency for farms and gardens using the methods.

* In Australia, the first biodynamic farmer was Ernesto Genoni&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2015) [http://www.slideshare.net/johnpaull/ernesto-genoni-artist-pacifist-anthroposophist "Ernesto Genoni: Artist, Pacifist, Anthroposophist"], Uriel Lecture, Christian Community, Hawthorn, pp. 1–67.&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1928 joined the Experimental Circle of Anthroposophical Farmers and Gardeners, followed soon after by his brother Emilio Genoni.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2014) [http://orgprints.org/27514/18/27514.pdf "Ernesto Genoni: Australia’s pioneer of biodynamic agriculture"], Journal of Organics, 1(1):57–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Ileen Macpherson and Ernesto Genoni founded [[Demeter]] Biological Farm at Dandenong, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], in 1934 and it was farmed using biodynamic principles for over two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2017) [https://www.academia.edu/31572839/Ileen_Macpherson_Life_and_tragedy_of_a_pioneer_of_biodynamic_farming_at_Demeter_Farm_and_a_benefactor_of_Anthroposophy_in_Australia  Ileen Macpherson: Life and tragedy of a pioneer of biodynamic farming at Demeter Farm and a benefactor of Anthroposophy in Australia], Journal of Organics, 4(1):29–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Williams presented the first public lecture in Australia on biodynamic agriculture on 26 June 1938 at the home of the architects [[Walter Burley Griffin]] and [[Marion Mahony Griffin]] at [[Castlecrag]], Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2012) [http://orgprints.org/21228/7/21228.pdf "Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, Architects of Anthroposophy"], Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania, 106: 20–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s research work has continued at the Biodynamic Research Institute (BDRI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demeter.org.au/ Biodynamic Research Institute (BDRI)]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Powelltown]], near Melbourne under the direction of [[Alex Podolinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdgrowing.com/mediaLibrary/files/PDF/BriefhistoryofBD.pdf "A Brief History of Bio-dynamics – an Australian Perspective" ''Biodynamic Growing'' No 1 Dec 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217150906/http://www.bdgrowing.com/mediaLibrary/files/PDF/BriefhistoryofBD.pdf |date=February 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Biodynamic Agriculture Australia was established, as a not for profit association.
* In 1928 the ''Anthroposophical Agricultural Foundation'' was founded in England;&lt;ref name=Paull2011/&gt; this is now called the ''Biodynamic Agriculture Association''. In 1939, Britain's first biodynamic agriculture conference, the [[Betteshanger]] Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Agriculture, was held at Lord [[Northbourne]]'s farm in [[Kent]]; [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]] was the lead presenter.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger/&gt;
* In the United States, the [[Biodynamic Farming &amp; Gardening Association]] was founded in 1938 as a New York state corporation.
* In France the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] (IFOAM) was formed in 1972 with five founding members, one of which was the Swedish Biodynamic Association.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2010) [http://www.jsrp.ro/content/JSRP-Nr2_PAULL "From France to the World: The International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM)"], ''Journal of Social Research &amp; Policy'', 1(2):93–102.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The University of [[Kassel]] had a Department of Biodynamic Agriculture from 2006 to March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiz.uni-kassel.de/bdl/ Biodynamic Agriculture Dept. of the University of Kassel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013055139/http://www.wiz.uni-kassel.de/bdl/ |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodynamic method of farming==
In common with other forms of organic agriculture, biodynamic agriculture uses management practices that are intended to "restore, maintain and enhance ecological harmony."&lt;ref name=Lotter&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lotter|first1=Donald W.|title=Organic Agriculture|journal=Journal of Sustainable Agriculture|volume=21|issue=4|year=2003|pages=59–128|issn=1044-0046|doi=10.1300/J064v21n04_06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central features include crop diversification, the avoidance of chemical soil treatments and off-farm inputs generally, decentralized production and distribution, and the consideration of celestial and terrestrial influences on biological organisms.&lt;ref name=Lotter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harwood, Richard R. (1990). "A History of Sustainable Agriculture". In Clive A. Edwards, Rattan Lal, Patrick Madden, Robert H. Miller and Gar House (Eds.). Sustainable Agricultural Systems. Ankeny, IA: Soil and Water Conservation Society. pp. 3–19. {{ISBN|0-935734-21-X}}. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Demeter Association recommends that "(a) minimum of ten percent of the total farm acreage be set aside as a biodiversity preserve. That may include but is not limited to forests, wetlands, riparian corridors, and intentionally planted insectaries. Diversity in crop rotation and perennial planting is required: no annual crop can be planted in the same field for more than two years in succession. Bare tillage year round is prohibited so land needs to maintain adequate green cover."&lt;ref name=FarmStandard&gt;Demeter, USA, [http://www.demeter-usa.org/downloads/Demeter-Farm-Standard.pdf Farm Standard]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Demeter Association also recommends that the individual design of the land "by the farmer, as determined by site conditions, is one of the basic tenets of biodynamic agriculture. This principle emphasizes that humans have a responsibility for the development of their ecological and social environment which goes beyond economic aims and the principles of descriptive ecology."&lt;ref name=OrgAg2/&gt;{{rp|141–142}} Crops, livestock, and farmer, and "the entire socioeconomic environment" form a unique interaction, which biodynamic farming tries to "actively shape ...through a variety of management practices. The prime objective is always to encourage healthy conditions for life": soil fertility, plant and animal health, and product quality.&lt;ref name=OrgAg2/&gt;{{rp|141–142}} "The farmer seeks to enhance and support the forces of nature that lead to healthy crops, and rejects farm management practices that damage the environment, soil plant, animal or human health....the farm is conceived of as an organism, a self-contained entity with its own individuality,"&lt;ref name=Alsos&gt;Alsos, G. A., Carter, S., and Ljunggren, E. (2011), ''The Handbook of Research on Entrepreneurship in Agriculture and Rural Development'' Cheltenham, GB:Edward Elgar Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148}} holistically conceived and self-sustaining.&lt;ref name=Lotter/&gt; "Disease and insect control are addressed through botanical species diversity, predator habitat, balanced crop nutrition, and attention to light penetration and airflow. Weed control emphasizes prevention, including timing of planting, mulching, and identifying and avoiding the spread of invasive weed species."&lt;ref name=FarmStandard/&gt;

Biodynamic agriculture differs from many forms of organic agriculture in its spiritual, mystical, and astrological orientation. It shares a spiritual focus, as well as its view toward improving humanity, with the "nature farming" movement in Japan.&lt;ref name=OrgAg&gt;Paul Kristiansen and Charles Mansfield, "Overview of organic agriculture", in Paul Kristiansen, Acram Taji, and John Reganold (2006), ''Organic Agriculture: A global perspective'', Collingwood, AU: CSIRO Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Important features include the use of livestock manures to sustain plant growth (recycling of nutrients), maintenance and improvement of soil quality, and the health and well being of crops and animals.&lt;ref name="Introduction"/&gt; [[Cover crop]]s, [[green manure]]s and [[crop rotation]]s are used extensively and the farms to foster the [[Bio-diversity|diversity]] of plant and animal life, and to enhance the biological cycles and the biological activity of the soil.&lt;ref name=Lotter/&gt;

Biodynamic farms often have a cultural component and encourage local community, both through developing local sales and through on-farm community building activities. Some biodynamic farms use the [[Community Supported Agriculture]] model, which has connections with [[social threefolding]].

Compared to non-organic agriculture, BD farming practices have been found to be more resilient to [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] challenges, to foster a diverse [[biosphere]], and to be more energy efficient, factors Eric Lichtfouse describes being of increasing importance in the face of [[climate change]], [[energy scarcity]] and [[population growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Lichtfouse|editor-first=Eric|title=Genetics, biofuels and local farming system|year=2011|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-94-007-1520-2|page=387|author=K. Padmavathy|author2=G. Poyyamoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodynamic preparations===
In his "agricultural course" Steiner prescribed nine different preparations to aid [[fertilization]], and described how these were to be prepared. Steiner believed that these preparations mediated terrestrial and cosmic forces into the soil.&lt;ref name=Kirchmann2008&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Fundamentals of organic agriculture |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/files/385/11695849.pdf |format=PDF |year=2008 |journal=Organic Crop Production--Ambitions and Limitations |last1=Kirchmann |first1=H. |last2=Thorvaldsson |first2=G. |last3=Bergstrom |first3=L. |last4=Gerzabek |first4=M. |last5=Andren |first5=O. |last6=Eriksson |first6=L.O. |last7=Winninge |first7=M. |accessdate=2009-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312055218/https://core.ac.uk/download/files/385/11695849.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prepared substances are numbered 500 through 508, where the first two are used for preparing fields, and seven are used for making [[compost]]. A long term trial (DOK experiment) evaluating the biodynamic farming system in comparison with organic and conventional farming systems, found that both organic farming and biodynamic farming resulted in enhanced soil properties, but had lower yields than conventional farming. Regarding compost development beyond accelerating the initial phase of composting, some positive effects have been noted:&lt;ref name="Reeve2005"/&gt;
* The field sprays contain substances that stimulate plant growth including [[cytokinins]].
* Some improvement in nutrient content of compost.

Although the preparations have direct nutrient values, their purpose in biodynamics is to support the self-regulating capacities of the soil biota in the case of 500 and 501 and the biological life resident in the composting organics, as well as the mature compost itself, in the others.&lt;ref&gt;Raupp, J. and U.J. König. (1996). "Biodynamic preparations cause opposite yield effects depending upon yield levels." Biol. Agric. &amp; Hort. 13, pp. 175–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Field preparations====
Field preparations, for stimulating [[humus]] formation:
* '''500''': (horn-manure) a humus mixture prepared by filling the horn of a cow with cow manure and burying it in the ground (40–60&amp;nbsp;cm below the surface) in the autumn. It is left to decompose during the winter and recovered for use the following spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Proctor|1997|pp=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''501''': Crushed powdered [[quartz]] prepared by stuffing it into a horn of a cow and buried into the ground in spring and taken out in autumn. It can be mixed with 500 but usually prepared on its own (mixture of 1 tablespoon of quartz powder to 250 liters of water) The mixture is sprayed under very low pressure over the crop during the wet season, in an attempt to prevent fungal diseases. It should be sprayed on an overcast day or early in the morning to prevent burning of the leaves.&lt;ref name="Proctor_47_48"&gt;{{harvp|Proctor|1997|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application rate of the biodynamic field spray preparations (i.e., '''500''' and '''501''') are 300 grams per hectare of horn manure and 5 grams per hectare of horn silica. These are made by stirring the ingredients into 20-50 liters of water per hectare for an hour, using a prescribed method.&lt;ref name="Proctor_47_48"/&gt;

====Compost preparations====
Compost preparations, used for preparing compost, employ herbs which are frequently used in medicinal remedies. Many of the same herbs are used in organic practices to make foliar fertilizers, turned into the soil as green manure, or in composting. The preparations include:
* '''502''': [[Yarrow]] blossoms (''Achillea millefolium'') are stuffed into [[urinary bladder]]s from [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''), placed in the sun during summer, buried in earth during winter and retrieved in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Proctor|1997|pp=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''503''': [[Chamomile]] blossoms (''Matricaria recutita'') are stuffed into [[small intestine]]s from [[cattle]] buried in humus-rich earth in the autumn and retrieved in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Proctor|1997|pp=70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''504''': [[Stinging nettle]] (''Urtica dioica'') plants in full bloom are stuffed together underground surrounded on all sides by [[peat]] for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Proctor|1997|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''505''': [[Oak]] bark (''Quercus robur'') is chopped in small pieces, placed inside the skull of a domesticated animal, surrounded by peat and buried in earth in a place where lots of rain water runs past.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Proctor|1997|pp=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''506''': [[Dandelion]] flowers (''Taraxacum officinale'') are stuffed into the [[mesentery]] of a cow and buried in earth during winter and retrieved in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Proctor|1997|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''507''': [[Valerian (plant)|Valerian]] flowers (''Valeriana officinalis'') are extracted into water.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Proctor|1997|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''508''': [[Horsetail]] (''Equisetum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Proctor|1997|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planting calendar===
The approach considers that there are lunar and astrological influences on soil and plant development—for example, choosing to plant, cultivate or harvest various crops based on both the phase of the moon and the zodiacal constellation the moon is passing through, and also depending on whether the crop is the root, leaf, flower, or fruit of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Desai|first=B K|title=Sustainable agriculture: a vision for the future|year=2007|publisher=B T Pujari/New India Pub.

Biodynamic agriculture has focused on the open pollination of seeds (with farmers thereby generally growing their own seed) and the development of locally adapted varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nemoto |first=K. |last2=Nishikawa |first2=Y. |title=Seed supply system for alternative agriculture: Case study of biodynamic agriculture in Germany |journal=Journal of the Faculty of Agriculture |publisher=Shinshu University, Japan |year=2007 |volume=43 |issue=1–2 |pages=73–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodynamic certification==
The [[Demeter International|Demeter]] biodynamic certification system established in 1924 was the first certification and labelling system for organic production.&lt;ref name=OrgAg/&gt;{{rp|5}} As of 2018, to receive certification as biodynamic, the farm must meet the following standards: agronomic guidelines, greenhouse management, structural components, livestock guidelines, and post-harvest handling and processing procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Magali Delmas, Vered Doctori-Blass, Kara Shuster, [http://repositories.cdlib.org/gsdprogram/TeachingCaseStudy1/ "Ceago Vinegarden: How green is your wine?: Environmental differentiation strategy through Eco-labels"]. Case Study, Donald Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, University of California, Santa Barbara, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Biodynamic'' is a trademark held by the [[Demeter International|Demeter]] association of biodynamic farmers for the purpose of maintaining production standards used both in farming and processing foodstuffs. The trademark is intended to protect both the consumer and the producers of biodynamic produce. Demeter International an organization of member countries; each country has its own Demeter organization which is required to meet international production standards (but can also exceed them). The original Demeter organization was founded in 1928; the U.S. Demeter Association was formed in the 1980s and certified its first farm in 1982. In France, [[Biodivin]] certifies [[biodynamic wine]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gregutt, "Not Woo-Woo Anymore: More and more wineries are tasting the benefits of saving the soil", ''The Seattle Times'', November 20, 2005.

== Effectiveness ==
Research into biodynamic farming has been complicated  by the difficulty of isolating the distinctively biodynamic aspects when conducting comparative trials.&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt; Consequently, there is no strong body of material that provides evidence of any specific effect.&lt;ref name=vogt&gt;{{cite book |work=Organic Farming: An International History |editor=Lockeretz W |publisher=CABI Publishing |year=2007 |pages=9–30 |isbn=9780851998336 |author=Vogt G |title=Chapter 1: The Origins of Organic Farming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since biodynamic farming is a form of organic farming, it can be generally assumed to share its characteristics, including "less stressed soils and thus diverse and highly interrelated soil communities".&lt;ref name=BARPP/&gt;

A 2009/2011 review found that biodynamically cultivated fields:&lt;ref name=BARPP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turinek|first=M.|author2=Grobelnik-Mlakar, S.|author3=Bavec, M.|author4=Bavec, F.|title=Biodynamic agriculture research progress and priorities|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5636508|journal=Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems|year=2009|volume=24|issue=2|pages=146–54|doi=10.1017/S174217050900252X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* had lower absolute yields than conventional farms, but achieved better efficiency of production relative to the amount of energy used;
* had greater earthworm populations and biomass than conventional farms.

Both factors were similar to the result in organically cultivated fields.

== Reception ==

In a 2002 newspaper editorial, Peter Treue, agricultural researcher at the [[University of Kiel]], characterized biodynamics as [[pseudoscience]] and argued that similar or equal results can be obtained using standard organic farming principles. He wrote that some biodynamic preparations more resemble [[alchemy]] or [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] akin to [[geomancy]].&lt;ref name=treue&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nitrogen.de/bub/faz.htm#plan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030417075038/http://www.nitrogen.de/bub/faz.htm |date=13 March 2002 |last=Treue |first=Peter |title=Blut und Bohnen: Der Paradigmenwechsel im Künast-Ministerium ersetzt Wissenschaft durch Okkultismus |work=Die Gegenwart |publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung |archivedate=17 April 2003 |accessdate=15 November 2011 |language=German}} (Translation: "Blood and Beans: The paradigm shift in the Ministry of [[Renate Künast]] replaces science with occultism")&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1994 analysis, Holger Kirchmann, a soil researcher with the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]], concluded that Steiner's instructions were occult and dogmatic, and cannot contribute to the development of alternative or sustainable agriculture. According to Kirchmann, many of Steiner's statements are not provable because scientifically clear hypotheses cannot be made from his descriptions. Kirchmann asserted that when methods of biodynamic agriculture were tested scientifically, the results were unconvincing.&lt;ref name=Kirchmann&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02349036 | last = Kirchmann | first = Holger | year = 1994| title = Biological dynamic farming – an occult form of alternative agriculture? | journal = J. Agric. Environ. Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 173–87 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in a 2004 overview of biodynamic agriculture, Linda Chalker-Scott, a researcher at [[Washington State University]], characterized biodynamics as pseudoscience, writing that Steiner did not use scientific methods to formulate his theory of biodynamics, and that the later addition of valid organic farming techniques has "muddled the discussion" of Steiner's original idea. Based on the scant scientific testing of biodynamics, Chalker-Scott concluded "no evidence exists" that homeopathic preparations improve the soil.&lt;ref name=Chalker&gt;{{cite journal|first=Linda |last=Chalker-Scott |url=http://www.puyallup.wsu.edu/~Linda%20Chalker-Scott/Horticultural%20Myths_files/Myths/Biodynamic%20agriculture.pdf |title=The Myth of Biodynamic Agriculture |magazine=Master Gardener Magazine |year=2004 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415163815/http://www.puyallup.wsu.edu/~Linda%20Chalker-Scott/Horticultural%20Myths_files/Myths/Biodynamic%20agriculture.pdf |archivedate=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Michael Shermer]]'s ''[[The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]]'', [[Dan Dugan (audio engineer)|Dan Dugan]] says that the way biodynamic preparations are supposed to be implemented are formulated solely on the basis of Steiner's "own insight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA32 |work=[[The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]] |editor=Shermer M |page=32 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |volume=2 |isbn=1-57607-653-9 |year=2002 |author=Dugan D |authorlink=Dan Dugan (audio engineer)  |title=Anthroposophy and Anthroposophical Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptic [[Brian Dunning (skeptic)|Brian Dunning]] writes "the best way to think of 'biodynamic agriculture' would be as a magic spell cast over an entire farm. Biodynamics sees an entire farm as a single organism, with something that they call a life force."&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4026|number=26|title=Biodynamic Agriculture |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florian Leiber, Nikolai Fuchs and Hartmut Spieß, researchers at the [[Goetheanum]], have defended the principles of biodynamics and suggested that critiques of biodynamic agriculture which deny it scientific credibility are "not in keeping with the facts...as they take no notice of large areas of biodynamic management and research." Biodynamic farmers are "charged with developing a continuous dialogue between biodynamic science and the natural sciences ''sensu stricto''," despite important differences in paradigms, world views, and value systems.&lt;ref name=OrgAg2/&gt;{{rp|147}}

Philosopher of science [[Michael Ruse]] has written that followers of biodynamic agriculture rather enjoy the scientific marginalisation that comes from its pseudoscientific basis, revelling both in its esoteric aspects and the impression that they were in the vanguard of the wider anti-science sentiment that has grown in opposition to modern methods such as genetic modification.&lt;ref name=demarc&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Pigliucci M, Boudry M |author=Ruse M|work=Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pc4OAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227|year=2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-05182-6|page=227|title=Chapter 12: Evolution – From Pseudoscience to Popular Science, from Popular Science to Professional Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiners theory was similar to those of the [[agricultural scientist]] [[Richard Krzymowski]], who was teaching in [[Breslau]] since 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmut Zander|title=Rudolf Steiner. Die Biographie.|year=2011|publisher=Piper, Munich|isbn=978-3-492-05448-5|page=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental scientist Frank M. Rauch mentioned in 1995, concerning the reprint of a book from [[Raoul Heinrich Francé]], another source probably used by Steiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebendigeerde.de|author=Frank M.

== History of the Concept ==

''Biofact'' was introduced as early as 2001 by the German philosopher [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis: ''Biologisch, natürlich, nachhaltig. Philosophische Aspekte des Naturzugangs im 21. Jahrhundert.'' Tuebingen: A. Francke Publisher; chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt; although her book ''Biofakte'' published in 2003 is commonly used as reference for the introduction of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis (Hg.), ''Biofakte. Versuch über den Menschen zwischen Artefakt und Lebewesen'', Mentis: Paderborn 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karafyllis, the word '''biofact''' first appeared in a German article (entitled 'Biofakt und Artefakt') in 1943, written by the Austrian protozoologist Bruno M. Klein.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Maria Klein: Artefakt und Biofakt, in: Mikrokosmos 1943/44&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing both microscopy and philosophy, Klein named a [[Biofact (biology)|biofact]] something that is a visible dead product emerging from a living being while this being is still alive (e.g. a shell). However, Klein's distinction operated with the difference biotic/abiotic and dead/alive, not with nature/technology and growth/man-made. For her part, Karafyllis described biofact as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic concept]] that allows the comparison between nature and [[technology]] in the domain of the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Genetics &amp; Society: Mapping the New Genomic Era|last=Atkinson|first=Paul|last2=Glasner|first2=Peter|last3=Lock|first3=Margaret|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=0203927389|location=Oxon|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly 

== Philosophy of the Concept ==

With the term ''biofact'', Karafyllis wants to emphasize that living entities can be highly artificial due to methods deriving from agriculture, gardening (e.g. breeding) or [[biotechnology]] (e.g. [[genetic engineering]], [[cloning]]).  Biofacts show signatures of [[culture]] and technique.
Primarily, the concept aims to argue against the common philosophical tradition to summarize all kinds of living beings under the category [[nature]]. The concept ''biofact'' questions if the phenomenon of growth is and was a secure candidate for differentiating between nature and technology.

For the [[philosophy of technology]] the questions arise if a) biotechnology and [[agriculture]] should not be an integral part of ''reflexion'', thereby adding new insights to the common focus on the [[machine]] and the artifact, and if b) established concepts of technique and technology which stress artificiality should not be modified. Karafyllis regards the inclusion of biofacts into a theory of techniques as a chance, to reformulate classic concepts of [[design]] and [[construction]] for defining the making of artifacts. In her view, biofacts depend on the method of provocation.&lt;ref&gt;Karafyllis, N. C.: Provokation als Methode der biotechnischen Evolution, in: Volker Gerhardt, Klaus Lucas and Günter Stock (Eds.): ''Evolution. Theorie, Formen und Konsequenzen eines Paradigmas in Natur, Technik und Kultur''. Berlin: Akademie Verlag 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[philosophy of nature]], biofacts highlight a need to clarify if nature is self-explanatory in every case. [[Biophilosophy]] is challenged to newly reflect upon the categories organism and [[living being]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Schark: ''Lebewesen versus Dinge'', De Gruyter 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[philosophy of science]], approaches are challenged which only focus on the category thing (or epistemic thing) without historizing the technicality, mediality and materiality of its emerging as a living object. For the [[sociology of science]] the biofact concept is fruitful to discuss the exclusiveness of scientific knowledge (the role of the [[expert]]) while making scientific objects which are released into the [[lifeworld]] or public sphere.  Particularly because the biofact concept deals with the [[phenomenon]] of growth and the establishing of a [[self]], it is also influential in the philosophical disciplines phenomenology, [[anthropology]] and [[ontology]]. It was [[Jürgen Habermas]] who recently stressed the anthropological consequences if mankind gives up the differentiation of "coming into being" and "making".&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas: ''Die Zukunft der menschlichen Natur'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts are artificial, i.e. man-made objects. Contrary to biofacts, they cannot be found in nature. Therefore, biofacts demarcate an ontological intersection. They are partially man-made, but growing. Like artifacts, they have been made for a certain [[utility]]. Biofacts can be seen as biotic artifacts which show their character as hybrids in multifold perspectives.

The term is also enabling philosophers to criticize some concepts in [[technoscience]], where the union of scientific knowledge about nature and the technical creation of technonature is seen as progress in the political sense.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bruno Latour: ''Politics of Natur. How to bring the Sciences into Democracy'', Harvard University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been adopted in the new [[BioArt]], not rarely without using its critical impacts.

As Karafyllis complemented the growth and reproduction of organisms with technical entities, she established a typology of different kinds of organisms according to their uses and these are:

* Natural life form
* Unaltered biofacts
* Reshaped biofacts
* Genetically reproduced biofacts
* Genetically modified biofacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Synthetic Biology: Metaphors, Worldviews, Ethics, and Law|last=Boldt|first=Joachim|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783658109875|location=Wiesbaden|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">The '''British Society for Social Responsibility in Science (BSSRS)''' was a radical science movement most active in the 1970s. It was formed in 1968 in opposition to university research on chemical and biological weapons, and supported by 83 distinguished scientists, including [[William Lawrence Bragg|William Bragg]], [[Francis Crick]], [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Nobel laureate [[Maurice Wilkins]] was the founding President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British Society for Social Responsibility in Science |url=https://www.artscatalyst.org/artist/british-society-social-responsibility-science |website=Arts Catalyst |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main aims of the BSSRS was to raise awareness of the social responsibilities of scientists, the political aspect of science and technology, and to create an informed public.
 
==Details==
Among groups that were particularly active in BSSRS were members of
* Scientists against the Bomb
* The [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND)
*[[Radical Statistics]]
*the [[Open University]]
* the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE)

BSSRS's inaugural meeting, sponsored by 64 Fellows, was held at the [[Royal Society]], and attended by more
than 300, mostly UK, scientists and engineers. Professor [[Maurice Wilkins]]
was the founding President (1969–91).&lt;ref&gt;[[New Scientist]] 9 August 1975, pp 329&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the groups first targets was the [[British Science Association]]. At a meeting of the BSA in Durham in 1970, they raised political issues under a banner of "Science is not neutral". They continued their stance against the BSA, claiming it served a "propagandist function".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beneath the white coat: the radical science movement |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/18/beneath-white-coat-radical-science-movement |website=Guardian Newspaper |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BSSRS published a newssheet (1969–72), continued by Science for People, (1972/3), and also had local societies and organized public meetings, as well as publishing longer research monographs.

The '''Cambridge Science Festival''' is a series of events typically held annually in March in [[Cambridge]], [[England]] and is the United Kingdom's largest free [[science festival]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Cambridge Science Festival 2011|publisher=BBC News|url=http://bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-12759607|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival attracts more than 30,000 visitors to over 250 events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About - www.sciencefestival.cam.ac.uk|url=http://www.sciencefestival.cam.ac.uk/about|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; University researches and students open their lecture halls and laboratories to the general public, and hold Talks, Exhibitions and Demonstrations, mostly free of charge.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

Started in 1994 by scientists of the [[University of Cambridge]] and backed by local businesses, the festival was inspired by ''National Science Week'' and is aimed making science and engineering more accessible, showcasing research performed at Cambridge University, and encouraging young people to pursue careers in engineering and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two exciting decades of scientific fun and games|publisher=Cambridge News|url=http://cambridge-news.co.uk/exciting-decades-scientific-fun-games/story-22498061-detail/story.html|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21st Cambridge Science Festival hopes to inspire the next generation of scientists|publisher=Anglia - ITV News|url=http://itv.com/news/anglia/update/2015-03-10/21st-cambridge-science-festival-hopes-to-inspire-the-next-generation-of-scientists|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st festival ran from 9 to 22 March 2015 and featured themes based on light science and technology to mark [[UNESCO]]'s ''[[International Year of Light]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaching out in the International Year of Light|url=http://optics.org/news/6/3/1|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Candida hypersensitivity''' is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] disease promoted by William G. Crook, M.D.&lt;ref name="Crook"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yeast Connection: A Medical Breakthrough|year=1986|first=William G.|last=Crook|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0933478062}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is spuriously claimed that chronic yeast infections are responsible for many common disorders and [[Symptom#Non-specific symptoms|non-specific symptoms]] including [[fatigue]], [[weight gain]], [[constipation]], [[dizziness]], muscle and joint [[pain]], [[asthma]], and others.&lt;ref name="SBM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candida and Fake Illnesses|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/|website=Science-Based Medicine|date=25 September 2013|access-date=4 July 2018|first=Steven|last=Novella}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida albicans]]'' is a [[fungus]] that colonizes a large majority of the population (meaning it is present in the body but not causing an infection or any problems). Under certain conditions, however, it can cause an [[Candidiasis|infection]]. The most common manifestations are thrush (a superficial ''Candida'' infection in the mouth) and [[vaginitis]], also commonly referred to as a yeast infection. ''Candida'' can also cause serious [[systemic infection]], but this is almost always restricted to those with [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]], such as patients undergoing [[chemotherapy]] or with advanced [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="SBM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candida and Fake Illnesses|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/|website=Science-Based Medicine|date=25 September 2013|access-date=4 July 2018|first=Steven|last=Novella}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
After reading publications by C. Orian Truss, M.D.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Truss|first=CO|title=The Missing Diagnosis|location=Birmingham, AL|publisher=The Missing Diagnosis, Inc.|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Crook proposed the idea that a condition he termed systemic candidiasis, or '''Candida hypersensitivity''', was responsible for a long list of common conditions and [[Symptom#Non-specific symptoms|non-specific symptoms]] including [[fatigue]], [[asthma]], [[psoriasis]], [[sexual dysfunction]], and many others.&lt;ref name="SBM"/&gt; The list of symptoms is similar to that of [[multiple chemical sensitivity]].&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"/&gt; Many patients presenting with symptoms of environmental sensitivity claim to suffer from multiple "fashionable" syndromes.&lt;ref name="Stewart1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Donna E.|title=The Changing Faces of Somatization|journal=Psychosomatics|volume=31|issue=2|year=1990|pages=153–158|issn=00333182|doi=10.1016/S0033-3182(90)72188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]] strongly criticized the concept of "candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome" and the diagnostic and treatment approaches its proponents use. AAAAI's position statement concludes: (1) the concept of candidiasis hypersensitivity is speculative and unproven; (2) its basic elements would apply to almost all sick patients at some time because its supposed symptoms are essentially universal; (3) overuse of oral antifungal agents could lead to the development of resistant germs that could menace others; (4) adverse effects of oral antifungal agents are rare, but some inevitably will occur; and (5) neither patients nor doctors can determine effectiveness (as opposed to coincidence) without controlled trials. Because allergic symptoms can be influenced by many factors, including emotions, experiments must be designed to separate the effects of the procedure being tested from the effects of other factors.&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndersonChai1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=J|last2=Chai|first2=H|last3=Claman|first3=H|last4=Ellis|first4=E|last5=Fink|first5=J|last6=Kaplan|first6=A|last7=Lieberman|first7=P|last8=Pierson|first8=W|last9=Salvaggio|first9=J|last10=Sheffer|first10=A|title=Candidiasis hypersensitivity syndromeApproved by the executive committee of the American academy of allergy and immunology|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=78|issue=2|year=1986|pages=271–273|issn=00916749|doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(86)80073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005, scientists were taking note of "a large [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] cult"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odds|first1=FC|title=Candida infections: an overview.|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|date=1987|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–5|pmid=3319417|doi=10.3109/10408418709104444}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had developed around the topic of [[Candidiasis|yeast infections]], with claims that up to one in three people were affected by yeast-related illnesses including Candida hypersensitivity.&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephen Barrett, M.D.|title=Dubious "Yeast Allergies"|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html|date=October 8, 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513203124/http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html|archivedate=May 13, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal action==
Some practitioners of alternative medicine have promoted dietary supplements as supposed cures for this non-existent illness, rendering themselves liable to prosecution.&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCAHF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncahf.org/articles/c-d/candida.html |title=Candidiasis Hypersensitivity |accessdate=18 January 2014 |publisher=[[National Council Against Health Fraud]] |author=Jarvis WT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, alternative health vendor [[Nature's Way]] signed a [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] consent agreement not to misrepresent in advertising any self-diagnostic test concerning yeast conditions or to make any unsubstantiated representation concerning any food or supplement's ability to control yeast conditions, with a fine of US$30,000 payable to the [[National Institutes of Health]] for research in genuine candidiasis.&lt;ref name="NCAHF" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2894">'''Carctol''' is an ineffective cancer treatment made by mixing eight Indian herbs.&lt;ref name="cruk"&gt;{{cite web | title=About Cancer | website=Cancer Research UK | date=30 August 2017 | url=https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer | access-date=8 August 2018|quote=there isn't any scientific evidence to prove that it is safe or works as a treatment for any type of illness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carctol has been aggressively marketed as being able to treat cancer and reduce the side-effects of [[chemotherapy]]. However, there is no [[medical evidence]] that it has any benefits whatsoever for people with cancer.&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt;

==Background and promotion==

Carctol is a herbal dietary supplement marketed with claims it is based on traditional [[ayurvedic medicine]].&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt; Its ingredients include ''[[Hemidesmus indicus]]'', ''[[Tribulus terrestris]]'', ''[[Piper cubeba]]'', ''[[Ammani vesicatoria]]'', ''[[Lepidium sativum]]'', ''[[Blepharis edulis]]'', ''[[Smilax china]]'', and ''[[Rheum emodi]]''.&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt;

It was first promoted in 1968 by Nandlal Tiwari.&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt; In 2009, [[Edzard Ernst]] wrote that it was still promoted in the [[United Kingdom]]; public relations companies hired by its sellers had garnered it wide coverage on the web and,&lt;ref name=ernst/&gt; according to the [[British Medical Journal]], in the media generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7469.804|title=PR coup for herbal cancer drug|year=2004|last1=Marks|first1=N.|journal=BMJ|volume=329|issue=7469|pages=804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness and response==

[[Cancer Research UK]] say of Carctol, "available scientific evidence does not support its use for the treatment of cancer in humans".&lt;ref name=cruk/&gt; Edzard Ernst has written "the claim that Carctol is of any benefit to cancer patients is not supported by scientific evidence".&lt;ref name=ernst&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1159/000193025|title=Carctol: Profit before Patients? | year=2009 | last1=Ernst | first1=Edzard | authorlink=Edzard Ernst | journal=Breast Care | volume=4 | pages=31–33 | pmid=20877681 | issue=1 | pmc=2942009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harriet A. Hall]] includes Carctol among the biologically-based remedies promoted by [[naturopath]]s. Hall laments that frauds and [[quackery|quacks]] persistently try to take advantage of the vulnerability of cancer patients.&lt;ref name=hall&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1179/1743291X12Y.0000000009|title=CAM for cancer: Preying on desperate people?|year=2012|last1=Hall|first1=Harriet A.| authorlink = Harriet A.

Near the end of summer, when brood rearing ceases and this sugar source is no longer available, yellow jackets become frantic for sugar, and can be baited with sugar-based baits. They are also much more likely to visit fall flowers for nectar, than they are earlier in the season.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:To deposit or not to deposit, that is the question - journal.pbio.1001779.g001.png|thumb|The decision whether and how to share data often rests with researchers.]]
'''Data sharing''' is the practice of making data used for scholarly research available to other investigators. Replication has a long history in science.  The motto of The Royal Society is 'Nullius in verba', translated "Take no man's word for it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/ History of the Royal Society] webpage accessed June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Many funding agencies, institutions, and publication venues have policies regarding data sharing because transparency and openness are considered by many to be part of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/professor-stefan-elbe/a-global-health-epidemic-_b_14129608.html|title=A Global Health Epidemic Is A Ticking Time Bomb - But Virus Databases Can And Are Helping To Save Lives|website=HuffPost UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of funding agencies and science journals require authors of [[Peer review|peer-review]]ed papers to share any supplemental information (raw data, statistical methods or source code) necessary to understand, develop or [[Reproducibility|reproduce]] published research. A great deal of scientific research is not subject to data sharing requirements, and many of these policies have liberal exceptions. In the absence of any binding requirement, data sharing is at the discretion of the scientists themselves. In addition, in certain situations governments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/7270183|title=A shot of transparency|date=2006-08-10|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-09-06|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; and institutions prohibit or severely limit data sharing to protect proprietary interests, national security, and subject/patient/victim confidentiality. Data sharing may also be restricted to protect institutions and scientists from use of data for political purposes.

Data and methods may be requested from an author years after publication. In order to encourage data sharing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How to encourage the right behaviour|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/416001b|journal=Nature|volume=416|issue=6876|pages=1–1|doi=10.1038/416001b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prevent the loss or corruption of data, a number of funding agencies and journals established policies on [[Scientific data archiving|data archiving]]. Access to publicly archived data is a recent development in the [[history of science]] made possible by technological advances in communications and [[information technology]]. To take full advantage of modern rapid communication may require consensual agreement on the criteria underlying mutual recognition of respective contributions. Models recognized for improving the timely sharing of data for more effective response to emergent infectious disease threats include the data sharing mechanism introduced by the GISAID Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCauley|first=John W.|date=2017-02-23|title=Viruses: Model to accelerate epidemic responses|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/542414b|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=542|issue=7642|pages=414–414|doi=10.1038/542414b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ip-watch.org/2017/05/20/no-free-lunch-g20-health-ministers-find-first-meeting/|title=No Free Lunch, G20 Health Ministers Find At First Meeting|date=2017-05-20|website=Intellectual Property Watch|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite policies on data sharing and archiving, data withholding still happens. Authors may fail to archive data or they only archive a portion of the data. Failure to archive data alone is not data withholding. When a researcher requests additional information, an author sometimes refuses to provide it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Savage CJ, Vickers AJ | year = 2009 | title = Empirical Study of Data Sharing by Authors Publishing in PLoS Journals | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 9| page = e7078 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0007078 | pmid=19763261 | pmc=2739314}}&lt;/ref&gt; When authors withhold data like this, they run the risk of losing the trust of the science community.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/books/obas/contents/publication.html Publication and Openness]," chapter from "On Being A Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research", National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data sharing may also indicate the sharing of personal information on a social media platform.

==U.S. government policies==

===Federal law===
On August 9, 2007, President Bush signed the [[America COMPETES Act]] (or the "America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act") requiring civilian federal agencies to provide guidelines, policy and procedures, to facilitate and optimize the open exchange of data and research between agencies, the public and policymakers. See Section 1009.&lt;ref name = "H.R. 2272"&gt;"[http://commdocs.house.gov/reports/110/h2272.pdf America COMPETES Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIH data sharing policy===
{{Quote |‘The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants Policy Statement defines "data" as "recorded information, regardless of the form or medium on which it may be recorded, and includes writings, films, sound recordings, pictorial reproductions, drawings, designs, or other graphic representations, procedural manuals, forms, diagrams, work flow charts, equipment descriptions, data files, data processing or computer programs (software), statistical records, and other research data."’ | Council on Governmental Relations&lt;ref&gt;"[http://206.151.87.67/docs/CompleteDRBooklet.htm Access to and retention of research data]: Rights and responsibilities", p. 5. Council on Governmental Relations, March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The NIH Final Statement of Sharing of Research Data says:
{{Quote |‘NIH reaffirms its support for the concept of data sharing. We believe that data sharing is essential for expedited translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. The NIH endorses the sharing of final research data to serve these and other important scientific goals. The NIH expects and supports the timely release and sharing of final research data from NIH-supported studies for use by other researchers.

‘NIH recognizes that the investigators who collect the data have a legitimate interest in benefiting from their investment of time and effort. We have therefore revised our definition of "the timely release and sharing" to be no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final data set. NIH continues to expect that the initial investigators may benefit from first and continuing use but not from prolonged exclusive use.’ | ‘[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html Final NIH statement on sharing research data].’&lt;ref name = "Grants"&gt;"[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/index.htm NIH Data Sharing Policy]."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===NSF Policy from Grant General Conditions===
{{Quote |'''36. Sharing of Findings, Data, and Other Research Products'''
''a. NSF …expects investigators to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of the work. It also encourages awardees to share software and inventions or otherwise act to make the innovations they embody widely useful and usable.''

''b. Adjustments and, where essential, exceptions may be allowed to safeguard the rights of individuals and subjects, the validity of results, or the integrity of collections or to accommodate legitimate interests of investigators.'' | "[https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2001/gc101/gc101rev1.pdf National Science Foundation]: Grant General Conditions (GC-1)", April 1, 2001 (p. 17).}}

==Office of Research Integrity==
Allegations of misconduct in medical research carry severe consequences. The United States Department of Health and Human Services established an office to oversee investigations of allegations of misconduct, including data withholding. The website defines the mission:

{{Quote |"The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) promotes integrity in biomedical and behavioral research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) at about 4,000 institutions worldwide. ORI monitors institutional investigations of research misconduct and facilitates the responsible conduct of research (RCR) through educational, preventive, and regulatory activities." | [http://ori.dhhs.gov/ Office of Research Integrity].}}

==Ideals in data sharing==
Some research organizations feel particularly strongly about data sharing. Stanford University's [[WaveLab (mathematics software)|WaveLab]] has a philosophy about reproducible research and disclosing all algorithms and source code necessary to reproduce the research. In a paper titled "WaveLab and Reproducible Research," the authors describe some of the problems they encountered in trying to reproduce their own research after a period of time. In many cases, it was so difficult they gave up the effort. These experiences are what convinced them of the importance of disclosing source code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf WaveLab and Reproducible Research] by Jonathan B. Buckheit and [[David Donoho|David L. Donoho]]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy is described:
:''The idea is: An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/ WaveLab850 website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rimmer|first=Matthew|date=2005-09-01|title=Japonica Rice: Intellectual Property, Scientific Publishing and Data‐sharing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08109020500235180|journal=Prometheus|volume=23|issue=3|pages=325–347|doi=10.1080/08109020500235180|issn=0810-9028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Data Observation Network for Earth''' ([[DataONE]]) and Data Conservancy&lt;ref&gt;[https://dataconservancy.org]&lt;/ref&gt; are projects supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] to encourage and facilitate data sharing among research scientists and better support [[meta-analysis]]. In environmental sciences, the research community is recognizing that major scientific advances involving integration of knowledge in and across fields will require that researchers overcome not only the technological barriers to data sharing but also the historically entrenched institutional and sociological barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reichman O.J. |author2=Jones M.B. |author3=Schildhauer M.P. | year = 2011 | title = Challenges and Opportunities of Open Data in Ecology | url = | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6018| pages = 703–705 | doi = 10.1126/science.1197962 | pmid=21311007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Richard J. Hodes, director of the [[National Institute on Aging]] has stated, "the old model in which researchers jealously guarded their data is no longer applicable".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/health/04alzheimer.html NY Times article about value of shared data to Alzheimers research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance for Taxpayer Access is a group of organizations that support open access to government sponsored research. The group has expressed a "Statement of Principles" explaining why they believe open access is important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/ The Alliance for Taxpayer Access website]&lt;/ref&gt; They also list a number of international public access policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/international.html Worldwide momentum for public access to publicly funded research ]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is no more so than in timely communication of essential information to effectively respond to health emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shu|first=Yuelong|last2=McCauley|first2=John|title=GISAID: Global initiative on sharing all influenza data – from vision to reality|url=http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22750|journal=Eurosurveillance|volume=22|issue=13|doi=10.2807/1560-7917.es.2017.22.13.30494}}&lt;/ref&gt; While public domain archives have been embraced for depositing data, mainly post formal publication, they have failed to encourage rapid data sharing during health emergencies, among them the Ebola&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yozwiak|first=Nathan L.|last2=Schaffner|first2=Stephen F.|last3=Sabeti|first3=Pardis C.|date=2015-02-26|title=Data sharing: Make outbreak research open access|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/518477a|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=518|issue=7540|pages=477–479|doi=10.1038/518477a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zika,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/zika-virus-outbreak-when-research-goes-off-the-rails/article8203618.ece|title=When research goes off the rails|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-02-11|title=Benefits of sharing|url=http://www.nature.com/news/benefits-of-sharing-1.19322|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=530|issue=7589|pages=129–129|doi=10.1038/530129a}}&lt;/ref&gt; outbreaks.

==Data sharing problems==

===Academic genetics===
Withholding of data has become so commonplace in academic genetics that researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital published a journal article on the subject. The study found that "Because they were denied access to data, 28% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.287.4.473 |vauthors=Campbell EG, Clarridge BR, Gokhale M |title=Data withholding in academic genetics: evidence from a national survey |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=4 |pages=473–80 |year=2002 |pmid=11798369 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11798369|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic psychology===
In a 2006 study, it was observed that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a 6-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wicherts | first1 = J.

===Academic archaeology===
A 2018 study reported on study of a random sample of 48 articles published during February–May 2017 in the ''[[Journal of Archaeological Science]]'' which found openly available raw data for 18 papers (53%), with compositional and dating data being the most frequently shared types. The same study also emailed authors of articles on experiments with stone artifacts that were published during 2009 and 2015 to request data relating to the publications.

===Scientists in training===
A study of scientists in training indicated many had already experienced data withholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001888-200602000-00007 |vauthors=Vogeli C, Yucel R, Bendavid E |title=Data withholding and the next generation of scientists: results of a national survey |journal=Acad Med |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=128–36 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16436573 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1040-2446&amp;volume=81&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=128|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study has given rise to the fear the future generation of scientists will not abide by the established practices.

==Differing approaches in different fields==
Requirements for data sharing are more commonly imposed by institutions, funding agencies, and publication venues in the medical and biological sciences than in the physical sciences. Requirements vary widely regarding whether data must be shared at all, with whom the data must be shared, and who must bear the expense of data sharing.

Funding agencies such as the NIH and NSF tend to require greater sharing of data, but even these requirements tend to acknowledge the concerns of patient confidentiality, costs incurred in sharing data, and the legitimacy of the request. Private interests and public agencies with national security interests (defense and law enforcement) often discourage sharing of data and methods through non-disclosure agreements.

Data sharing poses specific challenges in [[participatory monitoring]] initiatives, for example where forest communities collect data on local social and environmental conditions. In this case, a rights-based approach to the development of data-sharing protocols can be based on principles of [[free, prior and informed consent]], and prioritise the protection of the rights of those who generated the data, and/or those potentially affected by data-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;D Sabogal. 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1957">'''Dielectric thermal analysis''' ('''DETA'''), or '''dielectric analysis''' ('''DEA'''), is a [[materials science]] technique similar to [[dynamic mechanical analysis]] except that an oscillating electrical field is used instead of a mechanical force.&lt;ref name="haines"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For investigation of the [[Curing_(chemistry)|curing]] behavior of [[Thermosetting polymer|thermosetting resin]] systems, composite materials, [[adhesive]]s and [[paint]]s, Dielectric Analysis (DEA) can be used in accordance with [[ASTM International|ASTM]] E 2038 or E 2039. The great advantage of DEA is that it can be employed not only on a laboratory scale, but also in process.

==Measuring principle==

In a typical test, the sample is placed in contact with two electrodes (the [[Capacitance probe|dielectric sensor]]) and a sinusoidal voltage (the excitation) is applied to one electrode.&lt;ref name="brown2001"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  resulting sinusoidal current (the response) is measured at the second electrode. The response signal is attenuated in amplitude and shifted in phase in relation to the mobility of the ions and alignment of the dipoles. Dipoles in the material will attempt to align with the electric field and ions (present as impurities) will move toward the electrode of opposite polarity. The dielectric properties of [[permittivity]] ε' and loss factor ε" are then calculated from this measured amplitude and phase change.&lt;ref name="brown2001"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17136">An '''earthquake light''' ('''EQL''') is a [[luminosity|luminous]] aerial [[phenomenon]] that reportedly appears in the sky at or near areas of [[tectonic]] stress, [[seismic]] activity, or [[volcanic]] eruptions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[scientific skepticism|Skeptics]] point out that the phenomenon is poorly understood and many of the reported sightings can be accounted for by mundane explanations.&lt;ref name="Sheaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dunning/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

==Appearance==
The lights are reported to appear while an earthquake is occurring, although there are reports of lights before or after earthquakes, such as reports concerning the 1975 [[Kalapana, Hawaii|Kalapana]] earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/earthquakes/destruct/1975Nov29/ |title=November 29, 1975 Kalapana Earthquake |publisher=Hvo.wr.usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are reported to have shapes similar to those of the [[aurora (astronomy)|auroras]], with a white to bluish hue, but occasionally they have been reported having a wider color spectrum. The luminosity is reported to be visible for several seconds, but has also been reported to last for tens of minutes. Accounts of viewable distance from the epicenter varies: in the 1930 Idu earthquake, lights were reported up to {{convert|70|mi|km}} from the epicenter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Lane, F. W. ''The Elements Rage'' (David &amp; Charles 1966), pp. 175–76&lt;/ref&gt; Earthquake lights were reportedly spotted in [[Tianshui|Tianshui, Gansu]], approximately {{convert|400|km|mi}} north-northeast of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]'s epicenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article3556127.ece|title=Glowing lights around an earthquake's epicenter|author=Paul Simons|publisher=Times Online|date=2008-03-15|accessdate=2008-05-20 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2003 Colima earthquake]] in Mexico, colorful lights were seen in the skies for the duration of the earthquake.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} During the [[2007 Peru earthquake]] lights were seen in the skies above the sea and filmed by many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2014/jan/14/study-homes-in-on-the-cause-of-earthquake-lights |title=Study homes in on the cause of earthquake light |publisher=Physicsworld.com |date=2014-01-14 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was also observed and caught on film during the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|2009 L'Aquila]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5194/nhess-10-967-2010 |title=The earthquake lights (EQL) of the 6 April 2009 Aquila earthquake, in Central Italy |year=2010 |last1=Fidani |first1=C. |journal=Natural Hazards and Earth System Science |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=967–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4430/bgta0034 |first=C. |last=Fidani |date=March 2012 |title=Statistical and spectral properties of the L'Aquila EQL in 2009 |journal=Bollettino di Geofisica Teorica ed Applicata |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=135–46 |url=http://www2.ogs.trieste.it/bgta/provapage.php?id_articolo=547 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2015-05-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519093853/http://www2.ogs.trieste.it/bgta/provapage.php?id_articolo=547 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2010 Chile earthquake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20100228/83581/Registran-enormes-luces-en-el-cielo-durante-terremoto-de-88-grados-de-magnitud-que-destruyo-Chile |title=Registran enormes luces en el cielo durante terremoto de 88 grados de magnitud que destruyo Chile |trans-title=Recorded huge lights in the sky during the earthquake of 8.8 magnitude that destroyed Chile |language=es |publisher=Peru Online |date=February 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301224159/http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20100228/83581/Registran-enormes-luces-en-el-cielo-durante-terremoto-de-88-grados-de-magnitud-que-destruyo-Chile |archivedate=March 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video footage has also recorded this happening during the 9 April 2011 eruption of [[Sakura Island|Sakurajima Volcano, Japan]] {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}. The phenomenon was also reported around the Amuri Earthquake in New Zealand, that occurred 1 September 1888. The lights were visible in the morning of 1 September in Reefton, and again on 8 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_21/rsnz_21_00_003130.html |journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand |title=The Earthquake in the Aimuri |author=Hutton |year=1888 |volume=21 |pages=269–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent appearances of the phenomenon, along with video footage of the incidents, happened in Sonoma County of California on August 24, 2014,&lt;ref name="Press Democrat"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Lori|title=Did you see flashes? Yep, an earthquake can create ’em (w/video)|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/2586646-181/did-you-see-flashes-yep#page=1|accessdate=9 September 2014|work=Press Democrat|publisher=Press Democrat|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Wellington New Zealand on November 14, 2016 where blue flashes like lightning were seen in the night sky, and recorded on several videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/watch-rare-mystery-lights-colouring-wellingtons-sky-moment-7-5-quake-baffle-locals.html?autoPlay=5208365549001|title=Watch: Rare mystery lights colouring Wellington's sky at moment of 7.5  quake baffle locals|newspaper=1 NEWS NOW|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 8, 2017, many people reported such sightings in Mexico City after a [[2017 Chiapas earthquake|8.2 magnitude earthquake]] with epicenter 460 miles (740&amp;nbsp;km) away, near Pijijiapan in the state of Chiapas.&lt;ref name="eluniversal-2017"&gt;{{Cite news|title=¿Qué eran las luces que se vieron durante el sismo?|newspaper=El Universal|accessdate=8 September 2017|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/sociedad/que-eran-las-luces-que-se-vieron-durante-el-sismo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearances of the earthquake light seem to occur when the quakes have a high magnitude, generally 5 or higher on the [[Richter scale]].&lt;ref name="Press Democrat"/&gt;
There have also been incidents of yellow, ball-shaped lights appearing before earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Brian Clark|title=Bizarre Earthquake Lights Finally Explained|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/01/140106-earthquake-lights-earthquake-prediction-geology-science/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Earthquake lights may be classified into two different groups based on their time of appearance: (1) preseismic EQL, which generally occur a few seconds to up to a few weeks prior to an earthquake, and are generally observed closer to the epicenter and (2) coseismic EQL, which can occur either near the epicenter (“earthquake‐induced stress”), or at significant distances away from the epicenter during the passage of the seismic wavetrain, in particular during the passage of ''S'' waves (“wave‐induced stress”).&lt;ref name="Thériault 159–178"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thériault|first=Robert|last2=St‐Laurent|first2=France|last3=Freund|first3=Friedemann T.|last4=Derr|first4=John S.|date=2014-01-01|title=Prevalence of Earthquake Lights Associated with Rift Environments|url=http://srl.geoscienceworld.org/content/85/1/159|journal=Seismological Research Letters|language=en|volume=85|issue=1|pages=159–178|doi=10.1785/0220130059|issn=0895-0695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EQL during the lower magnitude aftershock series seem to be rare.&lt;ref name="Thériault 159–178"/&gt; 
[[File:How EQL form.gif|thumb|Simplified model of phole propagation within an interplate, orogenic tectonic setting in a subduction zone environment (i.e., Andean‐type). The vertical scale (topographic relief) is exaggerated for clarity. +, positive holes; ''e''′, electrons.&lt;ref name="Thériault 159–178"/&gt;]]

== Possible Explanations ==
Research into earthquake lights is ongoing; as such, several mechanisms have been proposed. Positive Holes is one such model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitehead |first1=Neil Evan |last2=Ulusoy |first2=Ü. |title=Origin of Earthquake Light Associated with Earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand, 2010-2011 |journal=Earth Sciences Research Journal |date=17 December 2015 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=113–120 |doi=10.15446/esrj.v19n2.47000 |url=http://www.chchquake.co.nz/whitehead15eqlight.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models suggest the generation of EQLs involve the ionization of oxygen to oxygen anions by breaking of peroxy bonds in some types of rocks (dolomite, rhyolite, etc.) by the high stress before and during an earthquake.&lt;ref name="Thériault 159–178"/&gt; After the ionisation, the ions travel up through the cracks in the rocks. Once they reach the atmosphere these ions can ionise pockets of air, forming plasma that emits light.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-do-lights-sometimes-appear-in-the-sky-during-an-earthquake-180948077/&lt;/ref&gt; Lab experiments have validated that some rocks do ionise the oxygen in them when subjected to high stress levels.
Research suggests that the angle of the fault is related to the likelihood of earthquake light generation, with subvertical (nearly vertical) faults in rifting environments having the most incidences of earthquake lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1785/0220130059 | laysummary=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-01/ssoa-ell122013.php | laysource=Seismological Society of America | laydate=January 2, 2014 | title=Prevalence of Earthquake Lights Associated with Rift Environments |year=2014 |last1=Thériault |first1=Robert |last2=St-Laurent |first2=France |last3=Freund |first3=Friedemann T. |last4=Derr |first4=John S. |journal=Seismological Research Letters |volume=85 | issue=1| pages=159–78| issn=0895-0695| publisher=[[Seismological Society of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One hypothesis involves intense electric fields created [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectrically]] by tectonic movements of rocks containing [[quartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1143/JJAP.37.5016 |title=A Dark Discharge Model of Earthquake Lightning |year=1998 |last1=Takaki |first1=Shunji |last2=Ikeya |first2=Motoji |journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics |volume=37 |pages=5016–20|bibcode=1998JaJAP..37.5016T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible explanation is local disruption of the Earth's magnetic field and/or [[ionosphere]] in the region of tectonic stress, resulting in the observed glow effects either from ionospheric radiative recombination at lower altitudes and greater atmospheric pressure or as [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]. However, the effect is clearly not pronounced or notably observed at all earthquake events and is yet to be directly experimentally verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/view.php?id=22089 |title='Restless Earth' May Give Advance Notice of Large Earthquakes |publisher=NASA |date=December 7, 2001 |accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the American Physical Society's 2014 March meeting, research was provided that gave a possible explanation for the reason why bright lights sometimes appear during an earthquake.  The research stated that when two layers of the same material rub against each other, voltage is generated. The researcher, Professor Troy Shinbrot of Rutgers University, conducted lab experiments with different types of grains to mimic the crust of the earth and emulated the occurrence of earthquakes. "When the grains split open, they measured a positive voltage spike, and when the split closed, a negative spike." The crack allows the voltage to discharge into the air which then electrifies the air and creates a bright electrical light when it does so.  According to the research provided, they have produced these voltage spikes every single time with every material tested.  While the reason for such an occurrence was not provided, Professor Troy Shinbrot referenced the light to a phenomenon called [[triboluminescence]]. Researchers hope that by getting to the bottom of this phenomenon, it will provide more information that will allow seismologists to better predict earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Charles|title=Mysterious Flashing 'Earthquake Lights' Maybe Explained|url=http://www.livescience.com/43686-earthquake-lights-possible-cause.html|website=livescience|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Meeri|title=Experiments at Rutgers lend credence to existence of ‘earthquake lights’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/experiments-at-rutgers-lend-credence-to-existence-of-earthquake-lights/2014/03/06/241a1a9c-a4c7-11e3-8466-d34c451760b9_story.html|website=Washington Post|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luntz|first1=Stephen|title=Clue To Mysterious Lights That Appear Before Earthquakes|url=http://www.iflscience.com/physics/clue-mysterious-lights-appear-earthquakes|website=Iflscience!|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
According to [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] researchers should be concerned about the fact that there are no documented "confirmed observations" of earthquake lights. It is a red flag that there is no consistency of what they are, when they happen and where they happen. It is likely that there "is not one, known, proven phenomenon". However, a significant amount of video footage has surfaced since the advent of sites like YouTube that claim to represent this —one example being the [[2017 Chiapas earthquake|2017 Mexico earthquake]]&lt;ref name="eluniversal-2017"/&gt;— although no consistent explanation has been agreed upon. There is also a "staggering volume of literature... hardly any of these papers agree on anything... I'm forced to wonder how many of these eager researchers are familiar with [[Ray Hyman|Hyman's Categorical Imperative:]] 'Do not try to explain something until you are sure there is something to be explained'". Dunning's final conclusion is that until there is "pending decent evidence" be skeptical of claims of earthquake lights.&lt;ref name=Dunning&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4534|number=534|title=Earthquake Lights: Do They Exist?|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Sheaffer]] writes that he is surprised how many [[scientific skepticism|skeptics]] and science bloggers have accepted earthquake lights as a real phenomenon without checking the source of the claim, or doing basic research on what the lights might be. Sheaffer on his ''Bad UFO'' blog shows examples of what people claim are earthquake lights, then he shows photos of [[Cloud iridescence|iridescent clouds]] which appear to be the same. He states that "It's truly remarkable how mutable "earthquake lights" are. Sometimes they look like small globes, climbing up a mountain. Sometimes they look like flashes of lightning. Other times they look exactly like iridescent clouds. Earthquake lights can look like anything at all, when you are avidly seeking evidence for them."&lt;ref name="Sheaffer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheaffer|first1=Robert|authorlink=Robert Sheaffer|title=Skeptics and Claims of "Earthquake Lights"|url=http://badufos.blogspot.com/2014/01/skeptics-and-claims-of-earthquake-lights.html|website=Bad UFOs: Skepticism, UFOs, and The Universe|publisher=Blogger|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sharon A. Hill|Sharon Hill]] writes that the science isn't in on earthquake lights, not enough research has been done. She states that not all earthquakes are the same and it may be possible that "extension" and "compression" faults produce "different behaviors on the surface as well as subsurface". She understands why skeptics are reluctant to confirm that this might be happening "because of the unreliability, irreproducibility and inadequate explanation for it". Also a possibility is that "stronger quakes break electrical wiring and cause transformers to explode, causing the flashes". As more research is done on electrical signals concerning earthquakes we will have a better understanding of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Sharon|authorlink=Sharon A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21529">'''Eco-costs''' are the costs of the environmental burden of a product on the basis of prevention of that burden. They are the costs which should be made to reduce the [[environmental pollution]] and [[Resource depletion|materials depletion]] in our world to a level which is in line with the [[carrying capacity]] of our earth.

For example: for each 1000&amp;nbsp;kg [[Greenhouse effect|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission]], one should invest €116,- in [[Offshore wind power|offshore windmill park]]s (plus in the other CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction systems at that price or less). When this is done consequently, the total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in the world will be reduced by 65% compared to the emissions in 2008. As a result, global warming will stabilise. In short: "the eco-costs of 1000kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are € 116,-".

Similar calculations can be made on the environmental burden of [[Ocean acidification|acidification]], [[eutrophication]], [[summer smog]], [[fine dust]], [[eco-toxicity]], and the use of metals, [[Rare-earth mineral|rare earth]]s, [[fossil fuel]]s, water and [[land consumption|land]] (nature).
As such, the eco-costs are '[[external costs]]', since they are not yet integrated in the real life costs of current production chains ([[Whole-life cost|Life Cycle Costs]]). The eco-costs should be regarded as hidden [[obligation]]s.

The eco-costs of a product are the sum of all eco-costs of emissions and use of resources during the life cycle "[[Cradle to Cradle Design|from cradle to cradle]]". The widely accepted method to make such a calculation is called [[life cycle assessment]] (LCA), which is basically a mass and energy balance, defined in the ISO 14040, and the ISO 14044 (for the building industry the EN 15804).

The practical use of eco-costs is to compare the [[sustainability]] of several product types with the same functionality. 
The advantage of eco-costs is that they are expressed in a standardized [[value (economics)|monetary value]] (€) which appears to be easily understood 'by instinct'. Also the calculation is transparent and relatively easy, compared to damage based models which have the disadvantage of extremely complex calculations with subjective weighting of the various aspects contributing to the overall environmental burden.&lt;ref&gt;M.

In 2007 the system has been updated, and published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Vogtländer; [http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b004.htm ''EVR, LCA-based assessment of sustainability''], VSSD, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The next updates were in 2012 and 2017. It is planned to update the system every 5 years to incorporate the latest developments in science.&lt;br /&gt; 
The concept of eco-costs has been made operational with general databases of the Delft University of Technology, and is described at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com].&lt;br /&gt; The method of the eco-costs is based on the sum of the marginal prevention costs (end of pipe as well as system integrated) for toxic emissions related to human health as well as ecosystems, emissions that cause [[global warming]], and [[resource depletion]] (metals, rare earths, fossil fuels, water, and land-use). For a visual display of the system see Figure 1.

Marginal prevention costs of toxic emissions are derived from the so-called prevention curve as depicted in Figure 2. The basic idea behind such a curve is that a country (or a group of countries, such as the European Union), must take prevention measures to reduce toxic emissions (more than one measure is required to reach the target). From the point of view of the economy, the cheapest measures (in terms of euro/kg) are taken first. At a certain point at the curve, the reduction of the emissions is sufficient to bring the concentration of the pollution below the so-called no-effect-level. The no-effect-level of {{CO2}} emissions is the level that the emissions and the natural absorption of the earth are in equilibrium again at a maximum temperature rise of 2 degrees C. The no-effect-level of a toxic emission is the level where the concentration in nature is well below the toxicity threshold (most natural toxic substances have a toxicity threshold, below which they might even have a beneficial effect), or below the natural background level. For human toxicity the '[[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]' is used.
The eco-costs are the marginal prevention costs of the last measure of the prevention curve to reach the no-effect-level. See the abovementioned references 4 and 8 for a full description of the calculation method (note that in the calculation 'classes' of emissions with the same 'midpoint' are combined, as explained below).

The classical way to calculate a 'single indicator' in LCA is based on the damage of the emissions. Pollutants are grouped in 'classes', multiplied by a 'characterisation' factor to account for their relative importance within a class, and totalised to the level of their 'midpoint' effect ([[Greenhouse effect|global warming]], [[Multi-effect Protocol|acidification]], nutrification, etc.). The classical problem is then to determine the relative importance of each midpoint effect. In damage based systems this is done by 'normalisation' (= comparison with the pollution in a country or a region) and 'weighting' (= giving each midpoint a weight, to take the relative importance into account) by an expert panel.

The calculation of the eco-costs is based on classification and characterisation tables as well (combining tables from IPCC ([http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html]), the [[USEtox]] model ([http://usetox.org usetox.org]), tables of the [[ILCD]] ([http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/LCIA-CF-20-02-2013-clean.pdf]), however has a different approach to the normalisation and weighting steps. Normalisation is done by calculating the marginal prevention costs for a region (i.e. the European Union), as described above. The weighting step is not required in the eco-costs system, since the total result is the sum of  the eco-costs of all midpoints.
The advantage of such a calculation is that the marginal prevention costs are related to the cost of the most expensive [[Best Available Technology]] which is needed to meet the target, and the corresponding level of  [[Emissions trading|Tradable Emission Rights]] which is required in future. From a business point of view, the eco-costs are the costs of non-compliance with future governmental regulations. Example from the past: NOx emissions of Volkswagen diesel.

The eco-costs have been calculated for the situation in the European Union. It is expected that the situation in some states in the USA, like California and Pennsylvania, give similar results. It might be argued that the eco-costs are also an indication of the marginal prevention costs for other parts of the globe, under the condition of a [[level playing field]] for production companies.

==Eco-costs 2017==
The method of the eco-costs 2017 (version 1.3) comprises tables of over 36.000 emissions, and has been made operational by special database for SimaPro: Idematapp 2018 and Idemat2018 (based on LCIs from Ecoinvent V3.4), Agri Footprint, and a database for CES (Cambridge Engineering Selector). Over 10.000 materials and processes are covered in total. Excel look-up tables are provided at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com].

For emissions of toxic substances, the following set of multipliers (marginal prevention costs) is used in the eco-costs 2017 system:
{|
|-
!eco-costs of!!equivalent
|-
|  acidification || 8.75 €/kg SOx equivalent
|-
| eutrophication|| 4.17 €/kg phosphate equivalent
|-
| ecotoxicity|| 55.0 €/kg Cu equivalent
|-
| human toxicity || 3754 €/kg Benzo(a)pyrene equivalent
|-
| summer smog (respiratory diseases)|| 10.38 €/kg C2H4 equivalent
|-
| fine dust|| 34.0 €/kg fine dust PM2.5

|-
| global warming  (GWP 100)|| 0.116 €/kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent
|}

The characterisation ('midpoint') tables which are applied in the eco-costs 2017 system, are recommended by the ILCD:&lt;ref&gt;Characterization factors of the ILCD Recommended Life Cycle Impact Assessment methods, ILCD [http://lct.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pdf-directory/LCIA-CF-20-02-2013-clean.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* IPPC 2013, 100 years, for greenhouse gasses
* USETOX 2, for human toxicity (carcinogens), and ecotoxicity
* ILCD, for acidification, eutrification, and photochemical oxidant formation (summer smog)
* UNEP/SETAC 2016,&lt;ref&gt;Global Guidance for Life Cycle Impact assessment Indicators Volume 1, United Nations Environment Programme, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;, for fine dust PM2.5 (for PM10 the default factors are used of the ILCD Midpoint+)

In addition to abovementioned eco-costs for emissions, there is a set of eco-costs to characterize the 'midpoints' of resource depletion:
* eco-costs of abiotic scarcity (metals, including rare earth, and fossil fuels)
* eco-costs of land-use change (based on [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], of vascular plants and mammals, used for eco-costs of tropical hardwood)
* eco-costs of water scarcity (based on the midpoint Water Stress Indicator - WSI - of countries &lt;ref&gt;Boulay, Bulle, Bayart, Deschênes, and Margni; Regional Characterization of Freshwater Use in LCA: Modeling Direct Impacts on Human Health; Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 2011, 45, pp 8948 - 8957&lt;/ref&gt;)
* eco-costs of landfill

The abovementioned marginal prevention costs at midpoint level can be combined to 'endpoints' in three groups, plus global warming as a separate group:
{|
|-
| eco-costs of human health       ||= the sum of carcinogens, summer smog, fine dust
|-
| eco-costs of ecosystems         || = the sum of acidification, eutrophication, ecotoxicity
|-
| eco-costs of resource scarcity || = the sum of abiotic depletion, land-use, water, and land-fill
|-
| eco-costs of global warming     || = the sum of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases (the GWP 100 table) 
|-
| total eco-costs    || = the sum of human health, ecosystems, resource scarcity and global warming
|}

Since the endpoints have the same monetary unit (e.g. euro, dollar), they are added up to the total eco-costs without applying a 'subjective' weighting system. This is an advantage of the eco-costs system (see also ISO 14044 section 4.4.3.4 and 4.4.5). 
So called 'double counting' (ISO 14044 section 4.4.2.2.3) is avoided in the eco-costs system.

The eco-costs of global warming (also called eco-costs of carbon footprint) can be used as an indicator for the [[carbon footprint]]. The eco-costs of resource depletion can be regarded as an indicator for 'circularity' in the theory of the [[circular economy]]. However, it is advised to include human toxicity and eco-toxicity, and include the eco-costs of global warming in the calculations on the circular economy as well. The eco-costs of global warming are required to reveal the difference between fossil-based products and bio-based products, since biogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not counted in LCA (biogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is part of the natural recycle loop in the biosphere).
Therefore,  total eco-costs can be regarded as a robust indicator for [[cradle-to-cradle]] calculations in LCA for products and services in the theory of the circular economy.
Since the economic viability of a business model is also an important aspect of the circular economy, the added value of a product-service system should be part of the analysis. This requires the two dimensional approach of Eco-efficient Value Creation &lt;ref&gt;Joost G. Vogtländer, A. Mestre, R. van der Helm, A. Scheepens and R. Wever; [http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b021.htm ''Eco-efficient Value creation, sustainable design and business strategies''], VSSD, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as described at the Wikipedia page on the model of the [[eco-costs value ratio|ecocosts/value ratio]], EVR.

The Delft University of Technology has developed a single indicator for S-LCA as well, the so-called s-eco-costs, to incorporate the sometimes appalling working conditions in production chains (e.g. production of garments, mining of metals). Aspects are the low [[List of minimum wages by country|minimum wages in developing countries]] (the "[[living wage|fair wage]] deficit"), the aspects of "[[child labour]]" and [[extreme poverty]]", the aspect of "excessive working hours", and the aspect of "OSH ([[Occupational Safety and Health]])". The s-eco-costs system has been published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.&lt;ref&gt;Natascha M. van der Velden and Joost G. Vogtländer; Monetisation of external socio-economic costs of industrial production: A social-LCA-based case of clothing production; Journal of Cleaner Production, 2017, 153, pp 320 - 330&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention costs versus damage costs==
Prevention measures will decrease the costs of the damage, related to environmental pollution. The damage costs are in most cases the same (or a bit higher) compared to the prevention costs. So the total effect of prevention measures on our society is that it results in a better environment at no extra costs.

==Discussion==
There are many 'single indicators' for LCA. Basically, they fall into three categories:
* single issue
* damage based
* prevention based

The best known 'single issue' indicator is the [[carbon footprint]]: the total emissions of kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or kg CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''equivalent'' (taking methane and some other [[greenhouse gas]]ses into account as well). The advantage of a single issue indicator is, that its calculation is simple and transparent, without any complex assumptions. It is easy as well to communicate to the public. The disadvantage is that is ignores the problems caused by other pollutants and it is not suitable for cradle-to-cradle calculations (because materials depletion is not taken into account).&lt;br /&gt;
The most common single indicators are damage based. This stems from the period of the 1990s, when LCA was developed to make people aware of the damage of production and consumption. The advantage of damage based single indicators is, that they make people aware of the fact that they should consume less, and make companies aware that they should produce cleaner. The disadvantage is that these damage based systems are very complex, not transparent for others than who make the computer calculations, need many assumptions, and suffer from the subjective weighting procedure as last step at the end. Communication of the result is not easy, since the result is expressed in 'points' (attempts to express the results in money were never very successful, because of methodological flaws and uncertainties). The most recent endpoint indicators avoid the last step to a single indicator: UseTOX 2 and ReCiPe 2016, resulting in 2 respectively 3 endpoints (human health, ecosystems and resources separately).&lt;br /&gt;
Prevention based indicators, like the system of the eco-costs, are relatively new. The advantage, in comparison to the damage based systems, is that the calculations are relatively easy and transparent, and that the  results can be explained in terms of money and in measures to be taken. The system is focused on the decision taking processes of architects, business people, designers and engineers. The advantage is that it provides 1 single endpoint in euro's. The disadvantage is that the system is not focused on the fact that people should consume less.

The eco-costs are calculated for the situation of the European Union, but are applicable worldwide under the assumption of a level playing field for business, and under the precautionary principle. There are two other prevention based systems, developed after the introduction of the eco-costs, which are based on the local circumstances of a specific country:
* In the Netherlands, 'shadow prices' have been developed in 2004 by TNO/MEP on basis of a local prevention curve: it are the costs of the most expensive prevention measure required by the Dutch government for each midpoint.  It is obvious that such costs are relevant for the local companies, but such a shadow price system doesn't have any meaning outside the Netherlands, since it is not based on the no-effect-level
* In Japan, a group of universities have developed a set of data for maximum abatement costs (MAC, similar to the midpoint multipliers of the eco-costs as given in the previous section), for the Japanese conditions. The development of the MAC method started in 2002 and has been published in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Tosihiro Oka, Masanobu Ishikawa, Yoshifumi Fujii, Gjalt Huppes; Calculating Cost-effectiveness for Activities with Multiple Environmental Effects Using the Maximum Abatement Cost Method; Journal of Industrial Ecology, Volume 9, Issue 4, pages 97–103, October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called avoidable abatement cost (AAC) in this method is comparable to the eco-costs.

Within [[ghost hunting]] and [[parapsychology]], '''electronic voice phenomena''' ('''EVP''') are sounds found on electronic recordings that are interpreted as [[spirit]] voices that have been either unintentionally recorded or intentionally requested and recorded. Parapsychologist [[Konstantīns Raudive]], who popularized the idea in the 1970s, described EVP as typically brief, usually the length of a word or short phrase.&lt;ref name="bretf"/&gt;

Enthusiasts consider EVP to be a form of [[paranormal]] phenomenon often found in recordings with [[white noise|static]] or other [[background noise]]. However, scientists regard EVP as a form of auditory [[pareidolia]] (interpreting random sounds as voices in one's own language) and a [[pseudoscience]] promulgated by popular culture.&lt;ref name="Williams2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F.

==History==
As the [[spiritualism|Spiritualist]] [[religious movement]] became prominent in the 1840s–1920s with a distinguishing belief that the [[spirit]]s of the dead can be contacted by [[medium (spirituality)|mediums]], new technologies of the era including [[spirit photography|photography]] were employed by spiritualists in an effort to demonstrate contact with a [[Spirit world (spiritualism)|spirit world]]. So popular were such ideas that [[Thomas Edison]] was asked in an interview with ''[[Scientific American]]'' to comment on the possibility of using his inventions to communicate with spirits. He replied that if the spirits were only capable of subtle influences, a sensitive recording device would provide a better chance of spirit communication than the table tipping and [[ouija boards]] mediums employed at the time. However, there is no indication that Edison ever designed or constructed a device for such a purpose.&lt;ref name="SkepDic"&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd, ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' 2003, Wiley Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-471-27242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[sound recording]] became widespread, mediums explored using this technology to demonstrate communication with the dead as well. Spiritualism  declined in the latter part of the 20th century, but attempts to use portable recording devices and modern digital technologies to communicate with spirits continued.&lt;ref name="fontana1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fontana | first = David | authorlink = | title = Is There an Afterlife: A Comprehensive Review of the Evidence | publisher = O Books | year=  2005 | location = Hants, UK |url = | doi = | isbn = 1-903816-90-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|352–381}}

===Early interest===
American photographer Attila von Szalay was among the first to try recording what he believed to be voices of the dead as a way to augment his investigations in photographing ghosts. He began his attempts in 1941 using a 78 rpm record, but it wasn't until 1956 — after switching to a reel-to-reel tape recorder — that he believed he was successful.&lt;ref name=senkowski&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worlditc.org/f_07_senkowski_analysis.htm |title=Analysis of Anomalous Audio and Video Recordings, presented before the "Society For Scientific Exploration" USA – June 1995 |accessdate=2007-09-18 |last=Senkowski |first=Ernst |year=1995 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013092253/http://worlditc.org/f_07_senkowski_analysis.htm |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with Raymond Bayless, von Szalay conducted a number of recording sessions with a custom-made apparatus, consisting of a microphone in an insulated cabinet connected to an external recording device and speaker. Szalay reported finding many sounds on the tape that could not be heard on the speaker at the time of recording, some of which were recorded when there was no one in the cabinet. He believed these sounds to be the voices of discarnate spirits. Among the first recordings believed to be spirit voices were such messages as "This is G!", "Hot dog, Art!", and "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all".&lt;ref name="senkowski"/&gt;  Von Szalay and Raymond Bayless' work was published by the Journal of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=brune1&gt;{{cite book | last = Brune | first = Francois | authorlink = | title = The Dead Speak To Us | publisher = Philippe Lebaud | year=  1988 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 2-253-05123-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayless later went on to co-author the 1979 book, ''Phone Calls From the Dead''.

In 1959, Swedish painter and film producer Friedrich Jürgenson was recording bird songs. Upon playing the tape later, he heard what he interpreted to be his dead father's voice and then the spirit of his deceased wife calling his name.&lt;ref name="senkowski"/&gt; He went on to make several more recordings, including one that he said contained a message from his late mother.&lt;ref name="Cardoso 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cardoso | first = Anabela | authorlink = | title = ITC Voices: Contact with Another Reality? | publisher = ParaDocs | year=  2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raudive voices===
[[Konstantin Raudive]], a Latvian psychologist who had taught at the [[Uppsala University]], Sweden and who had worked in conjunction with Jürgenson, made over 100,000 recordings which he described as being communications with [[Wiktionary:discarnate|discarnate]] people.

===Spiricom and Frank's Box===
In 1980, William O'Neil constructed an electronic audio device called "The Spiricom". O'Neil claimed the device was built to specifications which he received [[psychic]]ally from George Mueller, a scientist who had died six years previously.&lt;ref name=fontana1/&gt;{{rp|352–381}}&lt;ref name=Baruss/&gt; At a [[Washington, DC]] press conference on April 6, 1982, O'Neil stated that he was able to hold two-way conversations with spirits through the Spiricom device, and provided the design specifications to researchers for free. However, nobody is known to have replicated the results O'Neil claimed using his own Spiricom devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wintersteel.com/EVP.html |title=Electronic Voice Phenomena |accessdate=2007-09-20 |publisher=Winter Steel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919105304/http://www.wintersteel.com/EVP.html |archivedate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worlditc.org/h_07_meek_spiri_000_007.htm |title=An electromagnetic-etheric systems approach to communications with other levels of human consciousness |accessdate=2007-09-20 |last=Meek |first=George W |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629013254/http://worlditc.org/h_07_meek_spiri_000_007.htm |archivedate = 2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neil's partner, retired industrialist George Meek, attributed O'Neil's success, and the inability of others to replicate it, to O'Neil's [[Mediumship|mediumistic]] abilities forming part of the loop that made the system work.&lt;ref name="Baruss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meek1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report from Europe: Earthside instrumental communications with higher planes of existence via telephone and computer are now a reality|journal=Unlimited Horizons, Metascience Foundation Inc|year=1988|first=George W|last=Meek|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–11|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another electronic device specifically constructed in an attempt to capture EVP is "Frank's Box" or the "Ghost Box", created in 2002 by EVP enthusiast Frank Sumption for supposed real-time communication with the dead. Sumption claims he received his design instructions from the spirit world. The device is described as a combination [[white noise]] generator and [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] modified to sweep back and forth through the [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] band selecting split-second snippets of sound. Critics of the device say its effect is subjective and incapable of being replicated, and since it relies on radio noise, any meaningful response a user gets is purely coincidental, or simply the result of [[pareidolia]].&lt;ref name="CSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/franks_box_the_broken_radio/|title=Frank’s Box: The Broken Radio|last=Stollznow|first=Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|date=January 28, 2010|publisher=The Committee For Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=13 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726072215/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/franks_box_the_broken_radio|archivedate=26 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paranormal researcher [[Ben Radford]] writes that Frank's Box is a "modern version of the [[Ouija board]]... also known as the 'broken radio'".&lt;ref name="Radford 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Radford |first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Investigating Ghosts: The Scientific Search for Spirits |date=2017 |publisher=Rhombus Publishing Company |location=Corrales, New Mexico |isbn=978-0-936455-16-7 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern interest===
In 1982, Sarah Estep founded the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena (AA-EVP) in [[Severna Park, Maryland]], a nonprofit organization with the purpose of increasing awareness of EVP, and of teaching standardized methods for capturing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association TransCommunication  (Previously known as the AA-EVP)|url=http://atransc.org|publisher=atransc.org|accessdate=23 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130424030901/http://atransc.org/|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estep began her exploration of EVP in 1976, and says she has made hundreds of recordings of messages from deceased friends, relatives, and [[extraterrestrials]] whom she speculated originated from other planets or dimensions.&lt;ref name="Carroll2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Carroll|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=11 January 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-04563-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC) was coined by Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s to refer more generally to communication through any sort of electronic device such as tape recorders, fax machines, television sets or computers between [[Soul|spirits]] or other discarnate entities and the living.&lt;ref name=Baruss&gt;Baruss, Imants (2001), [http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_15_3_baruss.pdf ''Failure to Replicate Electronic Voice Phenomenon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228125352/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_15_3_baruss.pdf |date=2013-02-28 }}, Journal of Scientific Exploration, V15#3, 0892-3310/01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=itcvoic1&gt;Cardoso, Anabela (2003) "ITC Voices: Contact with Another Reality?"&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly famous claimed incidence of ITC occurred when the image of EVP enthusiast Friedrich Jürgenson (whose funeral was held that day) was said to have appeared on a television in the home of a colleague, which had been purposefully tuned to a vacant channel.&lt;ref name=Baruss/&gt; ITC enthusiasts also look at the TV and video camera feedback loop of the [[Droste effect]].&lt;ref name="CLAUS"&gt;" {{cite web|url=http://www.worlditc.org/h_08_schreiber_0.htm |title=Claus Schreiber, Germany |accessdate=2007-09-21 |publisher=World ITC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/itc.html |title=Skeptic's Dictionary on instrumental transcommunication (ITC) |accessdate=2007-09-22 |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030202147/http://skepdic.com/itc.html |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, parapsychologist [[D. Scott Rogo]] described an alleged [[paranormal]] phenomenon in which people report that they receive simple, brief, and usually single-occurrence [[telephone]] calls from [[ghost|spirits]] of deceased relatives, friends, or strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogo|first=D. Scott|authorlink=D. Scott Rogo|last2=Bayless|first2=Raymond|title=Phone Calls from the Dead|year=1979|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=0-13-664334-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Rosemary Guiley]] has written "within the parapsychology establishment, Rogo was often faulted for poor scholarship, which, critics said, led to erroneous conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary]]. (1992). ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits''. pp. 284-285&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the parapsychologist [[David Fontana]] proposed in an article that poltergeists could haunt tape recorders. He speculated that this may have happened to the parapsychologist [[Maurice Grosse]] who investigated the [[Enfield Poltergeist]] case. However, Tom Flynn a media expert for the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] examined Fontana's article and suggested an entirely naturalistic explanation for the phenomena. According to the skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] "Occasionally, especially with older tape and under humid conditions, as the tape travels it can adhere to one of the guide posts. When this happens on a deck where both supply and take-up spindles are powered, the tape continues to feed, creating a fold. It was such a loop of tape, Flynn theorizes, that threaded its way amid the works of Grosse’s recorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/haunted_tape_recorder/|title=The Haunted Tape Recorder - CSI|website=www.csicop.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109011116/http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/haunted_tape_recorder/|archivedate=2015-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Imants Barušs]], of the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, conducted a series of experiments using the methods of EVP investigator [[Konstantin Raudive]], and the work of "instrumental transcommunication researcher" Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either sat in silence or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP.&lt;ref name="Baruss"/&gt; Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: "While we did replicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena found in our study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence we have failed to replicate EVP in the strong sense." The findings were published in the ''[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]]'' in 2001, and include a literature review.&lt;ref name="Baruss"/&gt;

In 2005, the ''Journal of the [[Society for Psychical Research]]'' published a report by paranormal investigator Alexander MacRae.  MacRae conducted recording sessions using a device of his own design that generated EVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In an attempt to demonstrate that different individuals would interpret EVP in the recordings the same way, MacRae asked seven people to compare some selections to a list of five phrases he provided, and to choose the best match. MacRae said the results of the listening panels indicated that the selections were of paranormal origin.&lt;ref name=senkowski /&gt;&lt;ref name="macRae1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = MacRae | first = Alexander | authorlink = | title = Report of an Electronic Voice Phenomenon Experiment inside a Double-Screened Room | journal = Journal of the Society for Psychical Research | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = Society for Psychical Research |date=October 2005 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Alpha Mystery |journal=FATE Magazine |date=2000-07-01 |first=José |last=Feola |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/38/ |format= |accessdate=2007-09-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701231855/http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/38/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portable digital voice recorders are currently the technology of choice for some EVP investigators. Since some of these devices are very susceptible to Radio Frequency (RF) contamination, EVP enthusiasts sometimes try to record EVP in RF- and sound-screened rooms.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"&gt;{{cite web | last = Chisholm | first = Judith | title = A Short History of EVP | publisher = Psychic World | year = 2000 | url = http://www.psychicworld.net/EVP3.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-03 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070211082252/http://www.psychicworld.net/EVP3.htm |archivedate= 2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some EVP enthusiasts describe hearing the words in EVP as an ability, much like learning a new language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=You can Hear Dead People |journal=Fate |date=2001-02-01 |first= |last=Konstantinos |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/95/ |format= |accessdate=2007-09-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044750/http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/95/ |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Skeptics suggest that the claimed instances may be misinterpretations of natural phenomena, inadvertent influence of the electronic equipment by researchers, or deliberate influencing of the researchers and the equipment by third parties. EVP and ITC are seldom researched within the [[scientific community]], so most research in the field is carried out by amateur researchers who lack training and resources to conduct scientific research, and who are motivated by subjective notions.&lt;ref name=Baruss /&gt;

==Explanations and origins==
[[Paranormal]] claims for the origin of EVP include living humans imprinting thoughts directly on an electronic medium through [[psychokinesis]]&lt;ref name="jahn1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jahn | first = Robert G. | authorlink = |author2=Dunne, Brenda J. | title = Margins of Reality: The Role of Consciousness in the Physical World | publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year= 1987 | location = San Diego, California | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-15-157148-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and communication by discarnate entities such as spirits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendly-ghosts.com/faqs.html|title=EVPs - Questions &amp; Answers|website=www.friendly-ghosts.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517150243/http://www.friendly-ghosts.com/faqs.html|archivedate=2008-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Group analyzes paranormal activity|journal=The Collegian|date= October 26, 2004 |first=Josh|last=Josh Bosack|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; nature energies, beings from other dimensions, or [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].&lt;ref name="Voices-ET"&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080618050650/http://aaevp.com/voices_of_eternity_web.pdf Estep, Sarah, "''Voices Of Eternity''," page 144]&lt;/ref&gt; Paranormal explanations for EVP generally assume production of EVP by a communicating intelligence through means other than the typical functioning of [[communication technology|communication technologies]]. Natural explanations for reported instances of EVP tend to dispute this assumption explicitly and provide explanations which do not require novel mechanisms that are not based on recognized [[observation|scientific phenomena]].

One study, by psychologist [[Imants Barušs]], was unable to replicate suggested paranormal origins for EVP recorded under controlled conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Baruss, Imants (2001). "Failure to Replicate Electronic Voice Phenomenon," ''Journal of Scientific Exploration'', Vol. 15, No. 3, pp. 355–367, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Regal]] in ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'' (2009) has written "A case can be made for the idea that many EVPs are artifacts of the recording process itself with which the operators are unfamiliar. The majority of EVPS have alternative, nonspiritual sources; anomalous ones have no clear proof they are of spiritual origin."&lt;ref&gt;Regal, Brian (2009). ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia''. Greenwood. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-0-313-35507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural explanations===

There are a number of simple scientific explanations that can account for why some listeners to the static on audio devices may believe they hear voices, including radio interference and the tendency of the human brain to recognize patterns in random stimuli.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =EVP| work =Skeptic's Dictionary| publisher =| url =http://skepdic.com/evp.html| doi =| accessdate =2006-12-01| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061130171118/http://skepdic.com/evp.html| archivedate =2006-11-30| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recordings may be hoaxes created by frauds or pranksters.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;

====Psychology and perception====

''Auditory [[pareidolia]]'' is a situation created when the brain incorrectly interprets random patterns as being familiar patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins Arthur W. Wynn Charles M. (2001), "Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends and Pseudoscience Begins", National Academies Press, {{ISBN|0-309-07309-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of EVP it could result in an observer interpreting random noise on an audio recording as being the familiar sound of a human voice.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zusne |first=Leonard |author2=Warren H.

Skeptics such as [[David Federlein]], [[Chris French]], [[Terence Hines]] and [[Michael Shermer]] say that EVP are usually recorded by raising the "[[noise floor]]" – the electrical noise created by all electrical devices – in order to create [[white noise]].  When this noise is [[filter (signal processing)|filtered]], it can be made to produce noises which sound like speech.  Federlein says that this is no different from using a [[wah pedal]] on a guitar, which is a [[Spectral glide|focused sweep filter]] which moves around the spectrum and creates open vowel sounds.  This, according to Federlein, sounds exactly like some EVP.  This, in combination with such things as [[cross modulation]] of radio stations or faulty [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]] can cause the impression of paranormal voices.&lt;ref name="SkepDic" /&gt;  The human brain evolved to recognize patterns, and if a person listens to enough noise the brain will detect words, even when there is no intelligent source for them.&lt;ref name=shermer&gt;{{cite news |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man |date=May 2005 |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000EB977-12BE-1264-8F9683414B7FFE9F |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007142218/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000EB977-12BE-1264-8F9683414B7FFE9F |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCHUW"&gt;{{cite news | first=Huw | last=Williams | title='Ghostly' chatter - fact or fiction? | date=2005-01-06 | work=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4152805.stm | accessdate=2007-09-23 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115073641/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4152805.stm | archivedate=2010-11-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expectation also plays an important part in making people believe they are hearing voices in random noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hines, Terence|authorlink =Terence Hines|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|page=111|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|year=2003|isbn=1-57392-979-4}} "If one expects to hear voices, constructive perception will produce voices. The voices, not surprisingly, are usually described as speaking in hoarse whispers. The Indians used to believe that the dead spoke as the wind swirled through the trees. The tape recorder has simply brought this illusion into a technological age."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interference (communication)|Interference]], for example, is seen in certain EVP recordings, especially those recorded on devices which contain [[RLC circuit]]ry. These cases represent radio signals of voices or other sounds from broadcast sources.&lt;ref name="tipler"&gt;{{cite book | author= Paul Tipler| title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Electricity, Magnetism, Light, and Elementary Modern Physics (5th ed.) | publisher=W. H. Freeman | year=2004 | isbn=0-7167-0810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interference from [[citizens band radio|CB Radio transmissions]] and wireless baby monitors, or anomalies generated through [[cross modulation]] from other electronic devices, are all documented phenomena.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt; It is even possible for [[Crystal radio|circuits]] to [[resonance|resonate]] without any internal power source by means of [[radio receiver|radio reception]].&lt;ref name="tipler"/&gt;

''Capture errors'' are anomalies created by the method used to capture audio signals, such as noise generated through the over-amplification of a signal at the point of recording.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="signal"&gt;Smith, Steven W. (2002) ''Digital Signal Processing - A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists'', Newnes, {{ISBN|0-7506-7444-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital artifact|Artifacts]] created during attempts to boost the clarity of an existing recording might explain some EVP.  Methods include re-sampling, frequency isolation, and noise reduction or enhancement, which can cause recordings to take on qualities significantly different from those that were present in the original recording.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gentile&gt;[[James Randi|Randi, James]] (2006-06-09), ''[http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-06/060906just.html#i1 Just Where is Lou Gentile?],&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first EVP recordings may have originated from the use of tape recording equipment with poorly aligned erasure and recording heads, resulting in the incomplete erasure of previous audio recordings on the tape. This could allow a small percentage of previous content to be superimposed or mixed into a new 'silent' recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/may97/analysinganalogue.html?print=yes|title=More Past SOS Articles coming... -|website=www.soundonsound.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925190009/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/may97/analysinganalogue.html?print=yes|archivedate=2012-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- Original research?

====Sporadic meteors and meteor showers====

For all radio transmissions above 30&amp;nbsp;MHz (which are not reflected by the ionosphere) there is a possibility of meteor reflection of the radio signal.&lt;ref name="Harvey&amp;Bohlman"&gt;P Harvey &amp; KJ Bohlman. Stereo radio F.M. Handbook, Chapter 7, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Meteors leave a trail of ionised particles and electrons as they pass through the upper atmosphere (a process called ablation) which reflect transmission radio waves which would usually flow into space.&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;L.A. Manning et al., Determination of ionospheric electron distribution, Proc Inst Radio Engineers Vol 37, pp599-603 (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; These reflected waves are from transmitters which are below the horizon of the received meteor reflection.  In Europe this means the brief scattered wave may carry a foreign voice which can interfere with radio receivers.  Meteor reflected radio waves last between 0.05 seconds and 1 second, depending on the size of the meteor.&lt;ref name="Lovell"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.B.C.

==Organizations that show interest in EVP==
There are a number of organizations dedicated to studying EVP and instrumental transcommunication, or which otherwise express interest in the subject. Individuals within these organizations may participate in investigations, author books or journal articles, deliver presentations, and hold conferences where they share experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atransc.org/resources/aaevp_conference.html|title=2006 AA-EVP Conference - ATransC|date=14 September 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140809174644/http://atransc.org/resources/aaevp_conference.html|archivedate=9 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition organizations exist which dispute the validity of the phenomena on scientific grounds.&lt;ref name=Gentile/&gt;

==Cultural impact==
The concept of EVP has influenced popular culture. It is popular as an entertaining pursuit, as in [[ghost hunting]], and as a means of dealing with grief. It has influenced literature, radio, film, television, and music.

=== Groups ===
Investigation of EVP is the subject of hundreds of regional and national groups and Internet message boards.&lt;ref name=AZC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/pop/articles/0310ghosthunter10.html |title=Ghost hunters in search of the paranormal |accessdate=2007-09-21 |last=Schlesinger |first=Victoria |date=2005-03-10 |publisher=AZCentral.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCARE"&gt;" {{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-supernatural_28met.ART.North.Edition1.3ef5d91.html |title=Paranormal investigators not afraid to scare up some ghosts |accessdate=2007-09-21 |last=Appleton |first=Roy |date=2006-10-28 |work=The Dallas Morning News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023839/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-supernatural_28met.ART.North.Edition1.3ef5d91.html |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paranormal investigator [[John Zaffis]] claims, "There's been a boom in ghost hunting ever since the Internet took off." Investigators, equipped with electronic gear—like [[EMF meter]]s, video cameras, and audio recorders—scour reportedly [[list of reportedly haunted locations|haunted venues]], trying to uncover visual and audio evidence of [[ghost]]s. Many use portable recording devices in an attempt to capture EVP.&lt;ref name=AZC/&gt;

=== TV and radio ===
''[[Coast To Coast AM]]'' hosts [[George Noory]] and [[Art Bell]] have explored the topic of EVP with featured guests such as Brendan Cook and Barbara McBeath of the Ghost Investigators Society, and paranormal investigator and 'demonologist' Lou Gentile.&lt;ref name="CCAM0406"&gt;{{cite news | first=George | last=Noory | title=Demonology &amp; EVPs | date=2006-04-02 | publisher=Coast to Coast AM | url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2006/04/02.html | work= | pages= | accessdate=2007-09-19 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165223/http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2006/04/02.html | archivedate=2007-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CTCNoori"&gt;{{cite news | first=Art | last=Bell | title=Recorded Spirit Communications | date=2006-04-15 | publisher= | url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2006/04/15.html | work=Coast to Coast AM | pages= | accessdate=2007-09-19 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153946/http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2006/04/15.html | archivedate=2007-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spirit of [[John Lennon]]'', a pay-per-view [[seance]] broadcast in 2006, in which TV crew members, a [[psychic]], and an "expert in paranormal activity" claim the spirit of former Beatle John Lennon made contact with them through what was described as "an Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP)."&lt;ref name="BBCLen"&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| title=TV psychics claim Lennon contact| date=2006-04-25| publisher=| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4941490.stm| work=BBC News| pages=| accessdate=2007-09-19| language=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622013451/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4941490.stm| archivedate=2006-06-22| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Novels ===
''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'', a 1983 novel by [[William Peter Blatty]], contains a subplot where Dr. Vincent Amfortas, a terminally ill neurologist, leaves a "to-be-opened-upon-my-death" letter for Lt. Kinderman detailing his accounts of contact with the dead, including the doctor's recently deceased wife, Ann, through EVP recordings. Amfortas' character and the EVP subplot do not appear in the film version of the novel, ''[[The Exorcist III]]'', although in Kinderman's dream dead people are seen trying to communicate with the living by radio.

In ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'', a 2003 novel by [[William Gibson]], the main character's mother tries to convince her that her father is communicating with her from recordings after his death/disappearance in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].'

=== Theater and music ===
In ''[[Nyctivoe]]'' a 2001 vampire-inspired play by [[Dimitris Lyacos]] the male character as well as his deceased companion are speaking from a recording device amidst a static/white noise background.

In ''[[With the people from the bridge]]'', a 2014 play by [[Dimitris Lyacos]] based on the idea of the return of the dead, the voice of the female character NCTV is transmitted from a television monitor amidst a static/white noise background.

EVP is the subject of [[Vyktoria Pratt Keating]]'s song "Disembodied Voices on Tape" from her 2003 album ''Things that Fall from the Sky'', produced by [[Andrew Giddings]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].

[[Laurie Anderson]]'s "Example #22", from her 1981 album ''[[Big Science (Laurie Anderson album)|Big Science]],'' interposes spoken sentences and phrases in German with sung passages in English representing EVP.

During the outro to "Rubber Ring" by [[The Smiths]], a sample from an EVP recording is repeated. The phrase "You are sleeping, you do not want to believe," is a 'translation' of the 'spirit voices' from a 1970s flexitape. The original recording is from the 1971 record which accompanied Raudive's book 'Breakthrough', and which was re-issued as a flexi-disc in the 1980s free with The Unexplained magazine.

[[Bass Communion]]'s 2004 album [[Ghosts on Magnetic Tape]] was inspired by EVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/back-catalogue-bass-communions-ghosts-on-magnetic-tape-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816045630/http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/back-catalogue-bass-communions-ghosts-on-magnetic-tape-2/ |archivedate=2016-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band Giles Corey, founded by Dan Barrett composed a song called 'Empty Churches' which features track 2 called 'Raymond Cass', track 36 called 'Justified Theft' and track 38 called 'Tramping' from the album An Introduction to EVP by The Ghost Orchid which features excerpts from different EVP experiments produced by many researchers, although most are unknown, some have been pointed out to be more known researchers who studied EVP recordings including Friedrich Jurgenson, Raymond Cass and Konstantin Raudive.

In 2017 in Poland was published music cd ′′′Katharsis (A Small Victory)′′′ of [[Teatr Tworzenia]] by [[Jarosław Pijarowski]] with background recorded used EVP recordings (second track - „Katharsis – Pandemonium”).

'''Emotional Freedom Techniques''' ('''EFT''') is a form of [[Intervention (counseling)|counseling intervention]] that draws on various theories of [[alternative medicine]] including [[acupuncture]], [[neuro-linguistic programming]], [[energy medicine]], and [[Thought Field Therapy]] (TFT).  It is best known through '''Gary Craig'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s ''EFT Handbook'', published in the late 1990s, and related books and workshops by a variety of teachers.  EFT and similar techniques are often discussed under the umbrella term "[[energy psychology]]".

Advocates claim that the technique may be used to treat a wide variety of physical and psychological disorders, and as a simple form of self-administered therapy.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{Cite book | title = EFT Manual | last = Craig | format = pdf | first = G | url = http://www.spiritual-web.com/downloads/eftmanual.pdf | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' describes the foundations of EFT as "a hodgepodge of concepts derived from a variety of sources, [primarily] the ancient Chinese philosophy of [[Qi|chi]], which is thought to be the 'life force' that flows throughout the body." The existence of this life force is "not empirically supported".&lt;ref name="csicop" /&gt;

EFT has no benefit as a therapy beyond the [[placebo effect]] or any known-effective psychological techniques that may be provided in addition to the purported "energy" technique.&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt; It is generally characterized as [[pseudoscience]] and it has not garnered significant support in clinical psychology.&lt;ref name=Delphi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guilford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Eft punkte.jpg|thumb|''EFT-tapping points''&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;]]
During a typical EFT session, the person will focus on a specific issue while tapping on "[[acupuncture point|end points of the body's energy meridians]]".

According to the EFT manual, the procedure consists of the participant rating the emotional intensity of their reaction on a [[Subjective Units of Distress Scale]] (SUDS) (a [[Likert scale]] for subjective measures of distress, calibrated 0-10) then repeating an orienting [[Affirmations (New Age)|affirmation]] while rubbing or tapping specific points on the body. Some practitioners incorporate eye movements or other tasks. The emotional intensity is then rescored and repeated until no changes are noted in the emotional intensity.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

==Mechanism==

Proponents of EFT and other similar treatments believe that tapping/stimulating acupuncture points provide the basis for significant improvement in psychological problems.&lt;ref name=Feinstein/&gt; However, the theory and mechanisms underlying the supposed effectiveness of EFT have "no evidentiary support" "in the entire history of the sciences of biology, anatomy, physiology, neurology, physics, or psychology." Researchers have described the theoretical model for EFT as "frankly bizarre" and "pseudoscientific."&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt;  One review noted that one of the highest quality studies found no evidence that the location of tapping points made any difference, and attributed effects to well-known psychological mechanisms, including distraction and breathing therapy.&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt;&lt;ref name="srmhp"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.srmhp.org/0201/emotional-freedom-technique.html | title=Assessment of the Emotional Freedom Technique |author1=Waite, Wendy L |author2=Holder, Mark D | journal=Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice | year=2003 | volume=2 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' argued that there is no plausible mechanism to explain how the specifics of EFT could add to its effectiveness, and they have been described as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and therefore [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="csicop"&gt;{{cite journal | accessdate = 2011-12-12 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/can_we_really_tap_our_problems_away_a_critical_analysis_of_thought_field_th/ | title=Can we really tap our problems away? |vauthors=Gaudiano BA, Herbert JD | journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | year=2000 | volume=24 | issue=4 | format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has not been found for the existence of [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]].&lt;ref name = Ernst&gt;{{cite book | last = Singh | first = S | authorlink = Simon Singh |author2=Ernst E |authorlink2=Edzard Ernst  | year = 2008 | title = [[Trick or Treatment|Trick or treatment: The undeniable facts about alternative medicine]] | isbn = 978-0-393-06661-6 | publisher = [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | pages = 39–90 | chapter = The Truth about Acupuncture | quote="Scientists are still unable to find a shred of evidence to support the existence of meridians or Ch'i" (p72), "The traditional principles of acupuncture are deeply flawed, as there is no evidence at all to demonstrate the existence of Ch'i or meridians" (p107)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research quality ==

EFT has no useful effect as a therapy beyond the placebo effect or any known-effective psychological techniques that may be used with the purported "energy" technique, but proponents of EFT have published material claiming otherwise. Their work, however, is flawed and hence unreliable: high-quality research has never confirmed that EFT is effective.&lt;ref name=Bakker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Gary M.|title=The current status of energy psychology: Extraordinary claims with less than ordinary evidence|journal=Clinical Psychologist|date=November 2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=91–99|doi=10.1111/cp.12020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 review found "methodological flaws" in research studies that had reported "small successes" for EFT and the related [[Tapas Acupressure Technique]]. The review concluded that positive results may be "attributable to well-known cognitive and behavioral techniques that are included with the energy manipulation. Psychologists and researchers should be wary of using such techniques, and make efforts to inform the public about the ill effects of therapies that advertise miraculous claims."&lt;ref name=McCaslin&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago) |date=June 2009 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=249–56 |title=A review of efficacy claims in energy psychology |author=McCaslin DL |pmid=22122622 |doi=10.1037/a0016025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 systematic review found that EFT was effective in reducing [[anxiety]] compared to controls, but also called for more research comparing its effectiveness to that of established treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Clond |first=Morgan |date=May 2016 |title=Emotional Freedom Techniques for Anxiety: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=204 |issue=5 |pages=388–395 |doi=10.1097/NMD.0000000000000483 |issn=1539-736X |pmid=26894319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

A [[Delphi method|Delphi]] poll of an expert panel of psychologists rated EFT on a scale describing how discredited EFT has been in the field of psychology.  On average, this panel found EFT had a score of 3.8 on a scale from 1.0 to 5.0, with 3.0 meaning "possibly discredited" and a 4.0 meaning "probably discredited."&lt;ref name=Delphi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norcross|first=John C.|author2=Koocher, Gerald P. |author3=Garofalo, Ariele |title=Discredited psychological treatments and tests: A Delphi poll.|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|date=1 January 2006|volume=37|issue=5|pages=515–522|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.37.5.515}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book examining pseudoscientific practices in psychology characterized EFT as one of a number of "fringe psychotherapeutic practices",&lt;ref name=Guilford&gt;{{cite book|first=Scott O. |last=Lilienfeld|title=Science and pseudoscience in clinical psychology|year=2003|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=1-57230-828-1|pages=2|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a psychiatry handbook states EFT has "all the hallmarks of [[pseudoscience]]".&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Semple|title=Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-969388-7|pages=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFT, along with its predecessor, Thought Field Therapy, has been dismissed with warnings to avoid their use by publications such as ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]''&lt;ref name=skepdic&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT)|url=http://www.skepdic.com/eft.html|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quackwatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Stephen|title=Mental Help: Procedures to Avoid|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/mentserv.html|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of EFT and other energy psychology therapies have been "particularly interested" in seeking "scientific credibility" despite the implausible proposed mechanisms for EFT.&lt;ref name = Bakker/&gt;  A 2008 review by energy psychology proponent David Feinstein concluded that energy psychology was a potential "rapid and potent treatment for a range of psychological conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=D|title=Energy psychology: A review of the preliminary evidence.|journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago, Ill.)|date=Jun 2008|volume=45|issue=2|pages=199–213|pmid=22122417|doi=10.1037/0033-3204.45.2.199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this work by Feinstein has been widely criticized. One review criticized Feinstein's methodology, noting he ignored several research papers that did not show positive effects of EFT, and that Feinstein did not disclose his [[conflict of interest]] as an owner of a website that sells energy psychology products such as books and seminars, contrary to the best practices of research publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pignotti|first=M|author2=Thyer, B|title=Some comments on "Energy psychology: A review of the evidence": Premature conclusions based on incomplete evidence?|journal=Psychotherapy (Chicago, Ill.)|date=Jun 2009|volume=46|issue=2|pages=257–61|pmid=22122623|doi=10.1037/a0016027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another review criticized Feinstein's conclusion, which was based on research of weak quality and instead concluded that any positive effects of EFT are due to the more traditional psychological techniques rather than any putative "energy" manipulation.&lt;ref name=McCaslin/&gt;  A book published on the subject of [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] treatment of substance abuse called Feinstein's review "incomplete and misleading" and an example of a poorly performed evidence-based review of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=editors|first=Katherine van Wormer, Bruce A.

Feinstein published another review in 2012, concluding that energy psychology techniques "consistently demonstrated strong effect sizes and other positive statistical results that far exceed chance after relatively few treatment sessions".&lt;ref name="Feinstein"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/gpr/16/4/364/ | title=Acupoint stimulation in treating psychological disorders: Evidence of efficacy | author=Feinstein, David | journal=Review of General Psychology |date=December 2012  | volume=16 | issue=4 | pages=364–380 | doi=10.1037/a0028602}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review was also criticized, where again it was noted that Feinstein dismissed higher quality studies which showed no effects of EFT, in favor of methodologically weaker studies which did show a positive effect.&lt;ref name=Bakker/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2537">'''Energy field disturbance''' is a [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] concept rooted in [[alternative medicine]]. Supporters of this concept believe it concerns the disruptance of a metaphysical [[Energy medicine|biofield]] that permeates the body, resulting in poor [[emotion]]al or [[Physiology|physiological]] health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metaphysicalinstitute.org/energy.html Human Energy Fields - Healing Methods&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept is often related to [[therapeutic touch]].&lt;ref name=NANDA/&gt;

== NANDA diagnosis and controversy ==
The [[North American Nursing Diagnosis Association]] (NANDA) previously recognized the diagnosis "Disturbed Energy Field" in 1994, prior to implementation of a rule requiring a minimum requirement by evidence in the literature prior to accepting a new diagnosis.  Later, NANDA has reported it received feedback questioning the validity of the diagnosis, including criticism from [[Scientific skepticism|skeptic]] [[James Randi]].  Based on this feedback, NANDA said it would reevaluate this diagnosis based on current scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=NANDA&gt;{{cite web|title=DEFINING THE KNOWLEDGE OF NURSING: Priorities for Terminology Development|url=http://www.nanda.org/DEFINING-THE-KNOWLEDGE-OF-NURSING-Priorities-for-Terminology-Development-_b_7.html|publisher=NANDA|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Disturbed Energy Field" was removed from the NANDA taxonomy in the 10th edition of ''Nursing Diagnoses: Definitions &amp; Classification 2015-2017'', with the explanation that "...all literature support currently provided for this diagnosis is regarding intervention rather than for the nursing diagnosis itself" (p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;ref&gt;NANDA International, Inc.

In [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[research]], '''expert elicitation''' is the synthesis of opinions of [[Experts|authorities]] of a subject where there is uncertainty due to insufficient [[data]] or when such data is unattainable because of physical constraints or lack of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van der Sluijs, et. al.|first1=Jeroen P.|title=Expert Elicitation: Methodological suggestions for its use in environmental health impact assessments|url=http://www.nusap.net/downloads/reports/Expert_Elicitation.pdf|website=NUSAP|accessdate=25 November 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expert elicitation is essentially a [[scientific consensus]] [[methodology]]. It is often used in the study of rare events. Expert elicitation allows for [[parametrization]], an "educated guess", for the respective topic under study. Expert elicitation generally [[Quantification (science)|quantifies]] [[uncertainty]].

Expert elicitation tends to be [[multidisciplinary]] as well as [[interdisciplinary]], with practically universal applicability, and is used in a broad range of fields. Prominent recent expert elicitation applications include [[climate change]], [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] [[seismic hazard]] and damage, association of [[tornado intensity and damage|tornado damage]] to [[wind speed]] in developing the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]], [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] for [[nuclear waste]] storage.

In performing expert elicitation certain factors need to be taken into consideration. The topic must be one for which there are people who have predictive expertise. Furthermore, the objective should be to obtain an experts' carefully considered judgment based on a systematic consideration of all relevant evidence. For this reason one should take care to adopt strategies designed to help the expert being interviewed to avoid overlooking relevant evidence. Additionally, vocabulary used should face intense scrutiny; qualitative uncertainty words such as "likely" and "unlikely" are not sufficient and can lead to confusion. Such words can mean very different things to different people, or to the same people in different situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tversky|first1=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Judgments under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases|date=27 September 1974|publisher=Science|pages=1124–1131|edition=Vol. 185, No. 4157|url=http://psiexp.ss.uci.edu/research/teaching/Tversky_Kahneman_1974.pdf|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1788">The '''Expression Atlas''' is a database that  provides information on [[gene expression]] patterns. The Expression Atlas allows searches by gene, [[Alternative splicing|splice variant]] and protein attribute. Individual genes or gene sets can be searched for. There are two components to the Expression Atlas, the Baseline Atlas and the Differential Atlas:

== Baseline Atlas ==
The Baseline Atlas provides information about which gene products are present (and at what abundance) under "normal" conditions. This component of the Expression Atlas consists of highly curated and quality-checked [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]] experiments from [[ArrayExpress]]. It aims to answer questions such as:

* Which genes are specifically expressed in kidney?
* What is the expression pattern for gene SAA4 in normal tissues?

== Differential Atlas ==
The Differential Atlas allows users to identify genes that are up- or down-regulated in different experimental conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">'''Homoeomeria''' was a doctrine in the philosophy of the ancient Greek [[Anaxagoras]], as claimed by the Roman [[atomist]] [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intellectual Property Protection of Fact-based Works: Copyright and Its Alternatives|page=110|first=Robert|last=Brauneis|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was assumed that the [[atoms]] constituting a [[Matter|substance]] must themselves have the salient observed properties of that substance: so atoms of [[water]] would be wet, atoms of [[iron]] would be hard, atoms of [[wool]] would be soft, etc. This doctrine depends on the [[fallacy of division]].

Professor [[Fleeming Jenkin]] wrote that: "we may with the exercise of a good deal of fancy see in the doctrine of homoeomeria, which taught that all things contained the materials of everything else in a latent state, a foreshadowing of the chemical theory which proves that our bodies are made of the same chemical materials as peas, cabbages, &amp;c., but it requires an elastic imagination to link the old and new creed together."&lt;ref&gt;''Memoir of Fleeming Jenkin'', by R. L. Stevenson. Papers by Fleeming Jenkin, edited by Sir Sidney Colvin, James Alfred Ewing. P. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consent To Research===

[[Consent to Research]] (CtR) is a project that provides a platform for people to donate their health data for the purposes of scientific research and the advancement of medicine. Since health data is restricted and expensive, this project provides people the opportunity to freely donate information that can only positively benefit medicine and patients at large.&lt;ref name="Consent to Research - About Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weconsent.us/about|title=Consent to Research - About Us|publisher=Consent to Research|accessdate=2012-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629212121/http://weconsent.us/about|archivedate=2012-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consent to Research is connected to the Access2Research project, which aims to free access over the Internet to scientific journal articles that are already taxpayer-funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://access2research.org/about|title=Access2Research - About Us|publisher=Access2Research|accessdate=2013-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524034409/http://access2research.org/about|archive-date=2012-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilbanks founded the project in 2011 and gave a TED Global talk about the project in 2012.&lt;ref name="TED Blog - Unreasonable people unite: John Wilbanks at [[TED Global Conference|TED Global]] 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/2012/06/29/unreasonable-people-unite-john-wilbanks-at-tedglobal-2012/|title=TED Blog - Unreasonable people unite: John Wilbanks at TED Global 2012|publisher=TED|accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kvant''''' ({{lang-ru|Квант}} for "[[quantum]]") is a [[popular science]] [[magazine]] in [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] for school students and teachers, issued since 1970 in [[Soviet Union]] and continued in [[Russia]]. Translation of selected articles from ''Kvant'' had been published in ''[[Quantum Magazine]]'' in 1990–2001, which in turn had been translated and published in [[Greece]] in 1994–2001.&lt;ref name="greek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ph403.edu.physics.uoc.gr/quantum.php |title=Quantum (Greek) |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
Kvant was started as a joint project of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]] and USSR Academy of Pedagogical Sciences. In Soviet time, it was published by [[Nauka (publisher)|Nauka]] publisher with circulation about 200,000.

A '''Lariat chain''' is a loop of chain that hangs off, and is spun by a wheel. It is often used as a science exhibit or a toy. 

The original [http://normantuck.com/catalogPages/lariat.html '''Lariat Chain'''] was created in 1986 by [http://www.normantuck.com Norman Tuck], as an Artist-in-Residence project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/xref/exhibits/lariat_chain.html |title=Exhibit Cross Reference - Lariat Chain |publisher=Exploratorium.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco. 

'''Lariat Chain''' was developed from an earlier Tuck piece entitled '''Chain Reaction''' (1984). '''Chain Reaction''' was hand cranked, and utilized a heavy chain attached by magnets onto an iron flywheel. As in '''Lariat Chain''', '''Chain Reaction''' used a brush to disrupt the motion of the traveling chain.  

The speed of the chain is arranged to equal the [[group velocity|wave speed]] of [[transverse wave]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transverse and Longitudinal Waves|url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/tralon.html|website = hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that waves moving against the motion of the chain appear to be standing still.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploratorium.edu/cmp/exnet/exhibits/group2/lariat/index.html Exploratorium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005233508/http://www.exploratorium.edu/cmp/exnet/exhibits/group2/lariat/index.html |date=2008-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normantuck.com/catalogPages/lariat.html normantuck.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of an topical guide to academic disciplines:

An '''academic discipline''' or '''field of study''' is known as a branch of [[knowledge]]. It is [[education|taught]] as an accredited part of [[higher education]]. A scholar's discipline is commonly defined and recognized by a [[faculty (division)|university faculties.]] That person will be accredited by [[learned society|learned societies]] to which he or she belongs along with the [[academic journal]]s in which he or she publishes. However, no formal criteria exist for defining an academic discipline.

Disciplines varies between universities and programs. These discipline will have well-defined rosters of journals and conferences supported by a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, that are called sub-disciplines.

There is no consensus on how some academic disciplines should be classified (e.g., whether [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] are disciplines of [[social science]]s or fields within the [[humanities]]). More generally, the proper criteria for organizing knowledge into disciplines are also open to debate.

{{italic title}}
'''''Little Science, Big Science''''' is a book of collected lectures given by [[Derek J. De Solla Price]], first published in 1963. The book presents the 1962 [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] Pegram Lectures, a series of lectures dedicated to discussing science and its place in society. Price's goal in the lectures is to outline what it may look like for science to be analysed scientifically, by applying methods of measuring, hypothesizing, and deriving to science itself. With this goal in mind, he sets out to define quasi-mathematically how the shape and size of science has shifted from "small science" to "big science" in a historical and sociological way. Price presents a quantification of science as a measurable entity via an analogy to thermodynamics, conceptualizing science like a gas with individual molecules possessing individual velocities and interactions, a total volume, and general properties or laws.

== Prologue to a Science of Science ==
Price begins the lectures by setting forth a demarcation in science centered around the modern period. He describes the phenomenon that, at the time of the lectures, 80 to 90 percent of important scientific work had occurred in one normal human life span.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Little Science, Big Science|last=de Solla Price|first=Derek J.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this facet in mind, he sets out to describe the development of the term "Big Science," as coined by Alvin M. Weinberg in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinberg|first=Alvin M.|date=|title=Impact of Large-Scale Science on the United States|url=|journal=Science|volume=134|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a general directive, he seeks to show that the transition from "Little Science" to "[[Big Science]]," specifically the socio-economic and methodological changes to science in the 20th century, have been mostly gradual. To illustrate this point, he presents empirical statistical evidence from various aspects and fields of science, all of which show that the mode of growth of science is exponential, growing at compound interest. This assertion Price claims is the "fundamental law of any analysis of science," stating that it even holds accurately over long time periods. With this fundamental law in mind, he states that for general measures the size of science in manpower or number of publications doubles in size every 10 to 15 years. If this rate of expansion is considered broadly, then from the 1600s until now such size measures of science have increased by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this observation, Price moves to describe the "coefficient of immediacy:" the number of scientists alive compared to the number of scientists who have ever been, a ratio or percentage he states as 7:8 and 87.5% respectively. This measure serves to show numerically how the majority of important science has taken place within the average human life span at the time of the lecture presentation. As a result of the consistent exponential growth rate and immediacy of science, the statement that the majority of scientists throughout history are alive at any given moment must be consistent throughout history as well, meaning that in 1700 the majority of all scientists ever were alive, true also for 1800 and 1900 and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this facet, Price states that science has been constantly exploding into the population, increasing its size at a rate faster than the increase of total humans able to conduct it.

However, Price asserts that this exponential growth rate cannot simply explain the transition from "Little Science" to "Big Science," as the constant growth would not make the modern period under question any more likely to produce "Big Science" than any other. He conjectures that two statistical phenomena hold true for science generally, that individual metrics of science may grow at rates different from that of the exponential growth, and that the exponential growth rate may be starting to diminish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his second point, he claims that the normal exponential growth may give way to a logistic growth rate, growing exponentially until it reaches a maximum size and then ceasing to grow. The possibility that science follows a rate of growth modeled by a logistic curve is suggested further by the fact that if science had continued to grow at an exponential rate in 1962, then by now there would be more scientists than people. With his claim that the growth rate actually observes a logistic curve, he provides a second basic law of the analysis of science, namely that the exponential growth rates previously mentioned must be in fact logistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this claim is correct, then the exponential growth rate previously observed must break down at a point in the future, and Price implies as a conclusion to this section that the onset of this breakdown may be associated with an upper bound to the size of science brought on by "Big Science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Galton Revisited ==
In this chapter, Price suggests various ideas and methods about conducting a science of science, or [[scientometrics]], by first narrating some peculiar contributions to statistics made by [[Francis Galton]]. His overall goal is to further the possibility of applying scientific methods to science itself by suggesting various metrics and measures of the size, growth rate, and distribution of science. He focuses on Galton's work concerning the distribution of high achieving scientists and statesmen in the upper echelons of British society, specifically ''Hereditary Genius''  and ''English Men of Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works are reviewed with the goal of understanding a basic metric for the number of people or papers in science that reach different levels of quality, an idea basic in Price's formulation of scientometrics. Further, he suggests that understanding such a metric would allow predictions to be made of science and scientists when changes associated with Big Science arrive. Galton's original approach was to estimate the distribution of high achieving practitioners of science among the eminent parts of British society, and Price takes this as a starting step in grasping a scientific metric of the productivity of science. In analyzing Galton's work and the work of another statistics researcher, Alfred J. Lotka, Price suggests that there may be a rough inverse-square law of productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price moves next to define a quantity he calls someone's "solidness" ''s'', as the logarithm of the total papers published in one scientist's life. Keeping in mind the previous productivity law, for each unit increase in a scientist's solidness, the total number of scientists of that solidness decreases at a constant rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these two observations, among others, Price asserts that the foundations for an econometric-like study of science have been suggested, with the analysis of time series suggesting exponential or logistic growth and the distribution law of scientific productivity comprising them. He concludes by suggesting that these distributions and analyses contain errors relating to the non-uniform distribution of scientists across populations, noting that they tend to congregate in certain fields, institutions, countries, and journals. In keeping with his gas analogy, he maintains that just as one cannot measure the exact positions and velocities of gas molecules, one cannot pinpoint the exact productivity or contribution levels of individual scientists within science.

== Invisible Colleges and the Affluent Scientific Commuter ==
This chapter serves multiple purposes but overall achieves the same goal as the previous, providing a further conception of the productivity measure in science. This conclusion is reached through defining historically, sociologically, and from a communications perspective what a scientific paper is for, specifically what the purpose of this form of scientific communication is. To begin this analysis, he begins by looking at the history of the scientific paper, tracing its original purpose to discovering what was of interest within scientific practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of this scientific social practice, seen not as a means of publishing new knowledge but of communication between practitioners, the process of situating papers within the general body of literature came in to play. Specifically, each scientific paper is built from the foundation created by all previous papers, and with this facet exists a possibility of quantifying this foundation, the citation of references.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Little Science, Big Science, and Beyond|last=de Solla Price|first=Derek J.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=New York|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Solla Price|first=Derek|date=|title=Networks of Scientific Papers|url=|journal=Science|volume=149|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the idea that scientific papers were a social device of scientific communication, Price suggests that the driving force behind their emergent usage was the ability to assert and claim intellectual property within science. The possibility of communicating priority in disputes over scientific discoveries promoted the scientific paper as the best means of communication, leaving the information dissemination quality of papers as incidental in their overall purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|date=|title=Priorities in Scientific Discovery: a chapter in the sociology of science|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=22|pages=635|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the quantification of scientific productivity by citation number and rate, there arrives a metric in science that gives the scientific importance of an individual's work or journal as its total usage within scientific practice, its total citations or references in other papers or journals. With this in mind, Price observes the fact that the total number of scientific references at a specific date across science is proportional to the total literature available within science at that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving from the ability of scientific papers to facilitate communication and interactions between scientists, Price outlines an idea that allows further maximization of interactions between scientists. His term for this organizational method is the "invisible college," specifically the circuit of institutions, research centers, journals, and conferences that allow intermingling and interactions within specific fields of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of scientists naturally form as a result of collaborations between individuals focusing on similar problems, but the ability for researchers to move around the globe in order to achieve interpersonal relationships with their fellow researchers is what Price suggests maximizes the group size able to keep up regular productive interactions. Thus Price defines the sociological structure of scientific practice communicating through published papers.

== Political Strategy for Big Scientists ==
The final section of the lectures focuses on a larger-picture analysis of science and the monetary trends within it. As a general first statement, Price proposes that the cost of science has been increasing proportional to the square of the number of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that the cost of research in terms of the GDP did not increase in the years preceding World War II, yet afterward began increasing at the rate previously mentioned. As research amounts increase, the current and necessary number of researchers increases, promoting the inducement of scientists with higher salaries and better facilities in turn increasing the overall costs of science. Price suggests that it is this feedback loop that is a potential decelerator for the growth of science, and the main difference between Little Science and Big Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; What follows is his analysis of the "explosion of science" within non-developed countries, specifically [[Japan]]. He shows through this analysis that the United States' lack of experience of this explosion of science within the 20th century up to this point is due to the saturation of society with the activities of science, nearing costs not maintainable by the country. In countries where science has yet reached an exponential growth curve, this saturation is not present which allows the growth rate to set out at an exponential pace.

The final conceptual measure that Price offers is the idea of the "mavericity" of a scientist, or the likelihood that an individual will test new and unique combinations of theories and experiments unexpected in the current literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science|last=Price|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactions and interactions within science to this mavericity also characterizes Big Science over Little Science, where the former serves to limit and restrain the most maverick investigators due to collaborative work and specific directed goals for scientific research. Thus the emergence of Big Science not only influences the growth rate, connectedness, and significance of science, but also the individual facets of the scientific pursuit.

The '''Mermaid Theatre''' was a theatre encompassing the site of [[Puddle Dock]] and [[Worshipful Company of Curriers|Curriers' Alley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/LONDON-COMPANYS/2000-08/0967625368 www.ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] in the [[City of London]], and the first built in the City since the time of [[Shakespeare]]. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.

==History==
The 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor [[Bernard Miles]] with his wife, [[Josephine Wilson]]. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the [[St. John's Wood]] area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' with [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Maggie Teyte]] and [[Thomas Hemsley]], conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McArthur |first=Edwin |date=1965 |title=Flagstad, A Personal Memoir |publisher=A. A. Knopf |location=New York |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, and his revenues from publicity spots for the [[Egg Marketing Board]]; he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the [[Jacobean era]], to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by [[Philip Rosseter]] with distant backing from [[Philip Henslowe|Henslowe]] and [[Edward Alleyn|Alleyn]], was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of ''[[Lock Up Your Daughters (musical)|Lock Up Your Daughters]]'' and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as ''[[Cowardy Custard]]'' (often cited{{who|date=October 2015}} as responsible for the revival of interest in [[Noël Coward]]'s works) and including an annual staging of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', with Miles reprising his role of [[Long John Silver]], which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 February 1991 |title=The life and stage of Josephine Wilson – One of the founders of the Molecule Club |first=Donald |last=Gould|work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12917556-900-forum-the-life-and-stage-of-josephine-wilson-one-of-the-founders-of-the-molecule-club/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1961 the poet and author [[Sylvia Plath]] read her poem "Tulips" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, [[Ted Hughes]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Other notable productions include the 1978 première of ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway?]]'', with [[Tom Conti]] and [[Rona Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/10250854/Rona-Anderson.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Obituary: Rona Anderson | date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] sometimes transferred Stratford productions to the Mermaid, including a residency during 1987 which saw the staging of seven plays.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn2.rsc.org.uk/sitefinity/press-resources/performance-history---june-2016.pdf?sfvrsn=8&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the [[Johnson Matthey]] bank collapse.&lt;ref name="Offstage drama at the Mermaid"&gt;{{cite news |first= Charles|last= Neviin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/captain-moonlight-offstage-drama-at-the-mermaid-1466921.html |title= Captain Moonlight: Offstage drama at the Mermaid|publisher=The Independent|access-date= 11 April 2018 |location=London |date= 12 December 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthaboutlloyds.com/fraud/myth85.html |title=Not a Myth of Hindsight: 1085 |website=Truth About Lloyds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19891101&amp;id=jEVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1612,32433 |title=Prison for millionaire who lied |work=Glasgow Herald |date=1 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

After a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 [[Ken Livingstone]], the [[Mayor of London]], ordered the council to block the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mayor gives theatre a lifeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2939777.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, ''[[Friday Night is Music Night]]'' that showcased musicians such as the violinist [[Nigel Kennedy]] and singer [[Josh Groban]]. In 2006, music duo [[Pet Shop Boys]] played a mid-length set accompanied by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled [[Concrete (Pet Shop Boys album)|Concrete]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Loss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans==
In September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the [[Theatres Trust]] and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt; granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer £6 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/18/arts.artsnews | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Ward | title=Manchester theatre eyes Mermaid | date=2003-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners were concerned that the entire building might be demolished.&lt;ref name="Outrage"&gt;{{cite web |first= Lalayn |last= Baluch |date= 30 September 2008 |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/21927/campaigners-outraged-as-city-of-london|title=Outrage as Mermaid Theatre developer released from £6m donation deal |website= [[The Stage]] |accessdate= 11 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former chairman of the Save London's Theatres Campaign, John Levitt, called the decision “a tragedy” and “sheer meanness”.&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt;

In 2018 the Mermaid Theatre still exists as a conference centre called The Mermaid London.

[[Image:Planisphæri cœleste.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A celestial map from the 17th century, by the Dutch cartographer Frederik de Wit]]

'''Natural philosophy''' or '''philosophy of nature''' (from [[Latin]] ''philosophia naturalis'') was the [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[nature]] and the physical [[universe]] that was dominant before the development of [[modern science]].  It is considered to be the precursor of [[natural science]].

From the ancient world, starting with [[Aristotle]], to the 19th century, the term "natural philosophy" was the common term used to describe the practice of studying nature. It was in the 19th century that the concept of "science" received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as "biology" and "biologist", "physics" and "physicist" among other technical fields and titles; institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred.&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan |editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0226089282}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Newton]]'s book ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687), whose title translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", reflects the then-current use of the words "natural philosophy", akin to "systematic study of nature". Even in the 19th century, a treatise by [[Lord Kelvin]] and [[Peter Guthrie Tait]], which helped define much of modern physics, was titled ''[[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]]'' (1867).

In the [[German philosophy|German tradition]], ''Naturphilosophie'' (philosophy of nature) persisted into the 18th and 19th century as an attempt to achieve a speculative unity of [[nature]] and [[spirit]]. Some of the greatest names in German philosophy are associated with this movement, including [[Goethe]], [[Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]. ''Naturphilosophie'' was associated with Romanticism and a view that regarded the natural world as a kind of giant organism, as opposed to the philosophical approach of figures such as [[John Locke]] and [[Isaac Newton]] who espoused a more mechanical view of the world, regarding it as being like a machine.

==Origin and evolution of the term==
The term ''natural philosophy'' preceded our current ''[[natural science]]'' (i.e. empirical science). Empirical science historically developed out of [[philosophy]] or, more specifically, natural philosophy. Natural philosophy was distinguished from the other precursor of modern science, [[natural history]], in that natural philosophy involved reasoning and explanations about nature (and after [[Galileo]], [[quantitative property|quantitative]] reasoning), whereas natural history was essentially [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] and descriptive.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, natural philosophy was one of many branches of philosophy, but was not a specialized field of study. The first person appointed as a specialist in Natural Philosophy ''per se'' was [[Jacopo Zabarella]], at the [[University of Padua]] in 1577.

Modern meanings of the terms ''science'' and ''scientists'' date only to the 19th century. Before that, ''science'' was a synonym for ''knowledge'' or ''study'', in keeping with its Latin origin. The term gained its modern meaning when [[experiment]]al science and the [[scientific method]] became a specialized branch of study apart from natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;The naturalist-theologian [[William Whewell]] coined the word "[[scientist]]"; his earliest written use identified by the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' was in 1834.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-19th century, when it became increasingly unusual for scientists to contribute to both [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], "natural philosophy" came to mean just ''physics'', and the word is still used in that sense in degree titles at the [[University of Oxford]]{{Citation needed|reason=See talk page|date=October 2018}}. In general, chairs of Natural Philosophy established long ago at the oldest universities are nowadays occupied mainly by physics professors. Isaac Newton's book ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687), whose title translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", reflects the then-current use of the words "natural philosophy", akin to "systematic study of nature". Even in the 19th century, a treatise by [[Lord Kelvin]] and Peter Guthrie Tait, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled ''[[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]]'' (1867).

[[Greek philosophers]] defined it as the combination of beings living in the universe, ignoring things made by humans.&lt;ref name=MorenoMuñoz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org:80/educacion/9/Usr/ibjoa/Filos/tema1.html#NAT |title=Historia de la filosofía (C.O.U.) - Tema 1 |last=Moreno Muñoz |first=Miguel |date=20 September 1998 |access-date=28 June 2018 |work=Gobierno de Canarias |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923234739/http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org:80/educacion/9/Usr/ibjoa/Filos/tema1.html#NAT |archive-date=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other definition refers to [[human nature]].&lt;ref name=MorenoMuñoz/&gt;

==Scope==
In [[Plato]]'s earliest known dialogue, ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'' distinguishes between ''science'' or bodies of knowledge that produce a physical result, and those that do not.  Natural philosophy has been categorized as a theoretical rather than a practical branch of philosophy (like ethics).  Sciences that guide arts and draw on the philosophical knowledge of nature may produce practical results, but these subsidiary sciences (e.g., architecture or medicine) go beyond natural philosophy.

The study of natural philosophy seeks to explore the cosmos by any means necessary to understand the universe.  Some ideas presuppose that change is a reality.  Although this may seem obvious, there have been some philosophers who have denied the concept of metamorphosis, such as Plato's predecessor [[Parmenides]] and later Greek philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]], and perhaps some Eastern philosophers. [[George Santayana]], in his ''Scepticism and Animal Faith,'' attempted to show that the reality of change cannot be proven.  If his reasoning is sound, it follows that to be a physicist, one must restrain one's skepticism enough to trust one's senses, or else rely on [[anti-realism]].

[[René Descartes]]' [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] system of [[mind–body dualism]] describes two kinds of substance: matter and mind. According to this system, everything that is "matter" is [[determinism|deterministic]] and natural&amp;mdash;and so belongs to natural philosophy&amp;mdash;and everything that is "mind" is [[free will|volitional]] and non-natural, and falls outside the domain of philosophy of nature.

==Branches and subject matter==
Major branches of natural philosophy include [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], the study of nature on the grand scale; [[etiology]], the study of (intrinsic and sometimes extrinsic) [[cause]]s; the study of [[Chance (philosophy)|chance]], probability and randomness; the study of [[chemical element|element]]s; the study of the [[Infinity|infinite]] and the unlimited (virtual or actual); the study of [[matter]]; [[mechanics]], the study of translation of [[Philosophy of motion|motion and change]]; the study of [[nature]] or the various sources of actions; the study of natural [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]]; the study of physical [[quantity|quantities]]; the study of relations between physical entities; and the [[philosophy of space and time]]. (Adler, 1993)

== History ==
{{for|the history of natural philosophy prior to the 17th century|History of physics|History of chemistry|History of astronomy}}

Humankind's mental engagement with nature certainly predates civilization and the record of history. Philosophical, and specifically non-religious thought about the natural world, goes back to ancient Greece. These lines of thought began before Socrates, who turned from his philosophical studies from speculations about nature to a consideration of man, viz., political philosophy. The thought of early philosophers such [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Democritus]] centered on the natural world. In addition, three presocratic philosophers who lived in the Ionian town of Miletus (hence the [[Milesian School]] of philosophy,) [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], attempted to explain natural phenomena without recourse to  creation [[myth]]s involving the [[Greek gods]]. They were called the ''physikoi'' (natural philosophers,) or, as Aristotle referred to them, the ''physiologoi''. Plato followed Socrates in concentrating on man. It was Plato's student, Aristotle, who, in basing his thought on the natural world, returned empiricism to its primary place, while leaving room in the world for man.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Crowe, ''Mechanics from Aristotle to Einstein'' (Santa Fe, NM: Green Lion Press, 2007), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] observes that Aristotle was the originator of conception of nature that prevailed in the Middle Ages into the modern era:

{{Quote |The ''Physics'' is a lecture in which he seeks to determine [[Substance theory|beings]] that arise on their own, [[Natural kind|τὰ φύσει ὄντα]], with regard to their [[Ontology|being]]. Aristotelian "physics" is different from what we mean today by this word, not only to the extent that it belongs to antiquity whereas the modern physical sciences belong to [[modernity]], rather above all it is different by virtue of the fact that [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotle's "physics"]] is philosophy, whereas modern physics is a [[Positivism|positive]] science that presupposes a [[Philosophy of science|philosophy]].... This book determines the warp and woof of the whole of Western thinking, even at that place where it, as modern thinking, appears to think at odds with ancient thinking. But opposition is invariably {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a decisive, and often even perilous, dependence. Without Aristotle's ''Physics'' there would have been no Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Principle of Reason'', trans. Reginald Lilly, (Indiana University Press, 1991),  62-[https://books.google.com/books?id=rWDUmlA6M98C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 63].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', books I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |Plato's world of eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]], imperfectly represented in matter by a divine [[Demiurge|Artisan]], contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic ''[[Weltanschauungen]]'', of which [[atomism]] was, by the fourth century at least, the most prominent… This debate was to persist throughout the ancient world. Atomistic mechanism got a shot in the arm from [[Epicurus]]… while the [[Stoics]] adopted a [[Teleological argument|divine teleology]]…  The choice seems simple: either show how a structured, regular world could arise out of undirected processes, or inject intelligence into the system. This was how Aristotle… when still a young acolyte of Plato, saw matters. [[Cicero]]… preserves Aristotle's own [[Allegory of the cave|cave-image]]: if [[Troglodytae|troglodytes]] were brought on a sudden into the upper world, they would immediately suppose it to have been intelligently arranged. But Aristotle grew to abandon this view; although he believes in a divine being, the [[Unmoved mover|Prime Mover]] is not the [[efficient cause]] of action in the Universe, and plays no part in constructing or arranging it... But, although he rejects the divine Artificer, Aristotle does not resort to a pure mechanism of random forces. Instead he seeks to find a middle way between the two positions, one which relies heavily on the notion of Nature, or ''[[phusis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R. J. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-924656-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwfy-n5IWL8C |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"The world we inhabit is an orderly one, in which things generally behave in predictable ways, Aristotle argued, because every natural object has a "nature"—an attribute (associated primarily with form) that makes the object behave in its customary fashion..."&lt;ref name="Lindberg BWS 2007"&gt;David C. Lindberg, ''The Beginnings of Western Science'', University of Chicago Press, 2007, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle recommended [[four causes]] as appropriate for the business of the natural philosopher, or physicist, “and if he refers his problems back to all of them, he will assign the ‘why’ in the way proper to his science—the matter, the form, the mover, [and] ‘that for the sake of which’”. While the vagaries of the material cause are subject to circumstance, the formal, efficient and final cause often coincide because in natural kinds, the mature form and [[Teleology|final cause]] are one and the same. The [[Potentiality and actuality|capacity]] to mature into a specimen of one's kind is directly acquired from “the primary source of motion”, i.e., from one's father, whose seed (''sperma'') conveys the essential nature (common to the species), as a hypothetical ''ratio''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' II.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Material cause  : An object's motion will behave in different ways depending on the [substance/essence] from which it is made. (Compare clay, steel, etc.)
; Formal cause    : An object's motion will behave in different ways depending on its material arrangement. (Compare a clay sphere, clay block, etc.)
; Efficient cause : That which caused the object to come into being; an "agent of change" or an "agent of movement". &lt;!--(Consider )--&gt;
; Final cause     : The reason that caused the object to be brought into existence. &lt;!--(Consider)--&gt;&lt;!--Not a good example?: a seed that becomes a tree.)--&gt;

&lt;!--False!: Science has always been a systematic knowledge of causes. --&gt;From the late Middle Ages into the modern era, the tendency has been to narrow "science" to the consideration of efficient or agency-based causes of a particular kind:&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Dodds, "Science, Causality and Divine Action: Classical Principles for Contemporary Challenges," ''CTNS Bulletin'' 21:1 [2001].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |The action of an efficient cause may sometimes, but not always, be described in terms of quantitative force. The action of an artist on a block of clay, for instance, can be described in terms of how many pounds of pressure per square inch is exerted on it. The efficient causality of the teacher in directing the activity of the artist, however, cannot be so described…

The final cause acts on the agent to influence or induce her to act. If the artist works "to make money," making money is in some way the cause of her action. But we cannot describe this influence in terms of quantitative force. The final cause acts, but it acts according to the mode of final causality, as an end or good that induces the efficient cause to act. The mode of causality proper to the final cause cannot itself be reduced to efficient causality, much less to the mode of efficient causality we call "force."&lt;ref&gt;Dodds 2001, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Medieval philosophy of motion===
Medieval thoughts on motion involved much of Aristotle's works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''. The issue that medieval philosophers had with motion was the inconsistency found between book 3 of ''Physics'' and book 5 of ''Metaphysics''. Aristotle claimed in book 3 of ''Physics'' that motion can be categorized by substance, quantity, quality, and place. where in book 5 of ''Metaphysics'' he stated that motion is a magnitude of quantity. This disputation led to some important questions to natural philosophers: Which category/categories does motion fit into? Is motion the same thing as a terminus? Is motion separate from real things? These questions asked by medieval philosophers tried to classify motion.&lt;ref name="Murdoch and Sylla 1978"/&gt;

William Ockham gives a good concept of motion for many people in the Middle Ages. There is an issue with the vocabulary behind motion which makes people think that there is a correlation between nouns and the qualities that make nouns. Ockham states that this distinction is what will allow people to understand motion, that motion is a property of mobiles, locations, and forms and that is all that is required to define what motion is. A famous example of this is [[Occam's razor]] which simplifies vague statements by cutting them into more descriptive examples. "Every motion derives from an agent." becomes "each thing that is moved, is moved by an agent" this makes motion a more personal quality referring to individual objects that are moved.&lt;ref name="Murdoch and Sylla 1978"&gt;John E. Murdoch and Edith D. Sylla ''Science in The Middle Ages:The Science of Motion'' (1978) University of Chicago Press p. 213-222&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle's philosophy of nature===
:::"An acorn is potentially, but not actually, an oak tree. In becoming an oak tree, it becomes actually what it originally was only potentially. This change thus involves passage from potentiality to actuality — not from non-being to being but from one kind or degree to being another"&lt;ref name="Lindberg BWS 2007"/&gt;

Aristotle held many important beliefs that started a convergence of thought for natural philosophy. Aristotle believed that attributes of objects belong to the objects themselves, and share traits with other objects that fit them into a category. He uses the example of dogs to press this point. An individual dog may have very specific attributes (ex. one dog can be black and another brown) but also very general ones that classify it as a dog (ex. four-legged). This philosophy can be applied to many other objects as well. This idea is different than that of Plato, with whom Aristotle had a direct association. Aristotle argued that objects have properties "form" and something that is not part of its properties "matter" that defines the object. The form cannot be separated from the matter. Given the example that you can not separate properties and matter since this is impossible, you cannot collect properties in a pile and matter in another.&lt;ref name="Lindberg BWS 2007"/&gt;

Aristotle believed that change was a natural occurrence. He used his philosophy of form and matter to argue that when something changes you change its properties without changing its matter. This change occurs by replacing certain properties with other properties. Since this change is always an intentional alteration whether by forced means or by natural ones, change is a controllable order of qualities. He argues that this happens through three categories of being: non-being, potential being, and actual being. Through these three states the process of changing an object never truly destroys an objects forms during this transition state but rather just blurs the reality between the two states. An example of this could be changing an object from red to blue with a transitional purple phase.&lt;ref name="Lindberg BWS 2007"/&gt;

===Other significant figures in natural philosophy===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Early Greek philosophers studied motion and the cosmos. Figures like [[Hesiod]] regarded the Natural world as offspring of the gods, whereas others like [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] regarded the world as lifeless atoms in a vortex. [[Anaximander]] deduced that eclipses happen because of apertures in rings of celestial fire. [[Heraclitus]] believed that the heavenly bodies were made of fire that were contained within bowls. He thought that eclipses happen when the bowl turned away from the earth. [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] is believed to have stated that an underlying element was air, and by manipulating air someone could change its thickness to create fire, water, dirt, and stones. [[Empedocles]] identified the elements that make up the world which he termed the roots of all things as Fire, Air. Earth, and Water. [[Parmenides]] argued that all change is a logical impossibility. He gives the example that nothing can go from nonexistence to existence. [[Plato]] argues that the world is an imperfect replica of an idea that a divine craftsman once held. He also believed that the only way to truly know something was through reason and logic not the study of the object itself, but that changeable matter is a viable course of study.&lt;ref name="Lindberg BWS 2007"/&gt;

The [[scientific method]] has ancient precedents and [[Galileo]] exemplifies a mathematical understanding of nature which is the hallmark of modern natural scientists. Galileo proposed that objects falling regardless of their mass would fall at the same rate, as long as the medium they fall in is identical. The 19th-century distinction of a scientific enterprise apart from traditional natural philosophy has its roots in prior centuries. Proposals for a more "inquisitive" and practical approach to the study of nature are notable in [[Francis Bacon]], whose ardent convictions did much to popularize his insightful [[Baconian method]]. The late 17th-century natural philosopher [[Robert Boyle]] wrote a seminal work on the distinction between [[physics]] and [[metaphysics]] called, ''A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature'', as well as ''The Skeptical Chymist'', after which the modern science of [[chemistry]] is named, (as distinct from [[proto-science|proto-scientific]] studies of [[alchemy]]). These works of natural philosophy are representative of a departure from the [[medieval]] [[scholasticism]] taught in European [[universities]], and anticipate in many ways, the developments which would [[history of science|lead to science]] as practiced in the modern sense. As Bacon would say, "vexing nature" to reveal "her" secrets, ([[scientific experiment]]ation), rather than a mere reliance on largely historical, even [[anecdotal]], [[observation]]s of empirical [[phenomena]], would come to be regarded as a defining characteristic of [[modern science]], if not the very key to its success. Boyle's biographers, in their emphasis that he laid the foundations of modern chemistry, neglect how steadily he clung to the scholastic sciences in theory, practice and doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=More |first=Louis Trenchard |date=January 1941 |title=Boyle as Alchemist |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=61–76 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |doi=10.2307/2707281 |jstor=2707281}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he meticulously recorded observational detail on practical research, and subsequently advocated not only this practice, but its publication, both for successful and unsuccessful experiments, so as to validate individual claims by replication.

{{Quotation |For sometimes we use the word ''[[nature]]'' for that ''Author of nature'' whom the [[scholasticism|schoolmen]], harshly enough, call ''[[natura naturans]]'', as when it is said that ''nature'' hath made man partly corporeal and [[Mind-body dualism|partly immaterial]]. Sometimes we mean by the ''nature'' of a thing the ''[[essence]]'', or that which the schoolmen scruple not to call the ''[[quiddity]]'' of a thing, namely, the ''[[property (philosophy)|attribute]]'' or ''attributes'' on whose score it is what it is, whether the thing be [[matter|corporeal]] or not, as when we attempt to define the ''nature'' of an ''[[angel]]'', or of a ''[[triangle]]'', or of a ''[[fluid]]'' body, as such. Sometimes we take ''nature'' for an internal principle of [[motion (physics)|motion]], as when we say that a stone let fall in the [[air (classical element)|air]] is by ''nature'' carried towards the centre of the [[earth (classical element)|earth]], and, on the contrary, that [[fire (classical element)|fire]] or flame does ''naturally'' move upwards toward [[firmament|heaven]]. Sometimes we understand by ''nature'' the established course of things, as when we say that ''nature'' makes the [[night]] succeed the [[day]], ''nature'' hath made [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] necessary to the [[life]] of men. Sometimes we take ''nature'' for an [[physiology|aggregate of powers]] belonging to a body, especially a living one, as when [[physician]]s say that ''nature'' is strong or weak or spent, or that in such or such [[disease]]s ''nature'' left to herself [[immune system|will do the cure]]. Sometimes we take nature for the [[universe]], or system of the corporeal works of [[God]], as when it is said of a [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], or a [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], that there is no such thing in ''nature'', i.e. in the world. And sometimes too, and that most commonly, we would express by ''nature'' a [[mother nature|semi-deity]] or other strange kind of being, such as this discourse examines the notion of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Boyle |first2=M.A. |last2=Stewart |year=1991 |title=Selected Philosophical Papers of Robert Boyle |series=HPC Classics Series |publisher=Hackett |isbn=978-0-87220-122-4 |lccn=91025480 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_tNzGMLGSGwC&amp;pg=PA177 |pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Robert Boyle]]|A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature}}

Natural philosophers of the late 17th or early 18th century were sometimes insultingly described as 'projectors'. A [[projector (early scientist)|projector]] was an entrepreneur who invited people to invest in his invention but - as the caricature went - could not be trusted, usually because his device was impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-keller/age-projectors|title=The Age of the Projectors {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Swift satirized natural philosophers of the [[Royal Society]] as 'the academy of projectors' in his novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]].'' Historians of science have argued that natural philosophers and the so-called projectors sometimes overlapped in their methods and aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ku2IWu3xchoC&amp;dq=alex+keller+projector&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Sir Jonas Moore: Practical Mathematics and Restoration Science|last=Willmoth|first=Frances|date=1993-01-01|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=9780851153216|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamamoto|first=Koji|date=2015-12-01|title=Medicine, metals and empire: the survival of a chymical projector in early eighteenth-century London|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895512|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|volume=48|issue=4|pages=607–637|doi=10.1017/S000708741500059X|issn=0007-0874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern emphasis is less on a broad empiricism (one that includes passive observation of nature's activity), but on a narrow conception of the empirical concentrating on the ''control'' exercised through experimental (active) observation for the sake of ''control'' of nature. Nature is reduced to a passive recipient of human activity.

== Current work in the philosophy of science and nature==
In the middle of the 20th century, [[Ernst Mayr]]'s discussions on the [[teleology]] of nature brought up issues that were dealt with previously by Aristotle (regarding [[Four causes#Final cause|final cause]]) and Kant (regarding [[Critique of Judgment#Aesthetics|reflective judgment]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pt.scribd.com/doc/117102437/Teleology-and-Randomness-in-the-Development-of-Natural-Science-Research-Systems-Ontology-and-Evolution. "Teleology and Randomness in the Development of Natural Science Research: Systems, Ontology and Evolution" Interthesis, v. 8, n. 2, p. 316-334, jul/dec.2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially since the mid-20th-century European crisis, some thinkers argued the importance of looking at nature from a broad philosophical perspective, rather than what they considered a narrowly positivist approach relying implicitly on a hidden, unexamined philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Burtt, ''Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science'' (Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Company, 1954), 227-230.&lt;/ref&gt;  One line of thought grows from the Aristotelian tradition, especially as developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Another line springs from [[Edmund Husserl]], especially as expressed in ''The Crisis of European Sciences''. Students of his such as [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]] and [[Hans Jonas]] more fully developed his themes. Last, but not least, there is the [[process philosophy]] inspired by [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s works.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond, (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among living scholars, [[Brian David Ellis]], [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]], [[David S. Oderberg|David Oderberg]], and [[John Dupré]] are some of the more prominent thinkers who can arguably be classed as generally adopting a more open approach to the natural world. Ellis (2002) observes the rise of a "New Essentialism."&lt;ref&gt;See his ''The Philosophy of Nature: A Guide to the New Essentialism'' 2002. {{ISBN|0-7735-2474-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Oderberg (2007) takes issue with other philosophers, including Ellis to a degree, who claim to be [[essentialism|essentialist]]s. He revives and defends the Thomistic-Aristotelian tradition from modern attempts to flatten nature to the limp subject of the experimental method.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Oderberg, ''Real Essentialism'' (Routledge, 2007). {{ISBN|0415323649}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [http://www.mqup.ca/in-praise-of-natural-philosophy-products-9780773549036.php In Praise of Natural Philosophy: A Revolution for Thought and Life] (2017), [[Nicholas Maxwell]] argues that we need to reform philosophy and put science and philosophy back together again to create a modern version of natural philosophy.

Developed by [[Science North]] and [[AldrichPears Associates]], the Nature Exchange is an interactive forum where visitors trade ethically collected natural objects and information about them to learn and engage with the natural world. Visitors earn points for each trade, based on criteria such as quality, rarity and their knowledge of the item.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencenorth.ca/enterprises/work/exhibits/natureexchange/index.html Nature Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science museum#Science_center|Science center]]s, nature centers and [[zoo]]s use Nature Exchanges to raise awareness of key issues in the natural world, and, through personal interaction, changes attitudes and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20410">'''Open science data''' is a type of [[open data]] focused on publishing observations and results of scientific activities available for anyone to analyze and reuse. A major purpose of the drive for open data is to allow the verification of scientific claims, by allowing others to look at the reprodubility of results,&lt;ref name=spiegelhalter&gt;Spiegelhalter, D. [http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/01/15/open-data-and-trust-in-the-literature/ Open data and trust in the literature.] The Scholarly Kitchen. Retrieved 7 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and to allow data from many sources to be integrated to give new knowledge.&lt;ref name=FAIR/&gt; While the ''idea'' of open science data has been actively promoted since the 1950s, the rise of the [[Internet]] has significantly lowered the cost and time required to publish or obtain data.

==History==
The concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established with the formation of the [[World Data Center]] system (now the [[World Data System]]), in preparation for the [[International Geophysical Year]] of 1957–1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Scientific Accomplishments of Earth Observations from Space, National Research Council|title=Earth Observations from Space: The First 50 Years of Scientific Achievements|year=2008|publisher=The National Academies Press|isbn=0-309-11095-5|page=6|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11991&amp;page=6 |accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Council of Scientific Unions (now the [[International Council for Science]]) established several World Data Centers to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility, further recommending in 1955 that data be made available in machine-readable form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Data Center System|title=About the World Data Center System|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/wdc/about.shtml|publisher=NOAA, National Geophysical Data Center|accessdate=2010-11-24|date=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first initiative to create a database of electronic bibliography of open access data was the [[Education Resources Information Center|Educational Resources Information Center]] (ERIC) in 1966. In the same year, [[MEDLINE]] was created – a free access online database managed by the [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] and the [[National Institute of Health]] (USA) with bibliographical citations from journals in the biomedical area, which later would be called [[PubMed]], currently with over 14 million complete articles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/download/38678263/Open_Science_open_issues_Digital.pdf#page=190 Machado, Jorge. "Open data and open science". ''In'' Albagli, Maciel, Abdo. "Open Science, Open Questions", 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 GCDIS (US) put its position clearly in 
''On the Full and Open Exchange of Scientific Data'' (A publication of the Committee on Geophysical and Environmental Data - National Research Council):

{{quote|text="The Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere form an integrated system that transcends national boundaries. To understand the elements of the system, the way they interact, and how they have changed with time, it is necessary to collect and analyze environmental data from all parts of the world. Studies of the global environment require international collaboration for many reasons:
* to address global issues, it is essential to have global data sets and products derived from these data sets;
* it is more efficient and cost-effective for each nation to share its data and information than to collect everything it needs independently; and
* the implementation of effective policies addressing issues of the global environment requires the involvement from the outset of nearly all nations of the world.
International programs for global change research and environmental monitoring crucially depend on the principle of full and open data exchange (i.e., data and information are made available without restriction, on a non-discriminatory basis, for no more than the cost of reproduction and distribution)."
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18769/on-the-full-and-open-exchange-of-scientific-data|title=On the Full and Open Exchange of Scientific Data|last=National Research Council|first=|publisher=The National Academies Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=|language=en|doi=10.17226/18769}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last phrase highlights the traditional cost of disseminating information by print and post. It is the removal of this cost through the Internet which has made data vastly easier to disseminate technically. It is correspondingly cheaper to create, sell and control many data resources and this has led to the current concerns over non-open data.

More recent uses of the term include:

In 2004, the Science Ministers of all nations of the [[OECD]] (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), which includes most developed countries of the world, signed a declaration which essentially states that all publicly funded archive data should be made publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/0,2340,en_2649_34487_25998799_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Declaration on Open Access to publicly funded data]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420102950/http://www.oecd.org/document/0%2C2340%2Cen_2649_34487_25998799_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |date=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a request and an intense discussion with data-producing institutions in member states, the OECD published in 2007 the ''OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding'' as a ''soft-law'' recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/55/0,3343,en_2649_201185_38500791_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Edd Dumbill introduced an “Open Data” theme in XTech, including:
* [[Open government]]
* Public web services
* Grassroots data
* Scientific and academic publishing
* [[Intellectual property]]
* Blogging and personal content
* [[Semantic Web]]

In 2006 Science Commons&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spatial.maine.edu/icfs/ Science Commons in Washington 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; ran a 2-day conference in Washington where the primary topic could be described as Open Data. It was reported that the amount of micro-protection of data (e.g. by license) in areas such as biotechnology was creating a [[Tragedy of the anticommons]]. In this the costs of obtaining licenses from a large number of owners made it uneconomic to do research in the area.

In 2007 SPARC and Science Commons announced a consolidation and enhancement of their author addenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/3767.html SPARC-OAF forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the [[OECD]] (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) published the Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding|url=http://www.oecd.org/sti/sci-tech/oecdprinciplesandguidelinesforaccesstoresearchdatafrompublicfunding.htm|website=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Principles state that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Access to research data increases the returns from public investment in this area; reinforces open scientific inquiry; encourages diversity of studies and opinion; promotes new areas of work and enables the exploration of topics not envisioned by the initial investigators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010 the [[Panton Principles]] launched,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.okfn.org/2010/02/19/launch-of-the-panton-principles-for-open-data-in-science/ Launch of the Panton Principles for Open Data in Science and 'Is It Open Data?' Web Service]&lt;/ref&gt; advocating  Open Data in science and setting out for principles to which providers must comply to have their data Open.

In 2011 [http://linkedscience.org LinkedScience.org] was launched to realize the approach of the Linked Open Science&lt;ref name="kauppinen"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kauppinen | first1 = T. | last2 = Espindola | first2 = G. M. D. | doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2011.04.076 | title = Linked Open Science-Communicating, Sharing and Evaluating Data, Methods and Results for Executable Papers | journal = Procedia Computer Science | volume = 4 | pages = 726 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to openly share and interconnect scientific assets like datasets, methods, tools and vocabularies.

In 2012, the [[Royal Society]] published a major report, "Science as an Open Enterprise"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/|title=Final report - Science as an open enterprise|website=royalsociety.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, advocating open scientific data and considering its benefits and requirements.

In 2013 the G8 Science Ministers released a Statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=G8 Science Ministers Statement|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/g8-science-ministers-statement|publisher=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting a set of principles for open scientific research data

In 2015 the [[World Data System]] of the [[International Council for Science]] adopted a new set of Data Sharing Principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Data Organization Adopts Open Data Sharing Principles|url=http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=159210&amp;CultureCode=en|accessdate=8 January 2016|publisher=AlphaGalileo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Data System (WDS) Data Sharing Principles|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.34354|website=ZENODO|accessdate=8 January 2016|doi=10.5281/zenodo.34354}}&lt;/ref&gt; to embody the spirit of 'open science'. These Principles are in line with data policies of national and international initiatives and they express core ethical commitments operationalized in the WDS Certification of trusted data repositories and service.

==Relation to open access==
Much data is made available through scholarly publication, which now attracts intense debate under "[[Open access (publishing)|Open Access]]" and [[Semantic Web|semantically open formats]] &amp;ndash; like to offer the [[Scientific literature|scientific articles]] in [[Journal Article Tag Suite|JATS]] format. The [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] (2001) coined this term:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The logic of the declaration permits re-use of the data although the term "literature" has connotations of human-readable text and can imply a scholarly publication process. In Open Access discourse the term "full-text" is often used which does not emphasize the data contained within or accompanying the publication.

Some Open Access publishers do not require the authors to assign copyright and the data associated with these publications can normally be regarded as Open Data. Some publishers have Open Access strategies where the publisher requires assignment of the copyright and where it is unclear that the data in publications can be truly regarded as Open Data.

The ALPSP and STM publishers have issued a statement about the desirability of making data freely available:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpsp.org/Ebusiness/AboutALPSP/ALPSPStatements/Statementdetails.aspx?ID=55 A statement by the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP) and the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM)], [[Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Publishers recognise that in many disciplines data itself, in various forms, is now a key output of research. Data searching and mining tools permit increasingly sophisticated use of raw data. Of course, journal articles provide one ‘view’ of the significance and interpretation of that data – and conference presentations and informal exchanges may provide other ‘views’ – but data itself is an increasingly important community resource. Science is best advanced by allowing as many scientists as possible to have access to as much prior data as possible; this avoids costly repetition of work, and allows creative new integration and reworking of existing data.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We believe that, as a general principle, data sets, the raw data outputs of research, and sets or sub-sets of that data which are submitted with a paper to a journal, should wherever possible be made freely accessible to other scholars. We believe that the best practice for scholarly journal publishers is to separate supporting data from the article itself, and not to require any transfer of or ownership in such data or data sets as a condition of publication of the article in question.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Even though this statement was without any effect on the open availability of primary data related to publications in journals of the ALPSP and STM members. Data tables provided by the authors as supplement with a paper are still available to subscribers only.

==Relation to peer review==
In an effort to address issues with the reproducibility of research results, some scholars are asking that authors agree to share their raw data as part of the [[scholarly peer review]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The PRO Initiative for Open Science |url=https://opennessinitiative.org/ |website=Peer Reviewers' Openness Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far back as 1962, for example, a number of psychologists have attempted to obtain raw data sets from other researchers, with mixed results, in order to reanalyze them. A recent attempt resulted in only seven data sets out of fifty requests. The notion of obtaining, let alone requiring, open data as a condition of peer review remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witkowski |first1=Tomasz |authorlink1=Tomasz Witkowski |title=A Scientist Pushes Psychology Journals toward Open Data |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=6-7 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915205014/https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/2017/07/29/a-scientist-pushes-psychology-journals-toward-open-data/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open research computation ==

{{main article|Open research computation}}

To make sense of scientific data they must be analysed. In all but the simplest cases, this is done by software. The extensive use of software poses problems for the [[reproducibility]] of research. To keep research reproducible, it is necessary to publish not only all data, but also the source code of all software used, and all the parametrization used in running this software. Presently, these requests are rarely ever met. Ways to come closer to reproducible scientific computation are discussed under the catchword "[[open research computation]]".

'''Health sciences''' &amp;ndash; are those sciences which focus on health, or health care, as core parts of their subject matter. Because these two subject matter relate to multiple academic disciplines, both [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] disciplines as well as emerging [[patient safety]] disciplines (such as [[Social work|social care research]]) are relevant to current health scientific knowledge.

Health sciences knowledge bases are currently diverse, with intellectual foundations which are sometimes mutually-inconsistent. There is currently an existing bias in the field, towards high valuation of knowledge deriving from '''controlling''' views on human agency (as epitomized by the epistemological basis of [[Randomized controlled trial|Randomized Control Trial designs]]); compare this against the more '''naturalistic''' views on human agency taken by research based on [[Ethnography]] for example).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3179">'''Postnormal times''' ('''PNT''') is a concept developed by [[Ziauddin Sardar]] as a development of [[Post-normal Science]]. Sardar describes the present as "postnormal times", "in an in-between period where old orthodoxies are dying, new ones have yet to be born, and very few things seem to make sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sardar|first1=Ziauddin|title=Welcome to postnormal times|journal=Futures|date=June 2010|volume=42|issue=5|pages=435–444|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2009.11.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
In support of engaging communities of various scope and scale on how to best navigate PNT and imagine preferred pathways toward the future(s), Sardar and Sweeney published an article in the journal ''[[Futures (journal)|Futures]]'' outlining The Three Tomorrows method, which fills a gap in the field as "many methods of futures and foresight seldom incorporate pluralism and diversity intrinsically in their frameworks, and few, if any, emphasize the dynamic and merging nature of futures possibilities, or highlight the ignorance and uncertainties we constantly confront."&lt;ref&gt;Ziauddin Sardar &amp; John A. Sweeney, "The Three Tomorrows of Postnormal Times," Futures 75(2016) 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Sweeney, "Signs of postnormal times," East-West Affairs 1, no. 3/4(2013).''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and criticism==
Rakesh Kapoor criticized PNT in 2011 as a Western concept, that does not apply to India and other [[emerging market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rakesh Kapoor, "Is there a postnormal time? From the illusion of normality to the design for a new normality," Futures 43(2011) 216-220. &lt;/ref&gt; Sam Cole criticised the three C’s of PNT (chaos, complexity and contradictions) as "Alliterative Logic, theorizing through alliterative word-triads that is not based on empirical evidence".&lt;ref&gt;Sam Cole, "Alliterative logic: A theory of postnormal times," Futures 43(2011) 209-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Gray has suggested that PNT is embryonic, needs a more robust framework, and should be extended to include [[C. S. Holling|C S Holling's]] adaptive cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Jay E. Gary, "Toward a new macrohistory: An extension to Sardar’s ‘postnormal times,’" Futures 43(2011) 48-51. &lt;/ref&gt; Scientists working on complex evolving systems have pointed out that PNT recalls the ‘Long Waves’ of [[Kondratiev wave|Kondratiev]] and [[Joseph Schumpeter]]’s view of waves of "creative destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Allen and Liz Varga, "Modelling sustainable energy futures for the UK," Futures 57(2014) 28-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

PNT is one of the core areas of research for the Center for Postnormal Policy and Futures Studies at [[East-West University]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois, US. A number of articles and editorials on PNT have been published in the journal ''East-West Affairs''.

__NOTOC__
In the [[philosophy of science]], there are several definitions of '''protoscience'''.

Its simplest meaning (most closely reflecting its roots of ''[[wikt:proto-#Prefix|proto-]]'' + ''[[science]]'') involves the earliest eras of the [[history of science]], when the [[scientific method]] was still nascent. Thus, in the late 17th century and early 18th century, [[Isaac Newton]] contributed to the dawning sciences of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], even though he was also an [[alchemy|alchemist]] who sought [[chrysopoeia]] in various ways including some that were unscientific. 

Another meaning extends this idea into the present, with protoscience being an emerging field of study which is still not completely scientific, but later becomes a proper science.&lt;ref name=Bunge&gt;{{cite article | last=Bunge | first=Mario | title=What is pseudoscience?| year=1984 | publisher=The Skeptical Inquirer |volume=9 | pages=36-46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of it would the [[general theory of relativity]], which started being a protoscience (a theoretical work which had not been tested), but later was experimentally verified and became fully scientitific. Protoscience in this sense is distinguished from pseudoscience by a genuine willingness to be changed through new evidence, as opposed to having a theory that can always find a way to rationalize a predetermined belief.

[[Philosopher of chemistry]] Jaap Brakel defines protoscience as "the study of ''normative'' criteria for the use of experimental technology in science."&lt;ref&gt;Brakel, Jaap, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=XU1OwXNHN50C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=protoscience&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xsn6Tty0BtO78gOz8oAZ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=protoscience&amp;f=false protoscience and protochemistry]", Philosophy of chemistry: between the manifest and the scientific image, Leuven Univ Pr, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thomas Kuhn]] said that protosciences "generate testable conclusions but ... nevertheless resemble [[philosophy]] and [[the arts]] rather than the established sciences in their developmental patterns. I think, for example, of fields like [[chemistry]] and [[electricity]] before the mid-18th century, of the study of [[heredity]] and [[phylogeny]] before the mid-nineteenth, or of many of the [[social sciences]] today." While noting that they meet the demarcation criteria of [[falsifiability]] from [[Karl Popper|Popper]], he questions whether the discussion in protoscience fields "result[s] in clear-cut progress". Kuhn concluded that protoscience, "like the arts and philosophy, lack some element which, in the mature sciences, permits the more obvious forms of progress. It is not, however, anything that a methodological prescription can provide. ... I claim no therapy to assist the transformation of a proto-science to a science, nor do I suppose anything of this sort is to be had".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuhn |first=Thomas |editors=Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave | chapter = Reflections on my critics |title=Criticism and the growth of knowledge: Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science [held at Bedford college, Regent's Park, London, from July 11th to 17th 1965] |year=1970 |publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521096235 |edition=Reprint |pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''prescientific'' means at root "relating to an era before science existed". For example, [[traditional medicine]] existed for thousands of years before medical science did, and thus many aspects of it can be described as prescientific. In a related but somewhat different [[word sense|sense]], protoscientific topics (such as the alchemy of Newton's day) can be called prescientific, in which case the ''proto-'' and ''pre-'' labels can function more or less [[synonym]]ously (the latter focusing more sharply on the idea that nothing but science is science).

Compare [[fringe science]], which is considered highly speculative or even strongly refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dutch, Steven I |title=Notes on the nature of fringe science |journal=[[J Geol Ed]] |issn=0022-1368 |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=6–13 |date=January 1982 |id=ERIC EJ260409 |oclc=427103550}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some protosciences go on to become an accepted part of [[Scientific consensus|mainstream science]].&lt;ref name=CFS&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419010537/http://www2.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/truzzi.html |date=April 19, 2012 |title=''Reflections on the reception of unconventional claims in science'' }}, newsletter ''Center for Frontier Sciences'', [[Temple University]] (1990).

The SCALE-UP name originally stood for “Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Physics” but since its conception many different institutions have begun teaching a variety of courses of various sizes. The acronym was changed to “Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs.” Now, because of the increasing number of pre-college installations, plus to draw attention to the instruction as well as the space, the name has become "Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies." The basic idea is that students are given something interesting to investigate. While they work in teams on these "tangibles" (hands-on measurements or observations) and "ponderables" (interesting, complex problems), the instructor is free to roam around the classroom–--asking questions, sending one team to help another, or asking why someone else got a different answer. There is no separate lab class and most of the "lectures" are actually class-wide discussions. The groups are carefully structured and give students many opportunities to interact. Three teams (labelled a, b, and c) sit at each round table and have white boards nearby. Each team has a laptop in case they need web access. The [http://scaleup.ncsu.edu/groups/adopters/wiki/056a1/North_Carolina_State_Physics.html  original design] called for 11 round tables of nine students, but many schools have smaller classes while a few have even larger ones. Smaller classes, particularly those in high schools, have also been using D-shaped tables that seat six students.

The '''Science Media Centre''' is an organisation which formed in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Lancet|title=Fiona Fox|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61099-0|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61099-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;,
two years after the [[United Kingdom]] [[House of Lords]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on Science and Technology's third report on "Science and Society" in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3810.htm|title=House of Lords - Science and Technology - Third Report|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}}

This report stated that while science was generally reported accurately in the mass media, there was a need for the promotion of more expert information at times when science is under attack in the headlines, mentioning the public reaction to GM crops, in particular.

==Functions==
In order to promote more informed science in the media, the Centre's main function is as a service to journalists, providing background briefings on current scientific issues and facilitating interviews with scientists. Its director is [[Fiona Fox (UK press officer)|Fiona Fox]] who is a former member of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] and a former contributor to its magazine ''[[Living Marxism]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/19/farmingforthefuture | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Clear intentions | first=Peter | last=Melchett | date=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The SMC's stated aim is to "facilitate more scientists to engage with the media, in the hope that the public will have improved access to accurate, evidence-based scientific information about the stories of the day".

==Structure==
The setting up of the Science Media Centre was assisted by [[Susan Greenfield]], the director of the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]]. While the Centre is still based in a specially refurbished wing of the Royal Institution, full independence is claimed from all funders and supporters.

The Science Media Centre is funded by over 60 organisations, with individual donations capped at £12,500 per annum. The SMC receives sponsorship from a range of funders including media organisations, universities, scientific and learned societies, the [[Research Councils UK|UK Research Councils]], government bodies, [[Quango]]s, charities, private donors and corporate bodies. For an up-to-date list of funders, see [http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/funding.htm].

==Criticism==

A 2013 article in ''Nature'' stated about the SMC, "Perhaps the biggest criticism of Fox and the SMC is that they push science too aggressively — acting more as a PR agency than as a source of accurate science information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/science-media-centre-of-attention-1.13362|title=Science media: Centre of attention|year=2013|author=Nature|doi=10.1038/499142a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Ronan Bennett]] and [[Alan Rusbridger]] described the SMC as a lobby group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/jun/02/gm.observersciencepages|title=Lobby group 'led GM thriller critics'|author=The Guardian|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other SMCs==
During Professor Greenfield's term as [[Thinker in Residence]] in South Australia, a new [[Australian Science Media Centre]] was set up in [[Adelaide]], Australia in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Origins|url=http://www.aussmc.org/about-us/our-origins/|publisher=Australian Science Media Centre|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkers.sa.gov.au/thinkers/greenfield/impacts.aspx|title=Adelaide Thinkers in Residence - Impacts|publisher=Govt. of South Australia|accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Media Centres now exist in other countries; [[Science Media Centre of Canada|Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], Japan, and Germany. Except for the relation between the Science Media Centre in UK and the Australian Science Media Centre, these centres are independent of each other.

It was the first time such a recommendation had come from Parliament.]]
[[Science Education|'''Science education''']] [[Education in England|''' in England''']] is generally regulated at all levels for assessments that are England's, from 'primary' to 'tertiary' ([[university]]). Below university-level, science education is the responsibility of three bodies: the [[Department for Education]], [[Ofqual]] and the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|QAA]], but at university-level, science education is regulated by various ''professional bodies'', and the [[Bologna Process]] via the QAA. The QAA also regulates science education for some qualifications that are not university [[Academic degree|degrees]] via various ''qualification boards'', but not content for [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], and [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|GCE AS and A levels]]. Ofqual on the other hand regulates science education for GCSEs and AS/A levels, as well as all other qualifications, except those covered by the QAA, also via qualification boards. The Department for Education prescribes the content for science education for GCSEs and AS/A levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Department for Education|authorlink = Department for Education|title = GCE AS and A level subject content for biology, chemistry, physics and psychology|publisher = Department for Education|series = AS and A level subject content and requirements |year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is implemented by the qualification boards, who are then regulated by Ofqual. The Department for Education also regulates science education for students aged 16 years and under. The department's policies on science education (and indeed all subjects) are implemented by [[Local government in England|local government authorities]] on all [[state school]]s (also called ''publicly funded'' schools) in England. The content of the nationally organised science curriculum (along with other subjects) for England is published in the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]], which covers [[Key Stage 1|key stage 1 (KS1)]], [[Key Stage 2|key stage 2 (KS2)]], [[Key Stage 3|key stage 3 (KS3)]] and [[Key Stage 4|key stage 4 (KS4)]]. The four key stages can be grouped a number of ways; how they are grouped significantly affects [[#Compulsory science content and national assessments|the way the science curriculum is delivered]]. In state schools, the four key stages are grouped into KS1–2 and KS3–4; KS1–2 covers primary education while KS3–4 covers secondary education. But in [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]] or [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public (which in the United Kingdom are historic independent)]] schools (not to be confused with 'publicly funded' schools), the key stage grouping is more variable, and rather than using the terms ‘primary’ and 'secondary’, the terms ‘prep’ and ‘senior’ are used instead. Science is a compulsory subject in the National Curriculum of England, [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]];&lt;ref name="ERA1988"&gt;{{cite book|title = Education Reform Act 1988 c40|publisher = HMSO|year = 1989|isbn = 0 10 544088 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; state schools have to follow the National Curriculum while independent schools need not follow it. That said, science is compulsory in the [[Common Entrance Examination]] for entry into senior schools, so it does feature prominently in the curricula of independent schools. Beyond the National Curriculum and Common Entrance Examination, science is voluntary, but the government of the [[United Kingdom]] (comprising England, Wales, [[Scotland]] and Northern Ireland) provides [[#Challenges for science education in England|incentives for students to continue studying science subjects]]. Science is regarded as vital to the economic growth of the United Kingdom (UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = House of Commons|first = Science and Technology Committee|authorlink = House of Commons of the United Kingdom|title = The science budget: First Report of Session 2015–16|publisher = House of Commons|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For students aged 16 years (the upper limit of compulsory ''school age'' in England, but not compulsory education as a whole) and over, there is no ''compulsory'' nationally organised science curriculum for all state/publicly funded education providers in England to follow, and individual providers can set their own content, although they often (and in the case of England's state/publicly funded post-16 schools and colleges have to&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-to-have-your-qualifications-regulated|title=Guidance: Apply to have your qualifications regulated|author=Ofqual|date=8 March 2017|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstohe.ac.uk/HowCourses/AVA-profiles/Pages/Default.aspx|title=Access to Higher Education: Access Validating Agency profiles|author=Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|publisher=The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/about-us|title=QAA: About us|author=The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|publisher=The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) get their science (and indeed all) courses ''accredited'' or made ''satisfactory'' (ultimately by either Ofqual or the QAA via the qualification boards). Universities do not need such approval, but [[#Science education at university-level|there is a reason for them to seek accreditation]] regardless. Moreover, UK universities have obligations to the Bologna Process to ensure high standards. Science education in England has undergone significant changes over the centuries; facing challenges over that period, and still facing challenges to this day.

==History==
===Up to 1800===
Gillard (2011)&lt;ref name="Gillard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/index.html|title=Education in England: a brief history|author=Gillard, D.|date=2011|publisher=D. Gillard|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a documented account of science curriculum and education during this period. According to his work, the teaching of science in England dates back to at least [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon times]]. Gillard explains that the first schools in England (that are known of) were created by [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] when he brought [[Christianity]] to England around the end of the sixth century—there were almost certainly schools in [[Roman Britain]] before St Augustine, but they did not survive after the Romans left. It is thought the first [[grammar school]] was established at [[Canterbury]] in 598 during the reign of [[Æthelberht of Kent|King Ethelbert]]. Gillard also mentions Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History'', here science (in the form of [[astronomy]]) was already part of the curriculum in the early schools of the 600s. As the founding of grammar schools spread from south to north of England, science education spread with it. Science as it is known today developed from two spheres of knowledge: [[natural philosophy]] and [[natural history]]. The former was associated with the reasoning and explanation of nature while the latter focused more on living things. Both strands of knowledge can be identified in a curriculum provided by a school in [[York]] run by [[Alcuin]] in the 770s and 780s.&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt; Subsequent [[Viking Age#England|Viking invasions]] of England interrupted the development of schools, but despite this, through the ages, education in England was provided by the church and grammar schools (which were linked to the church). The link between church and school started to change in the 1300s when schools independent of the church began to emerge. University education in England started in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in the 1100s (although there is evidence that [[University of Oxford|teaching began there in the 1000s]]). Like pre-university education, science at Oxford University was initially taught in the form of astronomy (as part of the [[quadrivium]]). The [[Renaissance]] spurred physical inquiry into nature which led to natural philosophy developing into [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], and natural history developing into [[biology]]; these three disciplines form [[natural science]], from which interdisciplinary fields (or at least their modern versions) that overlap two or all three branches of natural science develop. This emerging trend in physical inquiry do not appear to have been reflected in the science curriculum in schools at the time.&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Williams|first = R.|authorlink = Raymond Williams|title = The Long Revolution|publisher = Chatto &amp; Windus|year = 1961|isbn = 0-14-020762-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in universities, the changes to science education that were necessary as a result of the Renaissance occurred very slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===1800s===
Up until the 1800s there were only two stages of education: elementary and university. However, in the nineteenth century, elementary education began to divide into primary (still called elementary) and secondary education. Elementary schools were defined in law in England through a series of acts of parliament&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt; which made education compulsory and free for children up to the age of 11 (later increased to 12). There were six (and later seven) standards for children to pass;&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Victorianschool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianschool.co.uk/school%20history%20lessons.html|title=The Standards of Education in schools in England from 1872|author=Victorian School|date=2015|publisher=Paradox|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrish"&gt;{{cite book|last = Morrish|first = I.|title = Education Since 1800|publisher = Routledge
|series = Routledge Library Editions: History of Education|year = 2007|isbn = 978-1-134-53251-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; science education did not feature in any of these standards, but for some schools it was an ''add-on'' especially at the higher standards (such as sixth and seventh—science subjects included physics, chemistry, mechanics).&lt;ref name="Morrish"/&gt; Promotion from one standard to the next was on merit and not age.&lt;ref name="Victorianschool"/&gt; Not all children completed all standards, which meant that by the age of 12, there were children that had not ‘completed’ their elementary education.&lt;ref name="Victorianschool"/&gt; Of course families that could afford (and wanted) to keep their children in school post-compulsory age to pass all standards did so. In fact some children stayed in school beyond the seventh standard. Schools that offered post-seventh standard education became known as ''higher grade schools'', of which science education was a recognised feature of their curricula.&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrish"/&gt;

====Taunton Report 1868====
This was by far the single most important development for science education in schools in England in the nineteenth century from a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] point of view. Ironically the original purpose of the committee that authored the 'Taunton' Report of 1868, or more formally, ''Volume II Miscellaneous Papers of the Schools Inquiry Commission'' (1868), was to examine how best [[Endowed Schools Act 1869|endowed schools]] should be managed; something Parliament at the time thought was of utmost importance.&lt;ref name="Taunton"&gt;{{cite book|last = Schools Inquiry Commission|title = Vol II: Miscellaneous Papers|publisher = HMSO|year = 1868}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee for the report was chaired by [[Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton|Lord Taunton (born Henry Labouchere)]]. In heading the preparation for the report, Lord Taunton sent a circular letter listing four questions to a number of prominent people in different parts of England on 28 May 1866; the first three were endowment-related issues, but the fourth question was on how to encourage a due supply of qualified teachers. Apart from the contents page, the word "science" first appears on page 45 of the report in a reply by one of the recipients of the circular letter; that recipient was Reverend W C Lake. The reverend comments:
:The question as to the best mode to be adopted for obtaining teachers both in sufficient numbers, and of the kind desirable for middle-class, education, seems to me more difficult than it would at first appear. ... you want men with an University culture, and yet not with exactly an University education ... You do not, I presume, want them to teach Greek; and as to Latin it ought not, in my opinion at least, to be the staple work of the school compared with arithmetic, some mathematics, modern languages, and history, and the principles of some important branches of physical science.
::::::::(Rev. Lake's reply to Lord Taunton IN Report by Schools Inquiry Commission, 1868: p45&lt;ref name="Taunton"/&gt;)
On page 77 of the report, Edward Twisleton, a member of the Schools Inquiry Commission, comments on the answers provided to the four questions set by the committee's chairman, Lord Taunton, based on feedback from the circular letter sent. To the first question, Twisleton writes:
:In providing,—what is generally a part of the arrangements of Prussian gymnasia—a museum of natural history and a cabinet with the philosophical instruments and other materials requisite for instruction in the experimental sciences. The Prussian system should be followed, in which two hours of each week are devoted throughout the school to lessons in these branches of knowledge; the instruction in the lower classes being in sciences of pure observation, such, as zoology and botany, while in the upper parts of the school instruction is given in the sciences usually called experimental, such as pneumatics, hydrostatics, and others. This system, however, cannot be adopted, unless there is a certain preliminary outlay of money, and it seems unobjectionable that this money should come from an endowment.
::::::::::::(Twisleton's response IN Report by Schools Inquiry Commission, 1868: p77&lt;ref name="Taunton"/&gt;)
There were noticeable opinions on the issue of science education from contributors that wrote to the committee to express their views. One by Robert Mosley of Holgate Seminary, York (pages 104 to 105 of the report), suggested the inclusion of physical sciences in a 'National education'; this national education being the best way to utilise educational endowment. Based on feedback from contributors, the Taunton Committee gave several arguments in favour of science education; two of them are:
*''As providing the best discipline in observation and collection of facts, in the combination of inductive with deductive reasoning, and in accuracy both of thought and language.'' 
and
*''Because the methods and results of science have so profoundly affected all the philosophical thought of the age, that an educated man is under a very great disadvantage if he is unacquainted with them.''
:::::::::::::::::::(Report by Schools Inquiry Commission, 1868: p219&lt;ref name="Taunton"/&gt;)
The committee subsequently made several recommendations; the first three on promoting scientific education in schools are listed below:
:i. That in all schools natural science be one of the subjects to be taught, and that in every public school at least one natural science master be appointed for the purpose.
:ii. That at least three hours a week be devoted to such scientific instruction.
:iii. That natural science should be placed on an equal footing with mathematics and modern languages in effecting promotions and in winning honours and prizes.
:::::::::::::::::::(Report by Schools Inquiry Commission, 1868: p222&lt;ref name="Taunton"/&gt;)
The issue of increased cost for fee payers played heavily on the minds of the committee, and although the committee felt that for "a wealthy country like England" (page 219 of the report), a slight increase in cost should not be a barrier to science education, it was left to individual schools to decide how to incorporate science into their curricula.

====Red brick universities====
By the time of the Taunton Report there were four universities in England (Oxford, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Durham University|Durham]] and [[University of London|London]]), but from the 1880s, a new wave of universities / university colleges completely separate from the original four began to emerge; these universities were called [[Red brick university|red brick]] universities. The first of these universities was established in [[Manchester]] in 1880 and was called [[Victoria University (United Kingdom)|Victoria University]]. Over the subsequent 80 years, a further 11 universities outside London, Cambridge, Durham and Oxford were founded, significantly expanding the availability of university (science) education throughout England. All through the 1800s, science was becoming increasingly specialised into the different areas we know today.

===1900s===
The Education Act 1902 led to the higher grade schools (alluded to earlier) and fee-paying schools being absorbed into the legally defined “higher education” (meaning any education that was not elementary (as primary education was known at the time)).&lt;ref name="Gillard"/&gt; Despite science education in higher grade schools and the recommendations of the Taunton Report, as well as the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science’s]] campaign for a science curriculum, science was still seen as a minor subject by the most prestigious public schools.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The problem was that most of these public schools had close relationships with Oxford and Cambridge universities which offered the majority of their scholarships in classics, and so science was regarded in low importance&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; by the prestigious schools. Consequently, science education varied significantly across English schools. Numerous education-related acts were passed throughout the twentieth century, but the most important in the history of science education in England was the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] (see next subsection). Another act of importance to the development of science education below university-level in England was the Education Act 1944.&lt;ref name="EA1944"&gt;{{cite book|title = Education Act 1944 c31|publisher = HMSO|year = 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1944 act's contribution was indirect though—it raised the compulsory school age to 15, but made provisions for it to be raised to 16 at a future date&lt;ref name="EA1944"/&gt;—which happened in 1972 (which is still the case today). By raising the school leaving age to 16, this formed the [[#Science education in England|basis for creating a nationally organised science curriculum and education in England]]. However, the 1944 Education Act did not stipulate that science be taught.&lt;ref name="EA1944"/&gt; For university-level science education, two significant developments were the expansion of [[Distance education|distance learning]] science courses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/historyofou/story/early-curriculum|title=Early curriculum|author=Open University|date=2017|publisher=Open University|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]] (via the [[Internet]]) into the delivery of science teaching, although this has also been adopted below university-level.

====Education Reform Act 1988====
This was the most important development in the history of science education in England. It was this act that established the National Curriculum and made science compulsory across both secondary and primary schools (alongside [[Mathematics|maths]] and [[English language|English]]).&lt;ref name="ERA1988"/&gt; The 1988 act in effect implemented the recommendation of the Taunton Committee made more than a century earlier. The act also established the now familiar “key stages”.&lt;ref name="ERA1988"/&gt;

===2000s===
The most significant developments to the science curriculum and education in this period to date have been the [[#Changes to GCSE science and its grading system|expansion of the compulsory science content in the National Curriculum and the associated changes to its assessment]]. Another significant event was the passing of the [[Education and Skills Act 2008]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/25/contents|title=Education and Skills Act 2008|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which raised the education leaving age in England to 18. It is unclear whether this extension of compulsory education will result in more science learners as science is not compulsory after the age of 16—the school leaving age, which the 2008 act did not alter.

==Compulsory science content and national assessments==
===Learning aims===
Compulsory science content is provided by the National Curriculum and generally applies to children between the ages of 5 and 16. These eleven years of compulsory education are divided by the state into four key stages: KS1, KS2, KS3 and KS4. Regardless of key stage, the National Curriculum states two overarching aims of science education:&lt;ref name="KS1and2"&gt;{{cite book|last = Department for Education|authorlink = Department for Education|title = Science programmes of study: key stages 1 and 2 – National curriculum in England|publisher = Department for Education|series = Programmes of study by subject|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KS3"&gt;{{cite book|last = Department for Education|authorlink = Department for Education|title = Science programmes of study: key stages 3 – National curriculum in England|publisher = Department for Education|series = Programmes of study by subject|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KS4"&gt;{{cite book|last = Department for Education|authorlink = Department for Education|title = Science programmes of study: key stages 4 – National curriculum in England|publisher = Department for Education|series = Programmes of study by subject|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics
* develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science through different types of science enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them
A third aim is common to KS1–3:
* ''are equipped with the scientific knowledge required to understand the uses and implications of science, today and for the future.''
But for KS4, the third aim is far more detailed, and there is also a fourth aim:
* ''develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry, problem-solving skills and mathematical skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other environments;''
* ''develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.''
The need for mathematical skills is stressed by the National Curriculum across all key stages, but more so at KS3 and KS4.

===Pedagogical considerations===
The National Curriculum for science is a [[spiral curriculum]]; it is also prescriptive. Because of its spiral nature, this makes its learning essentially [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]]. These points are illustrated in the subsections that follow. In addition, the Science National Curriculum emphasises the need for [[active learning]] right from the child’s earliest exposure to the curriculum. Research on the value of active learning has been demonstrated and published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=S.|last2=Eddy|first2=S.L.|last3=McDonough|first3=M.|last4=Smith|first4=M.K.|last5=Okoroafor|first5=N.|last6=Jordt|first6=H.|last7=Wenderoth|first7=M.P.|year=2014|title=Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics|journal=PNAS|volume=111|issue=23|pages=8410–5|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|doi=10.1073/pnas.1319030111|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410|accessdate=10 August 2017 |pmc=4060654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimentation by the child is underscored in the curriculum accompanied by careful discussion of what was observed. Despite these positive features, it has been argued that evaluating the effectiveness of the National Curriculum on learning is difficult to answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bera.ac.uk/blog/how-do-you-measure-a-national-curriculum|title=How do you measure a national curriculum?|author=Wyse, D.|date=27 July 2015|work=The BERA Blog: Research Matters|publisher=British Educational Research Association|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KS1===
Key stage 1 (KS1) covers the first two years of compulsory school education in the National Curriculum. As such, the years are referred to as years 1 and 2. Children are typically in the age range 5–7. The emphasis of science at this stage is observation and describing or drawing things that the child can see, either around them or from a book or photograph or video; the feel of materials is also an important feature of KS1 science. Abstract concepts in science are not introduced at this stage (at least not on the basis of the National Curriculum). As a result, the science curriculum at KS1 is more or less plants and animals, and materials, with the emphasis on what can easily be seen or described by feeling things.&lt;ref name="KS1and2"/&gt;

===KS2 (including SATs, 11+ CEs, and teacher assessments)===
Key stage 2 (KS2) covers years 3, 4, 5 and 6 of compulsory school education in the National Curriculum. It is the longest stage of compulsory school education in England. Children are typically in the age range 7–11. The National Curriculum divides KS2 into lower KS2 (years 3 and 4) and upper KS2 (years 5 and 6). Year 3 continues from KS1, but more complex observations for the child to do on plants and animals, and materials—rocks, fossils and soils, are brought in. Setting up simple experiments and recording data become increasingly important at this stage. Hazards and dangers of certain scientific experiments (such as feeling things after they have been heated) are drilled into pupils; necessary precautions against such dangers/hazards are taught. New areas are introduced: light (and the dangers of looking directly at sunlight with necessary precautions), forces and magnets. In year 4, classification of living and non-living things come to the fore; additional areas introduced include:&lt;ref name="KS1and2"/&gt;
* Environmental change
* Digestive system and food chains
* States of matter
* Sound
* Electricity
In years 5 and 6 (upper KS2), the National Curriculum states that the emphasis should be on enabling pupils develop a deeper understanding of scientific ideas. The need to read, spell and pronounce scientific vocabulary correctly is emphasised by the National Curriculum. This emphasis probably reflects the fact that by the age of 9, 10 or 11, a child in England should be able to read and write properly. Year 5 continues on from year 4; studying increasingly more complex aspects of what was introduced in year 4. Also the pupil starts to learn about accepting or ''refuting'' ideas based on scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="KS1and2"/&gt; Additional areas include:
* Life cycles
* Reproduction in some plants and animals
* Growing old
* Properties and changes of materials
* Earth and space
Year 6 not only continues on from year 5, adding more complex aspects of what was learnt in year 5, but also prepares the pupil for KS3 science; additional areas include:
* Circulatory system
* Drugs and lifestyle
* Evolution and inheritance

====SATs and teacher assessments====
Between the early 1990s and early 2010s, state school pupils had to take statutory [[National Curriculum assessment|SAT exams]] at the end of KS2 science although [[National Curriculum assessment|teacher assessments]] were also allowed. The KS2 SAT science exam consisted of two papers (forty-five minutes each).&lt;ref name="SAT KS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satspapers.org.uk/Page.aspx?TId=5|title=KS2 Year 6 SATs Papers|author=SatsPapers.org.uk|date=2017|publisher=SatsPapers.org.uk 
|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scores from both papers were combined to give a final score. This score would then be converted into a ''numerical'' level, which would in turn be converted into an ''expectation'' level. The conversion scale for the levels at KS2 SAT science is shown in the table below.

|-

|}

Level 6 (exceptional) was also available, but only in mathematics and English (reading); a separate test for level 6 assessment had to be taken, which had to be marked externally. Science KS2 SATs were discontinued in 2013 and replaced by teacher assessments (which were already allowed during the time of SATs). In addition to teacher assessments, a SAT replacement assessment called ''key stage 2 science sampling test'' is now offered to five randomly selected pupils in a school every two years. The test comprises three papers: ‘b’ for biology, ‘c’ for chemistry, and ‘p’ for physics (each twenty-five minutes). The aim of the tests is to assess how well children are getting on with the curriculum. The first test of this kind was in the summer of 2016.&lt;ref name="SAT KS2"/&gt;

====11+ CEs (Common Entrance Examination)====
This exam is taken by KS2 pupils wishing to be admitted into independent senior schools for KS3 study and higher (although not all senior schools admit 11-year-olds). The exam is typically taken while the pupil is in prep school, although some state school pupils use the exam to make the transition to an independent school. The syllabus for the 11+ CE science exam&lt;ref name="ISEB"&gt;{{cite book|last = Independent Schools Examinations Board|authorlink = Independent Schools Examinations Board|title = Common Entrance Examination at 11+ and 13+: Science Syllabus|publisher = Independent Schools Examinations Board|year = 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the National Curriculum for KS2 science;&lt;ref name="KS1and2"/&gt; one paper for science (one hour) is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iseb.co.uk/Schools/Examination-syllabuses-specimen-papers/Common-Entrance-at-11|title=Examination syllabuses &amp; specimen papers|author=Independent Schools Examinations Board|date=2017|publisher=ISEB|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the examinable syllabus for the 11+ CE, there is also prep-KS3 science material for the pupil to cover;&lt;ref name="ISEB"/&gt; this prep-KS3 science material is not examinable, but is required as preparation for KS3 science study in senior school if admitted.

===The ‘traditional’ three sciences for KS3 and KS4===
The National Curriculum for KS3–4 science differs from KS1–2 not just in its complexity, but unlike the latter, the science curriculum is divided into three explicit parts: biology, chemistry and physics. Typically in a state secondary school there can be anything from one to up to three (or even more) teachers delivering science to a single class (depending on the breadth of knowledge of the teacher and staff resources of the school). Broadly speaking, similar areas are covered at both stages (that is KS3 and KS4), but at a more advanced level in KS4. Below is a broad (and simplified) summary of the curriculum of each part at KS3/4 level.&lt;ref name="KS3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KS4"/&gt;

====Biology====
Defined in the National Curriculum as:
:''... the science of living organisms (including animals, plants, fungi and microorganisms) and their interactions with each other and the environment.''
The content for KS3/4 biology in the National Curriculum is broadly:
* Cell biology and organisation
* Body systems (vary between KS3 and KS4)
* Biochemistry
* Health, disease and medicines
* Photosynthesis
* Ecosystem
* Genetics and inheritance
* Variation within and between species, and evolution

====Chemistry====
Defined in the National Curriculum as:
:''... the science of the composition, structure, properties and reactions of matter, understood in terms of atoms, atomic particles and the way they are arranged and link together.''
The content for KS3/4 chemistry in the National Curriculum is broadly:
* Atoms, elements, mixtures, compounds and the particulate nature of matter
* The periodic table and periodicity
* Properties of matter
* Chemical reactions and changes
* Chemical analysis
* Energetics
* Materials (both natural and synthetic)
* Earth and atmosphere

====Physics====
Defined in the National Curriculum as:
:''... the science of the fundamental concepts of field, force, radiation and particle structures, which are inter-linked to form unified models of the behaviour of the material universe.''
The content for KS3/4 physics in the National Curriculum is broadly:
* Energy
* Forces and motion
* Waves (including sound and light) and electromagnetic waves (KS4)
* Electricity, magnetism and electromagnetism
* Physical nature of matter
* Particle model of matter
* Atomic structure (and radioactivity (KS4))
* Space physics (not always covered at KS4; depends on the GCSE exam board)

===KS3 (including SATs, 13+ CEs, and teacher assessments)===
Key stage 3 (KS3) covers years 7, 8 and 9 of compulsory school education in the National Curriculum. Pupils are typically in the age range 11–14.

====SATs and teacher assessments====
Between the early 1990s and late 2000s (‘late noughties’) state school pupils had to take statutory SAT exams at the end of KS3 science (just like KS2), although teacher assessments were also allowed. The KS3 SAT science exam consisted of two papers (one hour each). The scores from both papers were combined to give a final score. This score would then be converted into a numerical level, which would in turn be converted into an expectation level. The conversion scale for the levels at KS3 SAT is shown below.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;margin:0px;"
|- 
! style="width:20em;" |Numerical level

|-
|4
|-
|5 ||rowspan="2" |At expected level
|-
|6
|-
|7 ||Beyond expectations
|-
|8 ||Exceptional
|}

The conversion of the raw score from the two papers to a numerical level depended on the ‘tier’ taken by the student. For science KS3 SATs, two tiers were available: lower tier and higher tier. Levels 3–6 were available at the lower tier while levels 5–7 were available at the higher tier. The conversion scale for each tier’s scores are shown below.

Level 8 (exceptional) was not available to science KS3 SATs (not even at the higher tier); it was available to mathematics, but only at the highest tier (levels 6–8) out of four tiers that were available to mathematics KS3 SATs. Science KS3 SATs were discontinued in 2010 and replaced by teacher assessments (just like science KS2 SATs). Despite the discontinuation of statutory science KS3 SATs, the past papers are still used by schools today.&lt;ref name="SAT KS3"/&gt;

====13+ CEs (Common Entrance Examination)====
Like the 11+ CEs, the 13+ CEs are taken by pupils wishing to be admitted to independent senior schools; in this case for KS4 study and higher. The exam is typically taken while the pupil is in prep school (some senior schools only admit from the age of 13). Some state school pupils use the exam to make the transition to an independent school. The syllabus for the 13+ CE science exam(s)&lt;ref name="ISEB"/&gt; is based on the National Curriculum for KS3 science,&lt;ref name="KS3"/&gt; although not all of the KS3 science content is examinable in the CE, but the parts left out are recommended for teaching in year 9.&lt;ref name="ISEB"/&gt; For the exam the candidate can take either the simpler one paper in science (one hour) comprising biology, chemistry and physics parts, or three higher (and harder) papers (forty minutes each)—one in biology, one in chemistry, and one in physics.&lt;ref name="ISEB"/&gt; In addiion, individual senior schools may have exams for entry into other years; for example, 14+, 16+ (for [[Key Stage 5|post-16 or ‘KS5’]] study); details of which they give on their websites.

===KS4 (including GCSEs)===
Key stage 4 (KS4) covers years 10 and 11 of compulsory school education, but it may start earlier for science (and mathematics) in some schools. Pupils are typically in the age range 14–16. At the end of KS4, students have to take statutory GCSE exams, which can be taken at either foundation tier or higher tier. Science GCSEs can be complicated in that they offer a vast array of ‘routes’ although this has simplified somewhat following recent changes to GCSEs.&lt;ref name="WHSmith"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.whsmith.co.uk/changes-to-the-national-curriculum-in-england-2015/|title=Changes to the National Curriculum in England|author=WHSmith|date=29 July 2017|work=WHSmith Blog|publisher=WHSmith|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/science/gcse/combined-science-trilogy-8464|title=GCSE Combined Science: Trilogy|author=AQA|date=2017|publisher=AQA|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/demo/en/qualifications/edexcel-gcses/science-2011-mixed.html|title=Edexcel GCSE: Science - Mixed science route (2011)|author=Pearson|date=2017|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edexcel2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/demo/en/qualifications/edexcel-gcses/sciences-2016.html|title=Edexcel GCSE: Sciences (2016)|author=Pearson|date=2017|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today science GCSE can be taken either as a combined single subject (which is worth two GCSEs) or as the three separate subjects of physics, chemistry and biology, (each worth a single GCSE in its own right). When biology, chemistry and physics are taken as separate GCSE subjects the tiers can be mixed. So for instance, a student could take say, biology at higher tier, but chemistry at foundation tier. By contrast, tiers cannot be mixed in combined science (that is, all constituent parts must be taken at the same tier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Edexcel|authorlink = Edexcel|title = Pearson Edexcel Level 1/Level 2 GCSE (9-1) in Combined Science – Specification|publisher = Pearson Education|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = OCR|authorlink = Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations|title = GCSE (9–1) in Combined Science A (Gateway Science)|publisher = OCR|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments (also called ''practicals'') are compulsory in the GCSE science course, but in different ways across the boards offering GCSE science to English schools. For most boards the results of the practicals do not count towards the final grade in the reformed GCSE (as this is determined entirely by the results of the written examination), but the school/college must submit a signed ''practical science statement'' to the board under which the science is being studied BEFORE the students can take the examination. The statement must declare that all students have completed all the required practicals. The skills and knowledge that should have been acquired from the practicals are subsequently assessed in the GCSE exams, which for most boards are entirely written (as alluded to earlier). For one board ([[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment|CCEA]]) however, in addition to the examination of practical skills in the written papers, the results of some of the actual practicals do count towards the final grade in the reformed GCSE. Currently, GCSE sciences in England are available from five boards: [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]], [[Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations|OCR]], [[Edexcel]]. [[Eduqas|WJEC-Eduqas]] and CCEA. Although all five boards provide GCSE science to English schools, not all of these boards are based in England: AQA, OCR and Edexcel are based in England, but WJEC-Eduqas is based in Wales, while CCEA is based in Northern Ireland. Schools are free to choose any board for their science, and where the three sciences of chemistry, physics and biology are being taken independently at GCSE level, all three sciences need not be taken from the same board. Some boards offer multiple routes for their combined science courses in the reformed GCSE in England.

====AQA combined science====
Following recent changes, a student can go for one of two routes if taking AQA combined science: ''trilogy'' or ''synergy''.&lt;ref name="AQA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/science/gcse|title=GCSE Science: Specifications|author=AQA|date=2017|publisher=AQA|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In trilogy, science is delivered in the three traditional parts of biology, chemistry and physics. The trilogy specification document [http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/science/gcse] outlines topics for each science part and practicals are specified. The trilogy GCSE exam itself is made up of six papers (each one hour and fifteen minutes): two for biology, two for chemistry, and two for physics. In synergy, science is delivered in two parts: ''life and environmental sciences'' AND ''physical sciences''. Unlike trilogy, each of the two parts in the synergy specification document [http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/science/gcse] is broken down into ‘areas’ that enable biology, chemistry and physics to sit together. The synergy GCSE exam itself is made up of four papers (each one hour and forty-five minutes): two for life and environmental sciences and two for physical sciences.

====OCR combined science====
Like AQA combined science, following recent changes, a student can go for one of two routes if taking OCR combined science; in this case either ''combined science A'' or ''combined science B''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/by-subject/science/|title=OCR: Science|author=OCR|date=2017|publisher=2017|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combined science A, science is delivered in the three traditional parts of biology, chemistry and physics. Like AQA's trilogy, each science part is broken into topics in combined science A's specification document [http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse-gateway-science-suite-combined-science-a-j250-from-2016/], but unlike AQA combined science, practicals are suggested rather than specified, although practicals are still compulsory (the same goes for combined science B). The GCSE combined science A exam is made up of six papers (each one hour and ten minutes): two each for biology, chemistry and physics respectively. In combined science B, the science curriculum is delivered in four parts: biology, chemistry, physics and combined science. Each part is broken into topics in the combined science B specification document [http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse-twenty-first-century-science-suite-combined-science-b-j260-from-2016/]. The exam itself is made up of four papers (each one hour and forty-five minutes): one each for biology, chemistry, physics and combined science respectively.

====Combined science from Edexcel or WJEC–Eduqas====
Following the changes to GCSEs, only one route is available to the student that takes Edexcel or Eduqas combined science.&lt;ref name="Edexcel2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduqas.co.uk/qualifications/combined-science/index.html|title=GCSE (9-1) Combined Science|author=Eduqas|date=2017|publisher=WJEC CBAC|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Edexcel's combined science specification document [https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/edexcel-gcses/sciences-2016.html] the curriculum is delivered in the three traditional disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics, but in Eduqas's [http://www.eduqas.co.uk/qualifications/combined-science/index.html], the science curriculum is divided into four parts: ''Concepts in Biology'', '' Concepts in Chemistry'', ''Concepts in Physics'' and ''Applications in Science''. The Eduqas combined science exam is made up of four papers (one hour and forty-five minutes each): one for each of the three 'Concepts in ...' and one for 'Applications in Science'. The Edexcel exam is made up of six papers (each one hour and ten minutes): two each for biology, chemistry and physics respectively.

====New double award science from CCEA====
The new combined science from CCEA since the GCSE reforms retains the same name as its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccea.org.uk/general_science/|title=GCSE Double Award Science: For first teaching from September 2017|author=Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment|date=2015|publisher=CCEA|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specification document [http://ccea.org.uk/general_science/] presents the science curriculum in the traditional disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics. The exam is the most extensive of the GCSE science boards; made up of nine papers and three practical exams. For each of biology, chemistry and physics there are three papers and one practical exam: Paper 1 is one hour long, Paper 2 is one hour and fifteen minutes, Paper 3 is a practical skills paper and is thirty minutes long, and the practical exam is one hour long.

====Changes to GCSE science and its grading system====
As alluded to earlier, in the mid-2010s, the GCSE science courses of the GCSE exam boards underwent significant changes. This was in part due to changes in the National Curriculum, of which one of the areas affected the most was key stage 4 (KS4). The revised version of the National Curriculum covered more content;&lt;ref name="WHSmith"/&gt; the one for KS4 science was published in December 2014 and a version specifically for GCSE combined science was published in June 2015,&lt;ref name="GCSE"&gt;{{cite book|last = Department for Education|authorlink = Department for Education|title = Combined science: GCSE subject content|publisher = Department for Education|series = GCSE subject content|year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/get-the-facts-gcse-and-a-level-reform/get-the-facts-gcse-reform|title=Get the facts: GCSE reform|author=Ofqual|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased content triggered a change in the GCSE grading system from A*–G to 9–1. Much more detail on the new grading system and how it differs from the previous can be read [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|here]]. One consequence of the increased science content in the National Curriculum was that it helped simplify a bewildering array of GCSE science courses particularly from AQA, which are/were designed to accommodate students from the least able to the most able.&lt;ref name="AQA"/&gt; AQA science courses such as core science, additional science, further additional science, science A, science B, additional applied science illustrate the variety.&lt;ref name="AQA"/&gt; The new trilogy and synergy courses (which were developed from the recently expanded National Curriculum for science) have removed the need for the most able students to take multiple science courses&lt;ref name="AQA"/&gt; unless the student decides to take chemistry, biology and physics individually. The content for GCSE physics as a stand-alone subject is more than the content for physics in GCSE combined science. For instance, in the National Curriculum for KS4 science,&lt;ref name="KS4"/&gt; space physics is included, but not in the GCSE combined science version.&lt;ref name="GCSE"/&gt; AQA includes space physics in its GCSE specification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = AQA|authorlink = Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|title = GCSE Physics (8463). For exams 2018 onwards. Version 1.0|publisher = AQA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only when GCSE physics is taken as an independent subject in its own right, and not when physics is taken as part of GCSE combined science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = AQA|authorlink = Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|title = GCSE Combined Science: Trilogy (8464). For exams 2018 onwards. Version 1.0|publisher = AQA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science education post-16 or ‘KS5’==
For the ages of 16, 17 and 18 (and older for those that remain in education below university-level), students in England do what is sometimes loosely called ‘key stage 5’ or KS5; it has no legal meaning (unlike the other key stages). And unlike KS1–4 in which the levels of complexity of topics learnt at each stage are [[#Compulsory science content and national assessments|prescribed within relatively narrow limits]], at KS5, the levels of complexity of topics cover a wide range, although the highest level of complexity at KS5 is [[National qualifications frameworks in the United Kingdom|RQF level 3]]. Whether or not a student actually studies at this level of complexity in KS5 depends on his/her GCSE results—crucially on what subjects the student obtained passes at RQF level 2 standard (including mathematics and English) as well as the actual grades themselves. In other words, unlike KS1–4, where a specific student studies at one RQF level, at KS5, a specific student may be studying at several RQF levels depending on what s/he obtained at GCSEs. Regardless of the RQF-level mix, a KS5 student can do his/her post-16 study in one of the following:
* School with a [[sixth form]]
* [[Sixth form college#England|Stand-alone sixth form college]]
* [[Further education|Further education college]]
* [[Apprenticeship]]
* Traineeship

This can be done either full-time or part-time. If done part-time, the student also has to be working or volunteering for at least 20 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school|title=School leaving age|author=Gov.uk|work=Education and learning: Schools and curriculum|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As already hinted, the science curriculum and education at KS5 is highly varied, often disparate and tends to be specialised as students in their late teens interested in science begin to study subjects that will prepare them for science careers. In KS5 study at RQF level 3, students are introduced to concepts they would never have heard of during their time from KS1 to KS4, which they will either study in much greater depth at university-level (if s/he continues to study the science in question) or apply at [[Vocational education|vocational]] placements or [[apprenticeship]]s. Practical science at KS5–RQF level 3 can be more extensive. Individual A levels in chemistry, biology and physics are perhaps the best known KS5–RQF level 3 science subjects (and they take two years to complete when done full-time), but A level students may well choose only one or two of these subjects, and mix with mathematics or non-science A level subjects depending on what university degree the student wishes to study post-KS5 (typically A level students go straight to university on successful completion of A levels). Although A levels are probably the highest profile KS5 studies, there are other qualifications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/education/key-stage-5-exam-marking-qualifications-and-results|title=Key stage 5 exam marking, qualifications and results|author=Gov.uk|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; students can take as alternatives. KS5 science subjects (including [[Laboratory|laboratory science]]) can also be taken in [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTECs]], [[Cambridge Pre-U]]s, [[International Baccalaureate|IBs]], AQAs (non-A levels), OCRs (non-A levels). [[National Vocational Qualification|NVQs]], [[Foundation programme|university specific foundation year programmes]] (generally offered to students that have taken A levels, but not the correct ones; can also be offered to those that have failed their A levels), [[Access to Higher Education|access to HEs]] (generally not available to students under 21). Although all these alternative non-A level qualifications (which are all available at RQF level 3) can offer content similar in complexity to their A/AS level counterparts (which are also RQF level 3), the make-up of their content can vary significantly depending on the subject, and the board offering it. A comprehensive list of most subjects at most levels and the boards offering them is kept by the [[National Careers Service]] and individual subjects and their boards can be searched for on their website [https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/course-directory/home]. A search tool for only Ofqual approved list of subjects and their boards can be found at ''Ofqual: The Register''[https://register.ofqual.gov.uk/]; the list can also be downloaded from the site, while a search tool for only QAA approved access to HE subjects can be found at ''Access to Higher Education''[http://www.accesstohe.ac.uk/Pages/Default.aspx]. Both the National Careers Service and Ofqual lists include all A/AS levels, GCSEs (RQF levels 1–2) and most of the rest (RQF levels 1–8, and the RQF entry level (which is below RQF level 1)). With regards to universities in England accepting RQF level 3 science subjects for their science degrees, students with only non-A level science subjects may be accepted, or the student may require a mixture of some of these non-A level science subjects with one or two A/AS level science subjects. This all depends on the level 3 qualification in question, the university, and science degree the student wishes to study. Individual universities give details of their entry requirements for their various science (and obviously all) degrees on their websites. Some RQF level 3 students may use the KS5 science subjects they study for entry into higher/degree apprenticeships or university-level vocational training.

===Adult returners to education===
{{Main|Adult learner}}
Beyond 18 years of age, students that have already either left or finished their formal education, but return at later times in their lives to study science (having decided they do not have the appropriate level of knowledge), can do so on their return at RQF level 3 or lower. The level the student returns at will depend on his/her pre-enrollment level of knowledge of science, although science is generally not available below RQF level 1 (that is, the RQF entry (sub-1) level) to adult returners to education (but maths and English are). Typically, further education colleges admit adult returners, although some universities may offer distance learning courses. Further education and distance learning courses are often the ways these [[Adult learner|mature students]] can access science courses long after they have left education. Just like students that have neither left nor previously finished their education, satisfactorily passing the summative assessment at RQF level 3 is the crucial gateway into university-level education (that is RQF level 4 and higher) in England. In addition to satisfactory passes in science subjects at RQF level 3, the learner also has to have passed mathematics and English at RQF level 2 standard (typically GCSEs or equivalent with minimum (or equivalent minimum) grades of 'C' or '4'); providers of university-level education give details on their websites.

==Science education at university-level==
Like post-16 or KS5, this is also highly varied, disparate and specialised, but more so, as a student may chose to study 'one' science, which s/he will subsequently study in depth for three or more years; the [[summative assessment]] leads to a [[Academic degree#England, Wales and Northern Ireland|degree]] (of which for science in England today is typically one of  two levels—RQF level 6 or 7). Such education will enable students market themselves as (specialist) scientists to employers or [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] science degree programmes (although the choices available to the graduate are affected by the [[Academic degree#United Kingdom|class of degree]] the graduate achieves—recruiters give details on their websites). Many concepts the student first encountered in A levels / RQF level 3 are dealt with in much greater detail. The biggest difference between A level / RQF level 3 science and university-level science occurs in physics, which at university-level becomes highly mathematical (and at times [[Mathematical physics|difficult to distinguish from mathematics]]). Practical science at university-level can be quite extensive and by the time of the [[Thesis|dissertation]] project, the student may well be doing complex experiments lasting weeks or months unsupervised (although s/he will still have a supervisor on hand). Science degrees in England are offered by both universities and some further education colleges. University-level teachers (also referred to in England as ''lecturers'') will teach one area of the science the student is studying, but two notable differences between university-level science education in further education colleges and universities are that in universities, there is a close connection between teaching and research. In other words, it is common for a university teacher to be a researcher in the area s/he teaches—this applies not just to science, but to all areas; such connection between teaching and research does not occur in further education colleges in England. And the other difference is that further education colleges must have their degrees approved by universities. Although universities do not need approval for their science degrees and are free to set their own content, they generally get many of their science courses accredited by professional bodies. So for example, universities offering biology degrees commonly get these programmes accredited by the [[Royal Society of Biology]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rsb.org.uk/education/accreditation/institutions/Accreditation|title=Degree accreditation programme|author=Royal Society of Biology|date=2017|publisher=Royal Society of Biology|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for chemistry degrees, it is the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/courses-and-careers/accredited-courses/|title=Accredited Degree Programmes|author=Royal Society of Chemistry|date=2017|work=Chemistry Courses and Careers|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for physics degrees, it is the [[Institute of Physics]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.iop.org/education/higher_education/accreditation/file_69855.pdf|title=Register of Accredited Courses|author=IOP: Institute of Physics|date=June 2017|publisher=Institute of Physics|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[geology]] degrees, it is the [[Geological Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/accreditation|title=Accredited Degrees &amp; University Departments|author=Geological Society|date=2012|publisher=Geological Society of London|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so on. Accreditation of a science degree by a professional body is a precondition if the student studying the degree is to become a member of the body following graduation, and subsequently acquire [[Chartered (professional)|chartered status]]. In addition, UK universities are obliged to ensure that their degrees meet the standards agreed to in the Bologna Process to which the UK is a co-signatory. The QAA [[Universities in the United Kingdom#Academic standards|certifies those British degrees that meet those standards]]. Not all university-level students studying science study for science degrees; many will study science as part of a vocational degree such as [[pharmacy]], [[medicine]], [[dentistry]], [[nursing]], [[veterinary medicine]], [[allied health professions]], and so on. And some will study science as part of a higher/degree apprenticeship.

==Challenges for science education in England==
The challenges of establishing a national curriculum for science below university-level in England over the last two centuries have been explored by Smith (2010)&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; and others. In Smith's paper, she highlighted two potentially conflicting roles for science education below university-level: educating a public to be scientifically literate, and providing scientific training for aspiring science professionals. Smith further pointed out in her paper that even among the training of aspiring science professionals, three groups could be identified: those that sought science in pursuance of the truth and an abstract understanding of science; those that sought science for actual benefit to society—the applied scientists, and then the failures. The dilemma did not escape the committee led by [[J. J. Thomson|J J Thomson]] (discoverer of the [[electron]]) in 1918, which is quite telling of the tension in trying to accommodate several very different groups of science learners:
:In framing a course in Science for boys up to the age of 16 it should be recognised that for many this will be the main, for some the only, opportunity of obtaining a knowledge of Science, and that the course should therefore be self-contained, and designed so as to give special attention to those natural phenomena which are matters of everyday experience, in fine, that the Science taught in it should be kept as closely connected with human interests as possible.
:::::::::::::::::::::(Report by Thomson Committee, 1918: p23&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite book|last = Committee led by Thomson|first = J.J.|authorlink = J. J. Thomson|title = The Position of Natural Science: Educational System of Great Britain|publisher = HMSO|year = 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
Such tension has never really dissipated.&lt;ref name="RS"&gt;{{cite book|last = Royal Society|first = The|authorlink = Royal Society
|title = A ‘state of the nation’ report 2008: Science and mathematics education, 14–19
|publisher = Royal Society|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-85403-712-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report by the Royal Society from 2008,&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt; they state several challenges facing science education; the first two are reproduced here:

The first:
:provide science and mathematics education appropriate for students of all levels of attainment in an environment where more students remain in education post-16;
and the second: 
:give a solid core grounding in science and mathematics to those who will probably not continue studying these subjects post-16;
::::::::::::::::::::::(Report by the Royal Society, 2008: p17&lt;ref name="RS"/&gt;)
A lack of good quality teachers has also been cited as a challenge.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson"/&gt; Difficulty recruiting science teachers, which is a current problem in England (and the UK as a whole) is certainly not new as the following extract from the report by the Thomson Committee in 1918 shows:
:The first and indispensable condition for any real improvement in the teaching of Science in schools of all kinds is that effective steps should be taken to secure an adequate supply of properly qualified teachers. The supply is inadequate for existing needs ...
:::::::::::::::::::::(Report by Thomson Committee, 1918: p31&lt;ref name="Thomson"/&gt;)
Some interesting figures were quoted in the 1918 report; for instance on page 31 of the report: out of 72 schools that had 200–400 girls of all ages, only 39 had the services of two science teachers (mistresses). The report went on state that these figures had contributed to long hours and inadequate salaries. This sounds strikingly similar to the situation facing science (and indeed all) school teachers in England today; a hundred years later. Another challenge was that there was not an appreciation by the political elite on the value of a science education to the wider public;&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; despite the fact that England was producing some of the greatest scientists in the world. Yet another challenge was that [[#1900s|public schools were slow to respond to the needs of developing a science curriculum]]. For example, [[William Sharp (homeopath)|William Sharp]] was the first science teacher for [[Rugby School]], a prestigious public school in England, which only happened for the first time in 1847; nearly 300 years after the college was established and more than 100 years after England had lost one of the world’s greatest scientists—[[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=J.|year=2012|title=The scientific disciplines: what comes first among equals?|journal=School Science Review|volume=345|pages=109–116|publisher=Association for Science Education|url=https://www.ase.org.uk/journals/school-science-review/2012/6/345/3110/ssr-june-2012-109-115-williams.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these challenges, a science curriculum and education developed through the twentieth century and eventually became a compulsory part of the new National Curriculum in 1988 (phased in from 1989 to 1992). Even at the time of the deliberations in the mid-1980s prior to the creation of the National Curriculum, there was disagreement over how much time science should occupy in the curriculum.&lt;ref name="Frost"&gt;{{cite book|last = Frost|first = J.|title = The Science Curriculum IN Learning to Teach Science in the Secondary School: A Companion to School (J. Frost &amp; T. Turner (Eds))|publisher = RoutledgeFalmer
|year = 2005|isbn = 0-415-28780-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was pressure for science to be made to occupy 20% of curriculum time for 14–16-year-olds, but not everyone agreed with this; certainly not the then [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Secretary of State for Education and Science Kenneth Baker]].&lt;ref name="Frost"/&gt; The then Department for Education and Science settled for 12.5% of curriculum time, but schools were free to increase this. The result was the emergence of single science (which occupied 10% of curriculum time and was the minimum requirement—also called ''core'' science), double science (which occupied 20% of curriculum time, and was so called because it involved studying core science and ''additional'' science), and there was the option of doing the sciences of physics, chemistry and biology separately (also known as 'triple' science).&lt;ref name="Frost"/&gt; Following the changes to the National Curriculum in the 2010s, single science has effectively been removed, and the two components of double science have been combined to form 'combined science', which is now the minimum requirement. One challenge that ties in with England's shortage of science teachers is the number of science undergraduates in higher education, which provides the pool for future trainee science teachers,&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; but undergraduate numbers affect the three sciences differently: the number of students that study physical sciences in higher education (93050 in the year 2012/13) are less than half the students that study biological sciences (201520 in the year 2012/13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Universities UK &amp; HESA|authorlink = Universities UK|title = Patterns and Trends in UK Higher Education|publisher = Universities UK|series = Higher education in focus|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-84036-330-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has had a direct impact on government policy in England; for example, the UK government offers [[Bursary|bursaries]] of £30000 to graduates with first class honours degrees wishing to train as physics teachers in secondary schools in England; for chemistry, the top bursary is £25000, and for biology it is £15000.&lt;ref name="bursary"&gt;{{cite web 
|url=https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/funding-and-salary/overview|title=Get Into Teaching: Bursaries and funding|author=Department for Education|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For students with lower honours degrees in these subjects, correspondingly lower bursaries are offered, but they are still considerable for physics graduates (compared to bursaries offered to trainee teachers of other subjects).&lt;ref name="bursary"/&gt; For instance, a physics graduate with a lower second class honours degree can still attract a bursary of £25000. But the government has also implemented a policy to increase the number of science graduates from UK universities: normally a student in England wishing to study for a [[Undergraduate degree|first degree]] including an [[honours degree]] can get a [[Student loans in the United Kingdom|UK-government-backed student loan]] as long as s/he does not already possess an honours degree. Exceptions are permitted, but prior to September 2017 (and in the case of [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate master's degrees]], September 2016), these UK-government-backed loans for those in England that already had honours degrees were only available for them if the courses they were going to study led to professional qualifications such as medicine, dentistry, [[Social work|social care]], [[architecture]] or [[Teacher|teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nus.org.uk/en/advice/money-and-funding/ive-already-got-a-uk-honours-degree--can-i-get-funding-for-more-higher-education/|title=I’ve already got a UK honours degree – can I get funding for more higher education?|author=National Union of Students|date=22 March 2013|publisher=National Union of Students|accessdate=17 September 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223075035/https://www.nus.org.uk/en/advice/money-and-funding/ive-already-got-a-uk-honours-degree--can-i-get-funding-for-more-higher-education/|archivedate=23 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the range of subjects for which a student in England already in possession of an honours degree could get a second UK-government-backed student loan to study a second honours degree was expanded to include science subjects (as well as [[technology]], [[engineering]] and mathematics), which took effect from 1 September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/fees-and-funding/equivalent-qualifications 
|title=Loans for degree holders in England|author=The Open University|date=2017|publisher=The Open University|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like before, the student has to meet both England and UK residency requirements [https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies]. The inclusion of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (collectively called "[[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM"]] subjects) to the list appears to have been triggered not just by teacher shortages in those subjects, but also by a general skills shortage (in those subjects) UK-wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=M.|date=28 November 2016 
|title=What is the UK doing about its STEM skills shortfall?|journal=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/ready-and-enabled/stem-skills-shortfall/|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains to be seen whether the direct interventions by the UK government help alleviate the general skills shortages in STEM subjects, as well as the challenges of delivering a science curriculum and education in the long-term. As for universities, several challenges have been identified by Grove (2015);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/7-key-challenges-uk-higher-education#survey-answer|title=7 key challenges for UK higher education|author=Grove, J.|date=5 August 2015|work=Times Higher Education (THE): World University Rankings|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the summaries of those challenges have been reproduced below:
* Operating in a global market
* Rising student expectations (as a result of the increased loans [[Student loans in the United Kingdom#Tuition fee loan|students in England have to take to pay their increased tuition fees]])
* Increasing costs and shifting funding ([[Student loans in the United Kingdom#Maintenance grant|as the UK government provides less grants]] and students take on additional loans (on top of the increased tuition fee loans) to compensate)
* A demand and need for new technologies
* Linking estates, strategy and the student
* Attracting and retaining the best talent
* Making research sustainable

These challenges apply not just to the university provision of science education, but to all areas of university education.

As a '''scientific collection''' is referred to
*any systematic collection of objects for the study of [[nature]] or of the [[human history]]
*as well as the institutions, organizations or sub-organizations that build such collections preserve, develop systematically and make accessible and useful. These institutions often examine the collections also itself.

Important objects of research collections 
*in the field of [[Geology]] are in particular [[mineral]]s, [[Rock (geology)|rock]] samples and [[drilling core]]s,
*in the field of [[biology]] in particular [[plants]], [[fungi]], [[animals]], [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[viruses]] and their remains,
*in the field of [[history]] for example, wood samples with [[annual ring]]s, [[pottery]] and [[coin]]s not only for the study of these objects themselves, but also e.g. to determine the age of finds during excavations or [[ice core]]s and cores of [[sediment]]s in lakes for the study of [[climate history]] .

Important goals of these collections are the items collected for research to make tangible and accessible, hold reference objects for comparison purposes as well as the systematization and naming with scientific names of the collected objects ([[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]) .

== Indexing ==
The indexing of the collections was historically made by directories, catalogs, [[index card]]s, today supplemented by or replaced by [[database]]s with information such as e.g. scientific description, including picture, name, location, find circumstances, fund age, scientific analysis, phylogenetic relationships, [[DNA]] and [[isotope analysis]] results, analysis of pollutants, references, condition of the property, owner changes and name changes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.dnfs.de/seite/die-sammlungen Die Sammlungen | Deutsche Naturwissenschaftliche Forschungssammlung&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organisations support the indexing and handling of their collections by specialist libraries.

== Institutions ==
Research collections hold especially [[museum]]s, notably [[natural history museum]]s, [[botanical garden]]s, universities and other research institutions. There are also independent research collections, such as the Zoological State Collection Munich with over 20 million stuffed animals for research purposes. Public authorities such as national geological agencies or police units hold partly research collections too.

The [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]] - with one of the biggest collections worldwide - is home to life and [[earth science]] specimens comprising some 70 million items within five main collections: [[botany]], [[entomology]], [[mineralogy]], [[palaeontology]] and [[zoology]].

Largest German Natural History Museum is the [[Museum für Naturkunde]], [[Berlin]],  with over 30 million objects, including 9 million [[beetle]]s and 275,000 jars with preserved in alcohol animals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

* The most important geological collections in Europe include the [[Museum of the Earth of Polish Academy of Sciences]] in [[Warsaw]] With more than 170,000 minerals, [[meteorite]]s, [[fossil]] and a [[Amber]] collection.

== Biological collections / Life Sciences collections ==

Typical collection objects biology are [[fossil]]s of organisms, in particular plants and animals, plants, and animals killed, and be protected from decay, for example, by drying or preparation, but also live plants, animals, bacteria and viruses.

Plant collections are referred to as [[herbaria]]. Live plants are collected in the [[Botanical garden]]s, ([[tree]]s ) in [[arboretum]]s, [[aquarium]]s, and partly in [[seedbank]]s, as well as e.g. algae from the Culture Collection of Algae Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epsag.uni-goettingen.de/cgi-bin/epsag/website/cgi/show_page.cgi?kuerzel=about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901120126/http://www.epsag.uni-goettingen.de/cgi-bin/epsag/website/cgi/show_page.cgi?kuerzel=about |archivedate=2012-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Live animals are collected in [[zoo]]s and aquariums.
The great Old Botanical Garden of the University of Göttingen e.g. represents about a collection of 17,000 species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/108651.html Georg-August-Universität Göttingen - Alter Botanischer Garten&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly well known in Germany are the major research collections of the [[Naturmuseum Senckenberg]] of Senckenberg Society for Nature Research in [[Frankfurt am Main]] with over 22 million natural objects (Herbaria 1 Million). Senckenberg offers to open up his collection to the SESAM database.

The [[Macaulay Library]] is the world's largest archive of animal sounds. It includes more than 175,000 audio recordings covering 75 percent of the world's bird species. There are an ever increasing numbers of insect, fish, frog, and mammal recordings. The video archive includes over 50,000 clips, representing over 3,500 species.

An example for a special collection are the objects of the [[Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen]] (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures).

== History / Human Heritage collections ==
[[Dendrochronology]] is located on the border between biology and history. An annual ring table or tree-ring calendar is a time series of [[tree ring]] s of [[dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] art tree. Because of the specific growth of each tree species and regional differences of climate, such a table must always refer to a single species from the same region. Important tree chronologies are:
* [[Hohenheimer Jahrringkalender]] (Hohenheim tree-ring calendar), complete 12,483 years back to 10,480 BC in the [[Younger Dryas]]
* [[Aegean Dendrochronology Project]] to 1800 BC, [[Bronze Age]]

A '''scientific demonstration''' is a [[scientific experiment]] carried out for the purposes of demonstrating scientific principles, rather than for [[hypothesis testing]] or knowledge gathering (although they may originally have been carried out for these purposes).

Most scientific demonstrations are simple laboratory demonstrations intended to demonstrate physical principles, often in a surprising or entertaining way. They are carried out in schools and universities, and sometimes in public demonstrations in popular science lectures and TV programs aimed at the general public. Many scientific demonstrations are chosen for their combination of educational merit and entertainment value, which is often provided by dramatic phenomena such as explosions. 

Public scientific demonstrations were a common occurrence in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and have long  been a feature of the British [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], which date back to 1825. In the television era, scientific demonstrations have featured in science-related entertainment shows such as ''[[MythBusters]]'' and ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]''.

==Examples==
Some famous scientific demonstrations include:

* [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]]'s [[reaction time]]
* [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]'s [[camera obscura]], [[Oil lamp|lamp]] experiment and [[magnifying lens]]
* [[Al-Jazari]]'s [[crankshaft]], [[elephant clock]] and programmable [[robot]]s
* [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]]'s [[parasite]]s
* [[Detonation|Detonating]] a cloud of [[flour]]
* [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]]
* [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ball experiments, [[pendulum]] and [[telescope]]
* [[Heron's fountain]] and [[aeolipile]]
* [[Ibn al-Nafis]]' [[pulmonary circulation]] and [[coronary circulation]]
* [[Gyroscope|Gyroscopic]] [[bicycle wheel]]
* [[Nylon rope trick]] 
* [[Prince Rupert's Drop]]s
* Shooting a [[candle]] through a [[Plank (wood)|plank]]
* [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[alarm clock]], [[steam turbine]]
* Using a [[linear motor]] as a gun
* Using compressed air to drive a [[water rocket]]
* Using [[liquid nitrogen]] to shatter a rose
* [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulatory system]]

Note: many scientific demonstrations are potentially dangerous, and should not be attempted without considerable laboratory experience and appropriate safety precautions. Many older well-known scientific demonstrations, once mainstays of science education, are now effectively impossible to demonstrate to an audience without breaking health and safety laws. Some older demonstrations, such as allowing the audience to play with liquid mercury, are sufficiently dangerous that they should not be attempted by anyone under any circumstances.

'''''Sleepers, Wake! Technology and the Future of Work''''' is a book written by [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person135889|title=Prof Hon Barry Jones|last=|first=|date=|website=The University of Melbourne|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally published in 1982 and reprinted many times. A revised and updated edition was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6993736|title=''Sleepers, Wake! : Technology and the Future of Work'' / Barry Jones|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Australia|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the premise that technologically advanced nations are currently passing through a [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] or [[information revolution]], Jones analyzes the unique threats and opportunities of the sudden rise in information to the field such as manufacturing, service employment, and basic income.

Jones argues that science and technology have changed the quality, length, and direction of life in the past century far more than politics, education, ideology, or religion. Therefore, inventors such as [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Henry Ford]] have shaped human experience more broadly and enduringly than [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]].

Some of the book's key points, such as the claim that technological innovation is a major component of economic growth, are more widely accepted now than in 1982. But, to quote Barry Jones himself, "The central thesis was that people were going to be living longer, far longer, ''but it was possible that they would be working a good deal less''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/dimensions/dimensions_future/Transcripts/s616084.htm ''New Dimensions'': "Future of Work"], broadcast transcript, 24 July 2002, with [[George Negus]], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] {{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/BasicIncome|title=Basic income: a radical idea enters the mainstream|last=Arthur|first=Don|date=18 November 2016|website=Parliament of Australia|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{failed verification|date=February 2017}}

Due to the rising issues for the labour force, Jones proposed the need to assist workers in income support and choosing to stay or leave the workforce. However, Jones noted in the 1990 edition that the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Hawke Government|government]] did not pursue the idea of basic income when it won office [[Australian federal election, 1983|in 1983]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Sleepers, Wake!'' analyzes the major changes in the workforce and presents the possible political programs to assist the society in profiting from the technological advancements.

The fourth edition uses [[Census in Australia|1991 Commonwealth census]] data as confirmation of his thesis about changes in the labour force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=525198|title=Sleepers, Wake!: Technology and the Future of Work|last=|first=|date=|website=The ACM Digital Library|dead-url=|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Jones was Australia's [[Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Australia)|Minister for Science]] in the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] [[Hawke–Keating Government|government from 1983]] to 1990.

Some technologies, such as steel, paper or cement manufacturing, have a long lifespan (with minor variations in technology incorporated with time) while in other cases, such as electronic or pharmaceutical products, the lifespan may be quite short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nInjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=The+technology+underlying+the+product+(for+example,+that+of+a+uniquely+flavoured+tea)+may+be+quite+marginal+but+the+process+of+creating+and+managing+its+life+as+a#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20technology%20underlying%20the%20product%20(for%20example%2C%20that%20of%20a%20uniquely%20flavoured%20tea)%20may%20be%20quite%20marginal%20but%20the%20process%20of%20creating%20and%20managing%20its%20life%20as%20a&amp;f=false|title=Proceedings of IAC-MEM 2015 in Vienna|last=group of authors|publisher=Czech Institute of Academic Education z.s., 2015|year=2015|isbn=9788090579156|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TLC associated with a product or technological service is different from product life-cycle (PLC) dealt with in [[product life-cycle management]]. The latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction, marketing measures, and business costs. The ''technology'' underlying the product (for example, that of a uniquely flavoured tea) may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different. 

The technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology, the timeline of recovering cost, and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved. The TLC may, further, be protected during its cycle with [[patents]] and [[trademark]]s seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it.

The ''product'' of the technology may be a commodity such as [[polyethylene]] plastic or a sophisticated product like the [[integrated circuit]]s used in a [[smartphone]].

The development of a ''competitive product'' or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology, making it shorter. Equally, the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements (if any) through leakages also work to reduce a technology's lifespan. Thus, it is apparent that the ''management'' of the TLC is an important aspect of technology development.

Most new technologies follow a similar technology maturity lifecycle describing the [[technological maturity]] of a product. This is not similar to a [[product life cycle management|product life cycle]], but applies to an entire technology, or a generation of a technology.

Technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle. After expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes, producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult, as the [[mature technology|technology matures]].

==The four phases of the technology life-cycle==
The TLC may be seen as composed of four phases:
#The '''research and development  (R&amp;D)''' phase (sometimes called the "bleeding edge") when incomes from inputs are negative and where the prospects of failure are high 
#The '''ascent''' phase when out-of-pocket costs have been recovered and the technology begins to gather strength by going beyond some Point A on the TLC (sometimes called the "leading edge") 
#The '''maturity''' phase when gain is high and stable, the region, going into saturation, marked by M, and 
#The '''decline''' (or decay phase), after a Point D, of reducing fortunes and utility of the technology.

===S-curve===
The shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as S-curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.improvementandinnovation.com/features/article/understanding-s-curve-innovation/|accessdate=15 October 2012|title=Understanding S-curve Innovation|journal=Improvementandinnovation.com|author=Dr. Chandana Jayalath|date=22 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology perception dynamics==
There is usually [[technology hype]] at the introduction of any new technology, but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim.
Because of the [[logistic curve]] nature of technology adoption, it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive.

The two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology's development are:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* fitting an exponential curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming eternal [[exponential growth]]
* fitting a linear curve to the first part of the growth curve, and assuming that take-up of the new technology is disappointing

[[Image:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|Rogers' bell curve|300px]]
Similarly, in the later stages, the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of [[mature technology|technology maturity]] and [[market saturation]].

The [[technology adoption life cycle]] typically occurs in an S curve, as modelled in [[diffusion of innovations]] theory. This is because customers respond to new products in different ways. Diffusion of innovations theory, pioneered by [[Everett Rogers]], posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new [[innovation]]s and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption. Rogers classified individuals into five groups: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards. In terms of the S curve, innovators occupy 2.5%, early adopters 13.5%, early majority 34%, late majority 34%, and laggards 16%.

The four stages of technology life cycle are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.scribd.com/doc/20309856/Technology-Management-Growth-Lifecycle Technology Management - Growth &amp; Lifecycle], Shahid kv, Sep 28, 2009, Attribution Non-commercial&lt;/ref&gt;
*Innovation stage: This stage represents the birth of a new product, material of process resulting from R&amp;D activities. In R&amp;D laboratories, new ideas are generated depending on gaining needs and knowledge factors. Depending on the resource allocation and also the change element, the time taken in the innovation stage as well as in the subsequent stages varies widely.
*Syndication stage: This stage represents the demonstration and commercialisation of a new technology, such as, product, material or process with potential for immediate utilisation. Many innovations are put on hold in R&amp;D laboratories. Only a very small percentage of these are commercialised. Commercialisation of research outcomes depends on technical as well non-technical, mostly economic factors.
*[[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]] stage: This represents the market penetration of a new technology through acceptance of the innovation, by potential users of the technology. But supply and demand side factors jointly influence the rate of diffusion.
*Substitution stage: This last stage represents the decline in the use and eventual extension of a technology, due to replacement by another technology. Many technical and non-technical factors influence the rate of substitution. The time taken in the substitution stage depends on the market dynamics.

==Licensing options==
Large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing. The tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the TLC (business gain) as discussed later.&lt;ref&gt;Bayus, B. (1998). An Analysis of Product Lifetimes in a Technologically Dynamic Industry. Management Science, 44(6), pp.763-775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Licensing in the R&amp;D phase===
There are always smaller firms ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]) who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative R&amp;D in the post-research and early technology phases. By sharing incipient technology under certain conditions,  substantial risk financing can come from third parties. This is a form of quasi-licensing which takes different formats. Even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in  areas of significant and high risk (e.g. aircraft development) and may seek means of spreading  it to the stage that proof-of-concept is obtained.

In the case of small and medium firms, entities such as [[venture capitalists]] or business angels, can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies. Venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of R&amp;D, and that of market acceptance, in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself. Apart from finance, they may provide networking, management and marketing support. Venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital.

Larger firms may opt for Joint R&amp;D or work in a consortium for the early phase of development. Such vehicles are called [[strategic alliance]]s – strategic partnerships.
 
With both venture capital funding and strategic (research) alliances, when business gains begin to neutralize development costs (the TLC crosses the X-axis), the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change.

In the case  of smaller firms, venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development, maturation of  technology, product promotion and to meet marketing costs. A major route is through [[Initial Public Offering|initial public offering]] (IPO) which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain. At the same time, the IPOs enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre-allotted to them (subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange). When the IPO is fully subscribed, the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans, etc. if needed.

Strategic alliance partners, allied on research, pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as 'cross-licensing'. Generally, contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation; in which case the optee owns all subsequent development.

===Licensing in the ascent phase ===
The ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above Point A in the TLC diagram but actually it  commences when the R&amp;D portion of the TLC curve inflects (only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to Point A). The ascent is the strongest phase of the TLC because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain. The slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain, although they may not be ''as successful'' in that period. Strongly patented technology extends  the duration period.

The TLC begins to flatten out (the region shown as M) when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare.

Till this stage is reached, the technology-owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability, preferring ''not'' to license it. If an overseas opportunity does present itself, the firm would prefer to set up a  controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party.

===Licensing in the maturity phase===
The maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its 'vital life'. However, there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of  decline in profitability (or competitivity) and to expand financial opportunity.

The exercise of this option is, generally, inferior to seeking participatory exploitation; in other words, engagement in [[joint venture]], typically in regions where the technology would be in the ''ascent phase'',as say, a developing country. In addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the   technology-owner a degree of control over its use. Gain flows from the two streams of investment-based and royalty incomes. Further, the vital life of the technology is enhanced  in such strategy.

===Licensing in the decline phase===
After reaching a point such as D in the above diagram, the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly. To prolong the life cycle, owners of technology might try to license it out at  some point L when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets. This, then, traces the lengthening path, LL'. Further, since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space, licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology (than what prevailed during its vital life).

Licenses obtained in this phase are 'straight licenses'. They are free of direct control from the owner of the technology (as would otherwise apply, say, in the case of a joint-venture). Further, there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology.

The utility, viability, and thus the cost of straight-licenses depends on the estimated 'balance life' of the technology. For instance, should the key patent on the technology have expired, or would expire in a short while, the residual viability of the technology may be limited, although balance life may be governed by other criteria such as [[knowhow]] which could have a longer life if properly protected.

''It is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime, and competing technologies, are on their TLCs''. It would, of course, be evident to competing licensor firms, and to the originator, from the growth, saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations.

The license may, however, be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms. A lower cost, or easier terms, ''may'' imply a declining technology.

In any case, access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts. (In a joint-venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor  sharing it). Sometimes, financial guarantees from the licensor may work  to reduce such risk and can be negotiated.

There are instances when, even though the  technology declines to becoming a technique, it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator. This  is often the  form that ''technical service'' and ''technical assistance'' contracts take (encountered often in developing country contracts). Alternatively, consulting agencies may fill this role.

== Technology development cycle ==
According to the [[Encyclopedia of Earth]], "In the simplest formulation, innovation can be thought of as being composed of research, development, demonstration, and deployment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/156452/|title=Technological Innovation|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Earth]] |accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Technology development cycle'' describes the process of a new technology through the stages of technological maturity:
#[[Research and development]]
#[[Scientific demonstration]]
#[[System deployment]]
#[[Diffusion]]

'''The Science Network (TSN)''' is a non-profit virtual forum dedicated to science and its impact on society. Initially conceived in 2003 by [[Roger Bingham]] and [[Terry Sejnowski]] as a cable science network,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2003/12/61423?currentPage=1 Wired: Are You Ready for Some Science?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/11/candle-in-the-dark/ Michael Shermer.com, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; TSN would soon become a global digital platform. TSN currently offers free access to over 1100 videos&lt;ref name="search" /&gt; of lectures from scientific meetings and long form one-on-one conversations with prominent scientists and communicators of science, including [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], [[V.S. Ramachandran]], [[Helen S. Mayberg]], and [[Barbara Landau]], on topics including education, aging, neuroscience, and stem cells.&lt;ref name="search"&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/search?q=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 TSN Search]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its mission, TSN has also sponsored and co-sponsored scientific forums, such as the landmark Symposium and Town Hall meeting, ''Stem cells: science, ethics and politics at the crossroads'', held at the Salk Institute in 2004 &lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/stem-cells-science-ethics-and-politics-at-the-crossroads Stem Cells: Science, Ethics and Politics at the Crossroads]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salk.edu/insidesalk/pdf/InsideSalkNov04.pdf Inside Salk 11 04]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Beyond Belief'' conference series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programgroup/beyond-belief ''Beyond Belief'' conference series]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Beyond Belief'' Conference Series==

TSN's signature series ''Beyond Belief'' was conceived to bring together a community of scientists, philosophers, scholars from the humanities, and social commentators. Speakers at these meetings have included [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Harry Kroto]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], and [[Stuart Kauffman]]. So far, the following three ''Beyond Belief'' conferences were organized:

===2006: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival===
''[[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]]'',  the first of The Science Network's annual Beyond Belief symposia, held from November 5 to November 7, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-science-religion-reason-and-survival ''Beyond Belief: Science, Reason, Religion &amp; Survival'']&lt;/ref&gt; was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'', as "a free-for-all on science and religion," which seemed at times like "the founding convention for a political party built on a single plank: in a world dangerously charged with ideology, science needs to take on an evangelical role, vying with religion as teller of the greatest story ever told." According to participant [[Melvin Konner]], however, the event came to resemble a "den of vipers” debating the issue, "Should we bash religion with a crowbar or only with a baseball bat?”&lt;ref name = "nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/science/21belief.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/T/Tyson,%20Neil%20DeGrasse&amp;_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all ''A Free-for-All on Science and Religion," George Johnson, New York Times, Section F, Page 1, November 21, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Scientist]] summed up the topics to be discussed as a list of three questions:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225780.142-beyond-belief-in-place-of-god.html Michael Brooks and Helen Phillips, New Scientist, November 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Can [[science]] help us create a new rational narrative as poetic and powerful as those that have traditionally sustained societies?
* Can we treat [[religion]] as a natural phenomenon?
* Can we be good without [[God]]? And if not God, then what?

Speakers included physicists [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], biologist [[Joan Roughgarden]], and astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]].&lt;ref name = "nyt"/&gt;

===2007: Enlightenment 2.0===
''Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0'' was the second annual symposium and was held from 31 October to 2 November 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-enlightenment-2-0 ''Beyond Belief: Enlightenment 2.0'']&lt;/ref&gt;  at the Frederic de Hoffmann Auditorium of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

===2008: Candles in the Dark===
''Beyond Belief: Candles in the Dark'' was the third annual Beyond Belief symposium. This event was organized by The Science Network and held from 3 October to 6 October 2008 in La Jolla, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-candles-in-the-dark|title=2008 Official Website|work=The Science Network|accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum mechanics]], the '''uncertainty principle''' (also known as '''Heisenberg's uncertainty principle''') is any of a variety of [[Inequality (mathematics)|mathematical inequalities]]&lt;ref name=Sen2014&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sen | first1 = D. | title = The Uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics | url = http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/107/02/0203.pdf | journal = Current Science | volume = 107| issue = 2| year = 2014| pages = 203–218 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a [[particle]], known as [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary variables]], such as [[Position (vector)|position]] ''x'' and [[momentum]] ''p'', can be known.

Introduced first in 1927, by the German physicist  [[Werner Heisenberg]], it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Heisenberg |title=Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik  |language=de|journal=[[Zeitschrift für Physik]] |volume=43 |issue=3–4 |year=1927 |pages=172–198 |doi=10.1007/BF01397280 |postscript=. |bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..172H }}.

The uncertainty principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt; So it is helpful to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.

Mathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''ħk''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].

In [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|Ψ}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Laloë |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Schrödinger equation}}
According to the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]], every object in the universe is a [[wave]], i.e., a situation which gives rise to this phenomenon. The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or momentum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\hbar} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname P [a \leq X \leq b] = \int_a^b |\psi(x)|^2 \, \mathrm{d}x ~.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the single-moded plane wave, &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. 

On the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) \propto \sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\hbar}~, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \varphi(p) \cdot e^{i p x/\hbar} \, dp ~, &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.

One way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&amp;nbsp;''σ''. Since &lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.

The precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. Another way of stating this is that σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound. Click the ''show'' button below to see a semi-formal derivation of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics.

!Proof of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics
|-
|We are interested in the [[variance]]s of position and momentum, defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx - \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p^2 \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp - \left( \int_{-\infty}^\infty p \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp \right)^2~.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Without loss of generality]], we will assume that the [[expected value|means]] vanish, which just amounts to a shift of the origin of our coordinates. (A more general proof that does not make this assumption is given below.) This gives us the simpler form

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 \cdot |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty p^2 \cdot |\varphi(p)|^2 \, dp~.&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x \cdot \psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as a [[vector space|vector]] in a [[function space]]. We can define an [[inner product]] for a pair of functions ''u''(''x'') and ''v''(''x'') in this vector space:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle u \mid v \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty u^*(x) \cdot v(x) \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where the asterisk denotes the [[complex conjugate]].

With this inner product defined, we note that the variance for position can be written as
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2 \, dx = \langle f \mid f \rangle ~.&lt;/math&gt;

We can repeat this for momentum by interpreting the function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}(p)=p \cdot \varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; as a vector, but we can also take advantage of the fact that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; are Fourier transforms of each other. We evaluate the inverse Fourier transform through [[integration by parts]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} g(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tilde{g}(p) \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \hbar}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty p \cdot \varphi(p) \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi \hbar} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ p \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(\chi) e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \right] \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{i}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ \cancel{ \left. \psi(\chi) e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \right|_{-\infty}^\infty } - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\psi(\chi)}{d\chi} e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \right] \cdot e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{-i}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d\psi(\chi)}{d\chi} e^{-ip\chi/\hbar} \, d\chi \, e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&amp;= \left( -i \hbar \frac{d}{dx} \right) \cdot \psi(x) ,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the canceled term vanishes because the wave function vanishes at infinity. Often the term &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; is called the momentum operator in position space. Applying [[Parseval's theorem]], we see that the variance for momentum can be written as

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\tilde{g}(p)|^2 \, dp = \int_{-\infty}^\infty |g(x)|^2 \, dx = \langle g \mid g \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] asserts that
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 = \langle f \mid f \rangle \cdot \langle g \mid g \rangle \ge |\langle f \mid g \rangle|^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The modulus squared of any complex number ''z'' can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;|z|^{2} = \Big(\text{Re}(z)\Big)^{2}+\Big(\text{Im}(z)\Big)^{2} \geq \Big(\text{Im}(z)\Big)^{2}=\Big(\frac{z-z^{\ast}}{2i}\Big)^{2}. &lt;/math&gt;
we let &lt;math&gt;z=\langle f|g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z^{*}=\langle g\mid f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and substitute these into the equation above to get

:&lt;math&gt;|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2 \geq \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g \mid f \rangle}{2i}\bigg)^2 ~.&lt;/math&gt;

All that remains is to evaluate these inner products.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle = {} &amp; \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \, x \cdot \left(-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \, \psi(x) \, dx \\
&amp;{} - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \, \left(-i \hbar \frac{d}{dx}\right) \cdot x \, \psi(x) \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \left[ \left(-x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right) + \frac{d(x \psi(x))}{dx} \right] \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \left[ \left(-x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right) + \psi(x) + \left(x \cdot \frac{d\psi(x)}{dx}\right)\right] \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x) \psi(x) \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar \cdot \int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx \\
= {} &amp; i \hbar\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the above inequalities, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 \ge |\langle f \mid g \rangle|^2 \ge \left(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2i}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{i \hbar}{2 i}\right)^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
or taking the square root

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the only ''physics'' involved in this proof was that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)&lt;/math&gt; are wave functions for position and momentum, which are Fourier transforms of each other. A similar result would hold for ''any'' pair of conjugate variables.

===Matrix mechanics interpretation===
(Ref &lt;ref name="L&amp;L"/&gt;) 
{{Main article|Matrix mechanics}}
In matrix mechanics, observables such as position and momentum are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s. When considering pairs of observables,  an important quantity is the ''[[commutator]]''. For a pair of operators {{mvar|Â}} and {{mvar|B̂}},  one defines their commutator as
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A}.&lt;/math&gt;
In the case of position and momentum, the commutator is the [[canonical commutation relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i \hbar.&lt;/math&gt;

The physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum [[eigenstate]]s. Let &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. By definition, this means that &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}|\psi\rangle = x_0 |\psi\rangle.&lt;/math&gt; Applying the commutator to &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}] | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x}\hat{p}-\hat{p}\hat{x}) | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) \hat{p} \, | \psi \rangle = i \hbar | \psi \rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Î}} is  the [[identity matrix|identity operator]].

Suppose, for the sake of [[proof by contradiction]], that &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is also a right eigenstate of momentum, with constant eigenvalue {{mvar|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If this were true, then  one could write
:&lt;math&gt;(\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) \hat{p} \, | \psi \rangle = (\hat{x} - x_0 \hat{I}) p_0 \, | \psi \rangle = (x_0 \hat{I} - x_0 \hat{I})  p_0 \, | \psi \rangle=0.&lt;/math&gt;
On the other hand, the above canonical commutation relation requires that
:&lt;math&gt;[\hat{x},\hat{p}] | \psi \rangle=i \hbar | \psi \rangle \ne 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate.

When a state is measured, it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable. For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate. This means that the state is ''not'' a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented  as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates. In other words, the momentum must be less precise. This precision may be quantified by the [[standard deviation]]s,  
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x=\sqrt{\langle \hat{x}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{x}\rangle^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p=\sqrt{\langle \hat{p}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{p}\rangle^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

As in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.

==Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relations==
The most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the ''[[Howard Percy Robertson|Robertson]] uncertainty relation''.&lt;ref name="Robertson1929"&gt;{{Citation|last=Robertson|first=H. P.|title=The Uncertainty Principle|journal=Phys. Rev.|year=1929|volume=34|pages=163–64|bibcode = 1929PhRv...34..163R |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.34.163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an arbitrary [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{O}}&lt;/math&gt; we can associate a standard deviation

:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\mathcal{O}} = \sqrt{\langle \hat{\mathcal{O}}^2 \rangle-\langle \hat{\mathcal{O}}\rangle^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the brackets &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathcal{O}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; indicate an [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]]. For a pair of operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;, we may define their ''[[commutator]]'' as

:::&lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{B}\hat{A},&lt;/math&gt;

In this notation, the Robertson uncertainty relation is given by

::: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_A \sigma_B \geq \left| \frac{1}{2i}\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right| = \frac{1}{2}\left|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right|,&lt;/math&gt;

The Robertson uncertainty relation immediately [[Logical consequence|follows from]] a slightly stronger inequality, the ''Schrödinger uncertainty relation'',&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1930"&gt;{{Citation | last = Schrödinger |first = E. | title = Zum Heisenbergschen Unschärfeprinzip | journal = Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Physikalisch-mathematische Klasse | volume = 14 | pages = 296–303 | year = 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 = \langle(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

we let &lt;math&gt;|f\rangle=|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi\rangle &lt;/math&gt; and thus

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 = \langle f\mid f\rangle\, .&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for any other Hermitian operator &lt;math&gt; \hat{B} &lt;/math&gt; in the same state

:::&lt;math&gt; \sigma_B^2 = \langle(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi\rangle = \langle g\mid g\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; |g\rangle=|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \langle f\mid g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is in general a complex number, we use the fact that the modulus squared of any complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;|z|^2=zz^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. The modulus squared can also be expressed as

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; |z|^2 = \Big(\operatorname{Re}(z)\Big)^2+\Big(\operatorname{Im}(z)\Big)^2 = \Big(\frac{z+z^\ast}{2}\Big)^2 +\Big(\frac{z-z^\ast}{2i}\Big)^2. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

we let &lt;math&gt;z=\langle f\mid g\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z^{*}=\langle g \mid f \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and substitute these into the equation above to get

:::{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2 = \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle+\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2}\bigg)^2 + \bigg(\frac{\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle}{2i}\bigg)^2 &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

The inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is written out explicitly as

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle = \langle(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A} \rangle)\Psi|(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B} \rangle)\Psi\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and using the fact that &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; are Hermitian operators, we find

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle f\mid g\rangle &amp; = \langle\Psi|(\hat{A}-\langle \hat{A}\rangle)(\hat{B}-\langle \hat{B}\rangle)\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = \langle\Psi\mid(\hat{A}\hat{B}-\hat{A}\langle \hat{B}\rangle - \hat{B}\langle \hat{A}\rangle + \langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle)\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; = \langle\Psi\mid\hat{A}\hat{B}\Psi\rangle-\langle\Psi\mid\hat{A}\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Psi\rangle
-\langle\Psi\mid\hat{B}\langle \hat{A}\rangle\Psi\rangle+\langle\Psi\mid\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Psi\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; =\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle+\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle \\[4pt]
&amp; =\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have

:::&lt;math&gt;
\langle f\mid g\rangle-\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle+\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle = \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle f\mid g\rangle+\langle g\mid f\rangle = \langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle+\langle \hat{B}\hat{A}\rangle-\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle = \langle \{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle -2\langle \hat{A}\rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

We now substitute the above two equations above back into Eq. ({{EquationNote|4}}) and get
:::&lt;math&gt;
|\langle f\mid g\rangle|^2=\Big(\frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{2i} \langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle\Big)^{2}\, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into Eq. ({{EquationNote|2}}) we get the Schrödinger uncertainty relation

:::&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_A\sigma_B \geq \sqrt{\Big(\frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{A},\hat{B}\}\rangle - \langle \hat{A} \rangle\langle \hat{B}\rangle\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{2i} \langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle\Big)^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This proof has an issue&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Davidson|first=E. R.|title=On Derivations of the Uncertainty Principle|journal=J. Chem.

In fact, the Robertson uncertainty relation is false if &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an angle variable and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative with respect to this variable.

===Examples===

Since the Robertson and Schrödinger relations are for general operators, the relations can be applied to any two observables to obtain specific uncertainty relations. A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.
* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] &lt;math&gt;[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar&lt;/math&gt; implies the Kennard inequality from above:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:
:: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{J_i} \sigma_{J_j} \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \big|\langle J_k\rangle\big|,&lt;/math&gt;
: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes angular momentum along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for &lt;math&gt;[J_x, J_y] = i \hbar \varepsilon_{xyz} J_z&lt;/math&gt;, a choice &lt;math&gt;\hat{A} = J_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{B} = J_y&lt;/math&gt;, in angular momentum multiplets, ''ψ'' = |''j'', ''m''〉, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, &lt;math&gt;\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) ≥ ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j'' ≥ ''m'', among others.
*{{anchor|Time–energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]]. Nevertheless, in 1945, [[Leonid Mandelshtam|L. I. Mandelshtam]] and [[Igor Tamm|I. E. Tamm]] derived a non-relativistic '''''time–energy uncertainty relation''''', as follows.&lt;ref&gt;L. I. Mandelshtam, I. E.

:: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_E \frac{\sigma_B}{\left| \frac{\mathrm{d}\langle \hat B \rangle}{\mathrm{d}t}\right |} \ge \frac{\hbar}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
: where σ&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation of the energy operator (Hamiltonian) in the state {{mvar|ψ}}, σ&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; stands for the standard deviation of ''B''. Although the second factor in the left-hand side has dimension of time, it is different from the time parameter that enters the [[Schrödinger equation]]. It is a ''lifetime'' of the state {{mvar|ψ}} with respect to the observable ''B'': In other words, this is the ''time interval'' (Δ''t'') after which the expectation value &lt;math&gt;\langle\hat B\rangle&lt;/math&gt; changes appreciably.
: An informal, heuristic meaning of the principle is the following: A state that only exists for a short time cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time–energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.&lt;ref&gt;The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

===Energy–time uncertainty principle{{anchors|Energy–time uncertainty principle}}===
Other than the position–momentum uncertainty relation, the most important uncertainty relation is that between energy and time. The energy–time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson–Schrödinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \Delta E \Delta t \gtrsim h,&lt;/math&gt;

but it was not always obvious what &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked "To violate the time–energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!"&lt;ref name="C Jansson"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

One ''false'' formulation of the energy–time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; requires a time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &gt; h/\Delta E&lt;/math&gt;. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.

Another common misconception is that the energy–time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated—energy can be "borrowed" from the universe as long as it is "returned" within a short amount of time.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2005"/&gt;   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron–positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.

In 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time–energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of "events".&lt;ref&gt;see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/&lt;/ref&gt;

===A counterexample===
Suppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, which we may take to lie in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;. Define "position" and "momentum" operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt; by

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\psi(\theta)=\theta\psi(\theta),\quad \theta\in [0,2\pi],&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\psi=-i\hbar\frac{d\psi}{d\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

where we impose periodic boundary conditions on &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the definition of &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; depends on our choice to have &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; range from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;. These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators, &lt;math&gt;[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi-\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi=i\hbar\psi&lt;/math&gt; whenever both &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi&lt;/math&gt; are defined, and the space of such &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a dense subspace of the quantum Hilbert space. See  {{Citation | last = Hall | first = B. C. | title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | pages = 245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be any of the eigenstates of &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;, which are given by &lt;math&gt;\psi(\theta)=e^{2\pi in\theta}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that these states are normalizable, unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line. Note also that the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; ranges over a bounded interval. Thus, in the state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the uncertainty of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is zero and the uncertainty of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is finite, so that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A\sigma_B=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Although this result appears to violate the Robertson uncertainty principle, the paradox is resolved when we note that &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is not in the domain of the operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt;, since multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; disrupts the periodic boundary conditions imposed on &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hall2013"/&gt; Thus, the derivation of the Robertson relation, which requires &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}\hat{B}\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\hat{A}\psi&lt;/math&gt; to be defined, does not apply. (These also furnish an example of operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations but not the [[Canonical commutation relation#The Weyl relations|Weyl relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hall | first = B. C. | title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians | publisher = Springer | year = 2013 | pages = 285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

For the usual position and momentum operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; on the real line, no such counterexamples can occur. As long as &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p&lt;/math&gt; are defined in the state &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle holds, even if &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; fails to be in the domain of &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}\hat{P}&lt;/math&gt; or of &lt;math&gt;\hat{P}\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hall | first = B.

===Quantum harmonic oscillator stationary states===
{{Main article|Quantum harmonic oscillator|Stationary state}}
Consider a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). It is possible to express the position and momentum operators in terms of the [[creation and annihilation operators]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat x = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}(a+a^\dagger)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat p = i\sqrt{\frac{m \omega\hbar}{2}}(a^\dagger-a).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the standard rules for creation and annihilation operators on the eigenstates of the QHO,
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\dagger}|n\rangle=\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a|n\rangle=\sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle, &lt;/math&gt; 
the [[variance]]s may be computed directly,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \frac{\hbar}{m\omega} \left( n+\frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \hbar m\omega \left( n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\, .&lt;/math&gt;
The product of these standard deviations is then
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \hbar \left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right) \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}.~&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the above Kennard bound&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; is saturated for the [[ground state]] {{math|''n''{{=}}0}}, for which the probability density is just the [[normal distribution]].

In a quantum harmonic oscillator of characteristic angular frequency ω, place a state that is offset from the bottom of the potential by some displacement ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\left(\frac{m \Omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \Omega (x-x_0)^2}{2\hbar}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
where Ω describes the width of the initial state but need not be the same as ω. Through integration over the [[Propagator#Basic Examples: Propagator of Free Particle and Harmonic Oscillator|propagator]], we can solve for the {{Not a typo|full time}}-dependent solution. After many cancelations, the probability densities reduce to
:&lt;math&gt;|\Psi(x,t)|^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left( x_0 \cos{(\omega t)} , \frac{\hbar}{2 m \Omega} \left( \cos^2(\omega t) + \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\Phi(p,t)|^2 \sim \mathcal{N}\left( -m x_0 \omega \sin(\omega t), \frac{\hbar m \Omega}{2} \left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where we have used the notation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)&lt;/math&gt; to denote a normal distribution of mean μ and variance σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Copying the variances above and applying [[list of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identities]], we can write the product of the standard deviations as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_x \sigma_p&amp;=\frac{\hbar}{2}\sqrt{\left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)\left( \cos^2{(\omega t)} + \frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \sin^2{(\omega t)} \right)} \\
&amp;= \frac{\hbar}{4}\sqrt{3+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-1\right) \cos{(4 \omega t)}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From the relations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2} \ge 2, \quad |\cos(4 \omega t)| \le 1,&lt;/math&gt;

we can conclude the following: (the right most equality holds only when Ω&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ω'') .
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{4}\sqrt{3+\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Omega^2}{\omega^2}+\frac{\omega^2}{\Omega^2}\right)-1\right)} = \frac{\hbar}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Coherent states===
{{Main article|Coherent state}}
A coherent state is a right eigenstate of the [[annihilation operator]],
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a}|\alpha\rangle=\alpha|\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
which may be represented in terms of [[Fock state]]s as
:&lt;math&gt;|\alpha\rangle =e^{-{|\alpha|^2\over2}} \sum_{n=0}^\infty {\alpha^n \over \sqrt{n!}}|n\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

In the picture where the coherent state is a massive particle in a QHO, the position and momentum operators may be expressed in terms of the annihilation operators in the same formulas above and used to calculate the variances,
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2 = \frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, every coherent state saturates the Kennard bound

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega}} \, \sqrt{\frac{\hbar m \omega}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

with position and momentum each contributing an amount &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\hbar/2}&lt;/math&gt; in a "balanced" way. Moreover, every [[squeezed coherent state]] also saturates the Kennard bound although the individual contributions of position and momentum need not be balanced in general.

===Particle in a box===
{{Main article|Particle in a box}}
Consider a particle in a one-dimensional box of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Particle in a box#Wavefunctions|eigenfunctions in position and momentum space]] are
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x,t) =
\begin{cases}
A \sin(k_n x)\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\omega_n t}, &amp; 0 &lt; x &lt; L,\\
0, &amp; \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_n(p,t)=\sqrt{\frac{\pi L}{\hbar}}\,\,\frac{n\left(1-(-1)^ne^{-ikL} \right) e^{-i \omega_n t}}{\pi ^2 n^2-k^2 L^2},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_n=\frac{\pi^2 \hbar n^2}{8 L^2 m}&lt;/math&gt; and we have used the [[de Broglie relation]] &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;. The variances of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated explicitly:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2=\frac{L^2}{12}\left(1-\frac{6}{n^2\pi^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_p^2=\left(\frac{\hbar n\pi}{L}\right)^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The product of the standard deviations is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{n^2\pi^2}{3}-2}.&lt;/math&gt;
For all &lt;math&gt;n=1, \, 2, \, 3,\, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{n^2\pi^2}{3}-2}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than 1, so the uncertainty principle is never violated. For numerical concreteness, the smallest value occurs when &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, in which case

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi^2}{3}-2} \approx 0.568 \hbar &gt; \frac{\hbar}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constant momentum===
{{Main article|Wave packet}}
[[File:Guassian Dispersion.gif|360 px|thumb|right|Position space probability density of an initially Gaussian state moving at minimally uncertain, constant momentum in free space]]
Assume a particle initially has a [[momentum space]] wave function described by a normal distribution around some constant momentum ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; according to

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p) = \left(\frac{x_0}{\hbar \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-x_0^2 (p-p_0)^2}{2\hbar^2}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where we have introduced a reference scale &lt;math&gt;x_0=\sqrt{\hbar/m\omega_0}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; describing the width of the distribution−−cf. [[nondimensionalization]]. If the state is allowed to evolve in free space, then the time-dependent momentum and position space wave functions are

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(p,t) = \left(\frac{x_0}{\hbar \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \exp{\left(\frac{-x_0^2 (p-p_0)^2}{2\hbar^2}-\frac{ip^2 t}{2m\hbar}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t) = \left(\frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{\pi}} \right)^{1/2} \cdot \frac{e^{-x_0^2 p_0^2 /2\hbar^2}}{\sqrt{1+i\omega_0 t}} \cdot \exp{\left(-\frac{(x-ix_0^2 p_0/\hbar)^2}{2x_0^2 (1+i\omega_0 t)}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \langle p(t) \rangle = p_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p(t) = \hbar / x_0 \sqrt{2},&lt;/math&gt; this can be interpreted as a particle moving along with constant momentum at arbitrarily high precision. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the position is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \frac{x_0}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1+\omega_0^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
such that the uncertainty product can only increase with time as
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x(t) \sigma_p(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sqrt{1+\omega_0^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Additional uncertainty relations==

===Mixed states===
The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation may be generalized in a straightforward way to describe [[density matrix|mixed states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiger|first=Nathan|title=Quantum Uncertainty and Conservation Law Restrictions on Gate Fidelity|url=http://www.physics.byu.edu/Thesis/view.aspx?id=270|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_A^2 \sigma_B^2 \geq \left(\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{tr}(\rho\{A,B\}) - \operatorname{tr}(\rho A)\operatorname{tr}(\rho B)\right)^2 +\left(\frac{1}{2i} \operatorname{tr}(\rho[A,B])\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

===The Maccone–Pati uncertainty relations===
The Robertson–Schrödinger uncertainty relation can be trivial if the state of the system is chosen to be eigenstate of one of the observable. The stronger uncertainty relations proved by Maccone and Pati give non-trivial bounds on the sum of the variances for two incompatible observables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maccone|first1=Lorenzo|last2=Pati|first2=Arun K.|title=Stronger Uncertainty Relations for All Incompatible Observables|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=31 December 2014|volume=113|issue=26|page=260401|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.260401|arxiv=1407.0338|bibcode=2014PhRvL.113z0401M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For two non-commuting observables &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; the first stronger uncertainty relation is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A}^2 + \sigma_{ B}^2 \ge \pm i \langle \Psi\mid [A, B]|\Psi \rangle  + \mid \langle \Psi\mid(A \pm i B)\mid{\bar \Psi} \rangle|^2, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{A}^2 = \langle \Psi |A^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi \mid A \mid \Psi \rangle^2   &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \sigma_{B}^2 = \langle \Psi |B^2 |\Psi \rangle - \langle \Psi \mid B \mid\Psi \rangle^2 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|{\bar \Psi} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a normalized vector that is orthogonal to the state of the system &lt;math&gt;|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and  one should choose the sign of  &lt;math&gt;\pm i \langle \Psi\mid[A, B]\mid\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; to make this real quantity a positive number.

The second stronger uncertainty  relation is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2 \ge \frac{1}{2}| \langle {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \mid(A + B)\mid \Psi \rangle|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is a state orthogonal to &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.
The form of &lt;math&gt;| {\bar \Psi}_{A+B} \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; implies that the right-hand side of the new uncertainty relation 
is nonzero unless &lt;math&gt;| \Psi\rangle  &lt;/math&gt; is an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;(A + B)&lt;/math&gt;.  One may note that &lt;math&gt;|\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; can be an eigenstate of &lt;math&gt;( A+ B)&lt;/math&gt; without being an eigenstate of either
&lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;. However,  when &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is an eigenstate of one of the two observables the Heisenberg–Schrödinger uncertainty relation becomes trivial. But the lower bound in the new relation is nonzero 
unless &lt;math&gt; |\Psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  is an eigenstate of both.

===Phase space===
In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics, the Robertson–Schrödinger relation follows from a positivity condition on a real star-square function. Given a [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution|Wigner function]] &lt;math&gt;W(x,p)&lt;/math&gt; with [[Moyal product|star product]] ★ and a function ''f'', the following is generally true:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. |last2= Zachos | first2= C. | title = Negative Probability and Uncertainty Relations| journal = Modern Physics Letters A  | volume = 16 | issue = 37 | pages = 2381–2385 | doi = 10.1142/S021773230100576X | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = hep-th/0105226 |bibcode = 2001MPLA...16.2381C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f^* \star f \rangle =\int (f^* \star f) \, W(x,p) \, dx \, dp \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing &lt;math&gt;f=a+bx+cp&lt;/math&gt;, we arrive at

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f^* \star f \rangle =\begin{bmatrix}a^* &amp; b^* &amp; c^* \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star p \rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \langle p \star x \rangle &amp; \langle p \star p \rangle \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a \\ b \\ c\end{bmatrix} \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since this positivity condition is true for ''all'' ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', it follows that all the eigenvalues of the matrix are positive. The positive eigenvalues then imply a corresponding positivity condition on the [[determinant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star x \rangle &amp; \langle x \star p \rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \langle p \star x \rangle &amp; \langle p \star p \rangle \end{bmatrix} = \det\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle p \rangle \\ \langle x \rangle &amp; \langle x^2 \rangle &amp; \left\langle xp + \frac{i\hbar}{2} \right\rangle \\ \langle p \rangle &amp; \left\langle xp - \frac{i\hbar}{2} \right\rangle &amp; \langle p^2 \rangle \end{bmatrix} \ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;

or, explicitly, after algebraic manipulation,

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2 \sigma_p^2 = \left( \langle x^2 \rangle - \langle x \rangle^2 \right)\left( \langle p^2 \rangle - \langle p \rangle^2 \right)\ge \left( \langle xp \rangle - \langle x \rangle \langle p \rangle \right)^2 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

===Systematic and statistical errors===

The inequalities above focus on the ''statistical imprecision'' of observables as quantified by the standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Heisenberg's original version, however, was dealing with the ''systematic error'', a disturbance of the quantum system produced by the measuring apparatus, i.e., an [[Observer effect (physics)|observer effect]].

If we let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_A&lt;/math&gt; represent the error (i.e., [[accuracy|inaccuracy]]) of a measurement of an observable ''A'' and &lt;math&gt;\eta_B&lt;/math&gt; the disturbance produced on a subsequent measurement of the conjugate variable ''B'' by the former measurement of ''A'', then the inequality proposed by Ozawa&lt;ref name="Ozawa2003"/&gt; — encompassing both systematic and statistical errors — holds:
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_A\, \eta_B + \varepsilon_A \, \sigma_B + \sigma_A \, \eta_B \,\ge\,  \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, as originally described in the 1927 formulation, mentions only the first term of Ozawa inequality, regarding the ''systematic error''.   Using the notation above to describe the ''error/disturbance'' effect of ''sequential measurements'' (first ''A'', then ''B''), it could be written as
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{A} \, \eta_{B} \, \ge \,   \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

The formal derivation of the Heisenberg relation is possible but far from intuitive. It was ''not'' proposed by Heisenberg, but formulated in a mathematically consistent way only in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.160405| title = Proof of Heisenberg's Error-Disturbance Relation| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 111| issue = 16| year = 2013| last1 = Busch | first1 = P. | last2 = Lahti | first2 = P. | last3 = Werner | first3 = R.

Also, it must be stressed that the Heisenberg formulation is not taking into account the intrinsic statistical errors &lt;math&gt;\sigma_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_B&lt;/math&gt;.  There is increasing experimental evidence&lt;ref name="Rozema"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Erhart | first1 = J.| last2 = Sponar | first2 =S.| last3 = Sulyok | first3 = G. | last4 = Badurek | first4 = G. | last5 = Ozawa | first5 = M. | last6 =  Hasegawa | first6 = Y.| title = Experimental demonstration of a universally valid error-disturbance uncertainty relation in spin measurements | journal = Nature Physics | volume=8 | pages=185–189 | year=2012 | doi=10.1038/nphys2194 | arxiv = 1201.1833 | bibcode = 2012NatPh...8..185E | issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Baek | first1 =  S.-Y. | last2 = Kaneda  | first2 = F. | last3 = Ozawa | first3 = M. | last4 = Edamatsu | first4 = K. | title =  Experimental violation and reformulation of the Heisenberg's error-disturbance uncertainty relation |journal = Scientific Reports |volume= 3 |pages= 2221 |year= 2013 |doi= 10.1038/srep02221 | url = http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02221 |bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E2221B | pmid=23860715 | pmc=3713528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Ringbauer | first1 = M. | last2 = Biggerstaff | first2 = D.N. | last3 = Broome | first3 = M.A. | last4 =  Fedrizzi  | first4 = A.  | last5 =   Branciard | first5 = C. | last6 = White | first6 = A.G. | title = Experimental Joint Quantum Measurements with Minimum Uncertainty |journal =  Physical Review Letters |volume= 112 |pages= 020401 |year= 2014 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.020401 | url = http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.020401 |arxiv = 1308.5688 |bibcode = 2014PhRvL.112b0401R | pmid=24483993}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the total quantum uncertainty cannot be described by the Heisenberg term alone, but requires the presence of all the three terms of the Ozawa inequality. 
 
Using the same formalism,&lt;ref name="Sen2014"/&gt; it is also possible to introduce the other kind of physical situation, often confused with the previous one, namely the case of ''simultaneous measurements'' (''A'' and ''B'' at the same time):
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_A \, \varepsilon_B  \, \ge  \, \frac{1}{2} \, \left| \langle [\hat{A},\hat{B}] \rangle \right|&lt;/math&gt;

It is also possible to derive an uncertainty relation that, as the Ozawa's one, combines both the statistical and systematic error components, but keeps a form very close to the Heisenberg original inequality.  By adding Robertson&lt;ref name="Sen2014"/&gt; 
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::

The four terms can be written as: 
:: &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon_A + \sigma_A) \, (\eta_B + \sigma_B) \, \geq \,  \left|\langle[\hat{A},\hat{B}]\rangle \right| .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Quantum entropic uncertainty principle ===

For many distributions, the standard deviation is not a particularly natural way of quantifying the structure. For example, uncertainty relations in which one of the observables is an angle has little physical meaning for fluctuations larger than one period.&lt;ref name="CarruthersNieto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=D. |last=Judge |title=On the uncertainty relation for angle variables|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento|year=1964|volume=31|issue=2|pages=332–340|doi=10.1007/BF02733639|bibcode=1964NCim...31..332J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1= M. |last1= Bouten |first2= N. |last2= Maene

A solution that overcomes these issues is an uncertainty based on [[entropic uncertainty]] instead of the product of variances. While formulating the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics in 1957, [[Hugh Everett III]] conjectured a stronger extension of the uncertainty principle based on entropic certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=DeWitt |first=B.

where the logarithms may be in any base.

The probability distribution functions associated with the position wave function {{math|''&amp;psi;(x)''}} and the momentum wave function {{math|''&amp;phi;(x)''}} have dimensions of inverse length and momentum respectively, but the entropies may be rendered dimensionless by

:&lt;math&gt;H_x = - \int |\psi(x)|^2 \ln (x_0\,|\psi(x)|^2 ) \,dx =-\left\langle \ln (x_0\mid\psi(x)|^2 ) \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are some arbitrarily chosen length and momentum respectively, which render the arguments of the logarithms dimensionless.

Due to the [[Wavefunction#Relation between wave functions|Fourier transform relation]] between the position wave function {{math|''&amp;psi;(x)''}} and the momentum wavefunction {{math|''&amp;phi;''(''p'')}}, the above constraint can be written for the corresponding entropies as

where {{mvar|h}} is [[Planck's constant]].

Depending on one's choice of the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} product, the expression may be written in many ways. If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is chosen to be {{mvar|h}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If, instead,  {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is chosen to be {{mvar|ħ}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log (e\,\pi)&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are chosen to be unity in whatever system of units are being used, then
:&lt;math&gt;H_x + H_p \ge \log \left(\frac{e\,h }{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|h}} is interpreted as a dimensionless number equal to the value of Planck's constant in the chosen system of units.

The quantum entropic uncertainty principle is more restrictive than the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. From the inverse logarithmic Sobolev inequalities&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=D. |last=Chafaï |title=Gaussian maximum of entropy and reversed log-Sobolev inequality|arxiv=math/0102227 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-36107-7_5 |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-540-00072-3 |pages=194–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_x \le \frac{1}{2} \log ( 2e\pi \sigma_x^2 / x_0^2 )~,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_p \le \frac{1}{2} \log ( 2e\pi \sigma_p^2 /p_0^2 )~,&lt;/math&gt;
(equivalently, from the fact that normal distributions maximize the entropy of all such with a given variance), it readily follows that this entropic uncertainty principle is ''stronger than the one based on standard deviations'', because

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} \exp\left(H_x + H_p - \log \left(\frac{e\,h}{2\,x_0\,p_0}\right)\right) \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is a consequence of the quantum entropic uncertainty principle, but not vice versa.  A few remarks on these inequalities. First, the choice of [[base e]] is a matter of popular convention in physics. The logarithm can alternatively be in any base, provided that it be consistent on both sides of the inequality.  Second, recall the [[Shannon entropy]] has been used, ''not'' the quantum [[von Neumann entropy]].  Finally, the normal distribution saturates the inequality, and it is the only distribution with this property, because it is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] among those with fixed variance (cf. [[differential entropy#Maximization in the normal distribution|here]] for proof).

!Entropic uncertainty of the normal distribution
|-
|We demonstrate this method on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations. The length scale can be set to whatever is convenient, so we assign

:&lt;math&gt;x_0=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2m\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\psi(x) &amp;= \left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)} \\
&amp;= \left(\frac{1}{2\pi x_0^2}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{4x_0^2}\right)} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability distribution is the normal distribution
:&lt;math&gt;|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

with Shannon entropy
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x &amp;= - \int |\psi(x)|^2 \ln (|\psi(x)|^2 \cdot x_0 ) \,dx \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{x_0 \sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)} \ln \left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{x^2}{2x_0^2}\right)}\right] \, dx \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{u^2}{2}\right)} \left[\ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{u^2}{2}\right] \, du\\
&amp;= \ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{1}{2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A completely analogous calculation proceeds for the momentum distribution. Choosing a standard momentum of &lt;math&gt;p_0=\hbar/x_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p) = \left(\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\varphi(p)|^2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}} \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_p &amp;= - \int |\varphi(p)|^2 \ln (|\varphi(p)|^2 \cdot \hbar / x_0 ) \,dp \\
&amp;= -\sqrt{\frac{2 x_0^2}{\pi \hbar^2}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)} \ln \left[\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \exp{\left( -\frac{2x_0^2 p^2}{\hbar^2}\right)}\right] \, dp \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp{\left( -2v^2\right)} \left[\ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + 2v^2 \right] \, dv \\
&amp;= \ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is therefore the limiting value

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x+H_p &amp;= \ln(\sqrt{2\pi}) + \frac{1}{2} + \ln\left(\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\\
&amp;= 1 + \ln \pi = \ln(e\pi).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A measurement apparatus will have a finite resolution set by the discretization of its possible outputs into bins, with the probability of lying within one of the bins given by the Born rule. We will consider the most common experimental situation, in which the bins are of uniform size. Let ''δx'' be a measure of the spatial resolution. We take the zeroth bin to be centered near the origin, with possibly some small constant offset ''c''. The probability of lying within the jth interval of width ''δx'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_j]= \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x-c}^{(j+1/2)\delta x-c}| \psi(x)|^2 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

To account for this discretization, we can define the Shannon entropy of the wave function for a given measurement apparatus as

: &lt;math&gt;H_x=-\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j].&lt;/math&gt;

Under the above definition, the entropic uncertainty relation is

:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p&gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{\delta x \delta p}{h} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here we note that {{math|''δx''&amp;nbsp;''δp''/''h''}} is a typical infinitesimal phase space volume used in the calculation of a [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]]. The inequality is also strict and not saturated. Efforts to improve this bound are an active area of research.

!Normal distribution example
|-
|We demonstrate this method first on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations.
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\left(\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}\right)^{1/4} \exp{\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2\hbar}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of lying within one of these bins can be expressed in terms of the [[error function]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\operatorname P[x_j] &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x}^{(j+1/2)\delta x} \exp\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{\hbar}\right) \, dx \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta x\sqrt{m \omega / \hbar}}^{(j+1/2)\delta x\sqrt{m \omega / \hbar}} e^{u^2} \, du \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}}\right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\hbar}}\right) \right]\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum probabilities are completely analogous.

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[p_j] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta p \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar m \omega}}\right)- \operatorname{erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)\delta x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\hbar m \omega}}\right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

For simplicity, we will set the resolutions to

:&lt;math&gt;\delta x = \sqrt{\frac{h}{m \omega}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta p = \sqrt{h m \omega}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the probabilities reduce to

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_j] = \operatorname P[p_j] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

The Shannon entropy can be evaluated numerically.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x = H_p &amp;= -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j] \\
&amp;= -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right] \ln \frac{1}{2} \left[ \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j+\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right)- \operatorname {erf} \left( \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right) \sqrt{2\pi} \right) \right]
&amp;\approx 0.3226\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is indeed larger than the limiting value.
:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p \approx 0.3226 + 0.3226 = 0.6452 &gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln 1 \approx 0.3069&lt;/math&gt;

Note that despite being in the optimal case, the inequality is not saturated.

!Sinc function example
|-
|An example of a unimodal distribution with infinite variance is the [[sinc function]]. If the wave function is the correctly normalized uniform distribution,
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2a}} &amp; \text{for } |x| \le a, \\[8pt]
0 &amp; \text{for } |x|&gt;a
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
then its Fourier transform is the sinc function,
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(p)=\sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi \hbar}} \cdot \operatorname{sinc}\left(\frac{a p}{\hbar}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which yields infinite momentum variance despite having a centralized shape. The entropic uncertainty, on the other hand, is finite. Suppose for simplicity that the spatial resolution is just a two-bin measurement, ''δx''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'', and that the momentum resolution is ''δp''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''a''.

Partitioning the uniform spatial distribution into two equal bins is straightforward. We set the offset ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 so that the two bins span the distribution.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_0] = \int_{-a}^0 \frac{1}{2a} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname P[x_1] = \int_0^a \frac{1}{2a} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_x = -\sum_{j=0}^{1} \operatorname P[x_j] \ln \operatorname P[x_j] = -\frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{1}{2} = \ln 2&lt;/math&gt;

The bins for momentum must cover the entire real line. As done with the spatial distribution, we could apply an offset. It turns out, however, that the Shannon entropy is minimized when the zeroth bin for momentum is centered at the origin. (The reader is encouraged to try adding an offset.) The probability of lying within an arbitrary momentum bin can be expressed in terms of the [[sine integral]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\operatorname P[p_j] &amp;= \frac{a}{\pi \hbar} \int_{(j-1/2)\delta p}^{(j+1/2)\delta p} \operatorname{sinc}^2\left(\frac{a p}{\hbar}\right) \, dp \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{2\pi (j-1/2)}^{2\pi (j+1/2)} \operatorname{sinc}^2(u) \, du \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\pi} \left[ \operatorname {Si} ((4j+2)\pi)- \operatorname {Si} ((4j-2)\pi) \right]\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The Shannon entropy can be evaluated numerically.
:&lt;math&gt;H_p = -\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \operatorname P[p_j] \ln \operatorname P[p_j] = -\operatorname P[p_0] \ln \operatorname P[p_0]-2 \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \operatorname P[p_j] \ln \operatorname P[p_j] \approx 0.53&lt;/math&gt;

The entropic uncertainty is indeed larger than the limiting value.
:&lt;math&gt;H_x+H_p \approx 0.69 + 0.53 = 1.22 &gt;\ln\left(\frac{e}{2}\right)-\ln 1 \approx 0.31&lt;/math&gt;

==Harmonic analysis==
{{main article|Fourier transform#Uncertainty principle}}
In the context of [[harmonic analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the uncertainty principle implies that one cannot at the same time localize the value of a function and its [[Fourier transform]]. To wit, the following inequality holds,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 |f(x)|^2\,dx\right)\left(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \xi^2 |\hat{f}(\xi)|^2\,d\xi\right)\ge \frac{\|f\|_2^4}{16\pi^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further mathematical uncertainty inequalities, including the above [[entropic uncertainty]], hold between a function {{mvar|f}} and its Fourier transform {{math| ƒ̂}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=V.|last1=Havin|first2= B.|last2=Jöricke|title=The Uncertainty Principle in Harmonic Analysis|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Signal processing {{anchor|Gabor limit}}===
In the context of [[signal processing]], and in particular [[time–frequency analysis]], uncertainty principles are referred to as the '''Gabor limit''', after [[Dennis Gabor]], or sometimes the ''Heisenberg–Gabor limit''. The basic result, which follows from "Benedicks's theorem", below, is that a function cannot be both [[time limited]] and [[band limited]] (a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have bounded domain)—see [[Bandlimiting#Bandlimited versus timelimited|bandlimited versus timelimited]]. Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t \cdot \sigma_f \ge \frac{1}{4\pi} \approx 0.08 \text{ cycles}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_f&lt;/math&gt; are the standard deviations of the time and frequency estimates respectively &lt;ref&gt;Matt Hall, [https://agilescientific.com/blog/2014/1/15/what-is-the-gabor-uncertainty-principle.html "What is the Gabor uncertainty principle?"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Stated alternatively, "One cannot simultaneously sharply localize a signal (function {{mvar|f}} ) in both the [[time domain]] and [[frequency domain]] ({{math| ƒ̂}}, its Fourier transform)".

When applied to filters, the result implies that one cannot achieve high temporal resolution and frequency resolution at the same time; a concrete example are the [[Short-time Fourier transform#Resolution issues|resolution issues of the short-time Fourier transform]]—if one uses a wide window, one achieves good frequency resolution at the cost of temporal resolution, while a narrow window has the opposite trade-off.

Alternate theorems give more precise quantitative results, and, in time–frequency analysis, rather than interpreting the (1-dimensional) time and frequency domains separately, one instead interprets the limit as a lower limit on the support of a function in the (2-dimensional) time–frequency plane. In practice, the Gabor limit limits the ''simultaneous'' time–frequency resolution one can achieve without interference; it is possible to achieve higher resolution, but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other.

===DFT-Uncertainty principle===
There is an uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients).&lt;ref name="Donoho"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donoho |first1=D.L. |last2=Stark |first2=P.B |year=1989 |title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=906–931 |doi=10.1137/0149053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{ x_n } \right \} := x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of ''N'' complex numbers and &lt;math&gt;\left \{ \mathbf{X_k} \right \} := X_0, X_1, \ldots, X_{N-1},&lt;/math&gt; its [[discrete Fourier transform]].

Denote by &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_0&lt;/math&gt; the number of non-zero elements in the time sequence &lt;math&gt;x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; and by &lt;math&gt;\|X\|_0&lt;/math&gt; the number of non-zero elements in the frequency sequence &lt;math&gt;X_0,X_1,\ldots,X_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Then,

which is only known if either {{mvar|S}} or {{mvar|Σ}} is convex.

===Hardy's uncertainty principle===
The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] formulated the following uncertainty principle:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=G.H.|last=Hardy|authorlink=G. H.

Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} in &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)|\leq C(1+|x|)^Ne^{-a\pi x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;|\hat{f}(\xi)|\leq C(1+|\xi|)^Ne^{-b\pi \xi^2}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;C&gt;0,N&lt;/math&gt; an integer),

then, if {{math|1=''ab'' &gt; 1, ''f'' = 0}}, while if {{math|1=''ab'' = 1}}, then there is a polynomial {{mvar|P}} of degree {{math| ≤ ''N''}} such that

::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=P(x)e^{-a\pi x^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

This was later improved as follows: if &lt;math&gt;f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt; is such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}|f(x)||\hat{f}(\xi)|\frac{e^{\pi|\langle x,\xi\rangle|}}{(1+|x|+|\xi|)^N} \, dx \, d\xi &lt; +\infty ~,&lt;/math&gt;
then
::&lt;math&gt;f(x)=P(x)e^{-\pi\langle Ax,x\rangle} ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|P}} is a polynomial of degree {{math|(''N'' − ''d'')/2}} and {{mvar|A}} is a real {{math|''d''×''d''}} positive definite matrix.

This result was stated in Beurling's complete works without proof and proved in Hörmander&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=L.|last=Hörmander|authorlink=Lars Hörmander|title=A uniqueness theorem of Beurling for Fourier transform pairs|journal= Ark.

[[File:Heisenbergbohr.jpg|thumb|Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr]]
In 1925, following pioneering work with [[Hendrik Kramers]], Heisenberg developed [[matrix mechanics]], which replaced the ad hoc [[old quantum theory]] with modern quantum mechanics. The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.

Heisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.

In March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously—the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known. Heisenberg wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;It can be expressed in its simplest form as follows: One can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles—its position and its velocity. It is impossible to determine accurately ''both'' the position and the direction and speed of a particle ''at the same instant''.&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg, W., ''Die Physik der Atomkerne'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1952, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his celebrated 1927 paper, "Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik" ("On the Perceptual Content of Quantum Theoretical Kinematics and Mechanics"), Heisenberg established this expression as the minimum amount of unavoidable momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement,&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927"/&gt; but he did not give a precise definition for the uncertainties Δx and Δp. Instead, he gave some plausible estimates in each case separately. In his Chicago lecture&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Heisenberg |year=1930 |title=Physikalische Prinzipien der Quantentheorie  |language=de|location=Leipzig |publisher=Hirzel }} English translation ''The Physical Principles of Quantum Theory''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; he refined his principle:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \, \Delta p\gtrsim h&lt;/math&gt;|1}}

[[Earle Hesse Kennard|Kennard]]&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt; in 1927 first proved the modern inequality:

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x\sigma_p\ge\frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt;|2}}

where {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2{{pi}}}}}}, and {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the standard deviations of position and momentum. Heisenberg only proved relation ({{EquationNote|2}}) for the special case of Gaussian states.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

===Terminology and translation===
Throughout the main body of his original 1927 paper, written in German, Heisenberg used the word, "Ungenauigkeit" ("indeterminacy"),&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1927" /&gt;
to describe the basic theoretical principle. Only in the endnote did he switch to the word, "Unsicherheit" ("uncertainty"). When the English-language version of Heisenberg's textbook, ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', was published in 1930, however, the translation "uncertainty" was used, and it became the more commonly used term in the English language thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Cassidy |year=2009 |title=Beyond Uncertainty: Heisenberg, Quantum Physics, and the Bomb |location= New York |publisher=Bellevue Literary Press |page=185 |isbn= |bibcode=2010PhT....63a..49C |last2=Saperstein |first2=Alvin M. |volume=63 |journal=Physics Today |doi=10.1063/1.3293416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heisenberg's microscope===
[[File:Heisenberg gamma ray microscope.svg|thumb|200px|right|Heisenberg's gamma-ray microscope for locating an electron (shown in blue). The incoming gamma ray (shown in green) is scattered by the electron up into the microscope's aperture angle ''θ''. The scattered gamma-ray is shown in red. Classical [[optics]] shows that the electron position can be resolved only up to an uncertainty Δ''x'' that depends on ''θ'' and the wavelength ''λ'' of the incoming light.]]
{{Main article|Heisenberg's microscope}}

The principle is quite counter-intuitive, so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements to violate it were bound always to be unworkable. One way in which Heisenberg originally illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by utilizing the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] of  an imaginary microscope as a measuring device.&lt;ref name="Heisenberg_1930"/&gt;

He imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an [[electron]] by shooting a [[photon]] at it.&lt;ref name=GreensteinZajonc2006&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Greenstein|author2=Arthur Zajonc|title=The Quantum Challenge: Modern Research on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics|year=2006|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-2470-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49–50}}
:Problem 1 – If the photon has a short [[wavelength]], and therefore, a large momentum, the position can be measured accurately. But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron. If the photon has a long [[wavelength]] and low momentum, the collision does not disturb the electron's momentum very much, but the scattering will reveal its position only vaguely.

:Problem 2 – If a large [[aperture]] is used for the microscope, the electron's location can be well resolved (see [[Rayleigh criterion]]); but by the principle of [[conservation of momentum]], the transverse momentum of the incoming photon affects the electron's beamline momentum and hence, the new momentum of the electron resolves poorly. If a small aperture is used, the accuracy of both resolutions is the other way around.

The combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to [[Planck's constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Tipler |first=Paul A. |first2=Ralph A. |last2=Llewellyn |title=Modern Physics |edition=3rd |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Co. |year=1999 |isbn=1-57259-164-1 |chapter=5–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit (which is elaborated below), and preferred to use it instead, as a heuristic quantitative statement, correct up to small numerical factors, which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable.

==Critical reactions==
{{Main article|Bohr–Einstein debates}}

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle were, in fact, seen as twin targets by detractors who believed in an underlying [[determinism]] and [[Scientific realism|realism]]. According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the [[quantum state]] describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.

[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr–Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.

===The ideal of the detached observer===
[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle "the ideal of the detached observer" (phrase translated from the German):
{{blockquote|"Like the moon has a definite position" Einstein said to me last winter, "whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made." I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.
*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
===Einstein's slit===
The first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:

:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.

Bohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|Δ''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|Δ''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.

A similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].&lt;ref&gt;Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Einstein's box===
Bohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that "Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]]."&lt;ref name="Gamow"&gt;Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.&lt;/ref&gt; Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. "We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; "Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle."&lt;ref name="Gamow" /&gt;

Bohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, "since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,"&lt;ref&gt;Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt; because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].
"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

===EPR paradox for entangled particles===
Bohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=452 |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the "natural basic assumption" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from "locally changing deterministic quantities" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.

In 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be "hidden" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's "basic assumption" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.

While it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables are not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption—that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Popper's criticism ===
{{main article|Popper's experiment}}
[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]] | publisher = Hutchinson &amp; Co. | year = 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as "statistical scatter relations".&lt;ref name="Popper1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvie2006"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment, | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory. This directly contrasts with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which is [[Determinism|non-deterministic]] but lacks local hidden variables.

In 1934, Popper published ''Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen'' (''Critique of the Uncertainty Relations'') in ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'',&lt;ref name="Popper1934"&gt;{{Citation | title = Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen (Critique of the Uncertainty Relations) | journal = Naturwissenschaften | year = 1934 | first = Karl | last = Popper | author2 = Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | volume = 22 | issue = 48 | pages = 807–808 | doi=10.1007/BF01496543|bibcode = 1934NW.....22..807P | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|Logik der Forschung]]'' (translated and updated by the author as ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' in 1959), outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation. In 1982, he further developed his theory in ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Heisenberg's] formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable ''statistical formulae'' of the quantum theory. But they have been ''habitually misinterpreted'' by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the ''precision of our measurements''. [original emphasis]&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K. ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', Unwin Hyman Ltd, 1982, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popper proposed an experiment to [[Falsifiability|falsify]] the uncertainty relations, although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker|Weizsäcker]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]; this experiment may have influenced the formulation of the [[EPR paradox|EPR experiment]].&lt;ref name="Popper1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mehra2001"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehra | first1 = Jagdish | last2 = Rechenberg | first2 = Helmut | title = The Historical Development of Quantum Theory | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-387-95086-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Many-worlds uncertainty ===
{{main article|Many-worlds interpretation}}

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] originally outlined by [[Hugh Everett III]] in 1957 is partly meant to reconcile the differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's [[wave function collapse]] with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose ''distribution'' is governed by [[wave function]]s and the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of what goes on in the other universes.

=== Free will ===

Some scientists including [[Arthur Compton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.74.1911.172| title = The Uncertainty Principle and Free Will| journal = Science| volume = 74| issue = 1911| pages = 172| year = 1931| last1 = Compton | first1 = A. H. | pmid=17808216|bibcode = 1931Sci....74..172C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Heisenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/459164a| title = Is free will an illusion?| journal = Nature| volume = 459| issue = 7244| pages = 164–165| year = 2009| last1 = Heisenberg | first1 = M. |bibcode = 2009Natur.459..164H }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the uncertainty principle, or at least the general probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, could be evidence for the two-stage model of free will. One critique, however, is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry, [[Quantum biology|nontrivial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics]] are unlikely, due to the rapid [[decoherence]] time of quantum systems at room temperature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biosystems.2004.07.001| pmid = 15555759| title = Does quantum mechanics play a non-trivial role in life?| journal = Biosystems| volume = 78| issue = 1–3| pages = 69–79| year = 2004| last1 = Davies | first1 = P. C. W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard view, however, is that this decoherence is  overcome by both screening and decoherence-free subspaces found in biological cells.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The second law of thermodynamics==

There is reason to believe that violating the uncertainty principle also strongly implies the violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Hanggi, S. Wehner, A violation of the uncertainty principle also implies the violation of the second law of thermodynamics; 2012, arXiv:1205.6894v1 (quant-phy).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vancouver system''', also known as '''Vancouver reference style''' or the '''author–number system''', is a [[citation]] style that uses numbers within the text that refer to numbered entries in the reference list. It is popular in the [[physical sciences]] and is one of two referencing systems normally used in medicine, the other being the [[Harvard referencing|author–date, or "Harvard", system]].&lt;ref name="BMA"&gt;{{vcite web|title=Reference styles|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/library/library-guide/reference-styles|date=|accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Hundreds of [[scientific journals]] use author-number systems. They all follow the same essential logic (that is, numbered citations pointing to numbered list entries), although the trivial details of the output mask, such as [[punctuation]], [[letter case#Case styles|casing of titles]], and [[italic type|italic]], vary widely among them. They have existed for over a century; the names "Vancouver system" or "Vancouver style" have existed since 1978. The latest version of the latter is ''[[Citing Medicine]]'', per the ''References &gt; Style and Format'' section of the ICMJE Recommendations.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations&gt;{{Citation |author=ICMJE |title=Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals |url=http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broad sense, the Vancouver system refers to any author-number system regardless of the formatting details.  A narrower definition of the Vancouver system refers to a specific author-number format specified by the [[ICMJE Recommendations]] (Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts, URM).  For example, the [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA reference style]] is Vancouver style in the broad sense because it is an author-number system that conforms to the URM, but not in the narrow sense because its formatting differs in some minor details from the NLM/PubMed style (such as what is italicized and whether the citation numbers are bracketed).

==History==
Author–number systems have existed for over a century and throughout that time have been one of the main types of [[citation]] style in [[scientific journal]]s (the other being [[parenthetical referencing|author–date]]). In 1978, a committee of editors from various [[medical journal]]s, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), met in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC, Canada]] to agree to a unified set of requirements for the articles of such journals. This meeting led to the establishment of the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] (URMs). Part of the URMs is the reference style, for which the ICMJE selected the long-established author–number principle.

The URMs were developed 15 years before the [[World Wide Web]] debuted. During those years, they were published as articles or supplements in various ICMJE member journals. These included the 1991 BMJ publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=2001512 |pmc=1669007 |year=1991 |month=Feb |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=302 |issue=6772 |pages=338–341 |issn=0959-8138 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |doi=10.1136/bmj.302.6772.338}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1995 ''[[CMAJ]]'' publication&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=7728695 |pmc=1337910 |year=1995 |month=May |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals.  | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=152 |issue=9 |pages=1459–1473 |issn=0820-3946 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1997 ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=8992922 |year=1997 |month=Jan |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. |author=International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=36–47 |issn=0003-4819 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8992922 |format=Free full text |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-126-1-199701010-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s and early 2000s, journals were asked to cite the 1997 ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' version&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=9062335 |year=1997 |month=Mar |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=277 |issue=11 |pages=927–934 |issn=0098-7484 |journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association |doi=10.1001/jama.277.11.927}}&lt;/ref&gt; when reprinting the ''Uniform requirements''.

In the early 2000s, with the Web having become a major force in academic life, the idea gradually took hold that the logical home for the latest edition of the URMs would be the [http://www.icmje.org/ ICMJE website] itself (as opposed to whichever journal article or supplement had most recently published an update). For example, as of 2004, the editors of ''[[Haematologica]]'' decided simply to invite their authors to visit www.icmje.org for the 2003 revision of the ''Uniform requirements''.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=15020262 |year=2004 |month=Mar |author=International Committee Of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) |title=Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: writing and editing for biomedical publication |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=264 |issn=0390-6078 |journal=Haematologica |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15020262 |format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early to mid-2000s, the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (which runs [[MEDLINE]] and [[PubMed]]) has hosted the ICMJE's "Sample References" pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html |author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors | title = Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Sample References | accessdate = 2006-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2007, the NLM created ''[[Citing Medicine]]'', its [[style guide]] for citation style, as a new home for the style's details. The ICMJE Recommendations now point to ''[[Citing Medicine]]'' as the home for the formatting details of Vancouver style.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations/&gt; For example, in the December 2013 edition of the ICMJE Recommendations, the relevant paragraph is IV.A.3.g.ii. (''References &gt; Style and Format'').&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations/&gt;

==Sample usage==

===Labelling citations===
References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text – they are identified by [[Arabic numerals]] in [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]''' (1)''', [[square brackets]]''' [1]''', [[superscript]]'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''', or a combination'''&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;'''. The number usually appears at the end of the material it supports, and an entry in the reference list would give full bibliographical information for the source:

{{quote|Blood loss and the number of patients requiring post-operative blood transfusions were significantly greater, but operation and fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter, for the DHS versus the PFNA group&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

And the entry in the reference list would be: 1. {{cite journal|vauthors=Xu YZ, Geng DC, Mao HQ, Zhu XS, Yang HL|title=A comparison of the proximal femoral nail antirotation device and dynamic hip screw in the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fracture.|pmid=20925999|journal=J Int Med Res|date=2010|volume=38|pages=1266–1275}}

===Placing citations===
Several descriptions of the Vancouver system say that the number can be placed ''outside'' the text punctuation to avoid disruption to the flow of the text, ''or'' be placed ''inside'' the text punctuation, and that there are different cultures in different traditions.&lt;ref name="url_Leicester"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www2.le.ac.uk/library/help/citing/vancouver-numbered-system | title = Vancouver (Numbered) System | publisher = University of Leicester  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlmedind.nic.in"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://medind.nic.in/jbc/t04/i1/jbct04i1p21.pdf | title = Reference systems deciphered for you | publisher = Department of Forensic Medicine, Govt. Medical College, Patiala }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first method is recommended by some universities and colleges,&lt;ref name="urllibrary.vcc.ca"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://library.vcc.ca/downloads/VCC_VancouverStyleGuide.pdf | title = Vancouver Citation Style | publisher = Vancouver Community College | quote = The citation in brackets is placed after any commas and periods, and before any colons and semi-colons | accessdate = 2015-01-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209043418/http://library.vcc.ca/downloads/VCC_VancouverStyleGuide.pdf | archivedate = 2015-02-09 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter method is required by scientific publications such as the [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA]]&lt;ref name="urlMLA Citation Style | Cornell University Library"&gt;{{vcite web | url = https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation/mla | title = MLA Citation Style | publisher =  Cornell University Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IEEE]]&lt;ref name=IEEE/&gt; except for in the end of a block quotation. (IEEE are using Vancouver style labels within brackets, for example [1] to cite the first reference in the list, but otherwise refer to [[Chicago Style Manual]].)&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf | title = IEEE Citation Reference | format =  | work = IEEE | quote = References ... appear on the line, in square brackets, inside the punctuation. | accessdate = 2011-05-12 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110408195511/http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf | archivedate = 2011-04-08 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Vancouver system documents (the [[ICMJE recommendations]] and Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals) do not discuss placement of the citation mark.

===Format of citations===
Different formats exist for different types of sources, e.g. books, journal articles etc. Author names are abbreviated to at most two initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/ |title=Citing Medicine: The NLM Style Guide for Authors, Editors, and Publishers [Internet] | edition=2nd | first = K | last = Patrias | editor-first  = D | editor-last = Wendling |location=Bethesda, MD | publisher = National Library of Medicine (US) | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2012-02-22 | quote = Convert given (first) names and middle names to initials, for a maximum of two initials following each surname | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Citing Medicine'' does not explicitly mandate merging initials (e.g. "R. K." would be merged into "RK"), the examples used throughout the book do.

====Journal articles====

=====Standard journal articles=====
* Leurs R, Church MK, Taglialatela M. H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-antihistamines: inverse agonism, anti-inflammatory actions and cardiac effects. Clin Exp Allergy. 2002 Apr;32(4):489-498.
* Tashiro J, Yamaguchi S, Ishii T, Suzuki A, Kondo H, Morita Y, Hara K, Koyama I. Inferior oncological prognosis of surgery without oral chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer in clinical settings. World J Surg Oncol. 2014 May 10;12(1):145. [Epub ahead of print]

As an option, if a journal carries continuous pagination throughout a volume (as many medical journals do), the month and issue number may be omitted.

* Thomas MC. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs – the triple whammy. Med J Aust. 2000;172:184-185.

The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] lists all authors for all articles, because it is appropriate for capturing all authors and all of their publications in the MEDLINE database to be found by searches. However, in the reference lists of articles, most journals truncate the list after 3 or 6 names, followed by "[[et al.]]" (which most medical journals do not italicize):

* Guilbert TW, Morgan WJ, Zeiger RS, Mauger DT, Boehmer SJ, Szefler SJ, et al. Long-term inhaled corticosteroids in preschool children at high risk for asthma. N Engl J Med. 2006 May 11;354(19):1985-1997.

Optionally, a unique identifier (such as the article's [[digital object identifier|DOI]] or [[PubMed#PubMed identifier|PMID]]) may be added to the citation:

* von Itzstein M, Wu WY, Kok GB, Pegg MS, Dyason JC, Jin B, et al. Rational design of potent sialidase-based inhibitors of influenza virus replication. Nature. 1993 Jun 3;363(6428):418-423. {{PMID|8502295}}.

NLM elides ending page numbers and uses a hyphen as the range indicating character (184-5). Some journals do likewise, whereas others expand the ending page numbers in full (184-185), use an en dash instead of a hyphen (184–5), or both (184–185).

Virtually all medical journal articles are published online. Many are published online only, and many others are published online ahead of print. For the date of online publication, at the end of the citation NLM puts "[Epub Year Mon Day]" (for online-only publication) or "[Epub ahead of print]" for online ahead of print (with the month and day following the year in its normal position). In contrast, [[AMA style]] puts "[published online Month Day, Year]" at the end of the article title. It no longer uses the term "Epub" and no longer includes the words "ahead of print". It omits the year from its normal location after the journal title abbreviation if there is no print data to give (online-only publication).

The titles of journals are abbreviated. There are no periods in the abbreviation. A period comes after the abbreviation, delimiting it from the next field. The abbreviations are standardized. The standardization was formerly incomplete and internal to organizations such as NLM. It is now formalized at the [[supraorganization]]al level by documents including [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7251/ ''Citing Medicine'' at Appendix A: Abbreviations for Commonly Used English Words in Journal Titles], [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Z39.5, [[ISO 4|ISO 4: Information and documentation -- Rules for the abbreviation of title words and titles of publications]], and the [http://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-the-ltwa/ ISSN.org List of Title Word Abbreviations (LTWA)].

As per journal articles in English:

* Forneau E, Bovet D. Recherches sur l'action sympathicolytique d'un nouveau dérivé du dioxane. Arch Int Pharmacodyn. 1933;46:178-191. French.

The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] adds an English translation of the title enclosed in square brackets right after the title. The language is specified in full after the location (pagination), followed by a period.&lt;!-- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/box/A33262/?report=objectonly --&gt;

'''Xenology''' is the scientific study of [[extraterrestrial life]]. Derived from the Greek ''xenos'', which as a substantive has the meaning "stranger, wanderer, refugee" and as an adjective "foreign, alien, strange, unusual."&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', new (ninth) edition, with a supplement, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

=== In science fiction ===
It is used to denote a hypothetical science whose object of study would be extraterrestrial societies developed by alien lifeforms. In science fiction criticism and studies the term has been advocated by writers such as [[David Brin]] ("Xenology: The New Science of Asking 'Who's Out There?'" ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', 26 April 1983)&lt;ref&gt;Brian M. Stableford, ''Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 2006, p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt; as an analogue of (terrestrial) [[ethnology]]. By extension the term may also refer to the fictional creation of "alternative humankinds".&lt;ref&gt;''Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia'', p. 571.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instances in which Xenology was referred to in a work of Science Fiction include the [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky| Brothers Strugatsky's]] 1972 novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]''. In section three of which one of the character's, a noble laureate by the name of Valentine Pillman, explains Xenology as "an unnatural mixture of science fiction and formal logic. At its core is a flawed assumption—that an alien race would be psychologically human."&lt;ref name="StrugatskyStrugatsky2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arkady Strugatsky|author2=Boris Strugatsky|title=Roadside Picnic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iwpDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT92|date=16 September 2016|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-365-40085-8|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In cultural studies ===
The term xenology was employed by German [[Indologist]] [[Wilhelm Halbfass]] in his ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'' (India and Europe: Perspectives on Their Spiritual Encounter) (1981)&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'', Schwabe Verlag, Basel and Stuttgart, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the study of the ethnocentric views held by societies with regard to different classes of foreigner, in other words the positive or negative ways in which a given culture defines those outside or alien to it.&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Killingley, "Mlecchas, Yavanas and Heathens: Interacting Xenologies in Early Nineteenth-Century Calcutta," in ''Beyond Orientalism: The Work of Wilhelm Halbfass and its Impact on Indian and Cross-cultural Studies'', ed. Eli Franco, Karin Preisendanz, Editions Rodopi, Amsterdam, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenology is thus the study of the various modalities whereby self and otherness are defined "within a historically complex collision of cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Harvey P. Alper, review of ''Indien und Europa, Perspektiven ihrer geistigen Begegnung'', in ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 33, No. 2 (April, 1983), pp. 189-196&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In science ===
{{primary section|date=June 2017}}
[[Robert Freitas|Robert A. Freitas Jr.]] self-published a book on the subject, ''Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization'' (XRI, 1979). Freitas argued for the primacy of the term in the context of extraterrestrial life in a 1983 letter to the journal Nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Naming extraterrestrial life," Nature 301(13 January 1983):106 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v301/n5896/full/301106a0.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Naming extraterrestrial life," Correspondence to Nature Vol. 301(13), 13 January 1983, p 106. http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/NamingETL.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
