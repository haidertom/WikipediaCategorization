The '''Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants''', a 1998 protocol on [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs), is an addition to the 1979 [[Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]] (LRTAP). The Protocol seeks "to control, reduce or eliminate discharge, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants" in Europe, some former Soviet Union countries, and the United States, in order to reduce their transboundary fluxes so as to protect human health and the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1979|title=PROTOCOL TO THE 1979 CONVENTION ON LONG-RANGE TRANSBOUNDARY AIR POLLUTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/full%20text/1998.POPs.e.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors and promoters of the Protocol were the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE), which at the time housed 53 different country members and alliance.   The protocol was amended on 18 December 2009, but the amended version has not yet come into force.

As of May 2013, the protocol has been ratified by 31 states and the [[European Union]].

In the United States, the protocol is an executive agreement that does not require Senate approval. However, legislation is needed to resolve inconsistencies between provisions of the protocol and existing U.S. laws (specifically the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] and the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]]).

== Substances ==
The following substances are contained in the CLRTAP POPs Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;UNECE: ''[http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/Publications/11-22162-Part-C.pdf Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution 2010]'', p. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The document focuses on a list of 16 substances that have been singled out according to agreed risk criteria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 25, 1998|title=CONVENTION ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN DECISION-MAKING AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/pp/documents/cep43e.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1–35|via=UNECE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (comprising eleven pesticides, two industrial chemicals and three by-products/contaminants). The Protocol assigned the arrangements for proper disposal of waste products deemed banned and limited, including medical supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/env/lrtap/pops_h1.html|title=Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) - Air Pollution - Environmental Policy - UNECE|website=www.unece.org|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2759">'''Advice''', in [[constitutional law]], is formal, usually binding, instruction given by one constitutional officer of state to another. Especially in [[parliamentary system|parliamentary systems of government]], [[Head of state|heads of state]] often act on the basis of advice issued by [[Prime Minister|prime ministers]] or other government ministers. For example, in [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]], the monarch usually appoints [[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]] on the advice of his or her prime minister.

Among the most prominent forms of advice offered are:
* Advice to appoint and remove individual ministers.
* Advice to [[dissolve parliament]].
* Advice to deliver formal statements, such as a [[speech from the throne]].

In some states, the duty to accept advice is legally enforceable, having been created by a constitution or statute. For example, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law of Germany]] requires the [[President of Germany|President]] to appoint federal ministers on the advice of the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]]. In others, especially under the [[Westminster system]], advice may legally be rejected; for example, in several [[Commonwealth realm]]s, [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] is not legally obliged to accept the advice of her ministers. This lack of obligation forms part of the basis for the Queen's [[reserve powers]]. Nevertheless, the [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]] that the head of state accept ministerial advice is so strong that in ordinary circumstances, refusal to do so would almost certainly provoke a [[constitutional crisis]]. 

Although most advice is binding, in comparatively rare instances it is not. For example, many heads of state may choose not to follow advice on a dissolution of parliament where the government has lost the confidence of that body. In some cases, whether the advice is mandatory or truly just advisory depends on the context and authority of the person offering it. Hence the [[President of Ireland]] ordinarily is obliged to dissolve ''[[Dáil Éireann]]'' (the House of Representatives) when advised  to do so by the ''[[Taoiseach]]'' (prime minister). However, where a ''taoiseach'' has (in the words of the [[Constitution of Ireland]]) "ceased to retain the support of a majority in ''Dáil Éireann''" (i.e., lost the confidence of parliament) the President has the option of refusing to follow that advice.&lt;ref&gt;Article 13.2.2. of ''Constitution of Ireland'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The use of an advisory jury is derived from the practice of the [[Court of Chancery]] of referring [[issues of fact]] to one of the [[Common Law]] Courts of [[Westminster Hall|Westminster]] be tried by a [[jury]] as a ''feigned issue''. The ''feigned issue'' was to inform the conscience of the court, and could be disregarded by the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]]. The ''feigned issue'' was a legal fiction by stating that a wager contract was laid between two parties interested in respectively maintaining the affirmative and the negative of certain propositions. The [[Gaming Act 1845]] section 19 abolished the ''feigned issue'' and provided that the issue should the directly state the question of fact in dispute instead of a wager. The same abolition occurred in [[New York (state)|New York]] by section 72 of the [[Field Code]] in 1850.
In Watt v Starke {{ussc|101|247}} (1879) the [[United States Supreme Court]] stated "the verdict of a jury upon an issue out of chancery is only advisory." [[Federal Equity Rules|Federal Equity Rule]] 23, effective 1913, provides in an equity case when a question arises that is triable by jury, a jury trial is held on the equity side without transfer to the law side of the [[United States District Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Colleton Merc. Mfg. Co. v. Savannah River Lumber Co., 280 Fed. 358 (C.C.A.4th, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 [[Federal Rule of Civil Procedure]] 39(c)(1) authorized the in any action not triable of right by a jury the court on motion or on its own may have any issue tried by an advisory jury.

==Post Democracy==

Crouch coined the term "[[post-democracy]]" in 2000 in his book ''Coping with Post-Democracy''. It designates [[State (polity)|states]] that are conducted by fully operating [[Democracy|democratic system]]s (elections are being held, governments fall and there is [[freedom of speech]]), but whose application is progressively limited. A small elite is making the tough decisions and co-opts the democratic institutions. Crouch developed the idea in an article called ''Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?''&lt;ref&gt;Colin Crouch. [http://www.policy-network.net/pno_detail.aspx?ID=3997&amp;title=Is+there+a+liberalism+beyond+social+democracy%3f Is there a liberalism beyond social democracy?] [[Policy Network]] , 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[think tank]] [[Policy Network]] and in his subsequent book ''The Strange Non-Death of Neo-Liberalism''. The term appeared to define a running evolution within democracies during the 21st century and is [[polemic]]al because it calls attention to recognized democracies losing some of their foundations and evolving towards an [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocratic]] regime.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The '''Official Municipality Key''', formerly also known as the Official Municipality Characteristic Number or Municipality Code Number, is a number sequence for the identification of politically independent [[municipality|municipalities]] or [[unincorporated area]]s.  Other classifications for the identification of areas include [[postal code]]s, [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] codes or [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] codes.
{{TOC limit}}00923105059929

== Austria ==

=== Structure ===
The municipality identifier consists of five digits in [[Austria]], which are generated as follows: The {{color|red|'''first digit'''}} designates the number of the Austrian [[States of Austria|state]], the {{color|blue|'''second and third digits'''}} designate the district, and the {{color|green|'''fourth and fifth digits'''}} designate the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipalities|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_en/classifications/regional_breakdown/municipalities/index.html|website=Statistics Austria|publisher=Statistics Austria|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==
See [[Code officiel géographique]].

== Germany ==
In [[Germany]] the Official Municipality Key serves [[statistics|statistical]] purposes and is issued by the statistics offices of individual German [[States of Germany|states]].  The municipality key is to be indicated in instances such as changing residence on the notice of departure or registration documents.  This is done at the registration office in every town's [[city hall (administration)|city hall]].

=== Structure ===
The municipality key consists of eight digits, which are generated as follows: The {{color|red|'''first two numbers'''}} designate the individual German state.  The {{color|blue|'''third digit'''}} designates the government district (in areas without government districts a zero is used instead).  The {{color|green|'''fourth and fifth digits'''}} designate the number of the urban area (in a district-free city) or the district (in a city with districts).  The {{color|purple|'''sixth, seventh, and eighth digits'''}} indicate the municipality or the number of the unincorporated area.

==== Examples ====
{{color|red|'''08'''}} {{color|blue|'''1'''}} {{color|green|'''11'''}} {{color|purple|'''000'''}}: [[Stuttgart]]

* {{color|red|'''08'''}}: [[Baden-Württemberg]]
* {{color|blue|'''1'''}}: Government district of Stuttgart
* {{color|green|'''11'''}}: Urban area of Stuttgart
* {{color|purple|'''000'''}}: No other municipality is available, since Stuttgart is an urban area

{{color|red|'''15'''}} {{color|blue|'''3'''}} {{color|green|'''52'''}} {{color|purple|'''002'''}}: [[Aschersleben]]

* {{color|red|'''15'''}}: [[Saxony-Anhalt]]

===Structure===

Usually known as the municipal code or {{va|PSGC code}}, the number comprises nine digits rrppmmbbb, for which rr = region code, pp = province code, {{nowrap|1=mm = city / municipality}} code, bbb = barangay code.

For example, the municipality of [[Ubay, Bohol]] has a code of 071246000 meaning region 07 (Central Visayas), province 12 (Bohol), municipality 46 (Ubay) with barangay code of zero signifying "not at this level." [[Bongbong]], one of its constituent barangays, has a code of 071246007.

The province code is unique and is independent of the region code. All PSGCs, are therefore, unique.

== Switzerland ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Data codes for Switzerland]] --&gt;

=== Structure ===
The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Federal Office for Statistics|Federal Statistical Office]] generates code numbers with up to four digits, which are sequentially assigned in accordance with the official order of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]], districts, and [[municipalities of Switzerland|municipalities]].

== Sweden ==
A '''kommunkod''' (municipal code) is a numerical code given to all [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] by the Swedish tax authorities.  The code consists of four digits, the first two indicating which [[counties of Sweden|county]] the municipality is situated in, and the last two specific for the municipality.

The code system was introduced with the municipal reform of 1952. There were three different categories of municipalities at the time, which affected the number that they were allocated. Those with [[Stad (Sweden)|stad]]-status (cities) were given codes ending in 80 to 99, smaller towns ([[köping]]) 60 to 79 and [[Rural municipality|rural municipalities]] 01 to 59. The county seats were allocated codes ending in 80.

As part of the reform in the early 1970s, the categorization of municipalities was abolished, but the code was in most cases preserved. When several municipalities were merged, the code for the biggest municipality was kept.

{{Youth rights sidebar}}

A '''curfew''' is an order specifying a time during which certain regulations apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/curfew|title=curfew - definition of curfew in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/curfew|title=Curfew - Define Curfew at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically it refers to the time when individuals are required to return to and stay in their homes. Such an order may be issued by public authorities but also by the head of a household to those living in the household. For instance, an [[au pair|au pair ]] is typically given a curfew, which regulates when they must return to the host family's home in the evening.

== Etymology ==
The word "curfew" comes from the [[French language|French]] phrase "''couvre-feu''", which means "fire cover". It was later adopted into [[Middle English]]  as "curfeu", which later became the modern "curfew".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|curfew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original meaning refers to a law made by [[William The Conqueror]] that all lights and fires should be covered at the ringing of an eight o'clock bell to prevent the spread of destructive fire within communities in timber buildings.&lt;ref&gt;''Bailey's Dictionary'', fifth edition 1731&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
# An order issued by the public authorities or military forces requiring everyone or certain people to be indoors at certain times, often at night. It can be imposed to maintain public order (such as those after the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], the [[2010 Chile earthquake]], the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], and the [[2014 Ferguson unrest]]), or suppress targeted groups. Curfews have long been directed at certain groups in many cities or states, such as [[Japanese-American]] university students on the [[West Coast of the United States]] during [[World War II]], [[African-American]]s in many towns during the time of [[Jim Crow laws]], or people younger than a certain age (usually within a few years either side of 18) in many towns of the [[United States]] since the 1980s; see below.
# An order by the [[legal guardian]]s of a teenager to return home by a specific time, usually in the evening or night. This may apply daily, or vary with the day of the week, e.g., if the minor has to go to school the next day.
# An order by the head of household to a domestic assistant such as an au pair or [[nanny]]. The domestic assistant must then return home by a specific time.
# A daily requirement for guests to return to their [[hostel]] before a specified time, usually in the evening or night.
# In [[baseball]], a time after which a game must end, or play be suspended. For example, in the [[American League]] the curfew rule for many years decreed that no [[innings|inning]] could begin after 1 am local time (with the exception of international games).
# In aeronautics, [[night flying restrictions]] may restrict aircraft operations over a defined period in the nighttime, to limit the disruption of [[aircraft noise]] on the sleep of nearby residents. Notable examples are the [[London]] airports of [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]], which operate under the [[Quota Count system]].
# In a few locations in the UK patrons of licensed premises may not enter after a "curfew" time.

===Egypt===
On 28 January 2011, and following the collapse of the police system, President [[Hosni Mubarak]] declared a country-wide military enforced curfew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/28/egypt-protests-mubarak-army-curfew | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Jack | last1=Shenker | first2=Peter | last2=Beaumont | first3=Sam | last3=Jones | title=Egypt (News),Middle East and North Africa (News) MENA,World news,Hosni Mubarak,Mohamed ElBaradei,Africa (News) | date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was ignored by demonstrators who continued their sit-in in Tahrir Square. Concerned residents formed neighborhood vigilante groups to defend their communities against looters and the newly escaped prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/29/egypt-jail-break-700-prisoners-escape_n_815872.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Cara | last=Parks | title=Massive Egyptian Prison Break Frees 700 Inmates | date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second anniversary of the revolution, January 2013, a wave of demonstrations swept the country against President [[Mohamed Morsi]] who declared a curfew in [[Port Said]], [[Ismaïlia]], and [[Suez]], three cities where deadly street clashes had occurred. In defiance, the locals took to the streets during the curfew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/63539.aspx|title=Suez Canal residents defy President Morsi's curfew|work=ahram.org.eg}}&lt;/ref&gt; organizing football tournaments and street festivals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323375204578269700878491978|title=Egyptians Defy President's Curfew, as Unrest Spreads|author=Matt Bradley|date=29 January 2013|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibiting police and military forces from enforcing the curfew.

===Iceland===
Under [[Iceland|Iceland's]] Child Protection Act (no. 80/2002 Art. 92)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2002080.html "Child Protection",
2002 no. 80 May 10th&lt;/ref&gt;, children aged 12 and under may not be outdoors after 20:00 (8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.) unless accompanied by an adult. Children aged 13 to 16 may not be outdoors after 22:00 (10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.), unless on their way home from a recognized event organized by a school, sports organization or youth club. During the period 1 May to 1 September, children may be outdoors for two hours longer.

Children and teenagers that break curfew are taken to the local police station and police officers inform their parents to get them. The age limits stated here shall be based upon year of birth, not date of birth. If a parent cannot be reached, the child or teenager is taken to a shelter.

===Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Sri Lanka Police]] are empowered to declare and enforce a ''Police Curfew'' in any [[police station|police area]] for any particular period to maintain the peace, law and order. Under the [[State_of_emergency#Sri_Lanka|emergency regulations]] of the ''Public Security Ordinance'', the President may declare a curfew over the whole or over any part of the country. Travel is restricted, during a curfew, to authorised persons such as police, armed forces personal and public officers. Civilians may gain a [[Curfew Pass]] from a police station to travel during a curfew.

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] 2003 Anti-Social Behaviour Act created zones that allow police from 9 PM to 6 AM to hold and escort home unaccompanied minors under the age of 16, whether badly behaved or not. Although hailed as a success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/wear/5405822.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - England - Wear - Late night youth curfew a success|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled in one particular case that the law did not give the police a power of arrest, and officers could not force someone to come with them. On appeal the court of appeal held that the act gave police powers to escort minors home only if they are involved in, or at risk from, actual or imminently anticipated bad behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2006/court-judgment-on-governments-anti-yob-anti-child-policy.php|title=Court Judgment on Government’s ‘Anti-Yob’/ Anti-Child Policy|work=liberty-human-rights.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few towns in the United Kingdom, the [[curfew bell]] is still rung as a continuation of the medieval tradition where the bell used to be rung from the [[parish church]] to guide travelers safely towards a town or village as darkness fell, or when bad weather made it difficult to follow trackways and for the villagers to extinguish their lights and fires as a safety measure to combat accidental fires. Until 1100 it was against the law to burn any lights after the ringing of the curfew bell. In Morpeth, the curfew is rung each night at 8pm from [[Morpeth Clock Tower]]. In [[Chertsey]], it is rung at 8pm, from [[Michaelmas]] to [[Lady Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stpeterschertsey.org.uk/bells/curfew.htm|title=St. Peter's Shared Church Chertsey|work=stpeterschertsey.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short story concerning the Chertsey curfew, set in 1471, and entitled "[[Blanche Heriot]]. A legend of old [[Chertsey]] Church" was published by Albert Richard Smith in 1843, and formed a basis for the poem "[[Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight]]". At Castleton in the Peak District, the curfew is rung from Michaelmas to Shrove Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peaklandheritage.org.uk/index.asp?peakkey=31002121|title=peak district local history, customs, wildlife, transport - Peakland Heritage|work=peaklandheritage.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Wallingford in Oxfordshire, the curfew bell continues to be rung at 9pm rather than 8pm which is a one-hour extension granted by William The Conqueror as the Lord of the town was a Norman sympathiser. However, none of these curfew bells serve their original function.

===United States of America===

====Juvenile curfews====
Curfew law in the [[United States]] is usually a matter of [[local ordinance]] (mainly applied by a municipality or county), rather than federal law. However, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] guarantees certain rights, which have been applied to the states through the 14th Amendment. Hence, any curfew law may be overruled and struck down if, for example, it violates a juvenile's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] rights.
Nonetheless, curfews are set by state and local governments. They vary by state&lt;ref&gt;[http://411newyork.org/guide/2009/08/14/curfews-in-new-york/ Curfews in the State of New York]&lt;/ref&gt; and even by county or municipality. In some cities there are curfews for persons under the age of 18. American military curfews are a tool used by commanders at various installations to shape the behavior of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url= http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/curfew-put-in-place-for-all-u-s-troops-in-south-korea-1.157192
|title=Curfew put in place for all US troops in South Korea |publisher=Stars and Stripes|year=2011|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated purpose of such laws is generally to deter disorderly behavior and crime, while others can include to protect youth from victimization and to strengthen parental responsibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecode360.com/14324463|title=Town of Myersville, MD Curfew|work=ecode360.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but their effectiveness is subject to debate. Generally, curfews attempt to address [[vandalism]], [[shooting]]s, and [[property crime]]s, which are believed to happen mostly at night, but are less commonly used to address [[Legal drinking age|underage drinking]], [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] and [[teenage pregnancy]]. Parents can be fined, [[criminal charge|charged]] or ordered to take parenting classes for willingly, or through insufficient control or supervision, permitting the child to violate the curfew. Many local curfew laws were enacted in the 1950s and 1960s to attack the "juvenile delinquent" problem of youth gangs. Most curfew exceptions include:
*accompanied by a parent or an adult appointed by the parent;
*going to or coming home from work, school, religious, or recreational activity;
*engaging in a lawful employment activity or;
*involved in an emergency;
Some cities make it illegal for a business owner, operator, or any employee to knowingly allow a minor to remain in the establishment during curfew hours. A business owner, operator, or any employee may be also subject to fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faribault.org/departments/police/curfews|title=Curfews » City of Faribault, MN|work=faribault.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509034013/http://www.faribault.org/departments/police/curfews|archivedate=2012-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 UC-Berkeley study looked at the 54 larger U.S. cities that enacted youth curfews between 1985 and 2002 and found that arrests of youths affected by curfew restrictions dropped almost 15% in the first year and approximately 10% in following years.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/juvenile-curfew-laws-arrests/|title="Impact of Juvenile Curfew Laws on Arrests of Youth and Adults" at Journalist's Resource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all studies agree with the conclusion that youth curfew laws actually reduce crime, and many studies find no benefit or sometimes even the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;https://jjie.org/2013/10/14/op-ed-why-dont-youth-curfews-work/ OP-ED: Why Don’t Youth Curfews Work?, Mike Males | October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/repealing-juvenile-curfew-laws-could-make-cities-safer/ 
Repealing juvenile curfew laws could make cities safer
Jennifer L. DoleacTuesday, December 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one 2016 systematic review of 12 studies on the matter found that the effect on crime is close to zero, and can perhaps even backfire somewhat.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/07/31/the-curfew-myth The Curfew Myth, Ivonne Roman&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also concerns about [[racial profiling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/03/new_orleans_curfew_data_93_per.html|title=New Orleans curfew data: 93 percent of curfew arrestees are black|work=NOLA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to concerns about racial profiling, [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] passed a limited curfew, which would permit police officers to arrest juveniles in situations that appear threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/pdf/curfew.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514002127/http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/pdf/curfew.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mall curfews====
Many malls in the United States have policies that prohibit minors under a specified age from entering the mall after specified times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://997now.cbslocal.com/2012/05/10/upscale-mall-enforces-teen-curfew-dress-code/|title=Upscale Mall Enforces Teen Curfew &amp; Dress Code|work=cbslocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless they are accompanied by a parent or another adult or are working at the mall during curfew times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northparkcenter.com/Code-of-Conduct|title=Code of Conduct - NorthPark Center|work=northparkcenter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such policies are known as ''mall curfews.'' Malls that have policies prohibiting unaccompanied minors at any time are known as ''parental escort policies.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mallofamerica.com/guests/escorts|title=Parental Escort Policy|work=mallofamerica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Curfews for all====
States and municipalities in the United States have occasionally enacted curfews on the population at large, often as a result of severely [[inclement weather]] or [[political dissent|political unrest]]. Some such curfews require all citizens simply to refrain from driving. Others require all citizens to remain inside, with exceptions granted to those in important positions, such as [[elected official]]s, [[law enforcement]] personnel, [[first responder]]s, [[health care]] workers, and the [[mass media]].

In 2015, the city of [[Baltimore]] enacted a curfew on all citizens that lasted for five days and prohibited all citizens from going outdoors from 10 pm to 5 am with the exception of those traveling to or from work and those with medical emergencies. This was in response to the [[2015 Baltimore protests]].

However, unlike juvenile curfews, all-ages curfews have always been very limited in terms of both location and duration.  That is, they are temporary and restricted to very specific areas, and generally only implemented during states of emergency, then subsequently lifted or allowed to sunset.

===New Zealand===
Curfew laws do not exist in New Zealand and therefore cannot be legally enforced by Police.

The '''doctrine of exoneration of liens''' (sometimes simply referred to as "'''doctrine of exoneration'''") refers to a [[common law]] rule. The rule says that encumbrances (i.e. a [[mortgage law|mortgage]]) of a property conveyed by a [[Will (law)|will]] is discharged with funds from the originating [[Estate (law)|estate]], not from the property itself.&lt;ref name=WT&amp;E&gt;

'''''Domicilium citandi et executandi''''' is a [[Latin]] legal term meaning the address nominated by a party in a [[legal contract]] where legal notices may be sent; the onus usually being upon that party to notify the other signatory of any change in address, especially to be ready to receive any notice that is delivered to that address.

For instance, the delivery of a [[legal notice]] to the address of the ''domicilium citandi et executandi'' of a party to a contract can be considered legally sufficient for that notice to be considered received by that party, without the need for the person giving notice actually to find the person.

One or both parties to a contract may demand the other nominate a ''domicilium citandi et executandi'', typically in order to expedite later legal procedures relating to a contract by making it impossible for a party to claim that a legal notice was not received.

The literal translation from Latin into English is "house for summoning and upkeep".

The Latin term is commonly used within the [[legal jurisdiction]] of [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]].

'''Emphyteusis''' is a right, susceptible of assignment and of descent, charged on productive [[real estate]], the right being coupled with the enjoyment of the property on condition of taking care of the estate and paying [[tax]]es and sometimes a small [[renting|rent]].

It started in the early [[Roman Empire]] and was initially granted by the state for the purposes of [[agriculture]] or building on land. In essence it was a long-term lease of an imperial domain of private land for a rental in kind. The title existing before emphyteusis was ''ius in agro vectigali''. The emphyteusis gave the lease-holder (emphyteuta) rights similar to those of a proprietor, although the real owner remained the person to whom the rent (''canon'' or ''pensio'') was paid. Nevertheless,  the tenant gained most of the rights of the owner. Accordingly, he could maintain ''actio vectigalis in rem'' against any one to recover possession of the land thus leased to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Institutes of Roman Law by Gaius|last=Poste|first=Edward|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1904|isbn=|location=|pages=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under certain circumstances, the land returned to the owner (as in the case of the death of the emphyteuta without an heir, non-payment of the rent or taxes for three years (or 2 years in case of land held of the [[Church and state in medieval Europe|Church]]), lapse of time if a term was fixed in the original agreement, ''contractus emphyteuseos'', which was a specific contract and neither an ordinary lease nor a sale. The rights of the emphyteuta embraced the full use of the land and its products; they were alienable and transferable by testament or ''ab intestato''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law|last=Berger|first=Adolf|publisher=French University|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16961">'''Enterprise legal management''' ('''ELM''') is a practice management strategy of corporate legal departments, insurance claims departments, and government legal and contract management departments.

ELM developed during the 1990s in response to increased corporate demands for accountability, transparency, and predictability, and employs software to manage internal legal documents and workflows, [[electronic billing]] and invoicing, and to guide decision-making through reporting and analytics.

==Definitions==
Still an evolving term, ELM is a recognized management discipline and a strategic objective of [[general counsel]].&lt;ref name=Hyperion&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enterprise Legal Management: Electronic Billing and Matter Management Systems for Corporations|journal=Hyperion MarketView Report|date=2013|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have argued that ELM falls within the broader category of [[corporate governance]], risk, and compliance ([[Governance, risk management, and compliance|GRC]]); others maintain that ELM and GRC are separate entities along a continuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate but related technologies include [[information governance]], [[electronic discovery]], [[legal hold]], [[contract management]], [[corporate secretary]], and board of directors’ communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ELM software may integrate some or all of these components.

==Historical Development==

===Early Practice Management===
[[Law practice management]] refers to the business aspect of operating a law firm or in-house legal team. Components include economics, workplace communication and management, ethics, and client service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mont|first1=Joe|title=When Enterprise Legal Management and GRC Collide|url=https://www.complianceweek.com/news/news-article/when-enterprise-legal-management-and-grc-collide|website=Compliance Week|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, corporate legal spend was considered a “black box” with limited predictability and transparency, making it difficult for corporate legal teams to parse differences of efficiency and cost among outside firms, or to benchmark firm performance against previously hired counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition and Early Adoption===
Several factors led to a shift away from traditional, low-technology solutions and toward ELM, most notably the expansion of the Internet during the 1990s and subsequent development of [[Software as a service]] (SaaS) platforms. Within legal departments, factors included greater regulatory compliance risk, smaller budgets, and board member demands for greater accountability, predictability, and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the demand for budgetary information, including metrics such as the ratio of legal spend to total enterprise revenue, extended beyond board members to include other stakeholders. Corporate legal departments were positioned as the next frontier of corporate efficiency and risk management, and encouraged to operate as a true business partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enterprise Legal Management: Electronic Billing and Matter Management Systems for Corporations|journal=Hyperion MarketView Report|date=2013|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created pressure to reduce costs and, when possible, generate revenue for the larger enterprise.

Departments’ varied sizes and responsibilities created a range of practice management needs. A legal department with a small number of in-house attorneys might oversee thousands of cases managed by outside counsel, while a large internal legal department could handle most cases in-house. Smaller departments focused on management of workflow, collaboration, and [[spend management]]; larger departments had greater needs for internal [[matter management]], attorney utilization, and document management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Iffergan|first1=Eyal|title=New Solution Models Evolve for ELM|url=http://www.hgpresearch.com/new-solution-models-evolve-for-elm/|website=Hyperion GP Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first electronic transitions were to generic matter management applications, which replaced paper files as the system of record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialization and Expansion===
Initial [[enterprise resource planning]] systems did not meet the specific needs of legal departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kozubek|first1=Michael|title=ELM Systems Provide Global Solutions|url=http://www.insidecounsel.com/2010/12/01/elm-systems-provide-global-solutions|website=Inside Counsel|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; External legal costs presented unique management challenges because of the billable-hour model and unpredictable labor requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software specialization integrated matter management and preexisting, internal billing software. This integration provided the opportunity to meet management demands for increased communication and information from within corporate legal departments. Ultimately, it extended further to combine legal information with finance, compliance, and risk-management departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kozubek|first1=Michael|title=ELM Systems Provide Global Solutions|url=http://www.insidecounsel.com/2010/12/01/elm-systems-provide-global-solutions|website=Inside Counsel|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments also presented risks to enterprise-wide information management. Specialized software generated the potential for conflicts between company‐wide enterprise solutions and the ELM systems of in-house legal departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enterprise Legal Management: Electronic Billing and Matter Management Systems for Corporations|journal=Hyperion MarketView Report|date=2013|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, maintaining [[data security]] was and remains a preeminent concern, especially for SaaS-based ELM platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One in four [[chief legal officer]]s (CLOs) reported a data breach during 2013–15, with the health-care industry especially vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chief Legal Officers 2015 Survey|url=http://www.acc.com/vl/public/Surveys/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageid=1389460&amp;page=/legalresources/surveys/index.cfm&amp;qstring=&amp;title=ACC%20Chief%20Legal%20Officer%20(CLO)%202015%20Survey%20%20Executive%20Summary|website=Association of Corporate Counsel|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ELM Software==
The expansion of ELM as a practice management strategy was fostered by the growth of ELM software. That growth, in turn, was made possible through the expansion of the Internet and adoption of SaaS platforms across a wide range of industries. Total revenue of all SaaS providers accelerated into the 2010s, with the [[International Data Corporation]] (IDC) forecasting revenue to grow from $22.6 billion to $50.8 billion during 2014–18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dover|first1=Christine|title=Worldwide SaaS Enterprise Applications 2014–2018 Forecast and 2013 Vendor Shares|url=http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=252568|website=International Data Corporation|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ELM software primarily supports matter management and electronic billing, with derived analytics and reporting guiding legal department business processes. As of 2013, the maturity level of the industry was characterized as early mainstream, with market penetration of less than 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Blue Hill Research report stated that economic motivations have encouraged adoption, with an average return on investment of 766%; median spend contraction of 4.5% from automated processing and rejection of nonconforming invoices; and median recurring annual spend reduction of 4% from use of analytics to support data-driven spend management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variables affecting the purchase of ELM software include considerations of license type, usage scope, maintenance and support, installation location, and license fee calculation. Vendors employ a range of licensing practices, with no model inherently advantaged or disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enterprise Legal Management: Electronic Billing and Matter Management Systems for Corporations|journal=Hyperion MarketView Report|date=2013|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components of ELM Software===

====Matter Management====
[[Matter management]] includes the storage and retrieval of all data related to matters handled by a legal department, including the creation, revision, approval, and consumption of legal documents. Matter management is used to facilitate document collaboration internally and with outside counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In complex legal matters such as [[mass tort]] litigation, ELM software provides matter management capabilities such as batch uploading of invoices to expedite review and approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal E-Billing Technology Geared toward Mass Tort Litigation Drastically Reduces Client Review Time|url=http://www.acuityelm.com/legal-e-billing-technology-geared-toward-mass-tort-litigation-drastically-reduces-client-review-time/|website=Acuity ELM|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electronic Billing====
[[Electronic billing]] provides a centralized repository for legal bills and invoices, and a method to deliver those bills securely for review and payment. ELM software integrates with internal electronic billing software through the [[Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard]] ([[LEDES]]) format, which has standardized the transfer of legal data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEDES: The Global Standard in Legal Data Exchange|url=http://ledes.org|website=LEDES|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Development of LEDES in the late 1990s was supplemented by the [[American Bar Association]]’s creation of [[Uniform Task-Based Management System]] ([[UTBMS]]) to establish consistent coding of services by outside counsel.

Electronic billing automates review for compliance errors, allocation to cost centers, and routing for approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent research suggests that it reduces costs by decreasing manual labor and paper costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analytics and Business Process Management====
Matter management and electronic billing data collected by ELM software is used to generate reports and provide analytics that influence [[business process management]] within legal departments.

According to a [[Gartner]] survey, CLOs increasingly focus on regulatory compliance, customer and stakeholder satisfaction, and risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to reduce legal spend center on the reduction of outside counsel costs, achieved through the negotiation of [[alternative fee arrangements]], increased reliance on internal counsel, and convergence of outside counsel. Use of flat fees for entire matters grew from 12 to 20% during 2013–15, with larger legal departments—those serving companies with at least $4 billion in annual revenue—more than twice as likely to use a flat fee structure compared to companies with less than $100 million in annual revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chief Legal Officers 2015 Survey|url=http://www.acc.com/vl/public/Surveys/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageid=1389460&amp;page=/legalresources/surveys/index.cfm&amp;qstring=&amp;title=ACC%20Chief%20Legal%20Officer%20(CLO)%202015%20Survey%20%20Executive%20Summary|website=Association of Corporate Counsel|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Legal departments use analytics to inform these budgeting and forecasting decisions, with the selection of outside law firms based on tradeoffs between cost and attorney performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal historical billing data and industry benchmarks identify trends and differences among providers, and average fees associated with matter types. Some ELM software vendors offer comparative metrics harvested from subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Houlihan|first1=David|title=Benchmark Report: The Business Value of Legal Spend Management Investments|url=http://bluehillresearch.com/the-business-value-of-legal-spend-management-investments/|website=Blue Hill Research|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vendor Landscape==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Vendors come from one of two backgrounds: content provision or [[software development]]. Some vendors specialize in ELM software, while others include ELM software as part of a broader suite of legal software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John|title=Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Legal Management|journal=Gartner|date=23 October 2013|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; SaaS-based and on-premises solutions exist, although many on-premises providers have shifted to SaaS-based models or added SaaS-based options.

Multiple acquisitions occurred within the industry during 2011–15. In 2011 Bottomline Technologies acquired Allegiant Systems; in 2014 [[Wolters Kluwer]], owner of TyMetrix, acquired competitor Datacert; and in 2015 Mitratech purchased Houston-based Bridgeway Software and EAG's CaseTrack.

An '''eternity clause''' in the [[constitution]] or [[basic law]] of a country is a clause intended to ensure that the law or constitution cannot be changed by amendment. Eternity clauses are a type of [[entrenched clause]] in the constitutions of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]],&lt;ref name=CECEE/&gt; [[Constitution of Germany|Germany]], [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkey]], [[Constitution of Greece|Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf The official English language translation of the Greek Constitution as of May 27, 2008], Article 110 §1, p. 124, source: Hellenic Parliament, "The provisions of the Constitution shall be subject to revision with the exception of those which determine the form of government as a Parliamentary Republic and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7 , 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, 13 paragraph 1, and 26."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitution of Italy|Italy]],&lt;ref name=weakcon&gt;{{cite book|title=Weak Constitutionalism: Democratic Legitimacy and the Question of Constituent Power (Routledge Research in Constitutional Law|author=Joel Colón-Ríos|isbn=978-0415671903|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqqQAzH2zxEC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ac5BHQMPUf&amp;sig=W94bSY1hO-OioXESL7MR08Hp_gI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LVJUP-bAYnb0QXhuoDQCA|year=2012|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitution of Morocco|Morocco]],&lt;ref name=EWC/&gt; [[Constitution of Iran|the Islamic Republic of Iran]], [[Constitution of Brazil|the Federative Republic of Brazil]] and [[Constitution of Norway|Norway]].&lt;ref name=weakcon/&gt;

The [[Constitution of India]] and the [[Constitution of Colombia]] contain similar provisions aimed at making it difficult, but not impossible, to change their basic structure.&lt;ref name=weakcon/&gt;

==Brazil==
Article 60 paragraph 4th of the [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil]], lists four subject areas of the Constitution that cannot be amended:&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Constituição brasileira de 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Federal form of the state; 
# direct, secret universal and periodic voting; 
# separation of powers; and 
# individual rights and guarantees.

There are other clauses that implicitly cannot be amended, mostly because they are dependent of the subjects above.

==Czech Republic==
The [[Czech Constitution]] contains an explicit eternity clause, whereby the [[Czech constitutional court]] assumes the role of ultimate arbiter of the effect of [[European law]] on the constitution.&lt;ref name=CECEE&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutional Evolution in Central and Eastern Europe (Studies in Modern Law and Policy) |author=Kyriaki Topidi and Alexander H.E. Morawa|isbn=978-1409403272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhLKZKm7zGgC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6I3qdcCgv7&amp;sig=-N5b6wCU8dqfjiKGSAe1xWgxBmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LVJUP-bAYnb0QXhuoDQCA|year=2010|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The German eternity clause (German: ''Ewigkeitsklausel'') is Article 79 paragraph (3) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (German: ''Grundgesetz''). The eternity clause establishes that certain fundamental principles of [[Germany]]'s democracy can never be removed, even by [[parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/304634/defending-german-democracy-andrew-stuttaford|title=Defending German Democracy|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental principles, (i.e., "the basic principles" of Articles 1 and 20), are as follows:

* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." Art. 1;
* '''Acknowledgement of human rights''': "The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world." Art. 1 Para. (2);
* '''Directly enforceable law''': "The following basic rights bind the legislature, the executive and judiciary as directly enforceable law." Art. 1 Para. (3);
* '''Republic''' (form of government): Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Federal state''' ''(Länder)'': Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Social state''' (welfare state): Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." Art. 20 Para. (2);
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people by means of elections and voting and by specific legislative, executive and judicial organs." Art. 20 Para. (2);
* '''Rule of law''' (Rechtsstaat): "Legislation is subject to the constitutional order. The executive and judiciary are bound by the law." Art. 20 Para. (3);
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," each "bound by the law." Art. 20 Paras. (2) and (3).

The ''[[Parlamentarischer Rat]]'' (Parliamentary Council) included the eternity clause in its Basic Law specifically to prevent a new "legal" pathway to a dictatorship as was the case in the [[Weimar Republic]] with the [[Enabling Act of 1933]].&lt;ref name="iiea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiea.com/publications/challenges-to-the-esm-treaty-and-the-fiscal-compact-treaty-before-the-german-constitutional-court|title=The Euro Crisis: Challenges to the ESM Treaty and the Fiscal Compact Treaty before the German Constitutional Court|publisher=[[Institute of International and European Affairs]]|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not possible for any political party, any legislation or any national commitment to violate "the basic principles" of "this Basic Law" laid down in Articles 1 and 20. Furthermore, the only way that Articles 1 and 20 can be removed is through Article 146, which requires "a constitution that is adopted by a free decision of the German People."&lt;ref name="iiea" /&gt;  So long as the principles of Articles 1 and 20 are retained, they may be amended (as Article 20 has indeed been amended to establish a 'right of resistance'), but the full protection of the eternity clause does not extend to such amendments.

Unlike the [[Weimar Constitution]], which made human rights only an objective, the eternity clause and Articles 1 and 20 make specific demands of "all state authority" regarding "human rights" (that is, "the basic rights" guaranteed in "this Basic Law") and have established specific [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] organs in "the constitutional order" of "this Basic Law", each with separate functions bound by the [[law]]. These are "the basic principles" of the [[rule of law|democratic rule of law]] (German: ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'') and the [[separation of powers]], which are principles endorsed by three [[United Nations resolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ruleoflaw/index.shtml|title=United Nations and the Rule of Law |publisher=Un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Vague|date=September 2018}}

==Greece==
The Greek eternity clause is Article 110 of the [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]]. This article states that every article of the [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]] can be revised by the [[Hellenic Parliament|Parliament]], except of the fundemental ones, which establish [[Greece]] as a [[parliamentary republic]] and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, article 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7, article 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, article 13 paragraph 1 and article 26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf|title=Constitution of Greece in English|publisher= [[Hellenic Parliament]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These fundamental articles include:

* '''Republic''' (form of government): Art. 1 Para. (1);
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." Art. 1 Para. (2);
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people, exist for the perople and the nation and are exercised as the Constitution suggests." Art. 1 Para. (3);
* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." Art. 2 Para. (1);
* '''Rule of law''': "Every Greek is equal to the law." Art. 4 Para. (1);
* '''About Public Function''': "Only Greek citizens are acceptable to all public functions, except of the exceptions in special laws." Art. 4 Para (4);
* '''About nobility titles''': "Noble or excellence titles are not given and not reconised on Greek citizens." Art. 4 Para (7);
* '''Acknowledgement of free personality''': "All people shall have the right to develop freely their personality and to participate in the social, economic and political life of the country, insofar as they do not infringe the rights of others or violate the Constitution and the good usages." Art. 5 Para (1);
* '''Personal Liberty''': "Personal liberty is inviolable. No one shall be prosecuted, arrested, imprisoned or otherwise confined except when and as the law provides." Art. 5 Para. (3);
* '''Freedom of Religion''': "Freedom of religious conscience is inviolable. The enjoyment of civil rights and liberties does not depend on the individual’s religious beliefs." Art. 13 Para. (1)
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," Art. 26;

==India==
The [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] has developed the [[basic structure doctrine]] which holds that certain features of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] are fundamental in nature and cannot be modified through parliamentary amendment. The Supreme Court has yet to clearly delimit the components of the basic structure.

==Iran==
The final Article of the [[Constitution of Iran|Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], Art. 177, ensures that particular aspects of the Constitution are unalterable. These include the Islamic character of government and laws, the objectives of the republic, the democratic character of the government, “the absolute wilayat al-'amr and the leadership of the Ummah,” the administration of the country by referendum, and the official religion of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranchamber.com/government/laws/constitution_ch13.php The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morocco==
In the [[Constitution of Morocco]], eternity clauses exist that ensure certain provisions cannot be amended, including the role of [[Islam]] in the nation's law, and the role of the [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]] in law.&lt;ref name=EWC&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|author=Gerhard Robbers|isbn=978-0816060788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;pg=PA626&amp;lpg=PA626&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YdnxLlYGpo&amp;sig=6JeZzSC2H1Ms2nzztB6w7F1N7H8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CLNJULKMOYXL0AWJ6YHICw|year=2006|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Law Students' Association''' ('''ELSA''') is an international, independent, non-political, non-profit, [[non-governmental organisation]] run by and for law students. ELSA-activities comprise a large variety of academic and professional events that are organised to fulfill the stated vision of ELSA.

==History==
Five law students from [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[West Germany]] founded ELSA on 4 May 1981. It claims to be the world's largest independent law students association and to be represented at nearly 375 law faculties in 44 countries&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/network/&lt;/ref&gt; across Europe with membership of some 50,000 students and young lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/#home&lt;/ref&gt;

ELSA-activities comprise a large variety of academic and professional events that are organised to fulfill the stated vision of ELSA and in order to provide its members opportunities to enhance their skills and to interact with each other.

==Organization==
ELSA is organized into local member groups active at university level (Local Group), national member groups active on a national level (National Group), and ELSA International active on an international level. 

Membership of ELSA for individual law students is possible through the Local Groups (for instance ELSA Leiden&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elsaleiden.nl/nl/&lt;/ref&gt;). The Local Groups are member of a National Group (for instance ELSA the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;http://elsa-thenetherlands.org/&lt;/ref&gt;). The National Groups are part of the international ELSA network, which is managed by ELSA International with headquarters in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. ELSA International consists of the International Board, the ELSA International Team, and the Auditors of ELSA.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/team/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The International Board is the supreme executive body of the association. Its members are elected at an International Council Meeting (ICM) (which consists of all the National Groups) for a one-year period. The International Board's responsibilities include the overall co-ordination of the organisation as a whole including the support of member groups both locally and nationally. The International Board also co-ordinates and develops ELSA's collaboration with various international organisations and institutions, governments, law firms, and companies across Europe.

==Identity==
ELSA's 350 university-based local groups and 44 national groups as well as the international board are entirely student-managed and administered. Similar to a small franchise, each group creates its own plan of operation in line with the overall goals of the association. Each group recruits and trains its volunteer executives and markets ELSA's programmes to the academic and business community. In combination with the university curriculum, ELSA prepares its members for their future entry into professional life, especially when working in an international environment. The philosophy of ELSA is defined by the following statements regarding its vision, purpose, and means&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;: 

''Vision:''&lt;br&gt;"A just world in which there is respect for human dignity and cultural diversity".

''Purpose:''&lt;br&gt;"To contribute to legal education, to foster mutual understanding and to promote social responsibility of law students and young lawyers".

''Means:''&lt;br&gt;
*Providing opportunities for law students and young lawyers to learn about other cultures and legal systems in a spirit of critical dialogue and scientific co-operation.
*Assisting law students and young lawyers to be internationally minded and professionally skilled.
*Encouraging law students and young lawyers to act for the good of society.

==Institutional relations==
ELSA has gained consultative status with several United Nations bodies. In 1994, ELSA was granted Consultative Status in Category C in [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization)&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/partnerships/non-governmental-organizations/european-law-students-association&lt;/ref&gt;, and in 1997 ELSA obtained Special Consultative Status with [[ECOSOC]] (United Nations Economic and Social Council)&lt;ref&gt;See section II http://undocs.org/E/2016/INF/5&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition [[UNCITRAL]] (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) is inviting ELSA delegations to participate in their sessions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

ELSA was part of the Diplomatic Conference of 1998 in [[Rome]] where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was adopted to establish the [[International Criminal Court]]. ELSA participated with a delegation as an NGO represented by an observer.&lt;ref&gt;See Annex IV http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/finalfra.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, ELSA was granted Participatory Status with the [[Council of Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;http://coe-ngo.org/#/ingos&lt;/ref&gt;. This cooperation was further widened with the signing of a Human Rights Partnership between Council of Europe and ELSA in 2008&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/human-rights-channel/elsa&lt;/ref&gt;.

Furthermore, ELSA has a co-operation agreement with [[UNHCR]] (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} In October 2005, ELSA obtained Observer Status with [[WIPO]] (World Intellectual Property Organization)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/members/en/organizations.jsp?type=ngo_int&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since 2002, ELSA organizes the [[John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition]] (formerly known as ELSA Moot Court Competition) with the support of the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/emc2_maps_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The final round is held at the WTO headquarters in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news17_e/disp_06jun17_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
ELSA's activities include the organization of:

*[[John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition]] (previously called ELSA Moot Court Competition) on WTO Law.
*Lectures, seminars, and conference (both local and international)
*Study visits

Furthermore, ELSA co-operates with other student organisations across the world, for instance the Asian Law Students' Association (ALSA) in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;http://alsainternational.org/elsa-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

'''Synergy'''&lt;br&gt;Synergy is a biannual publication that is printed in 10,000 copies and distributed throughout the network.&lt;ref&gt;https://elsa.org/synergy-magazine/&lt;/ref&gt; It contains articles written by members, academics and institutions. The magazine was first published as a newsletter back in 1987.

'''Federal judges''' are judges appointed by a federal level of government as opposed to the state/provincial/local level.

==Brazil==
In Brazil, federal judges of first instance are chosen exclusively by [[public contest]]. Judges of Federal Courts of Appeal or Higher Courts are appointed according to specific rules. [[Appeal]] judges of second instance are called [[Desembargador]](es).

==Canada==
{{Main|Judicial appointments in Canada}}
[[Canada]] is a federation composed of a federal (central) government and of ten provinces and three territories. There are two levels of courts in each province or territory (except Nunavut): superior (upper level) courts appointed by the federal government, and a provincial or territorial court appointed by the province or territory.

Judicial appointments to the superior courts (trial or appellate) in each province or territory are made by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] on the recommendation of the federal [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Appointments to other superior courts which have jurisdiction for all Canada ---the Federal Court, the Federal Court of Appeal, the Tax Court of Canada, and to the Supreme Court of Canada which is the final court of appeal from all Canadian courts---are also made by the Governor General on the recommendation of the federal cabinet.  Appointments to the provincial court in each province are made by the [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governor]] of the province on the recommendation of the provincial government.

==United States==
{{Main|United States federal judge}}
A '''United States federal judge''' is a [[judge]] appointed by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] in accordance with [[Article III of the U.S. Constitution|Article III]] of the [[United States Constitution]].  Judges for Circuit Courts, called "circuit judges," are also appointed by the President and are therefore also "Federal judges." Federal judges are appointed for terms of life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7211">A '''form book''' is a tool used by [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to aid in the filing of [[pleading]]s, [[Motion (legal)|motions]] and other [[legal document]]s with a [[court]] or similar decision-making body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Forms|url=https://law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/legalforms/|website=Duke Law|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form book may be a bound volume or binder containing loose-leaf pages, containing forms, clauses and model documents that the attorney might use when preparing a legal document or court pleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kunsch|first1=Kelly|title=Drafting Legal Documents: A Resource Guide|url=https://lib.law.washington.edu/btg/2001/drafting.htm|website=Seattle University Law Library|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=27 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Due to the exacting nature of legal forms and the time and effort required to prepare legal documents, form books were created as an aid in the drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basics Of Court Forms And Filings|url=http://www.civillawselfhelpcenter.org/self-help/getting-started/48-basics-of-court-forms-and-filings|website=Civil Self-Help Center|publisher=Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These books conserve time and serve as a reference to attorneys and law students seeking to use them in their practice. The importance of these books is not to be underestimated, as a form lacking proper language or information may jeopardize court proceedings.

Forms can contain standard language to be used in court proceedings, or may more closely resemble a template which is to be filled in based on case specifics. Forms found in form books are often used as a reference, as the document that will be used must be tailored specifically to the court and situation in which it will be presented.  In some cases, such as [[patents|patent]] and [[bankruptcy]], certain forms are legally required.&lt;ref name="dukeformbk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Forms|url=http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/formbks|website=Duke Law|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Form books may be arranged chronologically, alphabetically, by subject, or by [[jurisdiction]]. They may also include additional resources such as outlines, research references, annotations, state considerations, and law practice checklists in addition to the forms.

The style, format, and information required in court documents differs from one jurisdiction to another, between different levels of courts in a system, and between different areas of law. Therefore, the companies that publish [[casebooks|casebook]] and other legal materials often publish form books as well, offering selections specific to the location and type of practice in which their customers are engaged. Many publishers offer the forms in their books on computer discs. Some books may be accompanied by CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs.

The advent of the [[Internet]] has lessened demand for printed form books. Many forms are now distributed freely by various courts, and others are available for free or online purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Finding Free Legal Forms Online - And Using Them Safely|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/research/legal_forms.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Catey|title=Don’t buy legal documents online without reading this story|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-buy-legal-documents-online-without-reading-this-story-2015-11-23|accessdate=7 September 2017|agency=MarketWatch|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms online may be offered with drafting tools and other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FYI: Document Assembly|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/charts_fyis/docassembly.html|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Form Books==
There are several different categories of form books available. These differ in their organization, subject, and the nature of the information contained.

===General Form Books===
General form books usually fall into one of two categories: transactional, or covering pleading and practice processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Use Form Books|url=http://www.cooley.edu/library/research_guides/FORMBooks.pdf|website=Cooley Law School|accessdate=7 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517065143/http://www.cooley.edu/library/research_guides/FORMBooks.pdf|archivedate=9 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactional (or legal) forms give examples of [[contract]]s, [[Will (law)|wills]], [[lease]]s, [[deed]]s, [[Mortgage law|mortgages]], and other substantive matters. Pleading and practice forms provide formatting and examples for legal language to be used in various court motions such as complaints, answers, and motions to dismiss. General form books are not state specific, and are annotated and cross-referenced. They are usually arranged alphabetically or encyclopedically and may provide a topical index to aid researchers in finding specific forms.

===Form Books for Specific Subjects or Proceedings===
Publishers can provide form books that discuss a specific type of practice. Topics which might have their own form books include [[real estate]], [[business law]], and [[taxes|tax]].

===Form Books Specific to Geographic Jurisdictions===
Most states have form books containing state-specific forms. These can be published by various entities such as state courts or individual [[state bar|state bar association]] organizations. Other court systems may publish their own materials as well.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Forms|url=http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/?page_id=456|website=Florida Southern District Court|publisher=U.S. Courts|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Types of Form Books===
Another type of form book is designed for those seeking legal forms but not trained as lawyers, commonly referred to as a “self-help” form book.&lt;ref name="dukeformbk"/&gt; Topics included could be leases, wills, and contracts.

==Topics Covered in Form Books==
Typical forms included in a form book are a model [[complaint]], [[answer (law)|answer]], motion to compel [[Discovery (law)|discovery]], motion for [[summary judgment]], and request for permission to [[appeal]]. Other types of forms include:
Transactional forms used to draft wills, contracts, and documents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christian|first1=Elizabeth|title=Form Books|url=http://guide.library.law.emory.edu/practicing_attorney|website=Hugh F. McMillan Law Library|publisher=Emory Law|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International Criminal Justice at the Crossroads''''' (2003) is a book by Austrian philosopher [[Hans Köchler]], who was appointed by the [[United Nations]] as observer of the [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial|Lockerbie bombing trial]] in the Netherlands (2000-2002). Turkish and Indian editions of the book were published in 2005, an Arabic edition was published in 2011.

==Topics==
The book deals with the evolving concept of [[universal jurisdiction]], the doctrine of [[humanitarian intervention]], legal questions of [[international terrorism]], and whether [[international criminal law|international criminal justice]] can at all be practiced in the absence of a global [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. The book analyzes the various international criminal courts since [[Nuremberg]] and provides a critical assessment of the prospects of the [[International Criminal Court]]. It challenges the assumption of established legal theory in which the normative framework of [[criminal justice]] can be abstracted from actual power relations and offers elements of a new doctrine on the "[[dialectical]] relationship" between [[Political power|power]] and [[law]].

==Quote from the author==

The gradual assertion of the International Criminal Court's authority will be the test case for the ''[[separation of powers]]'', which is the indispensable requirement of the rule of law, whether at the national or international level. Only a fully independent international court will guarantee that a system of ''[[global justice]]'', associated with [[universal jurisdiction]], will not turn into a system of ''global revenge'' where political interests, not the principles of [[impartiality]] and fairness, determine the practice of [[international criminal law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11405">The '''Handschu agreement''' is a set of guidelines that regulate police behavior in [[New York City]] with regard to political activity.

==Background==
In 1971, 21 members of the [[Black Panther Party]] were tried for conspiracy to blow up police stations and department stores. They were acquitted of all charges after only 90 minutes of jury deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOkYzy4t2VEC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=1971+new+york+panther+21+acquitted&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=awUaLAZn0z&amp;sig=_oyKmE0C-cSVljTz7DF9PDo56S0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ShGUrm9E-GkyQGQyoHwAg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=1971%20new%20york%20panther%2021%20acquitted&amp;f=false | title =Warfare in the American Homeland: Policing and Prison in a Penal Democracy | author =Joy James | author2 =''[[Duke University]]'' | isbn =978-0822339236 | pages =74 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial revealed the extent to which the NYPD had infiltrated and kept dossiers on not only the Black Panthers and other radical groups, but also on [[anti-war]] groups, [[gay rights]] activists, educational reform advocates, religious groups, and civic organizations.&lt;ref name ="ApuzzoGoldberg"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UWBLg4JRmAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20panther&amp;f=false | title =Enemies Within: Inside the NYPD's Secret Spying Unit and bin Laden's Final Plot Against America | author =Matt Apuzzo, Adam Goldberg| author2 =''[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]'' | isbn =978-1476727936 | pages =44 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Handschu agreement, or decree, was the result of a [[class-action lawsuit]] filed against the City of New York, its Police Commissioner and the Intelligence Division of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) on behalf of [[Barbara Handschu]] and fifteen other [[plaintiffs]] affiliated with various political or ideological associations and organizations, known as ''Handschu v. Special Services Division'', 605 F.Supp. 1384, affirmed 787 F.2d 828.&lt;ref name ="HandschuNYTimes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20070215_nycruling.pdf | title =Handschu v. Special Services Division | author =''[[New York Times]]'' | publisher =nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs claimed that "informers and infiltrators provoked, solicited and induced members of lawful political and social groups to engage in unlawful activities"; that files were maintained with respect to "persons, places, and activities entirely unrelated to legitimate law enforcement purposes, such as those attending meetings of lawful organizations"; and that information from these files was made available to academic institutions, prospective employers, licensing agencies and others. In addition, plaintiffs protested seven types of police misconduct: (1) the use of informers; (2) infiltration; (3) interrogation; (4) overt surveillance; (5) summary punishment; (6) intelligence gathering; and (7) electronic surveillance, and alleged that these police practices which punished and repressed lawful dissent had had a "chilling effect" upon the exercise of freedom of speech, assembly and association, that they violated constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures, and that they abridged rights of privacy and due process.&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyclu.org/content/testimony-police-surveillance-of-political-activity-history-and-current-state-of-handschu-de| author=Arthur N. Eisenberg| title=Testimony: Police Surveillance of Political Activity -- The History and Current State of the Handschu Decree| publisher=New York Civil Liberties Union| accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the court found that police surveillance of political activity violated [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] protections of [[free speech]].&lt;ref name ="HandschuNYTimes"/&gt; This ruling resulted in a [[consent decree]] which prohibited the NYPD from engaging "in any investigation of political activity except through the … Intelligence Division [of the Police Department]" and required that any "such investigations shall be conducted" only in accordance with the Guidelines incorporated into the Decree. The Guidelines further prohibited the Intelligence Division from "commencing an investigation" into the political, ideological or religious activities of an individual or group unless "specific information has been received by the Police Department that a person or group engaged in political activity is engaged in, about to engage in or has threatened to engage in conduct which constitutes a crime…."&lt;ref name="Arthur N.

==Provisions==
According to the terms of the agreement, purely political activity can only be investigated by the Public Security Section (PSS) of the NYPD's Intelligence Division, and then only when the Section suspects criminal activity. When the PSS does suspect criminal activity on the part of political groups, it must obtain a warrant from the three-person Handschu Authority, a commission made up of two deputy commissioners and a mayor-appointed civilian.

The agreement also prohibits indiscriminate police videorecording and photographing of public gatherings when there is no indication that unlawful activity is occurring.

The department is also prohibited from sharing information pertaining to political activity with other law enforcement agencies unless those agencies agree to abide by the terms of the Handschu agreement.

The court order mandates the compiling of annual, publicly available reports listing the surveillance requests made by the NYPD and the number of such requests granted.

==Current status==
In 2002, the NYPD asked federal judge [[Charles S. Haight, Jr.]], the judge who presided over the original case, to abrogate numerous provisions of the agreement, claiming that they inhibited the department's ability to prevent future [[terrorist]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The department also requested that the function of the Handschu authority be changed to investigating complaints of constitutional violations, which would take away the authority's power to oversee political investigations.

In regards to the requested changes, Police Commissioner [[Raymond W. Kelly]] said, "Today we live in a more dangerous, constantly changing world, one with challenges and threats that were never envisioned when the Handschu guidelines were written."&lt;ref name="NYT2002"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/nyregion/threats-responses-surveillance-police-ask-change-rules-ease-restrictions.html | title =THREATS AND RESPONSES: SURVEILLANCE; Police Ask to Change the Rules and Ease Restrictions on Political Investigations | author =Kevin Flynn, Jacob H.

Chris Dunn of the New York [[American Civil Liberties Union|Civil Liberties Union]], called the proposal "troubling," stating that the NYPD "has no legitimate reason to spy on lawful political activity."&lt;ref name="NYT2002"/&gt;

Former New York City mayor [[Ed Koch]], previously a critic of police surveillance, agreed with the proposal to rescind large portions of the Handschu agreement. "That's the necessary cost of protecting the public in these times where we're dealing with terrorism," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On February 11, 2003, Haight ruled that the NYPD should be permitted to modify the 1985 Decree, but not to the extent originally requested by the City. The judge instructed the city to adapt the [[U.S. Attorney General]]'s Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise and Terrorism Enterprise Investigations, issued by Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] in May, 2002. This weakened the original decree in that a preliminary inquiry could be initiated when there is "information … which indicates the possibility of criminal activity."&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"/&gt;

In February 2007, [[Charles S. Haight, Jr.|Judge Haight]] ruled that the NYPD had violated the terms of the agreement by videotaping two demonstrations by advocates of the [[homeless]], one in [[Harlem]] in March 2005, the other in front of New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]'s house in December 2005. On June 13, 2007, Haight reversed the ruling, saying that attorneys for the city had provided new evidence indicating that the protestors may have been "disorderly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''''Harvey v. Horan''''', 278 F. 3d 370 (4th Cir. 2002) is a federal court case dealing with [[felony|felons]]' rights of access to [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA testing]].  The [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|Eastern Virginia District Court]] originally found that felons were entitled access to DNA testing on potentially [[exculpatory evidence]], but this finding was later overturned by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]].  Nevertheless, the case paved the way for the [[Innocence Protection Act]], which ensures that convicted offenders can try to prove their innocence by requesting DNA testing on evidence in government's possession that was used in their case.

==The case==

On April 30, 1990, James Harvey was convicted of [[rape]] and forcible [[sodomy]] by a [[jury]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] [[Circuit Court]].  He was sentenced to 25 years in [[prison]].  One piece of evidence used to convict Harvey was [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] ("RFLP") [[DNA testing]].  The victim had two assailants, and this test prevented both Harvey and his co-defendant from being excluded as a possible source of [[spermatozoa]] recovered from the victim through conventional [[serology]].  Harvey was also implicated by testimony from his co-defendant, the victim, and a third prosecution witness.  However, this testimony indicated that Harvey had not [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] during the attack.

Harvey did not appeal his conviction but did file a state petition for a [[writ]] of [[habeas corpus]].  His petition was rejected by the [[Virginia Supreme Court]] in 1993.  On February 25, 1994, Harvey filed action in federal [[United States district court|district court]] against the [[Governor of Virginia]] under [[42 U.S.C. § 1983]], a post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[civil rights]] statute that allows citizens to sue state and local officials in federal courts for [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] violations.  He claimed that the state's failure to re-test biological evidence from the case was a violation of his rights under the [[due process]] clause.  On July 25, 1995, the district court dismissed Harvey's petition, finding that he had not exhausted state remedies and would have to refile his claim for DNA testing as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under {{UnitedStatesCode|28|2254}}.

In 1996, the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[Innocence Project]] contacted the [[Virginia Division of Forensic Science]] on Harvey's behalf, requesting the biological evidence form the case.  The Innocence Project wanted to re-test the evidence using [[short tandem repeat]] ("STR") DNA testing, which was unavailable at the time of Harvey's trial. The Division of Forensic Science recommended that the Innocence Project bring its request to the Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney's office.  The Innocence Project made this request in February 1998 and July 1999.  In October 1999, Commonwealth attorney [[Robert F. Horan Jr.]] denied the request for access to the evidence, asserting that even if Harvey were excluded as a contributor of genetic material, it would not prove his innocence due to the testimony indicating that he had not left any biological evidence behind.

Harvey then filed action in [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|district court]] under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Harvey's attorneys cited this statute, which is most often used in cases of police brutality, because Harvey's previous lawyers had missed a filing deadline in the more common criminal appeals process.  They argued that Harvey's right to due process was infringed because he was denied access to potentially exculpatory evidence.  They said that the test could be decisive if it yielded certain result &amp;mdash; for example, if the laboratory identified DNA from two men and neither of them was Harvey.  They also noted that although the prosecutor claimed that his office would allow DNA testing in appropriate cases, Fairfax had never found an appropriate case. 

On April 16, 2001 in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]], U.S. District Judge [[Albert V. Bryan Jr.]] ruled that Horan had violated Harvey's right to due process under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] and [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th Amendment]] by refusing the test.  In a 13-page opinion, Bryan stated, "due process is not a technical conception with a fixed concept unrelated to time, place and circumstances. It is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands."  He found that Harvey had a due process right of access to the DNA evidence under ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]'' (1963) because the material could prove to be exculpatory evidence, asserting that "denying the plaintiff access to potentially powerful exculpatory evidence would result in . . . a miscarriage of justice."  Significantly, Bryan also concluded that Harvey’s claim was not in effect a petition for a writ of habeas corpus because Harvey was not seeking immediate release from prison or challenging his conviction.  The judge ordered Horan to send all the evidence to the [[Virginia State Laboratory]] for testing.  Although Bryant's decision was not binding in other courts, it was significant because Bryant was the first judge to issue such an order.

==The appeal==

On September 26, 2001, Horan's lawyer, [[Jack L. Gould]], appealed the decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]].  He contended that § 1983 was not an appropriate vehicle for Harvey’s action.  He stated that the procedural flaws in the claim required that it be dismissed because it was really a successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus and an attempt to get around strict rules and deadlines.

On January 23, 2002, the court concluded that Harvey's rights had not been violated and that the lower court had erred in its decision.  Fourth Circuit [[Chief Judge]] [[J. Harvie Wilkinson III]] wrote the opinion, in which Judge Niemeyer joined. Judge King wrote a concurring opinion.

The majority opinion stated that the claim was, in effect, a petition for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] brought without leave of court.  According to a previous case, ''[[Heck v. Humphrey]]'' (1994), a convicted criminal defendant cannot bring a § 1983 action that would "necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence" unless the defendant can prove that his "conviction or sentence has already been invalidated."  In this decision, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] found that [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[tort]] actions are "not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments."  As such, the majority opinion in the appeal overturned the lower court's ruling because it found that Harvey had substantively failed to make a claim under § 1983.  Judge Wilkinson wrote that Harvey had attempted to circumvent habeas corpus requirements, which required exhaustion of remedies at the state level before moving to the federal level.  By bringing his claim directly to federal court under § 1983, Harvey had violated procedure:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While we agree with Harvey that the question of guilt or innocence lies at the heart of the criminal justice system, we also believe that the proper process for raising violations of constitutional rights in criminal proceedings cannot be abandoned. Because the substance of a claim cannot be severed from the proper manner of presenting it, we find Harvey’s § 1983 action to be deficient.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The opinion went on to state that Harvey's action under § 1983 "sought to invalidate a final state conviction whose lawfulness has in no way been impugned".  Harvey claimed that he was challenging neither the fact nor the duration of his confinement, pointing out that he merely seeks evidence which could also prove his guilt.  The court found this argument to be an evasion, saying, "He is trying to use a § 1983 action as a discovery device to overturn his state conviction".  The majority opinion asserted that the finality of convictions could not be challenged by advances in technology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The possibility of post-conviction developments, whether in law or science, is simply too great to justify judicially sanctioned constitutional attacks upon final criminal judgments. …Establishing a constitutional due process right under § 1983 to retest evidence with each forward step in forensic science would leave perfectly valid judgments in a perpetually unsettled state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the majority opinion, the only purpose of Harvey's claim was to challenge his conviction based on evidence that was available to him at the time of his trial.  As such, the court concluded that Harvey's rights had not been violated by Horan.  The court also stated that Harvey could only make his claim in habeas corpus, but that even if he had the court would be forced to dismiss it, for he had already filed such a petition in federal court.

Circuit Judge King concurred in part and in judgment with the majority decision.  While he agreed that the lower court's decision was incorrect, he also contended that Harvey's claim could properly be brought under § 1983.  The judge stated that the act of providing Harvey access to evidence did not alone necessarily imply the invalidity of Harvey's conviction.  King agrees with Harvey's attorney, [[Peter J. Neufeld]], that the evidence could indeed inculpate Harvey and thus that § 1983 was a proper vehicle for bringing the action.  However, King determined that since the material had been available to him at trial and since he had not been denied access to the legal system or evidence known to be exculpatory, Harvey did not have a legal claim to discover evidence under ''Brady v. Maryland''. He stated that Harvey's claim was invalid not because he violated procedure, but because he could not prove that a state actor deprived him of a federally protected right.

==Fallout==

After the January 2002 decision was handed down, Harvey applied to Virginia's Fairfax Circuit Court for DNA testing based on a 2001 law allowing felons increased access to potentially exculpatory biological evidence that had not previously been subjected to the current DNA testing method.  On March 1, 2002, the court ordered the [[Division of Forensic Science]] to conduct the testing.  On May 15, 2002, after the testing was completed, the division filed a [[certificate of analysis]] stating that Harvey could not be eliminated as a possible contributor to the sperm fractions found on the victim. On September 24, 2002, Harvey filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Virginia Supreme Court, challenging the validity of the certificate of analysis and related test results.  The court dismissed the petition on June 10, 2004, saying that it did not have jurisdiction to consider it.

Back in March 2002, the federal appeal had come before the full Fourth Circuit as an [[en banc]] reconsideration (as opposed to the original three-judge panel).  By this time, the issue was [[mootness|moot]], but two judges, [[J. Michael Luttig]] and Wilkinson, wrote anyway.  Luttig wrote that the "right of access to evidence for tests which ... could prove beyond any doubt that the individual in fact did not commit the crime, is constitutionally required ... as a matter of basic fairness." Luttig also concluded that there is "a limited, constitutional, post-conviction right of access to previously produced forensic evidence for the purpose of [DNA] testing."  Wilkinson responded by expressing hope that inmates like Harvey would have access to DNA testing but that it was a matter for the legislature to decide.  Significantly, his majority opinion in the original appeal stated, "our decision reflects the core democratic ideal that if this entitlement is to be conferred, it should be accomplished by legislative action rather than by a federal court as a matter of constitutional right."

Wilkinson's hopes were manifested with the passage of the [[bipartisan]] [[Innocence Protection Act]] in 2004.  On February 10, 2000, Senator [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT) introduced the act after devoting nearly a year to evaluating flaws in the administration of the death penalty nationwide.  A few months later, the bill is introduced in the House by [[Bill Delahunt]] (D-MA) and [[Ray LaHood]] (R-IL).  Innocence Project co-founders Neufeld and [[Barry C. Scheck]] testified several times over the next few years as witnesses before hearings of [[U.S. Congressional committees|committee]] on the Act.  Both mentioned the ''Harvey v. Horan'' case in their testimony, saying that it was significant for being the first federal court decision in the country to recognize a constitutional right of access to post-conviction DNA testing.  The Innocence Protection Act eventually passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by an overwhelming majority (393-14) on November 5, 2003.  On October 9, 2004, the legislation, which was sponsored by Senator [[Patrick Leahy]], passed unanimously in the [[United States Senate]] after narrowly moving through the [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]].

In 2009, the [[United States Supreme Court]] addressed the issue of a [[due process clause|due process]] right to DNA testing in ''[[District Attorney's Office v. Osborne]]''. The court decided that prisoners did not have a right to the testing. The decision only affects those few states that do not have laws similar to the federal Innocence Protection Act that explicitly give prisoners a right to DNA evidence.[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/us/19scotus.html?_r=1&amp;hp]

The '''hypodermic needle model''' (known as the '''hypodermic-syringe model''', '''transmission-belt model''', or '''magic bullet theory''') is a model of [[communication]] suggesting that an intended message is directly received and wholly accepted by the receiver. The model was originally rooted in 1930s [[behaviorism]] and largely considered obsolete for a long time, but [[big data]] analytics-based [[mass customization]] has led to a modern revival of the basic idea.

==Concept==
The "magic bullet" or "hypodermic needle theory" of direct influence effects was based on early observations of the effect of mass media, as used by [[Nazi propaganda]] and the effects of [[Hollywood]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Commmunication Theory; Mass Communication: MAGIC BULLET OR HYPODERMIC NEEDLE THEORY OF COMMUNICATION http://communicationtheory.org/magic-bullet-or-hypodermic-needle-theory-of-communication/&lt;/ref&gt; People were assumed to be "uniformly controlled by their biologically based 'instincts' and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever 'stimuli' came along".&lt;ref&gt;Lowery, Shearon (1995). ''Milestones in Mass Communication Research: Media Effects'' (en inglés). USA: Longman Publishers. p. 400. {{ISBN|9780801314377}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Magic Bullet" theory graphically assumes that the media's message is a bullet fired from the "media gun" into the viewer's "head".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Asa (1995). Essentials of Mass Communication Theory. Londres: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "Hypodermic Needle Model" uses the same idea of the "shooting" paradigm. It suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Croteau, W. Hoynes (1197). ''Media/society: industries, images, and audiences''. Pine Forge Press. {{ISBN|9780803990654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This passive audience is immediately affected by these messages. The public essentially cannot escape from the media's influence, and is therefore considered a "sitting duck".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both models suggest that the public is vulnerable to the messages shot at them because of the limited communication tools and the studies of the media's effects on the masses at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D.K. &amp; Baron, S.J. (1981). ''A History of Our Understanding of Mass Communication''. Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; It means the media explores information in such a way that it injects in the mind of audiences as bullets.

The "magic bullet" and "hypodermic needle" models originate from [[Harold Lasswell]]'s 1927 book, ''Propaganda Technique in the World War''.&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H. (1927) "Propaganda Technique in the World War"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work in the history of communication studies have documented how the two models may have served as strawman theory or fallacy&lt;ref&gt;Lubken, Deborah. (2008). Remembering the Straw Man: The Travels and Adventures of Hypodermic. In D. W. Park &amp; J. Pooley (Eds.), The history of media and communication research: contested memories: Peter Lang Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;Sproule, J. M. (1989). Progressive Propaganda Critics and the Magic Bullet Myth. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 6(3), 225-246. doi:citeulike-article-id:9472331&lt;/ref&gt; Others have documented the possible medical origins of the metaphor of the magic bullet model.&lt;ref&gt;Thibault, Ghislain. (2016). Needles and Bullets: Media Theory, Medicine, and Propaganda, 1910-1940. In K. Nixon &amp; L. Servitje (Eds.), Endemic: Essays in Contagion Theory (pp. 67-91). Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-step flow==
{{main|Two-step flow of communication}}
The phrasing "hypodermic needle" is meant to give a mental image of the direct, strategic, and planned infusion of a message into an individual. But as research methodology became more highly developed, it became apparent that the media had selective influences on people.

The most famous incident often cited as an example for the hypodermic needle model was the 1938 broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and the subsequent reaction of widespread panic among its [[United States|American]] mass audience. However, this incident actually sparked the research movement, led by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and [[Herta Herzog]], that would disprove the magic bullet or hypodermic needle theory, as [[Hadley Cantril]] managed to show that reactions to the broadcast were, in fact, diverse, and were largely determined by situational and attitudinal attributes of the listeners.

In the 1940s, Lazarsfeld disproved the "magic bullet" theory and "hypodermic needle model theory" through elections studies in "The People's Choice".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Felix Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, Hazel Gaudet (1948). ''The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign''. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Lazarsfeld and colleagues executed the study by gathering research during the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The study was conducted to determine voting patterns and the relationship between the media and political power. Lazarsfeld discovered that the majority of the public remained unfazed by propaganda surrounding Roosevelt's campaign. Instead, interpersonal outlets proved more influential than the media. Therefore, Lazarsfeld concluded that the effects of the campaign were not all powerful to the point where they completely persuaded "helpless audiences", a claim that the Magic Bullet, Hypodermic Needle Model, and Lasswell asserted. These new findings also suggested that the public can select which messages affect and don't affect them.

Lazarsfeld's debunking of these models of communication provided the way for new ideas regarding the media's effects on the public. Lazarsfeld introduced the idea of the [[two-step flow of communication]]&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [[Two-step flow model]]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1944. [[Elihu Katz]] contributed to the model in 1955 through studies and publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, E.]], [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Lazarsfeld, P.F.]] (1955) ‘Personal influence: The part played by people in the flow of mass communications‘, The Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The model of the two-step flow of communication assumes that ideas flow from the mass media to opinion leaders and then to the greater public. They believed the message of the media to be transferred to the masses via this [[opinion leadership]]. Opinion leaders are categorized as individuals with the best understanding of media content and the most accessibility to the media as well. These leaders essentially take in the media's information, and explain and spread the media's messages to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1957|title=The Two-Step Flow of Communication: An Up-To-Date Report on an Hypothesis|doi=10.1086/266687|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=61–78|last1=Katz|first1=Elihu|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1279&amp;context=asc_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the two step flow model and other communication theories suggest that the media does not directly have an influence on viewers anymore. Instead, interpersonal connections and even [[selective exposure]] play a larger role in influencing the public in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Joseph Severin, James W. Tankard (1979). ''Communication Theories: Origins, Methods, Uses''. Hastings House. {{ISBN|9780803812741}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary one-step flow==
More recently, the use of [[big data]] analytics to identify user preferences and to send tailor-made messages to individuals led back to the idea of a "one-step flow of communication", which is in principle similar to the hypodermic needle model.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, W. L., &amp; Manheim, J. B. (2006). The One-Step Flow of Communication. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 608(1), 213–232. http://doi.org/10.1177/0002716206292266&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that today's massive databases allow for the [[mass customization]] of messages. So it is not one generic [[mass media]] message, but many individualized messages, coordinated by a massive algorithm. For example, [[empirical studies]] have found that in [[Twitter]] networks, traditional mass media outlets receive 80–90% of their Twitter mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from average Twitter users.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"&gt;Hilbert, M., Vasquez, J., Halpern, D., Valenzuela, S., &amp; Arriagada, E. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1177/0894439316639561 One Step, Two Step, Network Step? Complementary Perspectives on Communication Flows in Twittered Citizen Protests]. [[Social Science Computer Review]]. Freely available at http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0nn4p7mv&lt;/ref&gt; However, these same studies also argue that there is a multitude of step-flow models at work in today's digital communication landscape.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Choi, S. (2014). The Two-Step Flow of Communication in Twitter-Based Public Forums. Social Science Computer Review, 0894439314556599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stansberry, K. (2012).

This is a list of political topics, including political science terms, political philosophies, political issues, etc.

'''[[Politics]]''' is the process by which groups of people make decisions. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within civil [[government]]s, politics is observed in all human group interactions, including [[corporation|corporate]], [[academia|academic]], and [[religion|religious]] institutions. Politics consists of "social relations involving authority or power"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.die.net/politics/ Definition of politics from die.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the regulation of a political unit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=303454 Politics (definition)@Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply [[policy]].&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/politics Definition of politics from "The Free Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Political science]]''' (also known as political studies) is the study of political behavior and examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]]. Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behavior, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.

[[File:Statua Iustitiae.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Iustitia ("[[Lady Justice]]") is a symbolic personification of the coercive power of a [[tribunal]]: a sword representing state authority, [[weighing scale#Balance|scales]] representing an objective standard, and a blindfold indicating that justice should be impartial.&lt;ref&gt;Luban, ''Law's Blindfold'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Law''' is a [[system]] of rules that are created and [[law enforcement|enforced through social or governmental institutions]] to regulate [[behavior]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been defined both as  "the [[soft science|Science]] of Justice" and "the [[the arts|Art]] of Justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/basharubin/2015/01/13/is-law-an-art-or-a-science-a-bit-of-both/ | title=Is Law an Art or a Science?: A Bit of Both}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=oR0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA525&amp;dq=Roman+ars+boni+et+aequi | title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law| isbn=9780871694324| last1=Berger| first1=Adolf| year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Law is a system that regulates and ensures that individuals or a community adhere to the will of the state. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective [[legislature]] or by a single legislator, resulting in [[statute]]s, by the executive through [[decree]]s and [[regulation]]s, or established by judges through [[precedent]], normally in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding [[contract]]s, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a [[constitution]], written or tacit, and the [[rights]] encoded therein. The law shapes [[politics]], [[economics]], [[history]] and [[society]] in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

A general distinction can be made between (a) [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, in which a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and (b) [[common law]] systems, where judge-made [[precedent]] is accepted as [[Legally binding|binding]] law. Historically, [[religious law]]s played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, and is still used in some religious communities. Islamic [[Sharia law]] is the world's most widely used religious law, and is used as the primary legal system in some countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law|title=What is sharia law?|work=brightknowledge.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019060625/http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law/|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. [[Criminal law]] deals with conduct that is considered harmful to [[social order]] and in which the [[guilt (law)|guilty]] party may be imprisoned or fined. [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]] (not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of [[lawsuits]] (disputes) between individuals or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cscja-acjcs.ca/criminal_civil_law-en.asp?l=4|title=Criminal and Civil Law|website=www.cscja-acjcs.ca|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into [[legal history]], [[philosophy]], [[economic analysis of law|economic analysis]] and [[sociology of law|sociology]]. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and [[justice]].

== Definition ==
{{Main|Definition of law|Analytical jurisprudence}}

=== Mainstream definitions ===
Numerous definitions of ''law'' have been put forward over the centuries. The ''Third New International Dictionary'' from Merriam-Webster&lt;ref&gt;''Third New International Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster, Inc., Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; defines law as: "Law is a binding custom or practice of a community; a rule or mode of conduct or action that is prescribed or formally recognized as binding by a supreme controlling authority or is made obligatory by a [[sanction (law)|sanction]] (as an edict, decree, rescript, order, ordinance, statute, resolution, rule, judicial decision, or usage) made, recognized, or enforced by the controlling authority."

The ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' published by Scribner's in 1973 defined the concept of law accordingly as: "A legal system is the most explicit, institutionalized, and complex mode of regulating human conduct. At the same time, it plays only one part in the congeries of rules which influence behavior, for social and moral rules of a less institutionalized kind are also of great importance."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', Charles Scribner's Sons, Editor Philip P. Weiner, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whether it is possible or desirable to define law ===
There have been several attempts to produce "a universally acceptable definition of law". In 1972, one source indicated that no such definition could be produced.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence. Third Edition 1972. Page 39"&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; McCoubrey and White said that the question "what is law?" has no simple answer.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Coubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. ''Textbook on Jurisprudence''. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glanville Williams]] said that the meaning of the word "law" depends on the context in which that word is used. He said that, for example, "[[early customary law]]" and "[[municipal law]]" were contexts where the word "law" had two different and irreconcilable meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Glanville. International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Meaning of the Word "Law". Revised version published in Laslett (Editor), ''Philosophy, Politics and Society'' (1956) p. 134 et seq. The original was published in (1945) 22 [[British Year Book of International Law|BYBIL]] 146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thurman Arnold]] said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word "law" and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Thurman. ''The Symbols of Government''. 1935. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word "law" (e.g. "let's forget about generalities and get down to [[Case law|cases]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|Legal history}}

[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.jpg|thumb|King [[Hammurabi]] is revealed the [[Code of Hammurabi|code of laws]] by the Mesopotamian sun god [[Shamash]], also revered as the god of justice.]]

The history of law links closely to the development of [[civilization]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian law, dating as far back as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of [[Ma'at]], characterised by tradition, [[rhetoric]]al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Théodoridés|title = law | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd century&amp;nbsp;BC, the ancient [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Ur-Nammu]] had formulated the first [[Code of Ur-Nammu|law code]], which consisted of [[Casuistry|casuistic]] statements ("if … then ..."). Around 1760&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Hammurabi|King Hammurabi]] further developed [[Babylonian law]], by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as [[Stele|stelae]], for the entire public to see; this became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British [[Assyriologists]], and has since been fully [[transliterated]] and translated into various languages, including English, Italian, German, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Hammurabi's Laws'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Testament]] dates back to 1280&amp;nbsp;BC and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-state, ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]], from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the [[slavery|slave]] class. However, Athens had no legal science or single word for "law",&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law (''thémis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''díkē'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, "Law", in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', 346&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Ancient Greek law]] contained major [[Solonian Constitution|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, ''The Nature of Athenian Democracy'', 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the [[Roman Empire]], law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref name="St107"&gt;As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law worldwide. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe and has played an important role in the creation of the idea of a common European culture (Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 2, 104–107).&lt;/ref&gt; Although codes were replaced by [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[case law]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin [[legal maxim]]s (called [[brocard (law)|brocards]]) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of [[precedent]] which later became the [[common law]]. A Europe-wide [[Law Merchant]] was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; As [[nationalism]] grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic]] and [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.&lt;ref&gt;Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71&lt;/ref&gt; EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the [[European Court of Justice]].

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 444 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Ancient [[Law of India|India]] and [[Chinese law|China]] represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', probably compiled around 100&amp;nbsp;AD (although it contains older material), and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;100–300&amp;nbsp;AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the composition and dating of these sources, see Olivelle, ''Manu's Code of Law'', 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei, [[Law of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the [[Code Civil|French]], but mostly the German Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Similarly, [[traditional Chinese law]] gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Law of the Republic of China|Taiwanese law]] retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalists, who fled there, and [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Socialist law]], which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, ''Five Years of China WTO Membership'', 263–304&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=''"But what, after all, is a law? […] When I say that the object of laws is always general, I mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the abstract, and never a particular person or action. […] On this view, we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws, since they are acts of the general will; nor whether the prince is above the law, since he is a member of the State; nor whether the law can be unjust, since no one is unjust to himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws, since they are but registers of our wills."''|source=Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''[[The Social Contract]]'', II, 6.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''The Social Contract'', [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/r/rousseau/jean_jacques/r864s/book2.html#section16 Book II: Chapter 6 (Law)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The philosophy of law is commonly known as (general) jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence asks "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?" [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural law]]yers on the other side, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of "natural law" emerged in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]], notably his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''.

[[Hugo Grotius]], the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as Aristotle had indicated—and reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Berolzheimer]], ''The World's Legal Philosophies'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]], ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 42 (par. 434)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] and his student Austin, following [[David Hume]], believed that this conflated the [[Is-ought problem|"is" and what "ought to be"]] problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's [[legal positivism|positivism]]; that real law is entirely separate from "morality".&lt;ref&gt;Green, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was also criticised by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the [[will to power]], and cannot be labelled as "moral" or "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Zur Genealogie der Moral'', Second Essay, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazantzakis, ''Friedrich Nietzsche and the Philosophy of Law'', 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linarelli, ''Nietzsche in Law's Cathedral'', 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the Austrian philosopher [[Hans Kelsen]] continued the positivist tradition in his book the ''[[Pure Theory of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marmor, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-theory/ The Pure Theory of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity", meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway ''is'' €500); law tells us what we "should" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (''[[Grundnorm]]'') instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, [[Carl Schmitt]], rejected both positivism and the idea of the [[rule of law]] because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bielefeldt, ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism'', 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception ([[state of emergency]]), which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience.&lt;ref name="F171"&gt;Finn, ''Constitutions in Crisis'', 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|Bentham's utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the 20th century.]]

Later in the 20th century, [[H. L. A. Hart]] attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, ''Hart's Legal Philosophy'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]'', [[Ronald Dworkin]] attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an "[[interpretivism (legal)|interpretive]] concept",&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410.&lt;/ref&gt; that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. [[Joseph Raz]], on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to [[sociology]], rather than jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 37 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic analysis ===
{{Main|Law and economics}}

In the 18th century [[Adam Smith]] presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.&lt;ref&gt;According to Malloy (''Law and Economics'', 114), Smith established "a classical liberal philosophy that made individuals the key referential sign while acknowledging that we live not alone but in community with others".&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. [[antitrust]] law. The most influential proponents, such as [[Richard Posner]] and [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]] and the so-called [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] of economists and lawyers including [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Gary Becker]], are generally advocates of [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]], and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of [[free market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jakoby, ''Economic Ideas and the Labour Market'', 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Posner]], one of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]], runs a blog with [[Bank of Sweden Prize]] winning economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/beckerposner/ |title=The Becker-Posner Blog |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ronald Coase]], whose first major article, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of [[transaction cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Nature of the Firm'', 386–405&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homo economicus|Rational individuals]] trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would [[bargaining|bargain]] with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', 1–44&lt;/ref&gt; Coase used the example of a [[nuisance]] case named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref name="Sturges" /&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of [[transaction costs]] may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt; So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociology ===
{{Main|Sociology of law}}

Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as [[criminology]].&lt;ref name="Jary"&gt;Cotterrell, ''Sociology of Law'', Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions of [[social construction]], [[social norms]], dispute processing and [[legal culture]] are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called [[law and society]] studies; in Europe it is more often referred to as socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, [[Eugen Ehrlich]], who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles'', Hertogh, ''Living Law'', Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109, Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Law, Culture and Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Weber]] in 1917, Weber began his career as a lawyer, and is regarded as one of the founders of sociology and sociology of law.]]

Around 1900 [[Max Weber]] defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the "legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to personal authority but to the authority of abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; Formal legal rationality was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state. Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Jary" /&gt; Another leading sociologist, [[Émile Durkheim]], wrote in his classic work ''The Division of Labour in Society'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Emile Durkheim: Law in a Moral Domain'', Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology'', 156&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early legal sociologists included [[Hugo Sinzheimer]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]] and [[Leon Petrażycki]] in Europe, and [[William Graham Sumner]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvitch, ''Sociology of Law'', 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papachristou, ''Sociology of Law'', 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological background ==
Law is complex from a methodological viewpoint. Its peculiar features make its unique against the background of other sciences and disciplines.

First, it is not only of a normative but also of a prescriptive nature. Law says how people ought to behave or not, what they may or may not require from others, and what they have to or have not to do if someone ask for that. But normative statements in law are deprived of a descriptive  or causal character as opposed to normative statements in empirical science (as a law of gravity) or even social science (as a law of demand and supply in economics).

Second, there is no possibility of empirical verification of the contents of law.  Whether the law should or should not comprise precepts of such-and-such import remains far beyond empirical proof. It is a matter of choice.

Third, law is dependent on the shape of the physical world and the limitations inherent in it. It cannot mandate behaviours which are unattainable or force people to do things which are beyond their capabilities.

Fourth, law is fully contingent on humans and their minds. Without humans and their mental operations it would be very difficult to speak about the law, its enforcement and application.

Fifth, law agents, such as judges, advocates and officials, are unspecialized in the sense that they lack some complex theories as to good and evil, empirical and social science or justice (proper distribution of goods/privileges and burdens in a society).

Sixth, the role of authority is prominent in law, while at the same time in law there are not means which enable us to check the correctness of authoritative statements (be they comprised in judicial opinions or scholarly literature).

Seventh, the procedure in which law is authoritatively applied is very specific. It is rigorous, precise, complex, casuistic and often very formal. The outcome of such procedure is obligatory in the sense that a judge cannot free himself or herself from passing his/her decision. There are also very limited means for re-opening such procedure when its being once completed.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Why Does Legal Reasoning Have to Be Unique?. The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no. 3/2016, pp.  555–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal methods ==

There are distinguished methods of legal reasoning (applying the law) and methtods of interpreting (construing) the law.
The former are [[legal syllogism]], which holds sway in civil law legal systems,  [[analogy]], which is present in common law legal systems, especially in the US, and argumentative theories that occur in both systems. The latter are different rules (directives) of legal interpretation such as directives of linguistic interpretation, teleological interpretation or systemic interpretation as well as more specific rules, for instance, [[golden rule]] or [[mischief rule]]. There are also many other arguments and cannons of interpretation which altogether make [[statutory interpretation]] possible.

== Legal systems ==
{{Main|List of national legal systems}}
In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholars argue that the significance of this distinction has progressively declined; the numerous [[legal transplants]], typical of modern law, result in the sharing by modern legal systems of many features traditionally considered typical of either common law or civil law (Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or [[public law]]. A third type of legal system—accepted by some countries without [[separation of church and state]]—is religious law, based on [[scripture]]s. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The [[sources of law|sources]] that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.

=== Civil law ===
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}

[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7| Emperor [[Justinian]] (527–565) of the [[Byzantine Empire]] who ordered the codification of [[Corpus Juris Civilis]].]]

[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]

Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation—especially [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in constitutions or [[statute]]s passed by government—and [[custom (law)|custom]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil law jurisdictions recognise custom as "the other source of law"; hence, scholars tend to divide the civil law into the broad categories of "written law" (''ius scriptum'') or legislation, and "unwritten law" (''ius non scriptum'') or custom. Yet they tend to dismiss custom as being of slight importance compared to legislation (Georgiadis, ''General Principles of Civil Law'', 19; Washofsky, ''Taking Precedent Seriously'', 7).&lt;/ref&gt; Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the [[Babylonian law|Babylonian]] ''[[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]''. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] whose texts were rediscovered by late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Western Europe. Roman law in the days of the [[Roman Republic]] and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay [[magistrate]], ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Decisions were not published in any systematic way, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529–534 AD the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]] codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the [[University of Bologna]] used it to interpret their own laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from [[religious law]]s such as [[canon law]], continued to spread throughout Europe until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the ''[[Code Civil]]'', and Germany, with the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'', modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the [[Law of Japan|Japanese]] and [[South Korea|Korean]] legal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzis, ''The Short-Lived Influence of the Napoleonic Civil Code in Greece'', 253–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirgüç-Kunt -Levine, ''Financial Structures and Economic Growth'', 204&lt;/ref&gt; Today, countries that have civil law systems range from [[Law of Russia|Russia]] and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] to most of [[Central America|Central]] and [[Law of South America|Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2100.html The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Field Listing&amp;nbsp;– Legal system], CIA&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Louisiana's Civil Code, the United States follows the common law system described below.

=== Common law and equity ===
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|King John of England signs Magna Carta]]

In [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law legal systems]], decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged as "law" on equal footing with [[statute law|statutes]] adopted through the legislative process and with [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] issued by the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]].  The "doctrine of precedent", or ''[[stare decisis]]'' (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts, and future decisions of the same court, to assure that similar cases reach similar results.  In [[Common law#2. Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems|contrast]], in "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" systems, legislative statutes are typically more detailed, and judicial decisions are shorter and less detailed, because the judge or barrister is only writing to decide the single case, rather than to set out reasoning that will guide future courts.

Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the [[British Empire]] (except Malta, [[Law of Scotland|Scotland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec law|Quebec]]). In medieval England, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] the law varied-shire-to-shire, based on disparate tribal customs. The concept of a "common law" developed during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during the late 12th century, when Henry appointed judges that had authority to create an institutionalized and unified system of law "common" to the country. The next major step in the evolution of the common law came when [[John of England|King John]] was forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This "great charter" or ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 also required that the King's entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html Magna Carta], Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt; A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralized. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the [[English Court of Common Pleas]] had five.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a systematized process of developing common law.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the system became overly systematized—overly rigid and inflexible.  As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the [[Lord Chancellor]] gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], the first [[lawyer]] to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own [[Court of Chancery]]. At first, equity was often criticized as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock (ed) ''Table Talk of [[John Selden]]'' (1927) 43; "Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a measure... equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is longer or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure a Chancellor's foot."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, courts of equity developed solid [[Maxims of equity|principles]], especially under [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gee v Pritchard]]'' (1818) 2 Swans. 402, 414&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century in England, and in [[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|1937 in the U.S.]], the two systems were [[Common law#1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity|merged]].

In developing the common law, [[Common law#Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems|academic writings]] have always played an important part, both to collect overarching principles from dispersed case law, and to argue for change. [[William Blackstone]], from around 1760, was the first scholar to collect, describe, and teach the common law.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Book the First&amp;nbsp;– Chapter the First]&lt;/ref&gt; But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious law ===
{{Main|Religious law}}
Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish [[Halakha]] and Islamic [[Sharia]]—both of which translate as the "path to follow"—while Christian [[canon law]] also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the [[Quran]] has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy), ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) and [[precedent]]. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]] respectively. Another example is the [[Torah]] or [[Old Testament]], in the [[Pentateuch]] or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The [[Halakha]] is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless, [[Israeli law]] allows [[litigant]]s to use religious laws only if they choose. [[Canon law]] is only in use by members of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].

[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|left|A trial in the Ottoman Empire, 1879, when religious law applied under the [[Mecelle]]]]

==== Sharia law ====
{{Main|Sharia}}
Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the [[Muslim world]] in a non-codified form, with the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mecelle]] code in the 19th century being a first attempt at [[Codification (law)|codifying]] elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;Anderson, ''Law Reform in the Middle East'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giannoulatos, ''Islam'', 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Jurist&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830232216/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm |date=30 August 2006 }}, Jurist&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Akhlagi, ''Iranian Commercial Law'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of [[Islamic resurgence]] has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected [[Global politics|world politics]].&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Hallaq, ''The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal institutions ==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou givest up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.|source=Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]}}

The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent [[courts]], representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] organisation, the [[legal profession]] and [[civil society]] itself. John Locke, in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', advocated for a [[separation of powers]] between the political, legislature and executive bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws'', [http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_11.htm#006 Book XI: Of the Laws Which Establish Political Liberty, with Regard to the Constitution, Chapters 6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the [[State (polity)|state]], in contrast to the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] theory of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref name="H17"&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20021125191001/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people's access to [[justice]], whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law's political basis.

=== Judiciary ===
{{Main|Judiciary}}
A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this authority is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court], Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]; in the UK, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf House of Lords Judgments], House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, the ''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]''; and in France, the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164330/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html |date=21 November 2006 }}, Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_publications_documentation_2/ Jurisprudence, publications, documentation], Cour de cassation&lt;/ref&gt; For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the [[Council of Europe]] member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, ''European Court of Human Rights'', 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|left|The judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[the Hague]]]]
Some countries allow their highest judicial authority to overrule legislation they determine to be [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. For example, in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the United States Supreme Court nullified many state statutes that had established [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] schools, finding such statutes to be incompatible with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Brown v. Board of Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only [[interpretivism (legal)|interpret]] the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the [[doctrine of precedent]]. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, ''Law of the Constitution'', 37–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[communist state]]s, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the court president is a political appointee (Jensen–Heller, ''Introduction'', 11–12). About the notion of "judicial independence" in China, see Findlay, ''Judiciary in the PRC'', 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] may invalidate such laws,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 158&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran the [[Guardian Council]] ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the "criteria of Islam".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasekh, ''Islamism and Republicanism'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislature ===
{{Main|Legislature}}
[[File:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|The debating chamber of the [[European Parliament]]]]
Prominent examples of legislatures are the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in Washington D.C., the [[Bundestag]] in Berlin, the [[Duma]] in Moscow, the [[Parliament of Italy|Parlamento Italiano]] in Rome and the [[National Assembly of France|''Assemblée nationale'']] in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out ''their'' wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are [[unicameralism|unicameral]], most countries are [[bicameralism|bicameral]], meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses.&lt;ref name="Riker101"&gt;Riker, ''The Justification of Bicameralism'', 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller [[constituency|constituencies]]. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a [[Federal republic|federal]] system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a [[House of Lords|house of review]]. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.&lt;ref name="Riker101" /&gt;

To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must [[vote]] for a [[bill (proposed law)]] in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).&lt;ref&gt;About "cabinet accountability" in both presidential and parliamentary systems, see Shugart–Haggard, ''Presidential Systems'', 67 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executive ===
{{Main|Executive (government)}}
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 2 April 2009-1.jpg|left|thumb|The [[G-20 major economies|G20]] meetings are composed of representatives of each country's executive branch.]]
The executive in a legal system serves as the centre of political [[authority]] of the [[State (polity)|State]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is led by the [[head of government]], whose office holds power under the [[Motion of no confidence|confidence]] of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections.&lt;ref name="Haggard71"&gt;Haggard, ''Presidents, Parliaments and Policy'', 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[head of state]] is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the [[President of Germany]] (appointed by [[Federal Convention (Germany)|members of federal and state legislatures]]), the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] (an [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary office]]), and the [[President of Austria]] (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the [[presidential system]], found in the [[President of the United States|United States]] and in [[President of Brazil|Brazil]]. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which it is not accountable.&lt;ref name="Haggard71" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''The New Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe'', 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]], the military and police, and the bureaucracy. [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] or [[Defence minister|defence ministry]]. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.

=== Military and police ===
{{Main|Military|Police}}
[[File:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers]]

While military organisations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is a relatively modern concept. For example, [[Medieval England]]'s system of traveling [[criminal court]]s, or [[Assize Court|assizes]], used [[show trial]]s and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Tuberville v Savage'' (1669), 1 Mod. Rep. 3, 86 Eng. Rep. 684, where a knight said in a threatening tone to a layman, "If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you."&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 History of Police Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229014447/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 |date=29 December 2006 }}, History.com Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world's first uniformed policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080506215949/http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm Des Sergents de Ville et Gardiens de la Paix à la Police de Proximité], La Préfecture de Police&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] famously argued that the state is that which controls the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of force]].&lt;ref name="mwp154"&gt;Weber, [[s:Politics as a Vocation|Politics as a Vocation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term [[failed state]] refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.&lt;ref&gt;In these cases sovereignty is eroded, and often warlords acquire excessive powers (Fukuyama, ''State-Building'', 166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bureaucracy ===
{{Main|Bureaucracy}}
[[File:UN Headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The United Nations' New York [[United Nations Headquarters|headquarters]] houses civil servants that serve its 193 member states.]]

The etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office" (''bureau'') and the [[Ancient Greek]] for word "power" (''kratos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bureaucracy&amp;searchmode Bureaucracy], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Like the military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Baron de Grimm]], a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and ''intendants'' are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.&lt;ref&gt;Albrow, ''Bureaucracy'', 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to [[private enterprise]] motivated by [[Maximization (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Mises, ''Bureaucracy'', II, [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy/section2.asp Bureaucratic Management]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="K367"&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 367&lt;/ref&gt; Negative perceptions of "[[red tape]]" aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are considered a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.&lt;ref name="K367" /&gt;

Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.&lt;ref name="mwp393"&gt;Weber, ''Economy and Society'', I, 393&lt;/ref&gt; Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, and management is composed of career experts who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.&lt;ref&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 371&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal profession ===
{{Main|Legal profession}}
[[File:Quentin Massys 007.jpg|thumb|In civil law systems such as those of Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Greece, there is a distinct category of [[Civil law notary|notary]], a legally trained public official, compensated by the parties to a transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is a 16th-century painting of such a notary by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]].]]

A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a [[barrister]] in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sunday Times v The United Kingdom]]'' [1979] [http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/1.html ECHR 1 at 49] Case no. 6538/74&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain professionalism, the [[practice of law]] is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a [[bar association]], [[bar council]] or [[law society]]. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a [[Bachelor of Laws]], a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]], or a [[Juris Doctor]] degree. Higher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a [[Master of Laws]], a [[Master of Legal Studies]], a [[Bar Professional Training Course]] or a [[Doctor of Laws]].), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment ([[admission to the bar|being admitted to the bar]]). There are few titles of respect to signify famous lawyers, such as [[Esquire]], to indicate barristers of greater dignity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British English: Esquire|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.|publisher=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins Dictionary|title=American English: Esquire|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctor of law]], to indicate a person who obtained a [[PhD]] in Law.

Many Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ahamd, [http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf Lawyers: Islamic Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001195205/http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf |date=1 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In China and other developing countries there are not sufficient professionally trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a [[law firm]], in a [[chambers (law)|chambers]] as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal [[counsel]]. In addition a lawyer may become a [[legal research]]er who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely.&lt;ref name="Fine364"&gt;Fine, ''The Globalisation of Legal Education'', 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring [[law report|case-law reports]], [[legal periodical]]s and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court [[pleading]]s, persuasive [[brief (law)|briefs]], contracts, or [[will (law)|wills]] and trusts. Negotiation and [[dispute resolution]] skills (including [[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]] techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.&lt;ref name="Fine364" /&gt;

=== Civil society ===
{{Main|Civil society}}
[[File:1963 march on washington.jpg|thumb|left|A march in Washington D.C. during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963]]

The [[classical republicanism|Classical republican]] concept of "civil society" dates back to Hobbes and Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Civil Society'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Locke saw civil society as people who have "a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise]]'', Chap. VII, Of Political or Civil_Society. Chapter 7, section 87&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] distinguished the "state" from "civil society" (''bürgerliche Gesellschaft'') in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', 3, II, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm 182]; Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 277–278&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that [[civil society]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole state–civil society was reproduced in the theories of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;(Pelczynski, ''The State and Civil Society'', 1–13; Warren, ''Civil Society'', 5–9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author [[Geoffrey Robertson QC]] wrote of international law,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes Against Humanity'', 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Freedom of speech]], [[freedom of association]] and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a [[deliberative democracy]] is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, [[cogers|debating clubs]], non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;There is no clear legal definition of the civil society, and of the institutions it includes. Most of the institutions and bodies who try to give a list of institutions (such as the [[European Economic and Social Committee]]) exclude the political parties. For further information, see Jakobs, ''Pursuing Equal Opportunities'', 5–6; Kaldor–Anheier–Glasius, ''Global Civil Society'', ''[http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf passim]'' (PDF); Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 282–283. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817130457/http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf |date=17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between "[[public law]]" (a term related closely to the [[State (law)|state]], and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "[[private law]]" (which covers contract, [[tort]] and property).&lt;ref&gt;Although many scholars argue that "the boundaries between public and private law are becoming blurred", and that this distinction has become mere "folklore" (Bergkamp, ''Liability and Environment'', 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[civil law(legal system)|civil law]] systems, contract and tort fall under a general [[law of obligations]], while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|international conventions]]. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and [[trust law|trusts]] are regarded as the "traditional core subjects",&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in England these seven subjects, with EU law substituted for international law, make up a "qualifying law degree". For criticism, see [[Peter Birks]]' poignant comments attached to a previous version of the [http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/articles1/birks1.html#appendix Notice to Law Schools].&lt;/ref&gt; although there are many [[Law#Further disciplines|further disciplines]].

[[International law]] can refer to three things: public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.
* '''[[Public international law]]''' concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The [[Sources of international law|sources]] for public international law development are [[Custom (law)|custom]], practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Public international law can be formed by [[international organisations]], such as the United Nations (which was established after the failure of the [[League of Nations]] to prevent World War II),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm History of the UN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |date=18 February 2010 }}, United Nations. [[Winston Churchill]] (''The Hinge of Fate'', 719) comments on the League of Nations' failure: "It was wrong to say that the League failed. It was rather the member states who had failed the League."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]], the [[World Trade Organization]], or the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the [[International Court of Justice]] as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;The prevailing manner of enforcing international law is still essentially "self help"; that is the reaction by states to alleged breaches of international obligations by other states (Robertson, ''Crimes against Humanity'', 90; Schermers-Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 900–901).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Petersmann, ''The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System'' [http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ International Criminal Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723080755/http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ |date=23 July 2011 }}, 32&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Conflict of laws]]''' (or "private international law" in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries) concerns which [[jurisdiction]] a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction's law should be applied. Today, businesses are increasingly capable of shifting [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]] supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses, making the question of which country has jurisdiction even more pressing. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfem, ''International Commercial Arbitration'', 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[European Union law]]''' is the first and, so far, only example of an [[supranational law|internationally accepted legal system]] other than the [[United Nations|UN]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Given the trend of increasing global economic integration, many regional agreements—especially the [[Union of South American Nations]]—are on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have gathered their authority in a system of courts and [[European Parliament|political institutions]]. These institutions are allowed the ability to enforce legal norms both against or for member states and citizens in a manner which is not possible through public international law.&lt;ref&gt;Schermers–Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 943&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[European Court of Justice]] said in the 1960s, European Union law constitutes "a new legal order of international law" for the mutual social and economic benefit of the member states.&lt;ref&gt;See the fundamental [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML C-26/62 ''Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen''], and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61964J0006:EN:HTML ''Flaminio Costa v E.N.E.L.''] decisions of the European Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional and administrative law ===
{{Main|Constitutional law|Administrative law}}
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]
Constitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. [[Constitutional law]] concerns both the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary and the human rights or [[civil liberties]] of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[Law of the United States|United States]] and [[Law of France|France]], have a single codified constitution with a [[bill of rights]]. A few, like the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those laws which constitute the [[body politic]], from [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v Carrington]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030; [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html 95 ER 807]&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]], was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v Carrington | work=19 Howell’s State Trials 1029 (1765) | publisher=Constitution Society | location=US | accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by [[Two Treatises of Government|John Locke]], holds that [[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|the individual can do anything except that which is forbidden by law]], and the state may do nothing except that which is authorised by law.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''The Second Treatise'', [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#2:9|Chapter 9, section 124]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, ''On the Rule of Law'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can sue an agency, local council, public service, or government ministry  for [[judicial review]] of actions or decisions, to ensure that they comply with the law, and that the government entity observed required procedure. The first specialist administrative court was the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' set up in 1799, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] assumed power in France.&lt;ref name="A75"&gt;Auby, ''Administrative Law in France'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal law ===
{{Main|Criminal law}}
Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]]'s seminal treatise of 1763–1764 is titled ''On Crimes and Punishments'' (''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevent people from committing a crime in the first place.&lt;ref name="W2"&gt;Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 2; Wilson, ''Criminal Law'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of [[criminal procedure]].&lt;ref name="Br2"&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London: 2012), 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[paradigm]] case of a crime lies in the proof, [[Legal burden of proof|beyond reasonable doubt]], that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or ''[[actus reus]]'' (guilty act).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 205 about ''[[Robinson v. California]]'', 370 U.S. 660 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the accused must have the requisite [[intention (criminal law)|malicious intent]] to do a criminal act, or ''[[mens rea]]'' (guilty mind). However, for so called "[[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]" crimes, an ''actus reus'' is enough.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Feinman, ''Law 111'', 260–261 about ''[[Powell v. Texas]]'', 392 U.S. 514 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (''dolus directus'' and ''dolus eventualis''), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dörmann, Doswald-Beck and Kolb, ''Elements of War Crimes'', 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, ''Leistungsstörungen'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SalemWitchcraftTrial large.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of a 17th-century criminal trial, for [[witchcraft]] in [[Salem witch trials|Salem]]]]
Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in [[self-defense (theory)|self defence]], or pleading [[insanity defense|insanity]]. Another example is in the 19th-century English case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which tested a defence of "[[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]]". The ''Mignonette'', sailing from [[Southampton]] to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17-year-old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]], expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to [[hanging|hang]], but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the [[Royal prerogative|Crown]] commuted their sentences to six months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;About ''R v Dudley and Stephens'' [1884] [http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html 14 QBD 273 DC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228224504/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html |date=28 February 2005 }}, see Simpson, ''Cannibalism and the Common Law'', 212–217, 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well.&lt;ref name="W2" /&gt; The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as "''The People'' v ..." or "''R'' (for [[Monarchy|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]]) v ...". Also, lay [[jury|juries]] are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be [[prison|imprisonment]], [[fine (penalty)|fines]], state supervision (such as probation), or [[community service]]. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences, especially with respect to [[sentence (law)|sentencing]], legal research, legislation, and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelser, ''Criminal Legislation'', 198&lt;/ref&gt; On the international field, 111 countries are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|members]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], which was established to try people for [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ The States Parties to the Rome Statute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623085130/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ |date=23 June 2011 }}, International Criminal Court&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contract law ===
{{Main|Contract}}
[[File:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|The famous Carbolic Smoke Ball advertisement to cure [[influenza]] was held to be a [[unilateral contract]]]]

Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (agreements must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Wehberg, ''Pacta Sunt Servanda'', 775&lt;/ref&gt; In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]] and the intention to create legal relations. In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get [[pound sterling|£]]100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an [[invitation to treat]], mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a [[reasonable man]] Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said [[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Justice Lindley]], "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".&lt;ref name="CCSBCE"&gt;About ''[http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205104916/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html |date=5 December 2004 }}'' [[Case citation|[1893] 1 QB 256]], and the element of consideration, see Beale and Tallon, ''Contract Law'', 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of [[estoppel]] or ''culpa in contrahendo'', can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 NSWLR 582&lt;/ref&gt; In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Germany, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/311.html §&amp;nbsp;311 Abs. II] [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills". [[Law of Germany|Germany]] has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their '[[abstraction principle (law)|abstraction principle]]' (''Abstraktionsprinzip'') means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/105.html|title=§&amp;nbsp;105 BGB Nichtigkeit der Willenserklärung|work=dejure.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. [[Unjust enrichment]] law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The Structure of Unjust Enrichment Law'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tort law ===
{{Main|Tort}}
[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|The "[[McLibel case]]" two were involved in the longest-running case in UK history for publishing a pamphlet criticising [[McDonald's]] restaurants.]]

Torts, sometimes called [[delict]]s, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.&lt;ref&gt;''Bolton v Stone'' [1951] AC 850&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law of [[negligence]], the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for their injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''.&lt;ref name="DvS"&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' ([[Case citation#England and Wales|[1932] A.C. 532, 1932 S.C. (H.L.) 31, [1932] All ER Rep 1]]). See the original text of the case in [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm UK Law Online].&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of [[ginger beer]] (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a café in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The [[House of Lords]] decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. [[Lord Atkin]] took a distinctly moral approach, and said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the [[lawyer]]'s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532, 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This became the basis for the four principles of negligence: (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a [[duty of care]] to provide safe drinks (2) he [[Breach of duty in English law|breached]] his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred [[causation (law)|but for]] his breach and (4) his act was the [[proximate cause]] of her harm.&lt;ref name="DvS" /&gt; Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.&lt;ref name="Sturges"&gt;''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[nuisance]] claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]] or [[trespass]]. A better known tort is [[slander and libel|defamation]], which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq War, ''[[George Galloway#Daily Telegraph libel case|George Galloway v Telegraph Group Ltd]]'' [2004] EWHC 2786&lt;/ref&gt; More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of [[labour law]] in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' [1901] AC 426&lt;/ref&gt; when statute does not provide immunity.&lt;ref&gt;In the UK, [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]; c.f. in the U.S., [[National Labor Relations Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property law ===
{{Main|Property law}}
[[File:South Sea Bubble.jpg|thumb|A painting of the [[South Sea Bubble]], one of the world's first ever speculations and crashes, led to strict regulation on share trading.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Bubble Act'', 610–627&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Property]] law governs ownership and possession. [[Real property]], sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd]]'' [1997] [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm 2 All ER 426]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal property]], refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as [[share (finance)|stocks and shares]]. A right ''[[in rem]]'' is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right ''[[in personam]]'' which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns [[mortgage law|mortgages]], [[leasehold estate|rental agreements]], [[license|licences]], [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], [[easement]]s and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, [[company (law)|company law]], [[trust law|trusts]] and [[commercial law]]. An example of a basic case of most property law is ''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' [1722].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' (1722) 93 ER 664, 1 Strange 505&lt;/ref&gt; A [[chimney sweep]]'s boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three [[Halfpenny (British coin)|halfpence]] and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. [[Lord Chief Justice Pratt]] ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of ''[[Possession (law)|possession]]'' in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something ''could'' belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.

This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''The Man of Property'', 251–274&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts, are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, ''Das Recht des Besitzes'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20080418181513/http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/bigpage/%22235083_00000057%22 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and [[Labour theory of property|mix our labour]] with our surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'', Chap. IX. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government. Chapter 9, section 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and trusts ===
{{Main|Equity (law)|Trust law|}}
[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|The [[Court of Chancery]], London, early 19th century]]

Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The [[Lord Chancellor]] on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, ''Snell's Equity'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; This meant equity came to operate more through [[Maxims of equity|principles]] than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''[[Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew]]'' [1998] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the early case of ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' [1722]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61&lt;/ref&gt; a child had inherited the [[lease]] on a [[Romford Market|market]] in [[Romford]], London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of [[conflict of interest]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]], agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,

{{quote|I very well see, if a trustee, on the refusal to renew, might have a lease to himself few trust-estates would be renewed … This may seem very hard, that the trustee is the only person of all mankind who might not have the lease; but it is very proper that the rule should be strictly pursued and not at all relaxed.}}

Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a [[South Sea Bubble|stock market crash]]. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nestlé v National Westminster Bank plc]]'' [1993] 1 WLR 1260&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for [[charitable trust|charitable purposes]], famous examples being the [[British Museum]] or the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

Law spreads far beyond the core subjects into virtually every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and overlap.

;Law and society
[[File:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|A trade union protest by [[UNISON]] while on strike]]
* '''[[Labour law]]''' is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship between worker, employer and trade union. This involves [[collective bargaining]] regulation, and the right to strike. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as [[job security]], [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] or a [[minimum wage]].
* '''Human rights''', [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] and [[human rights law]] are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (which founded the [[European Court of Human Rights]]) and the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] makes the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] legally binding in all member states [[Opt-outs in the European Union#Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – Poland and the United Kingdom|except Poland and the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf A Guide to the Treaty of Lisbon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910001253/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, The Law Society&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Civil procedure]]''' and '''[[criminal procedure]]''' concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern a citizen's [[right to a fair trial]] or hearing.
* '''[[Evidence (law)|Evidence]]''' law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.
* '''[[Immigration law]]''' and '''[[nationality law]]''' concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation-state that is not their own and to acquire or lose [[citizenship]]. Both also involve the [[right of asylum]] and the problem of [[statelessness|stateless]] individuals.
* '''[[Social security]]''' law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers' allowances or housing benefits.
* '''[[Family law]]''' covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and rights to property and money in the event of separation.
* '''[[Transactional law]]''' refers to the practice of law concerning business and money.

;Law and commerce
* '''[[Company law]]''' sprang from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership of property and control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, ''Modern Corporation and Private Property''&lt;/ref&gt; The law of the modern [[company (law)|company]] began with the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]], passed in the United Kingdom, which provided investors with a simple registration procedure to gain [[limited liability]] under the [[Juristic person|separate legal personality]] of the corporation.
* '''[[Commercial law]]''' covers complex contract and property law. The law of [[agency (law)|agency]], [[insurance law]], [[negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], [[insolvency]] and [[bankruptcy law]] and sales law are all important, and trace back to the medieval ''[[Law Merchant|Lex Mercatoria]]''. The UK [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the US [[Uniform Commercial Code]] are examples of codified common law commercial principles.
* '''[[Admiralty law]]''' and the '''[[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]]''' lay a basic framework for free trade and commerce across the world's oceans and seas, where outside of a country's zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as [[marine salvage|salvage]], [[Lien#Maritime liens|maritime liens]], and injuries to passengers.
* '''[[Intellectual property law]]''' aims at safeguarding creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services. These are legal rights ([[copyright]]s, trademarks, patents, and [[related right]]s) which result from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary and artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;WIPO, ''Intellectual Property'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Restitution]]''' deals with the recovery of someone else's gain, rather than [[Damages|compensation]] for one's own loss.
* '''[[Unjust enrichment]]''' When someone has been unjustly enriched (or there is an "absence of basis" for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.
* '''[[Space law]]''' is a relatively new field dealing with aspects of international law regarding human activities in Earth orbit and outer space.  While at first addressing space relations of countries via treaties, increasingly it is addressing areas such as [[commercialization of space|space commercialisation]], property, liability, and other issues.

;Law and regulation
[[File:1930-67B.png|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] trading floor after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], before tougher [[banking regulation]] was introduced]]
* '''[[Tax law]]''' involves regulations that concern [[value added tax]], [[corporate tax]], and [[income tax]].
* '''[[Bank regulation|Banking law]]''' and [[financial regulation]] set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].
* '''Regulation''' deals with the provision of [[public services]] and utilities. '''[[Water law]]''' is one example. Especially since [[privatization|privatisation]] became popular and took management of services away from public law, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by varying degrees of social responsibility. [[Energy policy|Energy]], [[Ofgem|gas]], [[telecommunication policy|telecomms]] and [[water law|water]] are regulated industries in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.
* '''[[Competition law]]''', known in the U.S. as [[antitrust]] law, is an evolving field that traces as far back as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] decrees against [[price fixing]] and the English [[restraint of trade]] doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the [[Sherman Act]] and [[Clayton Act]]) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence to distort market prices at the expense of [[consumer welfare]].
* '''[[Consumer protection|Consumer law]]''' could include anything from regulations on unfair [[contractual terms]] and clauses to directives on airline baggage insurance.
* '''[[Environmental law]]''' is increasingly important, especially in light of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the potential danger of [[climate change]]. Environmental protection also serves to penalise [[pollution|polluters]] within domestic legal systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Criminal law */ the change of 2010 to 2009 was because that was the date the new law was passed. In addition, the sentence "increased from 15 to 20 years, or exceptionally more" doesn't make sense because it is irrelevant and misleading. A felony in the Czech Republic carries a sentence of at least 5 years. The numbers given in the sentence are unnecessary and have no significance.</comment>

'''Czech law''', often referred to as the '''legal order of the Czech Republic''' (''{{lang|cs|právní řád České republiky}}''), is the [[Law|system of legal rules]] in force in the [[Czech Republic]], and in the international community it is a member of. Czech [[List of national legal systems|legal system]] belongs to the Germanic branch of continental legal culture ([[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]).&lt;ref name="bobek"&gt;Bobek, Michal. [http://www.nyulawglobal.org/Globalex/Czech_Republic1.htm "UPDATE: An Introduction to the Czech Legal System and Legal Resources Online. "] ''GlobaLex''. Hauser Global Law School Program, New York University School of Law, Sept. 2009. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Major areas of [[Public law|public]] and [[private law]] are divided into branches, among them civil, criminal, administrative, procedural and labour law, and systematically codified.

Written law is the basis of the legal order, and the most important [[Sources of law|source of law]] are: [[Regulation|legal regulations]] ([[Act of Parliament|acts of parliament]], as well as [[delegated legislation]]), [[Treaty|international treaties]] (once they have been [[Ratification|ratified]] by the parliament and [[Promulgation|promulgated]]), and such findings of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]], in which a statute or its part has been nullified as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. It is [[government gazette|made public]] by the periodically published ''{{lang|cs|Sbírka zákonů}}'', abbreviated ''Sb.'' (“Collection of Law”, “Coll.”), and ''{{lang|cs|Sbírka mezinárodních smluv}}'', abbreviated ''Sb. m. s.'' (“Collection of International Treaties”).

The system of law and justice in the Czech Republic has been in constant development since the [[Velvet Revolution|1989 regime change]]. In 1993, the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] has been enacted, which postulates the [[Rechtsstaat|rule of law]], outlines the [[Politics of the Czech Republic|structure and principles of democratic government]], and declares human rights and rights of the citizen. Since 2004, the membership in the EU means the priority of  [[European Union law]] over Czech law in some areas. Recently, a brand new Criminal Code entered into force in 2010, and the Civil Code followed in 2014.

== Sources of law ==

Sources of Czech law are (in this hierarchical order):&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;

* the Constitution (''{{lang|cs|Ústava}}'') and constitutional acts (''{{lang|cs|ústavní zákony}}'')
* international treaties ratified by the Parliament (''{{lang|cs|mezinárodní smlouvy ratifikované parlamentem}}'')
* statutes adopted by the Parliament (''{{lang|cs|zákony přijaté parlamentem}}''), published decisions of the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]]
* derived legislation: government orders&lt;ref&gt;also translated as government decrees&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|nařízení vlády}}'') and notifications of ministries&lt;ref&gt;sometimes orders of ministries&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|vyhlášky ministerstev}}''); legislative acts of territorial self-government bodies: regional ordinances&lt;ref&gt;or [[by-law|byelaws]], if you prefer&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{lang|cs|krajské vyhlášky}}'') and municipal ordinances (''{{lang|cs|obecní vyhlášky}}'')

Acts of parliament and other legal regulations enter into force on the day they are [[Promulgation|promulgated]] (published) in the official ''Collection of Law'' (''{{lang|cs|Sbírka zákonů}}'', abbreviated as ''{{lang|cs|Sb.}}'' – ''Coll.'' – when referring to statutes), although they may take effect at a later date. International treaties are similarly published in the ''Collection of International Treaties'' (''{{lang|cs|Sbírka mezinárodních smluv}}'', abbreviated ''Sb. m. s.'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://aplikace.mvcr.cz/sbirka-zakonu/ Official online version of Collection of Law and Collection of International Treaties]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sbírka zákonů 1993 částka 001 strana 01.png|thumb|The Constitution of the Czech Republic as published in the Collection of Laws]]

=== Constitutional law ===

Czech [[constitution]] is written, and it consists of several [[Constitutional act of the Czech Republic|constitutional acts]] (one of them [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|the Constitution of the Czech Republic]]), together they are known as the [[constitutional order of the Czech Republic]] (''{{lang|cs|ústavní pořádek}}'').

The constitution can be viewed as [[Entrenched clause|entrenched]], because constitutional statutes are more difficult to adopt, amend, supplement or repeal them than ordinary laws of the country. A special majority (constitutional supermajority) is required of three-fifths of all Deputies and a qualified majority of three-fifths of all Senators present.&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="concourt1"&gt;Czech Republic. Constitutional Court. [http://www.concourt.cz/clanek/2092 "Constitutional Order of the Czech Republic. "] ''The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic. '' Ústavní soud ČR, n.d. Web. 03 Jan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is to promote continuity and stability of the political system.

Most important constitutional acts are:

* Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll. the Constitution of the Czech Republic&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=40450&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=1~2F1993&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 1/1993 Sb. Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Resolution No. 2/1993 Coll. [...] incorporating Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms [...]&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=40453&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=2~2F1993&amp;rpp=15#local-content Usnesení č. 2/1993 Sb. Předsednictva České národní rady o vyhlášení LISTINY ZÁKLADNÍCH PRÁV A SVOBOD jako součásti ústavního pořádku České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In full: Resolution no. 2/1993 Coll. of the Presidium of the Czech National Council of 16 December 1992 on the declaration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms as a part of the constitutional order of the Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt;
* Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Coll. on the Security of the Czech Republic&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=46612&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=110~2F1998&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 110/1998 Sb. o bezpečnosti České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Constitutional Act No. 347/1997 Coll. on the Creation of Higher Territorial Self-Governing Units&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=45807&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=347~2F1997&amp;rpp=15#local-content Zákon č. 347/1997 Sb. o vytvoření vyšších územních samosprávných celků a o změně ústavního zákona České národní rady č. 1/1993 Sb., Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] declares sovereignty (self-government) of the people and the values of freedom and democracy. It defines the separation of the three powers in a system of [[Separation of powers|Checks and balances]]. It gives the legislative power to the popularly elected [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Parliament]] consisting of two chambers, the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]]. The executive power is divided between the [[President of the Czech Republic|President]] and the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]]. It describes the functioning of the [[Judiciary of the Czech Republic|judiciary]], especially the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]]. Two more institutions are established, the [[Czech National Bank]] and the [[Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic|Supreme Audit Office]].

The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms]] (''{{lang|cs|Listina základních práv a svobod}}'') is a [[bill of rights]] document enacted in 1991 by the [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic|Czechoslovak Federative Republic]]. In the Czech Republic it was kept in its entirety and forms a part of the constitutional order (i.e. has the same legal force as the Constitution). It postulates the sanctity of natural human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as citizens' (political) rights, the equality before the law, rights of minorities and so on.

The Constitution has been seriously modified in February 2012, introducing a controversial popular vote of the [[President of the Czech Republic]]:&lt;ref name="concourt1" /&gt;

* Constitutional Act No. 71/2012 Coll.&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=77110&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=71~2F2012&amp;rpp=15#local-content Ústavní zákon č. 71/2012 Sb., kterým se mění ústavní zákon č. 1/1993 Sb., Ústava České republiky, ve znění pozdějších ústavních zákonů]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;which amends the Constitutional Act No. 1/1993 Coll., the Constitution of the Czech Republic as amended by subsequent constitutional acts&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International treaties ===

On joining the [[European Union]], the Czech Republic committed itself to respect the principle of the supremacy of [[Community acquis|European law]] over Czech law in defined areas.&lt;ref&gt;Czech Republic. Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "[http://www.czech.cz/en/Life-Work/How-things-work-here/Law/The-system-of-independent-courts The System of Independent Courts]. " ''[http://www.czech.cz Hello Czech Republic (Czech Republic - The Official Website)]''. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 01 Jan. 2010. Web. 07 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important treaty in this category is the [[Council of Europe]]’s [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]].&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt;

=== Statutes adopted by the Parliament ===

Major areas of Czech law are codified in a systematic manner.

==== Criminal law ====

Most important statutes in the criminal justice field are:

* Act No. 40/2009 Coll., the Criminal Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=68040&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=40~2F2009&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 40/2009 Sb trestní zákoník]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 141/1961 Coll., the Criminal Procedure Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=30139&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=141~2F1961&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 141/1961 Sb. o trestním řízení soudním (trestní řád)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;sometimes rendered as Code of Criminal Justice&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 218/2003 Coll., on Juvenile Criminal Justice&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=55745&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=218~2F2003&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 218/2003 Sb. o odpovědnosti mládeže za protiprávní činy a o soudnictví ve věcech mládeže a o změně některých zákonů (zákon o soudnictví ve věcech mládeže)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Czech [[criminal law]] is regulated mainly, though not only, by the Criminal Code Act 2009 (''{{lang|cs|trestní zákoník}}''), which codifies substantive criminal law. The comprehensive regulatory statute for criminal procedure is the Criminal Proceedings Code Act 1961 (''{{lang|cs|trestní řád}}''). The two codes are complemented by the Juvenile Criminal Justice Act 2003, which deals with alleged offenders aged between 15 (the threshold of criminal liability as well as [[Age of consent|age of legal consent]]) and 17.

Until 2009, the criminal code statute in force dated back to 1961. In spite of numerous amendments made since the 1989, it still conformed to the communist ideology, oriented on punishment of perceived enemies of the socialist regime. As a part of an effort to comprehensively reform law and justice, a brand new codification has been written. The Ministry of Justice announced it as an "elaborate piece of work boiled down from the experience and knowledge of foremost expert on criminal law", which can be proudly compared to modern criminal codes of other democratic countries.&lt;ref name="moj"&gt;Czech Republic. Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR. [http://reforma.justice.cz/cz/trestni-zakonik/obecne-o-trestnim-zakoniku.html "Obecně o trestním zákoníku. "] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130217044737/http://reforma.justice.cz/cz/trestni-zakonik/obecne-o-trestnim-zakoniku.html |date=2013-02-17 }} ''Reforma justice. '' Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR, n.d. Web. 12 Dec. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the 2009 codification was to bring the criminal justice system in line with the rest of Europe. The main change introduced by the code was transition from material to formal conception of criminal offence. Another thing the lawyers drafting the 2009 code had in mind, and expressed it in the area of sentencing tariffs, was a new balance of punishment against rehabilitation effect on the criminal. On one hand we see the sentences for felony (''{{lang|cs|zločin}}'') which carry a sentence of at least 5 years. On the other a newly created category of misdemeanour (''{{lang|cs|přečin}}'') introduces a host of community sentences (''{{lang|cs|alternativní tresty}}''), including community payback (''{{lang|cs|veřejně prospěšné práce}}'') or house arrest (''{{lang|cs|domácí vězení}}''). The code also outlaws doping.&lt;ref name="moj" /&gt;

Less serious breaches of law are called [[contravention]]s (''{{lang|cs|přestupek}}'').&lt;ref&gt;The word ''přestupek'' (pl. ''přestupky'') can be found translated variously, even in official translations, as ''infraction'', ''administrative infraction'', ''administrative offence'', ''offence'' (!), ''offence'', ''transgression'', ''misdemeanour'', or ''violation''.&lt;/ref&gt; These are not normally dealt with by the courts of law, but rather punished either by the police on the spot, or through a procedure in front of a committee at the local or municipal authority, or sometimes other administration body. The result is not a conviction, and so such a punishment will not blemish the culprit's criminal record. Like with other administrative acts, the outcome of this procedure can be challenged through the administrative justice process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novotný|first=Václav|title=Administrative Justice in Europe – Report for the Czech Republic|date=n.d.|publisher=Association of Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions|url=http://www.juradmin.eu/en/eurtour/i/countries/czech/czech_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical example of contraventions in Czech law this are driving offences. (In the common law world, acts falling into this category would be classed as [[summary offence]]s.)
* Act No. 200/1990 on Contraventions&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=38544&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=&amp;part=&amp;name=p~C5~99estupky&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 200/1990 Sb. o přestupcích]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, Czech law also recognizes [[Corporate liability|criminal liability of corporations]] for offences committed by employees of a corporation, when acting on its behalf, being instructed by the board of directors or other representative of the company, or through lack of their action. In such cases, not only individuals will be prosecuted, but the corporation can be prosecuted as well for the same offence and punished by a host of measures, starting from cetrain injunctions, through fines a forfeitures, to liquidation of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trubač|first=Ondeřej|title=Trestní odpovědnost právnické osoby|url=http://finance.idnes.cz/trestni-odpovednost-pravnickych-osob-dhf-/pravo.aspx?c=A120305_210154_pravo_vr|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=iDNES.cz|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skalická|first=Hana|title=Corporate Criminal Liability in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.terralex.org/publication/p58cf9663e3/corporate-criminal-liability-in-the-czech-republic|work=Newsletter - TerraLex Practice Groups|publisher=TerraLex|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Act No. 418/2011 Coll., on Criminal Liability of Legal Persons and the Proceedings against Them&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=75794&amp;fulltext=&amp;nr=418~2F2011&amp;part=&amp;name=&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 418/2011 Sb. o trestní odpovědnosti právnických osob a řízení proti nim]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civil law ====

Main statutes regulating this area are:

* Act No. 89/2012 Coll. the Civil Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://www.psp.cz/sqw/sbirka.sqw?r=2012&amp;cz=89 Zákon č. 89/2012 Sb. občanský zákoník]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Act No. 99/1963 Coll. the Civil Procedure Code&lt;ref group=cs&gt;[http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/zakonPar.jsp?idBiblio=30398&amp;src=dulezite&amp;rpp=50#local-content Zákon č. 99/1963 Sb. občanský soudní řád]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;sometimes rendered Code of Civil Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Code codifies core areas of [[private law]]. It has five parts. The first part is dedicated to a legal status of a person as an individual. The second regulates family law – e.g. the institute of marriage and the rights and obligations of husband and wife, parents and children.&lt;ref name="novyoz" /&gt; Although the Code does include [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the Czech Republic|registered partnership]], it explicitly prohibits adoption to a person in a registered partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obcanskyzakonik.justice.cz/tinymce-storage/files/sb0033-2012.pdf "Zákon 89/2012 občanský zákoník. "] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709040352/http://obcanskyzakonik.justice.cz/tinymce-storage/files/sb0033-2012.pdf |date=2012-07-09 }} ''Sbírka zákonů. '' 03 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest in concerned mainly with property rights.&lt;ref name="novyoz" /&gt;

The civil code regulation effective since 1 January 2014 is a result of eleven years of work of the recodification committee of the [[Ministry of Justice (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Justice]]. Together with the Commercial Corporations Act and the Private International Law Act it constitutes a complete recodification of private law in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="novyoz"&gt;Czech Republic. Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR. [http://obcanskyzakonik.justice.cz/cz/uvodni-stranka.html "Úvodní stránka.

=== Case law ===

Theoretically, case law is not defined as a source of law in the Czech Republic. Despite that, the decisions of courts, namely supreme courts and the Constitutional Court, have a significant influence over the Czech legal system since 1989.&lt;ref name="bobek" /&gt; Findings of the Constitutional Court are considered a source of law, and are binding for general courts.&lt;ref&gt;"Enforceable rulings of the Constitutional Court shall be binding for all agencies and individuals. " – Constitution, Art. 89&lt;/ref&gt; If a lower court is to rule against "consistent adjudications" of the Supreme Court on the point of law, it must give detailed reasoning, and this can often be a reason for a successful appeal. This system is largely based on judiciary's own interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that it gives citizens predictability and fairness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fetter|first=Richard W.|title=Musejí nižší soudy poslouchat Nejvyšší soud?|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/paragrafy/zpravy/museji-nizsi-soudy-poslouchat-nejvyssi-soud/453253|accessdate=7 January 2013|newspaper=České noviny|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant judgements of both courts are published in the official Collection of Laws.&lt;ref name="concourt2"&gt;Czech Republic.

== History ==
[[File:Theresiana-Titel.jpg|thumb|[[Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana]], 1768]]
In [[Czech lands]], the process of formation of modern legislation dates back to the era of [[enlightened absolutism]], when they were a core part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. Reforms of government were to a large extent the work of empress [[Maria Theresa]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], who participated in creating the first [[civil code]] of the country in 1787, called [[Josephinisches Gesetzbuch]]. This was a forbearer to the comprehensive codification of civil law in 1811, known as the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] (ABGB). ABGB was [[Reception statute|received]] in 1918 by Czechoslovakia, among other successor states, but only for Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia), while Slovakia kept the customary law of Hungary. Albeit updated many times, this Austrian law was kept in Czechoslovakia, along with the legal duality, until 1950, when the "Middle Civil Code" was promulgated, soon to be superseded by the civil code of 1964, which will be in force until the "New Civil Code", enacted in 2009, will enter in force in 2014.

Following in the tracks of their enlightenment predecessors, the [[Constitutio criminalis Josephina]] of 1707 and the [[Constitutio criminalis Theresiana]] of 1768, the most important Czechoslovakian [[criminal code]]s were enacted in 1950, 1961 and 2009.

The history of Czechoslovak constitutionality starts with the formation of independent [[Czechoslovakia]] out of the ruins of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1918, the [[Interim Constitution of Czechoslovakia]] has been enacted hastily, establishing the republic with its president and temporary parliament. The [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920]] succeeded it, inspired by western democratic constitutions, and, controversially, postulating the [[Czechoslovakism|Czechoslovak nation]]. This lasted over the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|First Republic]] and the second world war. In 1948, the so-called [[Ninth-of-May Constitution]] was enacted after the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|communist coup]] – preserving some democratic institutions (human rights, partial division of the three powers, independent judiciary), though the political reality of the country departed from it radically. The [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia]], influenced by soviet constitutions, is often dubbed the "Socialist Constitution". It changed the name of the country to [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovak ''Socialist'' Republic]] and defined socialist, rather than democratic, character of the state, and introduced the leading role of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]]. The 1960 constitution remained in force until 1992, although in 1968 it was substantially modified by the [[Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation]] – this transformed the unitary state into a federation of the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] and the [[Slovak Socialist Republic]]. Further radical modifications were enacted after the [[Velvet Revolution|regime change of 1989]], but they turned out to be short-lived, as in 1992 the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] has been promulgated after the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|division of Czechoslovakia]], and entered into force in 1993.

'''Legal cultures''' are described as being temporary outcomes of interactions and occur pursuant to a challenge and response [[paradigm]]. Analyses of core legal paradigms shape the characteristics of individual and distinctive legal cultures.
“Comparative legal cultures are examined by a field of scholarship, which is situated at the line bordering [[comparative law]] and historical [[jurisprudence]].” &lt;ref&gt;Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) p. xix.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal cultures can be examined by reference to fundamentally different legal systems. However, such cultures can also be differentiated between systems with a shared history and basis which are now otherwise influenced by factors that encourage cultural change. Students learn about legal culture in order to better understand how the law works in society. This can be seen as the study of Law and Society. These studies are available at schools such as Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.

== Western legal culture vs non-Western legal culture ==
[[Western legal culture]] is unified in the systematic reliance on legal constructs. Such constructs include [[corporations]], [[contracts]], [[Estate (law)|estates]], rights and powers. These concepts are not only nonexistent in primitive or traditional legal systems but they can also be predominately incapable of expression in those language systems which form the basis of such legal cultures.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"&gt;J.C. Smith (1968) ‘The Unique Nature of the Concepts of Western Law’ The Canadian Bar Review (46: 2 pp. 191-225) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general proposition, the concept of legal culture depends on [[language]] and [[symbols]] and any attempt to analyze non-western legal systems in terms of categories of modern western law can result in distortion attributable to differences in language.&lt;ref name="J.C. Smith 1968 pp. 191-225"/&gt;  So while legal constructs are unique to classical Roman, modern civil and common law cultures, legal concepts or primitive and archaic law get their meaning from sensed experience based on facts as opposed to theory or abstract. Legal culture therefore in the former group is influenced by academics, learned members of the profession and historically, philosophers. The latter group’s culture is harnessed by beliefs, values and religion at a foundational level.

Traditional law in Africa is based on natural justice and lacks abstract concepts. This is characteristic of cultures that have an absence of written language which is necessary to elaborate concepts into theory.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"&gt;Max Gluckman (1964) ‘Natural Justice in Africa’ Natural Law Forum vol: 9 (pp. 25-44) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England).&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrines of traditional [[African law]] are based on social considerations whereby parties to disputes seek not declarations of right or wrong but rather they seek restitution of social relationships.&lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The trier of fact and law adjudicates between closely related people from communities as opposed to strangers in commerce. Judgments stress the importance of living together in generous, loving kindness, mutual helpfulness and reciprocity. Evidence suggests that ‘African law demonstrates that all men, because they live in society, have some theory of rules of justice which they believe arise from reason itself; [and Gluckman’s evidence] suggests that Africans may well have formulated, in embryonic form at least, a theory of natural justice coming from human kindness itself.’ &lt;ref name="Max Gluckman 1964 pp. 25-44"/&gt;

The [[Sharia|Islamic legal system]] exemplifies law as part of a larger culture where the concepts of knowledge, right and human nature play a central role. A case study by [[Lawrence Rosen (anthropologist)|Lawrence Rosen]] explains the anthropological, procedural and [[judicial discretion]] aspects of bringing a case to court in [[Sefrou]], [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"&gt;Lawrence Rosen (1989) The Anthropology of Justice: Law as Culture in Islamic Society (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge).&lt;/ref&gt;  The case study makes explicit those fundamentals in Islamic society that shape Islamic legal culture and differentiate this from western legal cultures.

Rigid procedural rules and strict court room decorum or etiquette which is entrenched in western legal cultures clears the way for a more natural process of dispute resolution.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  In Morocco, close attention is paid to social origins, connections and identity where these concepts influence a [[qadi]]’s (judge) judicial interrogation and discretion.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

While the systems of law found in the western world consist of conceptualisation and implementation that mimic the extrajudicial world only slightly, in the Islamic courts of Morocco, the culture of law being propounded reflects the overall culture of its people.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;  This is attributable to the goals of law in Islamic society, which is not to hold state or religious power as supreme or to develop an exacting body of legal doctrine, but to restore relationships and then facilitate the resolution of disputes independently of rigid [[precedent]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence Rosen 1989"/&gt;

== Western comparisons ==
The traditional focus between [[common law]] culture and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] culture has been highlighted by court room procedure, whereby the former nurtures an [[adversarial]] environment and the latter an [[inquisitorial]] one. Indeed no system of court procedure can ever be purely adversarial or purely inquisitorial.

In fact [[France]], which subscribes to a civil legal system, historically gave the [[judge]] a passive role and left the parties to engage in an accusatorial manner.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Jolowicz ‘Civil Procedure and the Common and Civil Law’ (pp. 55-78) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless the common law culture predominately consists of oral arguments where legal representors steer the case in search of [[justice]] and reinforcement of rights.

The use of a [[Jury]] in the common law as a judge of fact is unique when compared to civil law systems. The Jury are triers of fact in both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] cases and this reflects a particular culture of law; namely the direct involvement of society in the [[legal framework]]. In France a judge’s role as trier of law and fact is merely as an administrator without creating binding [[legal principle]]. Hence the civil law culture is more rational, orderly, authoritative and [[paternalistic]].

Common law has a culture of judicial inventiveness and even flexibility. Enunciation of principle is not forever paramount but indeed a continuing flow of cases and statutes add to the ebb and flow of the law, whereby ‘case law represented the modern man’s realisation of his own limitations.’ &lt;ref&gt;A. G. Chloros (1978) ‘Common Law, Civil Law and Socialist Law: Three Leading Systems of the World, Three Kinds of Legal Thought’ The Cambridge Law Review (pp. 11-26) in Csaba Varga (ed) (1992) Comparative Legal Cultures (Dartmouth: England) at 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Further differences include where a civilian [[lawyer]] speaks in terms of the law of nature while the common lawyer speaks to reason. It follows that the culture of these legal systems has been moulded by perceptions of justice and the means available to attain it.

== Common law comparisons ==
Legal culture can differ between countries despite their conformity to a similar if not identical legal system. Both the [[United States]] and [[England]] possess common law systems of law and yet each country embodies a distinctive legal culture. This has been attributable by contrasting both the institutions within the legal system and characteristics of the profession ([[judge]]s, [[barristers]] and [[solicitors]]).&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard A. Posner|Posner]]&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; during 1996 there was about 15 times more American judges than English judges but only about 10 times more American lawyers than English lawyers. Posner suggests that English judges have more prestige than American judges and a related point is that the ratio of judges to lawyers is lower in England than the United States.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt; The consequence of this is that the English common law system, as opposed to the American legal system, displays a legal culture of greater prestige and [[elitism]] not only in the judiciary but also those who are candidates for the [[judiciary]].

In England, and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, barristers are apt candidates for judicial nomination. The reasons for this stem from the common law systems which have a culture to encourage, harness and capture high quality intellect and experience within a concentrated portion of non-judicial officers of the legal profession known as barristers (which includes and accounts for their subsequent appointments to higher ranking [[queens counsel]] and [[senior counsel]]).

Barristers are engaged upon a solicitor's [[Brief (law)|brief]] instead of direct engagement with the client. This insulation avoids lay persons being taken advantage of by unscrupulous lawyers which is evidently "a big problem in the United States, where incompetent lawyers, and known to be such both by judges and by other lawyers, often wow naïve clients." &lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner (1996) ''Law and Legal Theory in England and America'' (Clarendon Press: Oxford) at 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of pursuing [[litigation]] influences the culture of each legal system in terms of what society perceives as the net benefit gained from the court and the profession. To litigate similar cases in England and the United States would cost approximately the same; however English courts are not as generous as their American counterparts in awarding [[damages]], especially [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  Therefore the net expected benefit of litigation being greater in the United States encourages a legal culture that is more litigious in nature than England.

National character is inherent in the legal institutions of the [[courts]] and [[parliament]], their formation and their output in terms of [[legislation]] or [[judgments]]. For example it has been said that many factors have contributed to the litigiousness of the United States, including: the rights afforded to the people, a written [[constitution]], immigrant origins of its population, racial and ethnic heterogeneity and the wealth and spoils of its population.&lt;ref name="Richard A. Posner 1996"/&gt;  To this end [[national character]] and [[history]] influence current legal culture.

== Chinese legal culture ==
The legal culture of [[China]], as well as its social and economic culture, continues to undergo dramatic change since the [[People’s Republic of China]]'s reforms of 1978. Transformation has occurred by legal modernisation whereby a rule of law has been suggested to replace the rule of man. The latter is a characteristic of the traditional rural Chinese society where unwritten rules, personal relationships and trust govern citizens' legal relationships; analogous to [[gemeinschaft]]. In the modern society of China, institutional, customary and legal reform (a rule of law that embodies universal rules uniformly enforced by a centralised and bureaucratic state) is necessary to govern legal relations; analogous to [[gesellschaft]].

Direct [[legal transplant|transplants]] of [[western legal systems]] or culture may not provide an adequate rule of law where the life of ordinary Chinese may be marginalised in favour of legal elite who use legal instruments for self-promotion. Furthermore, implanting western legal norms disregards the local culture and relations; thus potentially destroying significant cultural bonds and relationships in the rural community. The traditional [[rural Chinese]] legal culture which is premised on personal and informal relations faces erosion unless [[legal pluralism]] is promoted.

A top down approach in analysing the legal culture of China suggests that both under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Jiang Zemin]], China is "a country under rule by law, not rule of law."&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart).&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence comes from post Mao-China, where law is seen as necessary for institutionalising and generalising ad hoc policies for [[economic reform]] and as maintaining party leadership.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;

Further problems with the Chinese legal culture include a piecemeal approach to law making with an imbalance between [[law and policy]]; denials of private law; neglect towards [[human rights]] and individual liberties; and poor enforcement of laws.&lt;ref name="Klaus A. Ziegert 2004"/&gt;  According to Chen, the consensus in China among scholars is that the lack of [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]] are interdependent concepts whereby "the rule of law is legitimate only if it is the product of democratic government." &lt;ref&gt;Jianfu Chen "To Have the Cake and Eat it too? China and the Rule of Law" (pp. 250-272) in Guenther Doeker-Mach and Klaus A. Ziegert (Eds.) (2004) ''Law, Legal Culture and Politics in the Twenty First Century'' (Franz Steiner Verlag: Stuttgart) at 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is evident with the China experience is that legal culture is susceptible to change in pursuance to [[socio-economic]] and [[political]] forces. While such a change could be beneficial for portions of the society and [[international relations]], traditional and established cultural methods face extinction.

'''Legal death''' is the recognition under the law of a particular jurisdiction that a person is no longer alive. In most cases, a doctor's declaration of death (variously called) or the identification of a [[corpse]] is a legal requirement for such recognition. A person who has been [[Missing person|missing]] for a sufficiently long period of time (typically at least several years) may be presumed or [[Declared death in absentia|declared legally dead]], usually by a court. When a death has been registered in a [[civil registry]], a [[death certificate]] may be issued. Such death certificate may be required in a number of legal situations, such as applying for [[probate]], claiming some benefits or making an insurance claim, etc.

==Medical declaration==
&lt;!--{{Main|Medical definition of death}}--&gt;
Most legal determinations of death in the developed world are made by medical professionals who pronounce death when specific criteria are met. Two categories of legal death are death determined by irreversible cessation of heartbeat and breathing (cardiopulmonary death), and death determined by irreversible cessation of functions of the brain  ([[brain death]]).  In the [[United States]], each state has laws for determining these two categories of death that are modeled after the [[Uniform Determination of Death Act]].

Cardiopulmonary criteria for death are met when a physician determines that efforts to restart  a stopped heart during [[cardiac arrest]] are futile, or that no attempt should be made to restart a stopped heart, such as when there is a [[Do not resuscitate|Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)]] order. In the latter case, irreversible is understood to mean that heartbeat and breathing cannot return on their own and will not be restored by medical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Controversies in the Determination of Death: A White Paper by the President's Council on Bioethics | publisher = bioethics.gov| year = 2008| pages = 84| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=2eVHEwTR5T8C&amp;pg=PA84| quote =For this reason, many have argued that the word "irreversible" in this context should be understood to mean "cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions under conditions in which those functions cannot return on their own and ''will not'' be restored by medical interventions."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brain death]] determinations are made in cases where breathing is [[mechanical ventilation|supported by machines]]. Brain death is determined by there being no signs of brain function during neurological examination of a person with a beating heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van der Lugt A |title=Imaging tests in determination of brain death |journal=Neuroradiology |volume=52 | issue=11 |pages=945–947  |date=November 2010 | doi=10.1007/s00234-010-0765-7 |pmid=20820765 |pmc=2952109 |quote=There is uniform agreement on the clinical neurological examination to evaluate absence of brain function. This examination includes the assessment of coma, the absence of brain reflexes, and the assessment of apnea.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confirmatory tests document either no [[cerebral blood flow|blood flow to the brain]], or no [[electroencephalography|brain electrical activity]] in absence of factors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Trauma: Critical Care| last1 = Wilson| first1 = William  C.|last2 = Grande| first2 = Christopher M.|last3 = Hoyt| first3 = David B.| edition = 1st | publisher = CRC Press| year = 2007| isbn = 978-0824729202| page = 133 | quote =  However, barbiturate coma, metabolic dysfunction (e.g. hepatic encephalopathy), severe  hypothermia (temperature &lt; 18°C), and other confounding factors may also produce cerebral  electric silence on EEG.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  known to produce reversible loss of brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van der Lugt A |title=Imaging tests in determination of brain death |journal=Neuroradiology |volume=52 | issue=11 |pages=945–947  |date=November 2010 | doi=10.1007/s00234-010-0765-7 |pmid=20820765 |pmc=2952109 |quote=Confirmatory tests can be classified into two categories: confirmation of loss of electrical activity (electroencephalography or somatosensory-evoked potentials) and demonstration of loss of cerebral blood flow (cerebral angiography, transcranial doppler ultrasonography, or cerebral scintigraphy).}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike cardiopulmonary death which sometimes involves a decision not to resuscitate the heart, brain death is a determination that the brain biologically cannot be resuscitated.

If a [[clinical death|clinically dead]] person has suffered injuries so severe that resuscitation is obviously impossible, then in some jurisdictions [[first responder]]s may make a legal determination of cardiopulmonary death. Such a person is said to be [[dead on arrival|dead on arrival (DOA)]] or ''dead at the scene''.

==Presumption of death==
{{main|Declared death in absentia}}
In some cases, a person will be declared dead even without any remains or doctor's declaration. This is under one of two circumstances. First, if a person was known to be in mortal peril when last seen, they can often be declared dead shortly after. Examples would be the passengers of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] that were not rescued after the ship sank. Second, if a person has not been seen for a certain period of time and there has been no evidence that they are alive. The amount of time that has passed varies by jurisdiction, from as little as four years in the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|US state of Georgia]] to twenty years in [[Italy]].

==False declarations of death==
There are three general categories where people may be falsely declared dead: by mistake, because of fraud, or as punishment for a crime.

===Mistaken presumption of death===
Sometimes people who are declared dead return and are unable to be declared alive. One study estimated that every year, the U.S. Social Security Administration declares 12,200 alive citizens as dead.&lt;ref&gt;https://priceonomics.com/what-its-like-to-be-declared-dead-by-the/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notable examples====

*Donald E. Miller Jr., an [[Ohio]] man declared legally dead in 1994. He resurfaced in 2013 and sued to be declared alive, but the court declined and ruled he was still legally dead.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/12/us/declared-legally-dead-as-he-sat-before-the-judge.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraudulent death===
In some cases, a legal declaration of death is fraudulent. Several people have [[Faked death|faked their own deaths]] for various reasons. The most common reasons for this are to [[life insurance fraud|collect insurance money]], to [[fugitive|avoid capture by police]] or to avoid paying debts.

At times, people declare other people dead for some benefit to themselves. For example, Constantin Reliu, a [[Romania]]n man living in Turkey was declared dead by his wife so that she could remarry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/romania-courts-constantin-reliu-vaslui-turkey-deported-death-certificate-legal-system-latest-a8262196.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/16/594431754/man-claims-hes-not-dead-court-doesn-t-buy-it&lt;/ref&gt; In India, several people have been fraudulently declared dead by family members wishing to steal land and other property. The best known is [[Lal Bihari]], who was fraudulently declared dead by family members, and was legally dead between 1975 and 1994. Bihari founded the [[Uttar Pradesh Association of Dead People|Association of Dead People]] to help others in similar situations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/24/world/azamgarh-journal-back-to-life-in-india-without-reincarnation.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being victims of fraud, it often takes many years to reverse a fraudulent death declaration, and at times it never happens. Bihari didn't get his declaration of death reversed until 1994, 19 years later,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and Reliu lost a court battle to be declared alive in 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===As punishment===
Historically, those who have committed crimes or other wrongs against the state have been declared legally dead despite being obviously alive. This is known as [[civil death]]. Such a person loses all rights normally granted a person. In jurisdictions that practiced civil death, it was legal to murder such a person, since they were not actually alive accordingly to the law, and therefore not actually killed.

==Investigation==
Determining manner of death often has important legal implications. Governments elect a [[coroner]] or appoint a [[medical examiner]], depending on jurisdiction, to both determine manner and cause of death, and if necessary, identify bodies when their identities are unknown. Manner of death is usually classified as [[natural death|natural]], [[accidental death|accidental]], [[homicide]], [[suicide]], pending or undetermined. A soldier is often listed as [[killed in action]] if the death was during military service. There are legal implications to all of the classifications.

==Estate==
{{main|Probate}}
In nearly all jurisdictions, dead people do not have the right to own property. When a person dies, their property needs to be distributed to others in a process called [[probate]]. People can specify their wishes before they die by preparing a [[will and testament]]. If there is no will, the laws of their country determine how the property is distributed. In most cases, it would go to [[next of kin]], such as a [[spouse]] or adult child. If the person who died is wealthy, often a portion of their property will be collected by an [[estate tax]].

The '''legal humanists''' were a group of scholars of [[Roman law]], which arose in Italy during the Renaissance with the works of [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Andrea Alciato]] as a reaction against the [[Postglossator|Commentators]].  In the 16th century, the movement  reached [[France]] (Bourges, where Alciato taught), where it became very influential. They had a general disdain for the [[Middle Ages]] and felt nothing good could come from then. They also had a great love of antiquarianism and were greatly concerned with the authority and accuracy of the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]. Thus, they described the work of the glossators and commentators as a malignant cancer on the text. They particularly disliked the commentators because in their attempt to apply law in practice, they had moved further and further away from the texts.

==Overview==

This was the time of the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, where people sought a new birth of society. They believed this would come through a return to the eternal principles underlying classical society. The religious reformers sought a return to the pure Word. In law, the humanists were a parallel movement, seeking a return to classical [[Roman law]]. This involved purifying the texts. The humanists had great confidence in the mind and so originally this was done through a conjectural knowledge of antiquity. However, [[Jacques Cujas|Cujaccius]] recognized the importance of studying the best and most original text, and thus used the Florentine manuscript. This enabled a better study of the interpolations of the text. However, as more and more interpolations were revealed, the quasi-[[bible|Biblical]] status of the texts was undermined, which undermined the work of the humanists.

Since the humanists were primarily concerned with a return to classical society, they were not solely interested in the law, but instead in the historical context. Some humanists placed little emphasis on the law except in respect to what it revealed about the Roman society, for example, Alicus. Pure law was thus given a monumental status. However, this resulted in a move away from practical application of the text. It was recognized that Roman law was the product of Roman society. This undermined the humanist movement as at the same time as arguing that [[Roman law]] was perfect for today’s society, they revealed it was a product of Roman society. The logical conclusion of this was that French law should be a product of French society. The humanists, for example, [[Hugues Doneau|Donellus]], presumed that [[Roman law]] was rational and so tried to find an underlying rational structure. They distinguished sharply between questions of procedure (the means of obtaining an answer) and questions of substantive law (what is due).

==Impact==

The humanists had little impact on the immediate practice of law. Court advocates and notaries remained faithful to the commentaries because the work of the commentators had been better circulated. Since they already knew the works of the commentators, they had a vested interest in ensuring that they remained the basis of the court system. Consequently, there were fierce rebuttals, such as that of [[Scipione Gentili]]. Humanism was largely irrelevant since it was based around the discovery of pure Roman law, and pure Roman law was only appropriate for Roman society.

In the long term, however, humanism did significantly influence legal science. The principle of using the best available text was established and the quasi-biblical authority of the texts was undermined, resulting in the rise of legal science. The systematisation of the texts was both aided and encouraged, giving rise to the Pandectist school. The logical skills of the humanists in their search for interpolations meant that lawyers had skills that were useful for society as a whole. They were thus the natural mediator in Italy when there was no emperor (and they had Imperial authority), they created a comprehensive system of law. When in French the church and crown were opposed, the humanists were able to help the king gain control with their use of logic.

A disputed impact of the humanists was on the law of contract. The Gordley thesis does not consider their work at all, and opponents to this thesis have argued that they were crucial to the development of modern [[contract law]].  The humanists and commentators had reached the point where they acknowledged a large number of ways that agreement could be “clothed” in order to give rise to legal action, however, they still maintained that these were exceptions to the general rule that an agreement could not give rise to an action on its own. However, it was only a small step from this to the recognition that generally an agreement would give an action, but there were a few exceptions. That the transition was not made by the commentators is thought to be because of their adherence to the texts. This was undermined by the humanists. Thus, we might expect that the humanists would have brought the change that Gordley credits to the Spanish NeoScholastics. However, there is no evidence that this took place, perhaps because the humanists despised the work of the commentators to such an extent that they were unwilling to effectively build on the foundations laid down by the commentators in this area.

Most of the humanists were Protestants and so died or fled after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of Protestants in 1573. However, the direct link that Donellus fled to [[Leiden]] (via [[Germany]]) and started the Dutch Elegant School, has been questioned by Osler, who points out that the French Humanist school continued after the massacre and that the Dutch Elegant School did not really take off until Noodt at the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Osler |first=Douglas J. |title=Legal Humanism |publisher= [[Max-Planck Institute]] |url=http://www.rg.mpg.de/research/legal-humanism/ |accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recommendation algorithm and the "Netflix Prize" ==
{{Main|Netflix Prize}}
In 2006, Netflix held the first Netflix Prize competition to find a better program to predict user preferences and beat its existing Netflix movie recommendation system, known as Cinematch, by at least 10%. CEO Hastings did not necessarily expect a lot of quick progress towards the prize,&lt;ref name=PCOLInnovation /&gt; "We thought we built the best darn thing ever."&lt;ref name=PCOLInnovation&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/business/31leonhardt.html|title=You Want Innovation? Offer a Prize|date=January 31, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by June 2007, Hastings said the competition is "three-quarters of the way there in three-quarters of a year."&lt;ref name=PCOLNewyorktimes2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/technology/04netflix.html|title=Netflix Prize Still Awaits a Movie Seer|date=June 4, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three teams – an [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] Research Team called BellKor, commendo's team BigChaos, and Pragmatic Theory – combined to win the 2009 grand prize competition for $1 million. The winning team, called BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos, used [[machine learning]] techniques to find that, for example, the rating system people use for older movies is very different from that used for a movie they just saw. The mood of the day made a difference also; for example, Friday ratings were different from Monday morning ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/ |title=BelKor Home Page |publisher=AT&amp;T Labs, Inc. – Research |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Netflix canceled a running contest to improve the company's recommendation algorithm due to privacy concerns: under the terms of the competition, contestants were given access to customer rental data, which the company had purportedly anonymized. However, it was discovered that even this anonymized dataset could, in fact, identify a user personally. Netflix was sued by KamberLaw L.L.C. and ended the contest after reaching a deal with the FTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/technology/13netflix.html | title=Netflix Cancels Contest After Concerns Are Raised About Privacy | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=March 12, 2010 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Throttling of DVDs by mail ==
Netflix's DVD allocation policy – referred to by many as "[[DVD-by-mail#"Throttling"|throttling]]" – gives priority shipping and selection to customers who rent fewer discs per month. Higher volume renters may see some of their selections delayed, routed elsewhere, or sent out of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FMEGTO0.htm? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215072830/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FMEGTO0.htm |archivedate=February 15, 2006 |first=Michael |last=Liedtke |title='Throttling' angers Netflix heavy renters |agency=Associated Press (Internet Archive) |date=February 10, 2005 |accessdate=February 11, 2005 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix claims that "the large majority of our subscribers are able to receive their movies in about one business day following our shipment of the requested movie from their local distribution center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse#how|title=Terms of Use|publisher=Netflix|accessdate=January 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all shipments come from the subscriber's local distribution center, and shipments from distant centers are often delayed, as well.

In September 2004, a consumer [[class action lawsuit]], ''Frank Chavez v. Netflix, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&amp;PRGNAME=ROA&amp;ARGUMENTS=-ACGC04434884 Class action suit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929205730/http://www.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&amp;PRGNAME=ROA&amp;ARGUMENTS=-ACGC04434884 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was brought against Netflix in [[San Francisco Superior Court]]. The suit alleged [[false advertising]] in relation to claims of "unlimited rentals" with "one-day delivery." In January 2005, Netflix changed its [[terms of use]] to acknowledge "throttling" (Mike Kaltschnee, owner of the Hacking Netflix blog, says Netflix calls this practice "smoothing" internally).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2005/09/blockbuster_thr.html|title=Blockbuster Throttling|publisher=Hacking Netflix|accessdate=December 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, Netflix proposed a settlement for those who had enrolled as a paid Netflix member prior to January 15, 2005. These earlier members would be able to renew their subscriptions with a one-month free membership, and those early members with current subscriptions would receive a one-month free upgrade to the next-highest membership level. Netflix's settlement denied allegations of any wrongdoing, and the case did not reach a legal judgment. Netflix estimated the settlement cost approximately US$4 million, which included up to US$2.53 million to cover plaintiff lawyer fees. A controversial aspect of the settlement offer was that the customer's account would continue at the renewed or upgraded membership level after the free month provided by the settlement, with [[negative option billing|customers being charged accordingly]] unless they opted out after the month-long free period ended. After Trial Lawyers for Public Justice filed a challenge to the proposed settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Trial Lawyers for Public Justice|title=Court Urged To Strike Down Proposed Netflix Class Action Settlement in Deceptive Advertising Case|url=http://www.tlpj.org/pr/netflix_class_action_010506.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed an [[Amicus curiae|amicus]] brief urging the rejection or modification of the settlement, Netflix offered to alter the settlement terms, requiring customers to actively approve any continuation after the free month. The final settlement hearing took place on March 22, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Netflix|title=Netflix Claim Form Process|url=http://www.netflix.com/Settlement?mqso=60178549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of the settlement was delayed pending appeal in the California Appellate Courts.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;[http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=1&amp;doc_id=194535 California Appellate Courts] Chavez v.

Netflix, Inc. |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |last=Kralowec |first=Kimberly A. |date=April 28, 2008 |work=The UCL Practitioner }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The summary notice and long-form notice together provided all of the detail required by statute or court rule, in a highly accessible form. The fact that not all of the information was contained in a single e-mail or mailing is immaterial ... Using a summary notice that directed the class member wanting more information to a Web site containing a more detailed notice, and provided hyperlinks to that Web site, was a perfectly acceptable manner of giving notice in this case ... The class members conducted business with defendant over the Internet, and can be assumed to know how to navigate between the summary notice and the Web site. Using the capability of the Internet in that fashion was a sensible and efficient way of providing notice, especially compared to the alternative Vogel apparently preferred—mailing out a lengthy legalistic document that few class members would have been able to plow through.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The settlement was criticized because it paid out $2.5 million to attorneys for fees and costs, while offering only coupons to the class members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/04/23/attorneys-in-netflix-suit-take-home-2-million-in-fees/ |title=Court Orders Netflix to Deliver $2 million in Attorneys Fees |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |last=Slater |first=Dan |date=April 23, 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal Law Blog |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/130003/solutions_for_digital_annoyances.html |title=Solutions for Digital Annoyance |author=Spring, Tom |date=March 27, 2007 |work=PC World |accessdate=August 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Terms of Use have since been amended with terms that indicate such a suit would not be possible in the future:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netflix.com/TermsOfUse#disputes |title=Netflix Terms of Use: Disputes; Governing Law |accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of laws provisions. You and Netflix agree that the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and/or the California Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute between you and Netflix relating in any way to the Netflix service or Web site or these Terms of Use. You and Netflix expressly and irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in these courts. The parties agree that in any such dispute or subsequent legal action, they will only assert claims in an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, and that they will not seek or agree to serve as a named representative in a class action or seek relief on behalf of those other than themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Releasing this week ===
The Netflix website at one time featured a list of titles, "Releasing This Week" (RTW), that enabled customers to easily view new DVDs the company planned for rental release each week.&lt;ref name="All DVDs Releasing This Week"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.netflix.com/AllNewReleases?lnkctr=NavAllNewReleases| title=All DVDs Releasing This Week| publisher=Netflix| accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2007, the company removed the link to the page without notice and replaced it with a slider system showing only four previously released movies at a time. The new page, called "Popular New Releases", does not list newly released DVDs for rental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2007/12/netflix-removes.html| title=Netflix Removes New Releases Page – Customers Complain |publisher=Hacking Netflix |accessdate=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listing of new releases is still active,&lt;ref name="All DVDs Releasing This Week" /&gt; although there is no menu option that links to the page.

On January 1, 2008, a Netflix employee unofficially stated on the Netflix Community Blog that customers used the RTW page to add newly released movies to the top of their queues, then complained about delays in receiving them after demand outstripped the supply of DVDs on hand. By removing the page, Netflix sought to quell complaints that these movies were not readily available. Critics, however, have suggested this was just another Netflix attempt at throttling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Happy New Year |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2008/01/happy-new-year.html |publisher=Netflix Community Blog |accessdate=March 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamic queue, subscription, and delivery methods ==
On April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a [[patent infringement]] lawsuit in which it demanded a [[jury trial]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]], alleging that Blockbuster's [[online DVD rental]] subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first [[cause of action]] alleged Blockbuster's infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,024,381 (issued April 4, 2006; only hours before the lawsuit was filed) by copying the "dynamic queue" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=7024381|y=2006|m=04|d=04|inventor=Hastings; W. Reed (Santa Cruz, CA), Randolph; Marc B. (Santa Cruz, CA), Hunt; Neil Duncan|title=Approach for renting items to customers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second cause of action alleged infringement of Patent No. 6,584,450 (issued June 24, 2003), which covers in less detail the subscription rental service as well as Netflix's methods of communication and delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=6584450|y=2003|m=06|d=24|inventor=Hastings; W.

The company had already closed 290 stores in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/eastbay/stories/2007/06/25/daily54.html Blockbuster to close 282 stores this year – San Francisco Business Times]. Bizjournals.com (June 29, 2007). Retrieved on December 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2006, Blockbuster signed a deal with The Weinstein Company that gave it the exclusive rental rights to the studio's films beginning on January 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6391512.html |title=Blockbuster, Weinsteins sign exclusive deal |work= Video Business |publisher= Reed Business Information |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070103065726/http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6391512.html |archivedate= January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement forced Netflix to obtain copies from mass merchants or retailers, instead of directly from the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061116twchomeentertainment |title=How The Weinstein Company ruined Home Entertainment |author=Sciretta, Peter |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109161945/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061116twchomeentertainment |archivedate=January 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix has speculated that the effect of the Blockbuster-Weinstein agreement could result in higher rental costs and/or fewer copies of the studio's movies, which would limit the number of each movie's DVDs that would be available to subscribers at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Annual Report |url=http://ir.netflix.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-07-42689 |publisher=Netflix |accessdate=July 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007|6}}, Netflix continues to make available Weinstein movies, including ''[[Unknown (2006 film)|Unknown]]'', ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School For Scoundrels]]'' and ''[[Harsh Times]]'', among others. The [[first-sale doctrine]] allows Netflix and other video rental businesses to offer movies released by The Weinstein Company.

=== Removal of social networking feature ===
Beginning in 2004, Netflix subscribers could use a feature that allowed them to interact with friends who were also members. This feature was meant to tap into the growing popularity of [[social networking]]. With this feature, users could see how their friends rated a movie on that movie's page; view what DVDs their friends were renting; and allow them to leave their friends notes with film recommendations.&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fastcompany.com/1583922/netflix-offers-case-study-in-how-not-to-do-a-redesign |title= 5 Ways Netflix Could Have Avoided an Ugly User Backlash |first= Cliff |last= Kuang |date= March 16, 2010 |publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="betanews"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.betanews.com/article/Netflix-axes-friends-feature-due-to-unpopularity/1268941363 |title= Netflix axes 'friends' feature due to unpopularity |first= Tim |last= Conneally |date= March 18, 2010 |publisher=Betanews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, as part of a redesign of its movie-details pages, the Friends feature began to be phased out. Users could no longer see their friends' ratings on movie pages, and what remained of the friends section was moved to a small link at the bottom of each page. The initial announcement about the redesign on Netflix's official blog made no reference to any changes to the Friends feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/new-movie-details-page-rolled-out.html |title= New Movie Details Page Rolled Out |date= March 4, 2010 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of angry users posted negative comments, and the feedback prompted Netflix's Vice President of [[Product Management]], Todd Yellin, to post a follow-up statement. While apologizing for poor communication about the changes, Yellin stated that the Friends feature would continue to be phased out, citing figures that only 2% of members used the feature and the company's limited resources to maintain the service.&lt;ref name="fastcompany" /&gt;&lt;ref name="betanews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/friends-update.html |title= Friends Update |date= March 17, 2010 |publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netflix users also began using the movie-reviews section of the website to post comments protesting against the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2010/03/unhappy-netflix-customers-using-netflix-movie-reviews-to-protest-friends-feature-removal.html |title= Unhappy Netflix Customers using Netflix Movie Reviews to Protest Friends Feature Removal |date= March 14, 2010 |publisher=Hacking Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linux support ==
Netflix formerly supported online streaming only on Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS and Android, relying on Microsoft Silverlight. Partly due to digital rights management issues, despite the open-source implementation of Silverlight known as Moonlight, this has created problems for users of fully [[open-source software|open source]] versions of [[Linux]] and similar operating systems.&lt;ref name=TechRepublic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/opensource/the-netflix-linux-conjecture-how-netflix-snubs-the-linux-community/1745|title=The Netflix Linux Conjecture: How Netflix snubs the Linux community |author=Wallen, Jack |date=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Google's partially proprietary Android and [[Chrome OS]] platforms are essentially based upon Linux and other free software infrastructure, Netflix did not provide any crossover support for using its proprietary components to stream any of its content upon more free systems, such as Ubuntu and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], although this changed in October 2014.

On August 9, 2011, Netflix released a Google Chrome web store item for Chrome OS, Mac OS, and Windows; however, it did not initially enable Netflix streaming on Linux machines. On Linux systems running the Chrome browser, the extension simply redirects users to view Netflix.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deceagebecbceejblnlcjooeohmmeldh?hl=en-US&amp;hc=hp&amp;hcp=new|title= Netflix – Chrome Web Store}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Netflix chose to switch from Silverlight to HTML5 playback using [[Encrypted Media Extensions]] (EME), since then, the extensions were added to Microsoft's Internet Explorer on Windows 8.1 and Apple's Safari on OS X Yosemite.&lt;ref name="techblog.netflix.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/06/html5-video-in-ie-11-on-windows-81.html|title=The Netflix Tech Blog: HTML5 Video in IE 11 on Windows 8.1|work=netflix.com|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techblog.netflix.com" /&gt; It was implemented in Google Chrome on all platforms shortly afterward.

As of October 10, 2014 multiple versions of Linux including Ubuntu and PCLinuxOS claim support for Netflix in Google Chrome version 37 or newer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://insights.ubuntu.com/2014/10/10/watch-netflix-in-ubuntu-today/ |title=Watch Netflix in Ubuntu today |publisher=Ubuntu |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pclinuxos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pclinuxos.com/netflix-streaming-comes-to-chrome-for-pclinuxos/|title=Netflix streaming comes to PCLinuxOS » PCLinuxOS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website for PCWorld also states that users of other Linux distributions such as version 17 of [[Linux Mint]] have been successfully using Netflix via Google Chrome without any special workarounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2824623/ubuntu-linux-gets-netflix-without-weird-workarounds.html|title=Netflix comes to Linux via Ubuntu and Chrome|author=Jared Newman|date=October 10, 2014|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-party solutions ===
{{As of|2011|5|9|df=US}}, Google had initially released plans for a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] for the Chrome browser and Chrome OS which would allow Netflix streaming, including traditional Linux users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechromesource.com/netflix-plug-in-for-chrome-and-chrome-os-is-on-the-way/|title= Netflix Plug-in for Chrome and Chrome OS is on the way |author=West, Jullian|date=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2012, patches to the Wine compatibility layer to make viewing of Netflix on Linux and similar systems were made available.&lt;ref name="iheartubuntuannounce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/netflix-on-ubuntu-is-here.html |title=Netflix on Ubuntu Is Here |work=iheartubuntu.com |date=November 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author=iheartubuntu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308111726/http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/netflix-on-ubuntu-is-here.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2012, a [[Personal Package Archive|PPA]] and installation files were made publicly available making the installation and use of Netflix much easier for users of Ubuntu 12.04 and possibly other distributions.&lt;ref name="iheartubuntuppa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/ppa-for-netflix-desktop-app.html |title=PPA for Netflix Desktop App |work=iheartubuntu.com |date=November 18, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author=iheartubuntu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308112323/http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/ppa-for-netflix-desktop-app.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 2013, [[Software repository|software repositories]] were made publicly available making possible the usage of the Windows Silverlight plugin in Linux-native web browsers using Wine.&lt;ref name="ubuntugeek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubuntugeek.com/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html |title=Pipelight – Using Silverlight in Linux browsers |work=ubuntugeek.com |date=August 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |auto= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308112740/http://www.ubuntugeek.com/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fds-team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fds-team.de/cms/pipelight-installation.html |title=Pipelight – Installation |work=fds-team.de |date=October 15, 2013 |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |author=Fds-Team |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308113054/http://fds-team.de/cms/pipelight-installation.html |archivedate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous Linux Netflix support required running the entire Firefox web browser through the Wine compatibility layer.&lt;ref name="iheartubuntuppa" /&gt;

On March 11, 2011, Don Cullen filed a national class action lawsuit&lt;ref name="cullenvnetflix"&gt;[http://www.westonfirm.com/Netflix-Complaint.pdf NATIONWIDE CLASS ACTION FILED AGAINST NETFLIX; LAWSUIT ALLEGES POPULAR MOVIE WEBSITE FAILED TO CAPTION STREAMING VIDEO LIBRARY IN VIOLATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAW, MISLED DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CUSTOMERS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812190131/http://www.westonfirm.com/Netflix-Complaint.pdf |date=2011-08-12 }}. Cullen v. Netflix, Inc., Case No. CV 11-1199 (N.D. Cal.). Retrieved January 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; against Netflix alleging that the service failed to [[closed captioning|closed caption]] its streaming video library and had misled deaf and hard of hearing customers. In June 2011, the [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] represented by the [[Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund]] (DREDF) filed a lawsuit against Netflix for not providing closed captioning on all of its movies on the "Watch Instantly" service. The group claims Netflix is violating the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] by not providing equal access on entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20072619-38/netflix-sued-by-deaf-group-over-lack-of-subtitles/|title= Netflix sued by deaf group over lack of subtitles|author=Whitney, Lance|date=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 11, 2011, the court denied Netflix a motion to dismiss the case.&lt;ref name="nadcasedoc32"&gt;[http://www.nad.org/sites/default/files/2011/November/Court%20Order%20Denying%20MTD%202011%2011%2010.pdf MEMORANDUM AND ORDER REGARDING DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS AMENDED COMPLAINT]. United States DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS. Case 3:11-cv-30168-MAP. Document 32. Retrieved December 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals dismissed the suit, saying the Americans with Disabilities Act applies only to physical spaces, not online.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen v. Netflix, 600 Fed. Appx. 508 (Ct. App. Ninth Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Netflix increased the number of programs that are closed captioned. Almost all Netflix-ready devices in distribution today (including AppleTV, BD players, the Roku set-top box, and all the [[game console]]s, phone apps, tablet apps, and TVs) are capable of rendering captions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Blog.Netflix.com |url=http://blog.netflix.com/2012/02/update-on-captioning-for-our-members.html |date=February 2012|title=An Update on Captioning for our Members|accessdate= March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Netflix formed an experimental project to [[crowdsourcing|crowdsource]] the closed-captioning effort using the Amara (formerly Universal Subtitles) platform.&lt;ref name=amara1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/netflix-amara-closed-captions-crowdsourcing/|title=Netflix experiments with crowd-sourced captioning|date=July 30, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|publisher=[[GigaOM]]|last=Roettgers|first=Janko}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this proved problematic in the face of claims that crowdsourced subtitles, regardless of whether they are transcriptions or translations, are [[derivative work]]s which [[copyright infringement|infringe copyright]] if created or distributed without consent from the film's copyright owner.&lt;ref name=amara2&gt;{{Cite news| newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444592404578033301429532328| title=Lost in Translation, Found in Subtitles| last=Paletta| first=Anthony| date=October 3, 2012| accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amara operates under [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] safe-harbor provisions which indemnify it from secondary copyright infringement [[lawsuit]]s over user-uploaded content, and presumably Netflix would not publish any subtitles produced by this effort without authorization. Netflix was careful to say it is not committed to using any subtitles produced by the crowdsourcing project.&lt;ref name=amara1 /&gt;

In October 2012, Netflix was found to be offering the television series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' to customers in [[Finland]] with unauthorized subtitles from the [[fansub]] scene.&lt;ref name=tfOct19&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/netflix-caught-using-pirated-subtitles-in-finland-121019/|title=Netflix Caught Using "Pirated" Subtitles in Finland|author=Ernesto|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such subtitles, and motion pictures incorporating them, have long been traded online, resulting in [[cease and desist]] notices, [[notice and take down|takedowns]], and copyright infringement lawsuits against traders, website operators, and search engines; even criminal prosecution happened in one Norwegian case involving the distribution of fan-created subtitles alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/student-fined-for-running-movie-tv-show-subtitle-download-site-120608/|title=Student Fined For Running Movie &amp; TV Show Subtitle Download Site|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012|author=Enigmax|publisher=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When confronted, Netflix apologized and promised to remove the unauthorized translations but did not explain how the content came to be offered in the first place, or whether other potentially copyright-infringing subtitles exist in the company's repertoire.&lt;ref name=tfOct19 /&gt;

On January 20, 2014, Jon Christian published an article in ''The Week'', titled "How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions", which catalogues Netflix's various technical and legal issues regarding closed captioning, including the poor quality of the subtitles that are provided. For example, he states: "But for all the service's strengths, one aspect is still decidedly twentieth century: The bizarrely low standards for Netflix's closed captions, which continue to alienate subscribers who are deaf, hard of hearing, or simply have difficulty understanding dialogue." The article was updated the following day to publish Netflix's response: "Update: The day after this article was published, a representative from Netflix contacted the author of this piece with an additional comment: 'While we don't have the rights to make edits to subs/captions we do, in fact, request redelivery of subtitles or captions when we discover errors. The titles in your piece are now under investigation.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Week|title=How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions| date=January 20, 2014| url=http://theweek.com/article/index/255618/how-netflix-alienated-and-insulted-its-deaf-subscribers |author=Christian, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launch of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' in 2015, disability rights advocates pointed out that Netflix had not yet included content with [[described video|audio descriptions]] of visual content for those who are blind or visually impaired. One critic considered it "terribly laughable PR" for Netflix to not include audio descriptions on a series that focuses on a [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|character]] who himself is blind. On April 14, 2015, director of content operations Tracy Wright announced that Netflix would begin to work with studios to add audio descriptions to its original content.&lt;ref name=wp-blindsuperhero&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix makes a blind superhero accessible to blind audiences|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/04/14/netflix-makes-a-blind-superhero-accessible-to-blind-viewers/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety-descriptions&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix Adding Audio Description Tracks for Visually Impaired, Starting with 'Marvel's Daredevil'|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-adding-audio-description-tracks-for-visually-impaired-starting-with-marvels-daredevil-1201472372/|website=Variety|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circumvention of geoblocking ==
More than 30 million Netflix subscribers use the service via a [[proxy server]] or [[virtual private network]] (VPN); doing so can make a user appear to be located in a country other than the one they are actually in, thus allowing them to use the service to access content that Netflix [[Geo-blocking|cannot offer in their region]], due to geographical licensing restrictions. It is unclear whether accessing geo-blocked content via VPN violates local copyright laws, but content providers and other broadcasters have asserted that it is illegal because it infringes local rights to content that may have been sold to a competitor.&lt;ref name=telcoreviewnz-globalblock&gt;{{cite web|title=Global mode spat: We've got the legal paperwork|url=http://telcoreview.co.nz/story/Global-mode-spat-weve-got-the-legal-paperwork/|website=TelcoReview|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode /&gt;&lt;ref name=cwnz-globalmodelegal&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Mode "completely legal" as CallPlus dismisses industry backlash|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/572164/global-mode-completely-legal-callplus-dismisses-industry-backlash/|website=Computerworld NZ|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cwnz-riftcourt&gt;{{cite web|title=Streaming TV rift heads to court in New Zealand|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/573022/streaming-tv-rift-heads-court-new-zealand/|website=Computerworld NZ|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; GlobalWebIndex showed about 20 million of such VPN users came from China alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/09/why-netflix-wont-block-vpn-users |title=Why Netflix won't block VPN users – it has too many of them, Part II |last=Hern |first=Alex |publisher=The Guardian|date=24 June 2015 |website=The Guardian |access-date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-sonyvpn /&gt; As of November 2013, Canadian Netflix offered 3,600 titles compared to the U.S. service which had more than 10,000 which results in Canadians using VPNs so they can access the larger U.S. content selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/12/13/netflix-canada-vs-us_n_4435459.html|title=Netflix Canada vs. Netflix USA: Why Do We Get The Shaft?|first=Michael|last=Bolen|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2013-12-13|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a leaked e-mail revealed by the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]] in 2014, [[Sony Pictures Television]]'s president of international distribution, Keith LeGoy, described VPN usage of Netflix as being "semi-sanctioned" [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]], and he criticized the company for not taking further steps to detect these users and restrict their access to content Netflix had not licensed for their region.&lt;ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode&gt;{{cite news|title=New Zealand ISPs may be sued for letting users bypass geoblocks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/new-zealand-internet-service-providers-face-legal-action-over-copyright-breach|accessdate=22 April 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-sonyvpn&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony Pictures mad at Netflix's failure to block overseas VPN users|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/sony-pictures-mad-at-netflixs-failure-to-block-overseas-vpn-users/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on January 14, 2016, Netflix announced its intent to strengthen measures to restrict access to unlicensed material, by viewers using VPNs or proxies.&lt;ref name=verge-netflixproxy&gt;{{cite web|title=Netflix says it will do more to stop customers from bypassing country restrictions|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/14/10767982/netflix-blocking-proxies-vpn-country-restrictions|website=The Verge|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other controversies ==
=== Price increase lawsuit ===
A lawsuit was filed agented Netflix in 2016 by George Keritsis. The suit alleged that Netflix broke the contract it made with millions of customers who have "grandfathered" subscription plans with price guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-user-lawsuit-class-action-rate-hike-1201807561/|title=Netflix User Sues Over Rate Hike, Claiming Breach of Contract|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2016-07-01|work=Variety|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawsuit over Fox contracts ===
[[20th Century Fox]] filed a lawsuit in 2016, after Marco Waltenberg and Tara Flynn left the company for Netflix. Its claim argued that Netflix was enticing executives to break their employment contracts with Fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/09/netflix-fox-lawsuit-poaching-employees-1201821170/|title=Netflix hit by Fox with lawsuit over poaching executives|first=Dominic|last=Pattern|publisher=Deadline|date=2016-09-16|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firing of Jonathan Friedland ===
On June 2018, Netflix [[Chief Communications Officer|CCO]] Jonathan Friedland was fired for saying the word [[nigger]] during a company meeting about offensive words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17495364/netflix-pr-chief-jonathan-friedland-fired-n-word-racial-slur|title=Netflix PR chief fired for repeatedly using the n-word|first=Nick|last=Statt|publisher=The Verge|date=2018-06-22|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memo released by Reed Hastings, which stated that he should have used a [[euphemism]], mentioned that Friedland said the word again during a follow-up meeting with [[human resources]]. Hastings described the second utterance as "confirm[ing] a deep lack of understanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jonathan-friedland-exits-netflix-1122675|title=Netflix fires PR chief over use of N-word in meeting|first1=Bryn Elise|last1=Sandberg|first2=Lesley|last2=Goldberg|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2018-06-22|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, an advertising campaign for Netflix launched, which emphasized its black talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/russespinoza/2018/06/25/netflix-runs-strong-black-lead-spot-days-after-n-word-crisis/#6728451d7efa|title=Netflix runs 'Strong Black Lead' spot days after N-word crisis|first=Russ|last=Espinoza|publisher=Forbes|date=2018-06-25|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6003">'''Legal research''' is "the process of identifying and retrieving information necessary to support [[Law|legal]] decision-making.  In its broadest sense, legal research includes each step of a course of action that begins with an analysis of the facts of a problem and concludes with the application and communication of the results of the investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barkan|first1=Steven M.|last2=Bintliff|first2=Barbara|last3=Whisner|first3=Mary|title=Fundamentals of Legal Research|publisher=Foundation Press|isbn=1609300564|page=1|edition=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoD7rQEACAAJ|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The processes of legal research vary according to the country and the [[legal system]] involved. However, legal research generally involves tasks such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Perform Legal Research|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/links|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=25 February 2018|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Finding primary [[sources of law]], or [[primary authority]], in a given [[jurisdiction]] ([[Case law|cases]], [[statutes]], [[regulations]], etc.).
# Searching [[secondary authority]] (for example, [[law review]]s, [[Law dictionary|legal dictionaries]], [[legal treatise]]s, and legal encyclopedias such as [[American Jurisprudence]] and [[Corpus Juris Secundum]]), for background information about a legal topic. 
# Searching non-legal sources for investigative or supporting information.

Legal research is performed by anyone with a need for legal information, including [[lawyers]], law [[librarians]], and [[paralegals]]. Sources of legal information range from printed books, to free legal research websites (like [[Legal Information Institute|Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute]], [[Findlaw|Findlaw.com]], [[LexisNexis Martindale-Hubbell|Martindale Hubbell]] or [[CanLII]]) and information portals to fee database vendors such as [[Wolters Kluwer]], [[LexisNexis]], [[Westlaw]], [[VLex]] and [[Bloomberg Law]]. [[Law libraries]] around the world provide research services to help their patrons find the legal information they need in [[law school]]s, [[law firm]]s and other research environments. Many law libraries and institutions provide free access to legal information on the web, either individually or via [[collective action]], such as with the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

A number of books are available for those wishing to undertake legal research in the UK context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Using a law library : A student's guide to legal research skills.|last=Clinch|first=Peter|publisher=Blackstone|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Butterworths legal research guide (2nd ed.)|last=Holborn|first=Guy|publisher=Butterworths|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dane &amp; Thomas : How to use a law library : An introduction to legal skills. (4th ed)|last=Knowles|first=J|last2=Thomas|first2=P|publisher=Sweet and Maxwell|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Databases and software tools==
===Free-to-use===
Although many jurisdictions publish laws online,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{cite web|title=legislation.gov.uk|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; case law is often accessed through specialty online databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Law Online|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations.php|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=24 July 2017|date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free-to-access services, through the free law movement, include: [[Australasian Legal Information Institute]], [[British and Irish Legal Information Institute]], [[CanLII]], [[Legal Information Institute]], [[LexML Brasil]], World Legal Information Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WorldLII|url=http://worldlii.org/|website=World Legal Information Institute|publisher=AustLII|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindworks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mindworks|url=http://mindworks.altervista.org/|website=Altervisa|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jurispedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jurispedia|url=http://jurispedia.org/|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===
Commercial services for legal research include both [[primary source|primary and secondary sources]]. Commercial services can be country-specific, international or comparative. As of 2010, commercial legal research tools in the United States generated an estimated $8 billion in revenues per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Russell|title=Bloomberg Hangs New Shingle|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704545004575353143750422612|accessdate=24 July 2017|agency=Wall Street Journal|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some governments also provide access to certain resources through paid databases, such as the [[PACER (law)|United States PACER law system]].

==Third-Party Legal Research Providers==
Legal research is known to take much time and effort, and access to online legal research databases such as LexisNexis and Westlaw can be costly. Consequently, with due consideration given to ethical concerns, law firms and other practitioners may turn to third-party legal research providers to outsource their legal research needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Adam I.|last2=Lender|first2=David J.|title=Electronic Discovery: Law and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|isbn=1454815604|page=SA13-32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBWECwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of official [[minimum wage]] rates of the 193 [[United Nations member states]] and former members of the [[United Nations]], and also includes the following territories and states with limited recognition: [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Northern Cyprus]], [[Kosovo]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and other independent countries. Some countries may have a very complicated minimum wage system; for example, India has more than 1202 minimum wage rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paycheck.in/main/salary/minimumwages |title=Minimum Wage in India 2013 |publisher=PayCheck.in |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Methodology ==
The minimum wages listed refer to a [[gross income|gross]] amount, that is before [[tax deduction|deduction of taxes]] and [[social security]] contributions, which vary from one country to another. Also excluded from calculations are regulated paid days off, including public holidays, sick pay, annual leave and [[social insurance]] contributions paid by the employer.

For the sake of comparison, an annual wage column is provided in [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]], a hypothetical unit of [[currency]] calculated based on the [[purchasing power parity]] of [[household final consumption expenditure]]. For calculating the annual wage, the lowest general minimum wage was used.

[[File:Map of the Legal systems of the world (en).png|thumb|Legal systems of the world]]
The contemporary '''legal systems of the world''' are generally based on one of four basic [[systems]]: [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[common law]], [[statutory law]], [[religious law]] or combinations of these. However, the legal system of each country is shaped by its unique history and so incorporates individual variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://saint-claire.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Legal-Systems-of-the-World.pdf|title=Legal Systems of the World|last=|first=|date= |website= |access-date=|publisher = Saint: Security Sector Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The science that studies Law at the level of legal systems is called [[Comparative Law]].

Both ''civil'' (also known as ''Roman'') and ''common'' law systems can be considered the most widespread in the world: civil law because it is the most widespread by landmass, and common law because it is employed by the greatest number of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Principles of International Insolvency''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;lpg=PT454&amp;ots=D-khdgPbR4&amp;dq=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;pg=PT454#v=onepage&amp;q=maps%20of%20world%20financial%20law%20common%20law&amp;f=false|date=2007|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Phillip|title=''Maps of World Financial Law:Law and practice of international finance series''|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Maps_of_World_Financial_Law.html?id=Z5vKGAAACAAJ|date=2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''English Common Law is the most widespread legal system in the world''|url=https://www.sweetandmaxwell.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/061108.pdf|date=November 2008|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}
[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Shamash]] (the [[Babylonia]]n sun god) hands King [[Hammurabi]] a [[Code of Hammurabi|code of law]]]]

The central source of law that is recognized as authoritative is [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in a constitution or [[statute]] passed by [[legislature]], to amend a code.
While the concept of codification dates back to the [[Code of Hammurabi]] in [[Babylon]] ca. 1790 BC, civil law systems derive from the [[Roman Empire]] and, more particularly, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' issued by the Emperor [[Justinian]] ca. AD 529. This was an extensive reform of the law in the [[Byzantine Empire]], bringing it together into codified documents. Civil law was also partly influenced by [[religious law]]s such as [[Canon law]] and [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Badr&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 [Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977]|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi /&gt; Civil law today, in theory, is interpreted rather than developed or made by judges. Only [[legislature|legislative]] enactments (rather than legal [[precedent]]s, as in common law) are considered legally binding.

Scholars of [[comparative law]] and economists promoting the [[legal origins theory]] usually subdivide civil law into four distinct groups:
* '''French civil law''': in France, the [[Benelux]] countries, Italy, Romania, Spain and former colonies of those countries;
* '''[[Law of Germany#Civil law|German civil law]]''': in Germany, Austria, Russia, Switzerland, Estonia, Latvia,  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo*, Macedonia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, [[Portugal]] and [[Portuguese Empire|its former colonies]], Turkey, and East Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (Republic of China);
* '''[[Scandinavian law|Scandinavian civil law]]''': in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. As historically integrated in the Scandinavian cultural sphere, Finland and Iceland also inherited the system.
* '''[[Chinese law]]''': a mixture of civil law and [[socialist law]] in use in the People's Republic of China.

However, some of these legal systems are often and more correctly said to be of hybrid nature:
*'''Napoleonic to Germanistic influence ([[Italian law|Italian civil law]]) '''
The [[Italy|Italian]] civil code of 1942 replaced the original one of 1865, introducing germanistic elements due to the geopolitical alliances of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.teoriaestoriadeldirittoprivato.com/index.php?com=statics&amp;option=index&amp;cID=132 |title = Towards a Civil Code: The Italian Experience|last = Triggiano|first = Annalisa|website = Teoria e Storia del Diritto Privato}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian approach has been imitated by other countries including the [[Netherlands]] (1992), [[Argentina]] (2014), [[Brazil]] (2002) and [[Portugal]] (1966). Most of them have innovations introduced  by the Italian legislation, including the unification of the [[civil code|civil]] and [[Commercial code (law)|commercial code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol16/iss2/8/ |title = On the Legal Method of the Uniform Commercial Code|journal = Law and Contemporary Problems|volume = 16|number = 2|first= Mitchell|last= Franklin|date = Spring 1951|pages = 330-343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Germanistic to Napoleonic influence ([[Swiss law|Swiss civil law]])'''
The [[Swiss civil code]] is considered mainly influenced by the German civil code and partly influenced by the French civil code.  The civil code of the [[Republic of Turkey]] is a slightly modified version of the Swiss code, adopted in 1926 during [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]'s presidency as part of the government's progressive reforms and secularization.

A comprehensive list of countries that base their legal system on a [[Codification (law)|codified]] civil law follows:

|The Spanish legal tradition had a great influence on the [[Civil Code of Argentina]], basically a work of the Argentine [[jurist]] [[Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield]], who dedicated five years of his life on this task. The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1871. Beyond the influence of the Spanish legal tradition, the Argentinian Civil Code was also inspired by the Draft of the Brazilian Civil Code, the [[wikt:Draft|Draft]] of the Spanish Civil Code of 1851, the [[Napoleonic code]] and the [[Civil Code (Chile)|Chilean Civil Code]]. The sources of this Civil Code also include various theoretical legal works, mainly of the great French jurists of the 19th century. It was the first Civil Law that consciously adopted as its cornerstone the distinction between i. rights from obligations and ii. real property rights, thus distancing itself from the French model.

The Argentinian Civil Code was also in effect in Paraguay, as per a [[Paraguayan]] law of 1880, until the new Civil Code went in force in 1987.

In Argentina, this 1871 Civil Code remained in force until August 2015, when it was replaced by the new ''Código Civil y Comercial de la Nación''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/235000-239999/235975/norma.htm |title=Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas Públicas - Argentina |publisher=InfoLEG |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jornadaonline.com/Pol%C3%ADtica/139234-Comienza-a-regir-el-nuevo-C%C3%B3digo-Civil-y-Comercial |title=Comienza a regir el nuevo Código Civil y Comercial |publisher=Jornadaonline.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{flagicon|Chile}} [[Law of Chile|Chile]]
|Based on the Chilean Civil Law inspired by the Napoleonic Civil Law. The Spanish legal tradition exercised an especially great influence on the civil code of Chile. On its turn, the Chilean civil code influenced to a large degree the drafting of the civil codes of other [[Latin-American]] states. For instance, the codes of Ecuador (1861) and Colombia (1873) constituted faithful reproductions of the Chilean code, but for very few exceptions. The compiler of the [[Civil Code of Chile]], Venezuelan [[Andrés Bello]], worked for its completion for almost 30 years, using elements, of the Spanish law on the one hand, and of other [[Western law]]s, especially of the French one, on the other. Indeed, it is noted that he consulted and used all of the codes that had been issued till then, starting from the era of [[Justinian]].

The Civil Code came into effect on 1 January 1857. The influence of the [[Napoleonic code]] and the Law of Castile of the Spanish colonial period (especially the ''[[Siete Partidas]]''), is great; it is observed however that ''e.g.'' in many provisions of [[property law|property]] or [[contract law]], the solutions of the French ''code civil'' were put aside in favor of pure [[Roman law]] or Castilian law.

|Based on the Napoleonic Civil Law. First Civil Code (a part of the General Code or [[Braulio Carrillo Colina|Carrillo]] Code) came into effect in 1841; its text was inspired by the South Peruvian Civil Code of Marshal [[Andres de Santa Cruz]]. The present Civil Code went into effect 1 January 1888, and was influenced by the [[Napoleonic Code]] and the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 (from its 1851 draft version).
|-
|{{flagicon|Croatia}} [[Law of Croatia|Croatia]]
|Based on the Germanic Civil Law. Croatian Law system is largely influenced by German and  Austrian law systems. It is significantly influenced by the [[Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Civil Code of the Austrian Empire]] from 1811, known in Croatia as ''"General Civil Law"'' ''("Opći građanski zakon")''. OGZ was in force from 1853&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=45220 |title=Opći građanski zakonik &amp;#124; Hrvatska enciklopedija |publisher=Enciklopedija.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1946. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-controlled [[puppet state]] that was established in 1941 during [[World War II]], used the OGZ as a basis for the 1943 ''"Base of the Civil Code for the Independent State of Croatia"'' ''("Osnova građanskoga zakona za Nezavisnu Državu Hrvatsku")''. After the War, Croatia become a member of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Federation]] which enacted in 1946 the ''"Law on immediate voiding of regulations passed before April 6, 1941 and during the enemy occupation"'' ''("Zakon o nevaženju pravnih propisa donesenih prije 6. travnja 1941. i za vrijeme neprijateljske okupacije")''. By this law OGZ was declared invalid as a whole, but implementation of some of its legal rules was approved. During the post-War era, the Croatian legal system become influenced by elements of the [[socialist law]]. Croatian civil law was pushed aside, and it took norms of public law and legal regulation of the [[Socialization (economics)|social ownership]]. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on June 25, 1991, the previous legal system was used as a base for writing new laws.  ''"The Law on Obligations"'' ''("Zakon o obveznim odnosima")'' was enacted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Croatian legal history in the European context, Dalibor Čepulo, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Croatia as a [[European union]] member state implements elements of the [[Acquis communautaire|EU acquis]] into its legal system.

The Greek [[civil code]] of 1946, highly influenced by traditional Roman law and the German civil code of 1900 ([[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]); the Greek civil code replaced the [[Byzantine law|Byzantine–Roman civil law]] in effect in Greece since its independence (Νομική Διάταξη της Ανατολικής Χέρσου Ελλάδος, Legal Provision of Eastern Mainland Greece, November 1821: 'Οι Κοινωνικοί Νόμοι των Αειμνήστων Χριστιανών Αυτοκρατόρων της Ελλάδος μόνοι ισχύουσι κατά το παρόν εις την Ανατολικήν Χέρσον Ελλάδα', 'The Social [i.e. Civil] Laws of the Dear Departed Christian Emperors of Greece [referring to the Byzantine Emperors] alone are in effect at present in Eastern Mainland Greece')

|{{flagicon|Guatemala}} [[Law of Guatemala|Guatemala]]
|Based on Napoleonic civil law. Guatemala has had three Civil Codes: the first one from 1877, a new one introduced in 1933, and the one currently in force, which was passed in 1963. This Civil Code has suffered some reforms throughout the years, as well as a few derogations relating to areas which have subsequently been regulated by newer laws, such as the Code of Commerce and the Law of the National Registry of Persons. In general, it follows the tradition of the Roman-French system of civil codification.

Regarding the theory of 'sources of law' in the Guatemalan legal system, the 'Ley del Organismo Judicial' recognizes 'the law' as the main legal source (in the sense of legislative texts), although it also establishes 'jurisprudence' as a complementary source. Although jurisprudence technically refers to judicial decisions in general, in practice it tends to be confused and identified with the concept of 'legal doctrine', which is a qualified series of identical resolutions in similar cases pronounced by higher courts (the Constitutional Court acting as a 'Tribunal de [[Amparo (law)|Amparo]]', and the Supreme Court acting as a 'Tribunal de Casación') whose theses become binding for lower courts.

==Common law==
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King John of England signs [[Magna Carta]]]]
Common law and [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]] (legal concept) are systems of law whose sources are the decisions in cases by judges. In addition, every system will have a legislature that passes new laws and statutes. The relationships between statutes and judicial decisions can be complex. In some jurisdictions, such statutes may overrule judicial decisions or codify the topic covered by several contradictory or ambiguous decisions. In some jurisdictions, judicial decisions may decide whether the jurisdiction's constitution allowed a particular statute or statutory provision to be made or what meaning is contained within the statutory provisions. Statutes were allowed to be made by the government. Common law developed in England, influenced by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] law and to a much lesser extent by the [[Norman conquest of England]], which introduced legal concepts from [[Norman law]], which, in turn, had its origins in [[Salic law]]. Common law was later inherited by the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and almost every former colony of the [[British Empire]] has adopted it ([[Malta]] being an exception). The doctrine of ''stare decisis'', also known as ''case law'' or ''[[precedent]] by courts'', is the major difference to codified civil law systems.

Common law is currently in practice in [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], most of the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] ([[English law|England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]]), [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Law of India|India]] (excluding [[Goa civil code|Goa]]),{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed because the Supreme Court of India's decisions override many lower courts|date=June 2014}} [[Law of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Law of Canada|Canada]] (excluding [[Quebec law|Quebec]]), [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], the [[Law of the United States|United States]] (on a state level excluding [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]]), and many other places. In addition to these countries, several others have adapted the common law system into a mixed system. For example, Nigeria operates largely on a common law system, but incorporates religious law.

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] takes an approach mixing civil law (based on the treaties) with an attachment to the importance of case law. One of the most fundamental documents to shape common law is the English [[Magna Carta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html|accessdate=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which placed limits on the power of the English Kings. It served as a kind of medieval bill of rights for the aristocracy and the judiciary who developed the law.

==Religious law==
{{main|Religious law}}

Religious law refers to the notion of a religious system or document being used as a legal source, though the methodology used varies. For example, the use of Jewish and [[Halakha]] for public law has a static and unalterable quality, precluding amendment through legislative acts of government or development through judicial precedent; Christian [[Canon law]] is more similar to [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] in its use of [[code (law)|codes]]; and Islamic [[Sharia]] law (and [[Fiqh]] jurisprudence) is based on legal [[precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]''), and is thus considered similar to [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice|first=Mahmoud A.|last=El-Gamal|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-86414-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main kinds of religious law are [[Sharia]] in Islam, [[Halakha]] in Judaism, and [[canon law]] in some Christian groups. In some cases these are intended purely as individual moral guidance, whereas in other cases they are intended and may be used as the basis for a country's legal system. The latter was particularly common during the [[Middle Ages]].

[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Aleppo Codex: 10th century Hebrew Bible with Masoretic pointing]]
The Halakha is followed by [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|conservative]] Jews in both ecclesiastical and civil relations. No country is fully governed by Halakha, but two Jewish people may decide, because of personal belief, to have a dispute heard by a Jewish court, and be bound by its rulings.

The Islamic legal system of [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) and [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence) is the most widely used [[religious law]], and one of the three most common legal systems in the world alongside common law and civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on both [[divine law]], derived from the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]], and the rulings of [[Ulema]] (jurists), who used the methods of ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus), ''[[Qiyas]]'' (analogical deduction), ''[[Ijtihad]]'' (research) and ''[[Urf]]'' (common practice) to derive ''[[Fatwā]]'' (legal opinions). An Ulema was required to qualify for an ''[[Ijazah]]'' ([[Law degree|legal]] [[doctorate]]) at a ''[[Madrasa]]'' ([[law school]]/[[college]]) before they could issue ''Fatwā''.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=George|title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=109|issue=2|date=April–June 1989|pages=175–182 [175–77]|doi=10.2307/604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], classical Islamic law may have had an [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe|influence]] on the development of common law&lt;ref name=J-Makdisi&gt;{{citation|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several civil law institutions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{citation|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, 24–25 February 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharia law governs a number of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, though most countries use Sharia law only as a supplement to national law. It can relate to all aspects of civil law, including property rights, contracts or public law.

===Civil law and canon law===
{{main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
[[Canon law]] is not divine law, properly speaking, because it is not found in revelation. Instead, it is seen as human law inspired by the word of God and applying the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the church. [[Canon law]] regulates the internal ordering of the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]]. Canon law is amended and adapted by the legislative authority of the church, such as [[episcopal conference|councils of bishops]], individual bishops for their respective sees, the [[Pope]] for the entire Catholic Church, and the British Parliament for the [[Church of England]].

Codification occurred in 1866 with the enactment of the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]], which continued in force when the modern Province of Quebec was created at Confederation in 1867.  Canadian federal law in force in Quebec is based on common law, but federal statutes also take into account the bijuridical nature of Canada and use both common law and civil law terms where appropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">An '''obligation''' is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether [[legal obligation|legal]] or [[moral obligation|moral]].  There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of [[etiquette]], [[social]] obligations, [[religious]] and possibly in terms of [[politics]], where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally [[legal]] obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a [[tradition]] or for social reasons.

Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bear, ''Sacred Journey of the Medicine Wheel'' (2008), p. 393: "Adults have more obligations and are held to higher standards of accountability than children are".&lt;/ref&gt; Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.  For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit is not blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.

The word "obligation" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.

==Other uses==
The term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is [[facultative]], meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family [[Proteidae]] are obligate [[paedomorphs]], whereas species belonging to the [[Ambystomatidae]] are facultative paedomorphs.

In the Catholic Church, [[Holy Days of Obligation]] or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]].

'''Private jurisdiction''' is the right of an individual or a [[Legal person|legal entity]] to establish [[Court|courts of law]]. It was prevalent during [[feudalism]].

A [[Exclusive right|franchise]], such as a [[corporation]], a jurisdiction, or a right to collect certain tolls or taxes, was, in effect, a kind of property: an "[[incorporeal hereditament]]". Under [[English law]] incorporeal hereditaments (including jurisdictions) were either granted or recognized in [[charter]]s. 

Franchise jurisdictions included those of [[manorial court]]s, secular courts of ecclesiastical corporations (in addition to the Church's own jurisdiction over [[family law]]), [[borough courts]] of [[municipal corporation]]s, merchant courts established on markets and fairs, and mining courts of mines and mining villages.

In medieval England franchises could also be established for jurisdiction over partially or entirely privatized administrative territories such as "[[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]]" and [[county|counties]]. Broad jurisdictional powers were also granted to many colonial corporations (such as the [[East India Company]]). 

In medieval England for many substantive areas of law the king's courts only reviewed whether the franchise courts stayed within their jurisdictional and certain procedural bounds and not the substance of the case. Generally, the only way to remove or undo the remedy of a franchise court case in royal court was to bring one of several varieties of lawsuits for [[trespass]] ([[tort]]) against the franchise court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">'''The Project on Scientific Knowledge and Public Policy (SKAPP)''', based at the [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], examines the nature of science and the ways in which it is both used and misused in government decision-making and legal proceedings. Through [[empirical research]], conversations among scholars, and publications, SKAPP aims to enhance understanding of how knowledge is generated and interpreted. SKAPP's mission is to promote transparent decision-making based on the best available science in order to promote public safety and health.

SKAPP provides information about the impacts of existing legislation and regulation on drug safety, [[occupational safety and health|occupational health and safety]], and [[environmental health]]. It has examined the use of science in regulation of specific hazards, including [[bisphenol A]], [[beryllium]], [[hexavalent chromium]], and the butter-flavoring chemical [[diacetyl]].

Support for SKAPP is provided by the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services, the [[Open Society Institute]], and the Rockefeller Family Fund. Past support has been provided by the Common Benefit Trust, a fund established pursuant to a court order in the Silicone Gel Breast Implant Products Liability litigation; the Alice Hamilton Fund; and the [[Bauman Foundation]].

== Scientific evidence and the law ==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] of the [[United States]] has issued three rulings which greatly impact the role scientists may play in providing [[expert testimony]]. These rulings are ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]],'' ''General Electric v. Joiner'', and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]].'' Each address the "[[gatekeeper]]" role of the judge in determining the admissibility of expert testimony, with considerable implications for [[tort]] litigation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2634">A '''robot lawyer''' or a '''robo-lawyer''' refers to a [[Artificial intelligence and law|legal AI]] application that can perform tasks that are typically done by paralegals or young associates at law firms. However, there is some debate on the correctness of the term. Some commentators say that legal AI is technically speaking neither a [[lawyer]] nor a [[robot]] and should not be referred to as such.&lt;ref&gt;A.I. Is Doing Legal Work. But It Won’t Replace Lawyers, Yet. The New York Times, 19 Mar. 2017. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/19/technology/lawyers-artificial-intelligence.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators believe that the term can be misleading and note that the robot lawyer of the future won't be one all-encompassing application but a collection of specialized [[lawbot|bots]] for various tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/single-post/Robot-Lawyer-Means&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Some legal AI solutions are developed and marketed directly to the customers or consumers, whereas other applications are tools for the attorneys at law firms. [[Lawbots.info]] has a catalogue of automated legal AI services that have been developed for the direct distribution to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; One notable legal AI solution for the law firms is [[ROSS Intelligence|ROSS]], which has been used by US law firms to assist in legal research,&lt;ref&gt;"ROSS Intelligence Lands Another Law Firm Client."

The papyrus fragments that show parts of the work were discovered by the Greek scholar [[Gregorios Bernardakis]] in the 19th century in a [[Mount Sinai]] convent.

The scroll is not the work of a single author, but of different authors at different times who are generally thought to be of Eastern origin. The literature suggests that the authors were connected to the [[Law School of Beirut]], they cite numerous works of Roman jurists, texts from imperial constitutions and also the ''[[Codex Gregorianus]]'', the ''[[Codex Hermogenianus]]'' and the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]],'' demonstrating knowledge and availability of legal texts of Roman law broader than that demonstrated by contemporary authors of the [[Western Roman Empire|western part]] of the empire.&lt;ref name="rec"&gt;{{cite book | title=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society | publisher=American Philosophical Society | year=1953 | isbn= 9780871694324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19116">The conception of the [[separation of powers]] has been applied to the United Kingdom and the nature of its [[executive (government)|executive]] ([[UK government]], [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]]), [[Judiciary|judicial]] ([[Judiciary of England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Judiciary of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]) and [[Legislature|legislative]] ([[UK Parliament]], [[Scottish Parliament]], [[National Assembly for Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]) functions. Historically, the apparent merger of the executive and the legislature, with a powerful [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]] drawn from the largest party in parliament and usually with a safe majority, led theorists to contend that the separation of powers is not applicable to the United Kingdom. However, in recent years it does seem to have been adopted as a necessary part of the [[UK constitution]].

The [[independence of the judiciary]] has never been questioned as a principle, although application is problematic. Personnel have been increasingly isolated from the other organs of government, no longer sitting in the [[House of Lords]] or in the [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]]. The court's ability to legislate through [[precedent]], its inability to question validly enacted law through [[legislative supremacy]] and [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], and the role of the [[European integration|Europe-wide institutions]] to legislate, execute and judge on matters also define the boundaries of the UK system.

==Approach==
Although the United Kingdom recognises [[parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], writers have stressed the importance of the [[independence of the judiciary]] in establishing the [[rule of law]], among them [[Trevor Allan (legal philosopher)|Trevor Allan]].&lt;ref name="ewing81"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the [[separation of powers]] has changed with the rise of judicial involvement in the affairs of government.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; [[Albert Venn Dicey]], writing in 1915 in ''[[Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution]]'', described the separation of powers as "the offspring of a double misconception".&lt;ref&gt;Dicey (1915). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Ivor Jennings|Sir Ivor Jennings]] has argued that it is of little relevance,&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;  and, faced with the role of the executive within the legislature, some authors describe only the independence of the judiciary as evidence that the model applies to the modern United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few critics of the applicability of the separation of powers to the United Kingdom question the basic division.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;
The separation of powers has come under the stress of increasing government intervention into social issues outside its former remit dominated by administration and foreign and military policy &amp;ndash; the creation of [[big government]].&lt;ref name="drewry191"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been seen by some as having led to a weakening of the concept of [[government]], replaced with the concept of governance.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} This lends itself to a more flexible approach considering the wide variation in the sorts of things that the "executive" does.&lt;ref name="drewry192"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach is to take an approach of [[public choice theory]]. The self-interest of political actors, under this theory, bridges the separate sections of government, drawing upon the approach of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] which applies the same rules to different organs, although heir approach to judges is separate.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt; Either theory would accept that there are wider decision making processes which are not restricted to a single branch of government.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). pp. 192&amp;ndash;193.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important idea is that variations within each separate part of government are as significant as differences in approach between branches, and require similar consideration.&lt;ref name="daintith12"&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Lord Mustill]] summarised the prevailing modern viewpoint in the 1995 judgment, ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union|R. v Home Secretary ex parte Fire Brigades Union]]'':&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union'' [1995] 2 AC 513 at 567.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a feature of the peculiarly UK conception of the separation of powers that Parliament, the executive and the courts each have their distinct and largely exclusive domain. Parliament has a legally unchallengeable right to make whatever laws it thinks right. The executive carries on the administration of the country in accordance with the powers conferred on it by law. The courts interpret the laws and see that they are obeyed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Division between organs of parliament==
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] creates law through the authority of the [[Queen-in-Parliament]], securing the support of at least the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and usually the [[House of Lords]] as well &amp;ndash; although since the passing act of the [[Parliament Act 1911]] this has not been necessary.&lt;ref name="ewing82"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the organs of the [[European Communities]] to legislate for the United Kingdom was recognised, by virtue of that Act. The power to create [[primary legislation]] has also been devolved to [[Scottish parliament|Scottish]] and [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh parliament]]s and to government ministers and local authorities to create [[secondary legislation]].&lt;ref name="ewing82"/&gt;

The executive comprises all official and public authorities (including [[local authorities]]) that govern the UK, from initiating and implementing legislation to the running of local and national services, such as [[waste collection|rubbish collection]]s and the [[police in the United Kingdom|police]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The civil service remains non-partisan (having little in common with the Cabinet and Prime Minister in that respect).&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive also exercises a number of powers under the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]], including [[foreign relations]]; many other actions are taken in the sovereign's name, from whom executive power is derived. The [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the  [[EU Commission|Commission]] of the [[European Union]] also exercise executive power, as do [[devolved government]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; Within the executive, there is no longer a clear elected&amp;ndash;non-elected divide: decision-makers are of both sorts since the widening of the government's remit.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the Civil Service serves the government, rather than usurping it, is one character of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judicial function determines the outcome of disputes and performs minor legislative and administrative functions. It oversees both public and private law through [[Civil court|civil]] and [[criminal court]]s and a variety of [[tribunal]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] has placed a requirement that courts take into account the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt;

The introduction of a tax is a [[legislature|legislative]] function; collecting tax is an [[executive (government)|executive]] and administrative function; settling tax disputes is a judicial function, as is [[judicial review]] of executive decisions.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; However, such an approach does not in itself enlighten what each role entails: the audit of public expenditure was a judicial function in the fourteenth century; an executive one in the eighteenth; and is now a legislative function. This is not in itself a measure of efficiency or good process, or what the function actually entails.&lt;ref name="daintith12"/&gt;

The separation of powers may require, depending on interpretation, that the membership of the three powers must be separate; that one of the three powers does not control the work of another; or that one organ of government should not exercise the powers of another. Keeping all three roles separate is seen as both theoretically and practically impossible.&lt;ref name="ewing87"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislature and executive==

The legislature and executive have a close relationship in the UK constitution. This led  [[Walter Bagehot]] to declare the "nearly complete fusion" of the roles in the nineteenth century. Other writers have stressed that the harmonisation of the legislature and executive does not preclude their distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; By convention, [[Minister (government)|government minister]]s are drawn from one of the two houses; the weight of democratic responsibility entails that most come from the House of Commons.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt; There is, however, a limit on their number.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; Most other members of the executive are excluded from holding legislative office, including the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]], the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces]], and the police, some of whom are prevented from becoming involved in any political affairs. The crossover in personnel is effectively limited to ministers.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; The Prime Minister wields considerable power on behalf of the executive, as party leader and chief spokesperson for government policy.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

When the government has a clear majority it wields a lot of power to push through legislation. A 1978 [[Select committee (Westminster system)|Select Committee]] report suggested:&lt;ref name="bradley88"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The balance of advantage between Parliament and Government is so weighted in favour of Government that it is inimical to the proper working of our parliamentary democracy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Between 1979 and 2010, the government had a safe majority which made the scrutiny of the government more difficult, although not impossible. The government could rely on its legislation being passed, although in some cases this did not happen.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt; The [[Conservative&amp;ndash;Liberal Democrat coalition]] complicated the party structure, since the [[leader of the Liberal Democrats]], [[Nick Clegg]], served as  [[Deputy Prime Minister]] under a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="drewry192"/&gt; However, the legislature can oust a government through a [[vote of no confidence]], as happened in [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|1979]].&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; This was driven by a growth in the political party structure, enforced through party discipline, as increased suffrage meant a far wider remit of government policy platforms.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

[[Secondary legislation]] &amp;ndash; where Parliament passes limited legislative rights to the executive through an [[Act of Parliament]] &amp;ndash; is also problematic, although necessary for the efficient working of government. Legal rules should be relatable to the Acts of Parliament on which they are based, but this is not always possible. Proper scrutiny of government actions under secondary legislation is needed to prevent abuse.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt;

==Executive and judiciary==
The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] remains an independent court, despite being organisationally part of the executive. The [[Lord Chancellor]], a member of the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinet]] is no longer a judge since the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].  The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] ([[England and Wales]]) and the [[Lord Advocate]] ([[Scottish law|Scotland]]) have "quasi-judicial roles" but are part of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 88&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of control, the [[independence of the judiciary]] is confirmed through statute, constitutional convention, and weight of opinion. In England and Wales, judges in [[superior courts]] cannot be arbitrarily dismissed by the executive, instead serving whilst in "good behaviour".&lt;ref name="ewing89"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in lower courts have similar protection from dismissal without due cause. Most members of tribunals cannot be dismissed by members of the government department of which they form part. This is important in cases of [[judicial review]] and other judicial methods of preventing government abuse of power.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt;

The judiciary undertake minor legislative functions in the form of court procedure, which, whilst the performance of a conflicting power, strengthens their independence. Tribunals are tied, but remain independent from, the executive. Government departments adjudicate on many decisions, and are required to take principles such as fairness and transparency into account in return.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; The courts provide only one method of dispute resolution, albeit one that is important where the government is one party and independence is necessary. The picture of which decision-making processes should be assigned to which body is complicated.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; There remain problems with the scope of role of the [[UK Home Secretary|Home Secretary]] in the [[penal system]] and judicial decisions with regard to sentencing.&lt;ref name="ewing90"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan LJ, in ''[[M v Home Office]]'', noted that:&lt;ref&gt;M v Home Office [1992] QB 270 at 314.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proper constitutional relationship of the executive with the courts is that the courts will respect all acts of the executive within its lawful province, and that the executive will respect all decisions of the courts as to what its lawful province is.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In matters such as Extradition of British nationals, courts must first consent and the [[Home Secretary]] must agree and sign an Extradition Order or the individual cannot be extradited. A recent example of this is autistic computer-hacker [[Gary McKinnon]] being extradited to the United States. The courts decreed that he could be extradited and that it would not harm him. However the [[Home Secretary]] announced that she refused to sign the order as she believed it would harm his life rights and could lead to him committing suicide.

==Judiciary and legislature==
The judges of the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] do not sit in the House of Lords. Until 2009, the judges appointed as [[Law Lords]] formed part of the House of Lords in Parliament. The creation of the Supreme Court ended confusion in name of both capacities. No [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] may hold a full-time position in the judiciary.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt;

The departure of the judiciary from the [[House of Lords]] has led to greater tension between the government, Parliament and the courts, as the senior judges are no longer able to amend and speak on Bills and Peers are no longer able to question the judges and thereby hold them to account.

The legislature retains the right to impeach members of the judiciary by agreement of both houses, but this has only happened once in three hundred years. There are restrictions on the criticism of judges in parliament.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; Courts are bound to interpret Acts of Parliament, even retrospectively, and [[legislative supremacy]] dictates that they cannot declare properly enacted law invalid. They are not bound by other resolutions of either house.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; The European Communities Act 1972 places a legislature-imposed requirement on the judiciary to follow European case law in relevant matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] allows the courts to make a [[declaration of incompatibility]], they cannot disapply legislation.&lt;ref name="ewing91"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each House of Parliament retains the right to punish offenders within its walls (including [[exclusive cognisance]]), with the potential to cause conflict.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt; However, ''[[R v Chaytor]]'' confirmed that right was limited in scope, and that it was the court that decided what that scope was.&lt;ref name="chaytor"&gt;''R v Chaytor''. [2010] [[UK Supreme Court|UKSC]] 52.&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered very unlikely that parliament would seek to protect those guilty of a crime unrelated to parliamentary business in this way.&lt;ref name="chaytor"/&gt; The courts have also exercised a quasi-legislative power through [[precedent]] &amp;ndash; for example, ending the [[marital rape]] exemption in ''[[R v R (Rape: marital exemption)]]''.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v R (Rape: marital exemption)'' [1992] 1 AC 599.&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular scope for the identification and application of personal liberties, and some cases have shaped the judiciary&amp;ndash;legislature relationship.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11570">The '''state of defence''' (in German: '''Verteidigungsfall''' or '''V-Fall''') is the constitutional [[state of emergency]] in Germany if the country is "under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115a Article 115a GG]&lt;/ref&gt; Established by a [[German Emergency Acts|constitutional amendment]] in 1968 during the [[Cold War]], this state of emergency gives the [[Politics of Germany|federal government]] extraordinary powers in wartime. It is laid down in the articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G13 115a to 115l] (title Xa) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]]. As of October 2018, Germany has never been in the state of defence.

==Declaration==
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115a 115a] of the German Constitution, the State of Defence shall be declared if "the federal territory [of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]] is under attack by armed force or imminently threatened with such an attack".

The normal procedure is that, upon request of the [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government]], the [[Bundestag]] determines that the conditions of the State of Defence exist. That means that the Bundestag does not actually declare the State of Defence; instead, it just decides whether it exists or not. (If, for example, a foreign army invaded Germany, the Bundestag would determine that the action is an "attack by armed force", as described in article 115a, and so Germany is in the State of Defence.) The determination requires at least two thirds of the votes of the Bundestag present at that time (at least half of the members being the [[quorum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/btgo_1980/__45.html section 45 of the Rules of Procedure of the German Bundestag] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;). It also has to be approved by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] with more than half of its members, which, according to general Bundesrat protocol, is given in bundled form by each Land.

If the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or not able to reach a quorum, the ''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee]]'' decides on their behalf.

If Germany is under attack by armed force and the Bundestag, the Bundesrat and the Joint Committee are not able to determine the State of Defence immediately, "the determination shall be deemed to have been made and promulgated at the time the attack began". If, for example, an invasion started on January 4 at 4:17&amp;nbsp;a.m., Germany would be in the State of Defence from that time, and the government could react immediately.)

==Consequences==
===Commander-in-chief===
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115b 115b] [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|GG]], the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Federal Chancellor]] becomes [[Commander-in-chief#Germany|Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Bundeswehr|armed forces]]. (Normally, the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]] holds that post.)

===Extension of federal legislative powers===
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115c 115c] GG, the federal government has extended legislative powers:

*The federal government may pass laws with respect to any matter even if it would normally be under exclusive legislative power of the [[Länder]].
*Temporary provisions concerning the compensation for [[expropriations]] may differ from [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P14 those] laid down in the constitution.
*A law may rule that people arrested by police may be held in custody for four days before being brought before a judge (instead of "no later than the day following his arrest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P104 article 104 GG]&lt;/ref&gt;) However, that applies only if no judge has been able to act in the normal time limit.
*Laws concerning financial matters may differ from the requirements laid down in the titles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G9 VIII], ''(The Execution of Federal Laws and the Federal Administration)'' [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G10 VIIIa] ''(Joint Tasks)'' and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G12 X] ''(Finance)'' of the constitution.

==Legislative procedure==
The normal legislative procedure is replaced by a faster one:
*According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115d 115d] GG, bills are discussed "without delay" and adopted by the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, in a single joint session.

===Joint Committee===
The ''[[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee]]'' (Gemeinsamer Ausschuss) consists of members of the [[Bundestag]] and members of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Two thirds of the committee members are provided by the Bundestag, one third provided by the Bundesrat. The committee members of the Bundestag are designated by the Bundestag "in proportion to the relative strength of the various parliamentary groups". Every Land is represented by a Bundesrat member. The committee members of the Bundestag must not be members of the Cabinet, and the committee members of the Bundesrat are exceptionally "not bound by instructions". There are thus 16 members of the Bundesrat (one for each Land), and 32 members of the Bundestag (twice the number of Bundesrat members), giving it a total number of 48 members. The members of the Joint Committee and their deputies are already designated during peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/plenum/gemeinsamer_ausschuss/mitglieder.html current members of the Joint Committee] (January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee takes over the tasks of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat if, during the State of Defence, it determines, with a two-thirds majority of its vote, that either the Bundestag or the Bundesrat is not able to convene in time or reach a [[quorum]]. That majority must include at least a majority of all committee members (at least 25 members). For example, if only 30 committee members could be reached, 20 votes would be a two-thirds majority, but at least 25 votes would be required for the determination. If the Joint Committee is not able to reach full strength (48 members), the Bundestag (in case of missing or dead Bundestag committee members) and/or the state governments (in case of missing or dead Bundesrat committee members) designate new committee members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gemausgo/__1.html section 1 of the Rules of Procedure of the Joint Committee] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee takes over any task normally dealt by the Bundestag and/or the Bundesrat. All decisions which would normally be made by the either the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat, or both of them, is made by the entire Joint Committee. However, there are some limitations to the power of the Joint Committee (when compared to Bundestag and Bundesrat):
*It may not amend, abrogate or suspend the constitution, in whole or in part.
*It may not enact laws pursuant to Articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P23 23] ''(European Union - Protection of basic rights - Principle of subsidiarity)'', [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P24 24] ''(Transfer of sovereign powers - System of collective security)'', or [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P29 29] ''(New delimitation of the federal territory)'' of the constitution.
*A [[constructive vote of no confidence]] by the Joint Committee requires a two-thirds majority (instead of just the majority of the votes needed for a vote of no confidence by the Bundestag).
*Laws enacted by the Joint Committee may be repealed at any time by the Bundestag, with the consent of the Bundesrat.

The Joint Committee is based on Articles [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0249 53a] ''(Composition - Rules of procedure)'' and [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0694 115e] ''(Joint Committee)'' of the constitution, as well as on own [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gemausgo/BJNR111020969.html rules of procedure].

===Use of Federal Border Guard===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115f 115f], paragraph (1), clause 1 GG, the Federal Government may employ the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|Federal Border Guard]] throughout the federal territory, everywhere in Germany. By law a [[Compulsory Border Guard Service]] is still in force, but will only be executed in the state of defence or if there are not enough volunteers joining the federal police.

When the Emergency Acts were passed, the Federal Border Guard was a [[paramilitary]] police force responsible only for the protection of [[West Germany]]'s external land and sea borders. Over the decades, however, the role of the Federal Border Guard and even its name have changed to [[Federal Police (Germany)|Federal Police]]. The Federal Police is also responsible for the security of the [[rail transport in Germany|railway network]], [[airport security]] and the protection of federal buildings. However, as the entire title [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000G13 Xa] has not been changed after it had been passed in 1968, the term ''Federal Border Guard'' is still used in the constitution.

===Extended powers of instruction===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115f 115f], paragraph (1), clause 2 GG, the federal government may issue instructions to state governments and state authorities. (Normally, state governments act on their own, and Land authorities receive their orders only from the Land government.)

===Extended electoral terms===
According to article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115h 115h] GG, electoral terms that would expire during the State of Defence are extended:
*The electoral term of the [[Bundestag]] or a [[Landtag#Modern legislatures|state parliament]] ends six months after the end of the State of Defence.
*The term of office of the [[President of Germany|President]] ends nine months after the end of the State of Defence.

===Conscription===
In 2011, the German Conscription Act was changed to abolish peacetime conscription. From July 1, conscripts may not be drafted except during a State of Tension or a State of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/wehrpflg/__2.html section 2 of the Conscription Act] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==
According to Article [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P115l 115l] GG, the State of Defence ends when it is ended by the Bundestag "if the conditions for determining it no longer exist", such as after a [[peace treaty]] is signed.

A '''term of office''' is the length of time a person serves in a particular [[elected office]]. In many jurisdictions there is a defined limit on how long terms of office may be before the officeholder must be subject to [[re-election]]. Some jurisdictions exercise [[term limits]], setting a maximum number of terms an individual may hold in a particular office.

==United Kingdom==
Being the origin of the [[Westminster system]], aspects of the [[United Kingdom]]'s system of government are replicated in many other countries.
===Monarch===
The [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|monarch]] serves as head of state until his or her death or [[abdication]].

===House of Commons===
{{seealso|House of Commons of the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] Members of Parliament (MPs) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] are elected for the duration of the parliament. Following [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolution]] of the Parliament, a [[General elections (UK)|general election]] is held which consists of simultaneous elections for all seats. For most MPs this means that their terms of office are identical to the duration of the Parliament, though an individual's term may be cut short by death or [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]]. An MP elected in a [[UK Parliamentary by-elections|by-election]] mid-way through a Parliament, regardless of how long they have occupied the seat, is not exempt from facing [[re-election]] at the next general election.

The [[Septennial Act 1715]] provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned; this maximum period was reduced to five years by the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. Prior to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] parliaments had no minimum duration. Parliaments could be dissolved early by the monarch at the [[Prime Minister]]'s request. Early dissolutions occurred when the make-up of Parliament made forming government impossible (as occurred in [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|1974]]), or, more commonly, when the incumbent government reasoned an early general election would improve their re-election chances (e.g. [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]]). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 mandated that Parliaments should last their full five years. Early dissolution is still possible, but under much more limited circumstances.

Because the [[government of the United Kingdom|government]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] are effectively [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] through the Commons, the terms of Parliaments and MPs do not directly apply to offices of government, though in practice these are affected by changes in Parliament. While, strictly speaking, a Prime Minister whose incumbency spans multiple Parliaments only serves one, unbroken, term of office, some writers may refer to the different Parliaments as separate terms.&lt;ref name="Thatcher 3terms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Thatcher|url=http://www.biography.com/people/margaret-thatcher-9504796|website=Biography.com|accessdate=5 February 2016|quote="During her three terms…"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Lords===
[[Hereditary peer]]s and [[life peers]] retain membership of the [[House of Lords]] for life, though members can resign or be expelled. [[Lords Spiritual]] hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. [[George Carey]], made ''Baron Carey of Clifton'' the day after he ceased being [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]).
===Devolved administrations===
The [[devolution|devolved administrations]] in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are variations on the system of government used at [[Westminster]].

The office of the leader of the devolved administrations has no numeric term limit imposed upon it. However, in the case of the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] there are fixed terms for which the [[legislatures]] can sit. This is imposed at four years. Elections may be held before this time but only if no administration can be formed, which has not happened yet.
===Other elected offices===
Offices of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] other regional elected officials follow similar rules to the national offices discussed above, with persons elected to fixed terms of a few years.

==United States==

===Federal===
{{main|Federal government of the United States}}
In the [[United States]], the [[president of the United States]] is elected indirectly through the [[United States Electoral College]] to a four-year term, with a [[term limit]] of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of ten years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1951.

The [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] serves four-year terms. [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] serve two-year terms. [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] serve six-year terms. 

[[Federal judges]] have different terms in office. [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article I judges]]; such as those that sit on the [[United States bankruptcy court]]s, [[United States Tax Court]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]], and certain other [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] and other forms of [[United States administrative law|adjudicative bodies]] serve limited terms: The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for 15 years, bankruptcy courts for 14. However, the majority of the federal judiciary; Article III judges, such as those of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], [[United States court of appeals|courts of appeal]], and [[United States district court|federal district courts]]; serve for life.

===State and territories===
{{main|State governments of the United States}}
The terms of office for officials in state governments varies according to the provisions of [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] and [[state law]].

The term for [[state governor]]s is four years in all states but [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]]; the [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont]] and [[Governor of New Hampshire|New Hampshire governors]] serve for two years.

The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] reported in January 2007 that among [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429232858/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/legismgt/about/numoflegis.htm]:
*44 states had terms of office for the [[lower house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state House of Representatives) at two years. Five ([[Alabama House of Representatives|Alabama]], [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]], [[Maryland House of Delegates|Maryland]], [[Mississippi House of Representatives|Mississippi]], and [[North Dakota House of Representatives|North Dakota]]) had terms of office at four years. (The [[Nebraska Legislature]] is an exception and has a [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] with members elected for four years.)
*37 states had terms of office for the [[upper house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state Senate) at four years. Twelve ([[Arizona Senate|Arizona]], [[Connecticut Senate|Connecticut]], [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia]], [[Idaho Senate|Idaho]], [[Maine Senate|Maine]], [[Massachusetts Senate|Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire Senate|New Hampshire]], [[New York State Senate|New York]], [[North Carolina Senate|North Carolina]], [[Rhode Island Senate|Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota Senate|South Dakota]], [[Vermont Senate|Vermont]]) had terms of office at two years.

Among [[territories of the United States]]:
*In the [[American Samoa Fono]], members of the [[American Samoa House of Representatives|House]] serve two-year terms while members of the [[American Samoa Senate|Senate]] serve six-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]] have four-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature]] have two-year terms.
*The [[Legislature of Guam]] and [[Legislature of the Virgin Islands]] are unicameral and Senators have two-year terms.

Members of [[Council of the District of Columbia]] serve a four-year term.

==Canada==
As a former British territory following the [[Westminster System]], there are many similarities with the United Kingdom, although with some variations based on local customs, the federal system of government and the absentee monarch.
===Monarch===
Being a [[Commonwealth realm]], Canada shares a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] with the United Kingdom and 14 other countries, who serves as head of state of all 16 realms until their death or abdication.

===Viceroys===
The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] is appointed by the monarch as his/her personal representative on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], and serves [[At Her Majesty's Pleasure|for an indefinite term]], though the normal convention is 5 years. Similarly, the [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]], who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial [[Premier (Canada)|premier]]), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|Commissioners]], who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]] (i.e. the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]]), and conventionally serve for about 5 years.

===House of Commons===
{{seealso|House of Commons of Canada}}

Similar to the United Kingdom, MPs serve for the duration of the Parliament. They may resign before the end of a Parliament or be elected in [[By-election|by-elections]] during the middle of a Parliament.

Under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], a Parliament may last for a maximum of 5 years from the most recent election before expiring, although all Parliaments to date have been dissolved before they could expire. Bill C-16, introduced in the [[39th Canadian Parliament|39th Parliament]], provided for fixed election dates every 4 years on the third Monday in October, beginning in 2009. However, the Prime Minister may still advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time. 

As in the United Kingdom, the cabinet and head of government are indirectly elected based on the composition of the House of Commons, they are not technically affected by the terms of legislators or Parliaments. In practice however, the terms of government office holders are affected by changes in the House of Commons, and those who serve for multiple consecutive Parliaments are generally considered to have served a single term. The term of a government generally ends when it is defeated on a confidence matter or the governing party fails to gain enough seats in a general election.

===Senate===

Senators are appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] to represent a province by the Governor General of Canada on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serve until the mandatory retirement age of 75. Senators appointed before the passage of the [[British North America Act, 1965]] served for life. Senators may also resign from office or be expelled from the Senate.

===Provincial and Territorial Legislatures===
{{seealso|Legislative assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories}}

Provincial legislatures and the legislature of the Yukon function very similarly to the federal House of Commons. MLAs (called MPPs in [[Ontario]], MNAs in [[Quebec]], and MHAs in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]) serve for the duration of the legislature, though they may resign before the legislature is dissolved or be elected in by-elections between general elections. The legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] operate using a [[Consensus government in Canada|consensus]] model, but are similar otherwise. The premiers and their cabinets are selected in the same way as in the House of Commons, and like at the federal level, the term of a provincial government can be ended by defeat in a general election or the loss of the legislature's confidence.

All provincial legislatures except that of [[Nova Scotia]] have fixed-term election legislation in place, as does the legislature of the Northwest Territories. Premiers may also advise Lieutenant Governors to dissolve legislatures at any time before the prescribed election date.

Numbers in years unless stated otherwise. Note that some countries where [[fixed-term election]]s are uncommon, the legislature is almost always dissolved earlier than its expiry date. "[[Life tenure|Until removed from office]]" refers to offices that don't have fixed terms; in these cases, the officeholder(s) may serve indefinitely until death, abdication, resignation, retirement, or forcible removal from office (such as [[impeachment]]).

In cases where the [[head of government]] is a different person from the head of state, its term of office is identical to the chamber that elected it (the legislature if it is unicameral, or most usually the [[lower house]] if it is bicameral), unless it doesn't survive a [[vote of no confidence]].

The case examines how the rescued survivors, who kill and eat one person in order to survive, should be treated by the law.]]

"'''The Case of the Speluncean Explorers'''" is an article by legal philosopher [[Lon L. Fuller]] first published in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1949. Largely taking the form of a fictional judgment, it presents a [[jurisprudence|legal philosophy]] puzzle to the reader and five possible solutions in the form of [[judicial opinion]]s that are attributed to judges sitting on the fictional "Supreme Court of Newgarth" in the year 4300.{{efn|Fuller addressed his decision to date his scenario in the [[fifth millennium]] in the article's postscript, writing that "the reader puzzled by the choice of date may wish to be reminded that the centuries which separate us from the year 4300 are roughly equal to those that have passed since the [[Fifth-century Athens|Age of Pericles]] [i.e. the fifth century]".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=645}} }}

The case involves five explorers who are caved in following a landslide. They learn via intermittent radio contact that, without food, they are likely to starve to death before they can be rescued. They decide to engage in [[cannibalism]], and select one of their number to be killed and eaten so that the others may survive. They decide who should be killed by throwing a pair of dice.  After the four survivors are rescued, they are charged and found guilty of the [[murder]] of the fifth explorer. If their appeal to the Supreme Court of Newgarth fails, they face a mandatory [[capital punishment|death sentence]]. Although the wording of the statute is clear and unambiguous, there is intense public pressure for the men to avoid facing the death penalty.

The article offers five possible judicial responses. Each differs in its reasoning and on whether the survivors should be found guilty of breaching the law.  Two judges affirm the convictions, emphasising the importance of the [[separation of powers]] and [[Plain meaning rule|literal approach]] to [[statutory interpretation]]. Two other judges overturn the convictions; one focuses on "common sense" and the popular will while the other uses arguments drawn from the [[natural law]] tradition, emphasizing the [[purposive approach]]. A fifth judge, who is unable to reach a conclusion, recuses himself.  As the Court's decision is a tie, the original convictions are upheld and the men are sentenced to death.

Fuller's account has been described as "a classic in [[jurisprudence]]"{{sfn|D'Amato|1980|p=467}} and "a microcosm of [the 20th] century's debates" in legal philosophy.{{sfn|Eskridge Jr.|1993|p=467}}  It allows for contrasts to be drawn between different legal philosophies, with the main two being [[natural law]] and [[legal positivism]].  In the 50 years following the article's publication, a further 25 hypothetical judgments were written by various authors whose perspectives include [[natural law]] theory, [[consequentialism]], plain meaning [[positivism]] or [[textualism]], purposivism, historical contextualism, realism, pragmatism, [[critical legal studies]], [[feminism]], [[critical race theory]], [[process theory]] and minimalism.{{sfn|Roederer|2003|p=388}}

==Synopsis==
===Facts===
The facts of the case are recounted in the first judicial opinion, which is given by Chief Justice Truepenny.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1851}}

Five cave explorers became trapped inside a cave following a landslide.  They have limited food supplies and no sources of nutrition inside the cave. Above ground, substantial resources are spent to rescue them, with 10 workmen killed in subsequent landslides near the blocked entrance. Radio contact is eventually established with the cavers on the 20th day of the cave-in, and the cavers learn that another 10 days would be required in order to free them. They then consult with medical experts, who inform them that they are unlikely to survive to the rescue given the likelihood of starvation.

[[File:Two red dice 01.svg|thumb|180px|left|In "the Case of the Speluncean Explorers", the person to be eaten was chosen by throwing a pair of dice. This method had also been suggested for choosing the victim in the similar real-life case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]''.]]

One of the cavers, Roger Whetmore, then asks on the cavers' behalf if the cavers could survive 10 days longer "if they consumed the flesh of one of their number". The medical experts reluctantly confirm this to be the case. Whetmore then asks if they should [[sortition|draw lots]] to select a person to be killed and eaten. No one outside the cave is willing to answer this question. Radio contact is subsequently lost.

Once the cave-in is cleared, it is discovered that only four cavers have survived; Roger Whetmore had been killed and eaten by the others. The survivors state that Whetmore had originally come up with the ideas of cannibalism and choosing the victim through random chance, offering a pair of [[dice]] in his possession.

Before the dice are cast, Whetmore allegedly expresses a wish to withdraw from the arrangement, preferring to wait another week "before embracing an expedient so frightful and odious". The others refuse to accept his change of mind, and cast the dice on his behalf. The survivors claim that Whetmore conceded that the dice were thrown fairly. He is subsequently killed and eaten.

Following their rescue and recovery, the survivors are charged with the murder of Whetmore. The relevant statute provides that "Whoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be punished by death", offering no exceptions which would be relevant to the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=1853}} The jury seek a [[special verdict]], so that they can make limited findings of fact without having to return a verdict on whether it constitutes murder. The cavers are ultimately convicted of murder.

The [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory sentence]] for murder in Newgarth is [[death by hanging]]. Both the trial judge and members of the jury petition the Chief Executive to [[Commutation of sentence|commute the sentence]] of the surviving spelunkers from the death penalty to six months' imprisonment. The Chief Executive refuses to act while the Supreme Court of Newgarth considers the appeal.

===Opinion of Chief Justice Truepenny===
The first opinion is largely [[Exposition (narrative)|expository]]; it is used to recount the facts of the case.  The Chief Justice states that the statute is unambiguous, with no applicable legal defences, so it must be applied by the court.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=619}}  He adds that granting mercy is a decision for the executive branch of government to make, rather than the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} However, the Chief Justice suggests that the judges of the court should add their names to the petition of the trial judge and jury requesting the Chief Executive to show mercy to the defendants. This would allow justice to be achieved "without impairing either the letter or spirit of our statutes and without offering any encouragement for the disregard of law".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}

===Opinion of Justice Foster===
{{Quote|text=I believe something more is on trial in this case than the fate of these unfortunate explorers; that is the law of our Commonwealth. If this Court declares that under our law these men have committed a crime, then our law is itself convicted in the tribunal of common sense, no matter what happens to the individuals involved in this petition of error. For us to assert that the law we uphold and expound compels us to a conclusion we are ashamed of, and from which we can only escape by appealing to a dispensation resting within the personal whim of the Executive, seems to me to amount to an admission that the law of this Commonwealth no longer pretends to incorporate justice.|sign=Justice Foster{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}}}}

The second opinion takes a different approach to the Chief Justice's.  In determining that the convictions should be overturned, Justice Foster makes two main points.  Firstly, the defendants were in a "[[state of nature]]" at the time of the killing, so the laws of nature applied to them. The laws of nature allowed to agree to sacrifice one person for the survival of the rest.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=620}} Secondly, assuming the laws of Newgarth did apply, a {{cfy|text=[[functional approach]]|date=March 2016}} should be used in applying the statute.  As its main purpose is deterrence, the judge concluded that, just as with a case of self-defence, the purpose of the statute would not be served by upholding the convictions.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=624}}

The judge counters potential objections of [[judicial activism]] by suggesting that although judges must obey the will of legislators, they must do so intelligently. He draws analogies to servants who need to "read between the lines" of their masters' instructions; strict literal compliance may not always be the actual intention.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=625}}  Thus the "correction of obvious legislative errors or oversights is not to supplant the legislative will, but to make that will effective."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}}

===Opinion of Justice Tatting===
In the third opinion, Justice Tatting is emotionally "torn between sympathy for [the defendants] and a feeling of abhorrence and disgust at the monstrous act they committed".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=626}} He ultimately finds himself unable to decide the case.

Justice Tatting disagrees strongly with Justice Foster's rationales in overturning the convictions. He criticizes the "state of nature" concept and is not satisfied with Justice Foster's formulation placing the law of contract above the law against murder.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=627–628}} He also notes the difficulty of applying the [[purposive approach]] to the criminal statute which has multiple purposes, including retribution and rehabilitation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=628–629}} He distinguishes the self-defence exception that was created by past judges on the basis that it is not a "willful" killing, so it does not contradict the wording of the statute.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=629}} He finds that the self-defence exception could not be applied to the present case as it would raise "a quagmire of hidden difficulties".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=630}} 

The judge cites the case of  ''Commonwealth v Valjean'',{{efn|This reference invokes [[Jean Valjean]], the protagonist in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel ''[[Les Misérables]]''. In the novel, Valjean is imprisoned after stealing bread to feed his sister's starving children.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=70–71}} }} in which starvation was held not to justify the theft of a loaf of bread, let alone homicide. These combined objections lead Justice Tatting to reject Justice Foster's reasoning as "intellectually unsound and approaching mere rationalization."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

Despite rejecting Justice Foster's reasoning, Justice Tatting cannot bring himself to reach the alternative view, that the defendants' convictions should be upheld. He states that "almost every consideration that bears on the decision of the case
is counterbalanced by an opposing consideration leading in the opposite direction."{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}} Concluding with a criticism of the prosecutor for deciding to bring the prosecution in the first place, the judge makes the "unprecedented" decision of withdrawing from the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=631}}

===Opinion of Justice Keen===
The fourth opinion begins by excluding [[executive clemency]] and the morality of the defendants' actions as relevant factors to the court's deliberations.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} Rather, the question before the court is purely one of applying the legislation of Newgarth and determining whether the defendants wilfully took the life of Whetmore. He criticizes the other judges for failing to distinguish the legal from the moral aspects of the case.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}} While he shares their preference that the defendants be spared from death, he respects the obligations of his office to put his "personal predilections" of what constitutes justice out of mind when interpreting and applying the law.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=632}}

Justice Keen objects vehemently to Justice Foster's purposive approach allowing the plain words of the law to be ignored.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=67}} He emphasizes that laws may have many possible purposes, with difficulties arising in divining the actual "purpose" of a piece of legislation.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}}

Justice Keen recalls that earlier instances of judicial activism in Newgarth had ultimately led to [[civil war]], which established the supremacy of the legislature over the judiciary.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=633}} He concludes by criticizing the courts' creation of the self-defence excuse, stating that waiting for the legislature to enact such revisions would have led to a stronger legal system.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}}

===Opinion of Justice Handy===
In contrast to the other judges, Justice Handy prefers to use a "pragmatic, common-sense approach", rather than abstract legal theories, to resolve the case.{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He criticizes his colleagues' "obscuring curtain of legalisms" when the case simply requires the application of "practical wisdom" of "human realities".{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=637}} He emphasizes the need for the courts to maintain public confidence, which requires them to follow the 90% majority in favour of applying a token punishment or releasing the defendants altogether.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}} He is prepared to use Justice Foster's purposive approach doctrine as the legal rationale.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=640}}{{sfn|Caron|Gely|2004|p=69}}

Justice Handy notes that apart from the ambivalent Justice Tatting, the other judges share the majority public opinion.  The judges voting to uphold the convictions simply differ from Justices Foster and Handy on whose role it is to spare the defendants from the death penalty.{{sfn|Fuller|1949|p=642}}

'''''Theory of Legal Norms''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Teoria della Norma Giuridica'') is a book, published in 1958, by the [[Italia]]n [[jurist]] [[Norberto Bobbio]] about one of the [[Ontology|ontological]] elements of [[philosophy of law|foundations of law]] &amp;mdash; the legal norm.

== Importance ==
Seen by scholars as an important work&lt;ref name="UNIN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FILIPPI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Filippi|first=Alberto|last2=Lafer|first2=Celso|title=A Presença de Bobbio|place=São Paulo|publisher=UNESP|year=2004|page=87|isbn=8571395713}}&lt;/ref&gt; in understanding of a conceptual constructivist approach of the [[scientific method|scientific way]] of thinking law in the new era of the [[jurisprudence of values]], Bobbio's book faces this challenge in six chapters.

== Chapters&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; ==
# Law as behavior rule: he shows three theories that lead, according to him, to a unique, non-paradoxical concept system: ''regulational'', ''intersubjective'' and ''institutional''.
# Discusses the two main schools of legal theory: [[legal positivism]] and theories of [[natural law]].
# Approaches the norm in its formal aspect, analyzing ''propositions'', ''prescriptions'', ''expressions'', ''imperatives'', ''commands'' and ''advices''.
# Discusses imperatives specifically, as well as their relationship with [[value judgement]]s, ''permissions'' and the addressees of a norm.
# ''Sanctions'' of norms (prescribed consequences of their violation); the necessity of sanctions to characterize a norm.
# Classifications of norms and the ''[[sine qua non]]'' character of ''[[generalization]]-[[abstraction]]''.

== Criticism ==
"In this book, Bobbio defends a ''positive'' philosophy committed to the scientific soul and against [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] points of view. Bobbio breaks from jusnaturalists tendencies, considering law as a speech to be submitted to the [[language]] analysis, inside the borderlines of a scientific theory, according to the paradigm of the [[logical positivism]]"&lt;ref name="SHV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pt.shvoong.com/law-and-politics/1708639-teoria-da-norma-jur%C3%ADdica/|title=Teoria da Norma Jurídica|date=19 November 2007|publisher=Shvoong - A Fonte Global de Resumos e Críticas|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bobbio presents his position about ''sanctions''. According to him, sanction is the response to violation of a law. Analyzing sanction under the point of view of efficacy, the relation between law and force appears. For [[Kelsen]], law exists to regulate force. For Bobbio, sanctions are means to obtain the ''desirable human behavior''. Bobbio emphasizes the positive sanctions (awards) in opposition to repressive ones."&lt;ref name="CIEH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cienciashumanas.com.br/resumo_artigo_7097/artigo_sobre_o_pensamento_jur%C3%8Ddico_de_norberto_bobbio|title=O Pensamento Jurídico de Norberto Bobbio|publisher=Ciências Humanas.coml.br|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In this book, Bobbio analyzes the ''law as rule of behavior'', showing a general view  and a criticism of the various theories that intend to reveal the concept of law, concluding that, although all the theories are integrated,  the normativist one prevails in sense of constituting pressuposed of validity for the other ones"&lt;ref name="UNIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.uninove.br/ojs/index.php/prisma/article/viewFile/513/492|title=Bobbio, Norberto.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22841">The [[United States Constitution]] has had influence internationally on later constitutions and legal thinking. Its influence appears in similarities of phrasing and borrowed passages in other constitutions, as  well as in the principles of the [[rule of law]], [[separation of powers]] and recognition of [[civil liberties|individual rights]]. The United American experience of amendments and [[judicial review]] motivated constitutionalism at times when they were considering the possibilities for their nation's future. Examples include [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the American Civil War, his contemporary and ally [[Benito Juárez]] of Mexico, and the second generation of 19th-century constitutional nationalists, [[José Rizal]] of the Philippines and [[Sun Yat-sen]] of China. However, democratizing countries often chose more centralized British or French models of government, particularly the [[Westminster system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terrill|first1=Richard J.|title=World Criminal Justice Systems: A Comparative Survey|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317228820|pages=20–27|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ3hCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the later half of the 20th century, the influence of the United States Constitution may be waning as other countries have revised their constitutions with new influences.

==National constitutions==
The historian [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]] argued that the United States saw itself as "one of a family of peoples and nations" making a history apart from the European civilization of their colonization.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

The United States Constitution is an expression of Americans diverging from colonial rule, according to this viewpoint. Its effect is reflected in the ideals of limiting the rulers of a state apart and above sitting law-givers in a [[parliament]]. The concepts of governance influencing others internationally are not only found among similarities in phrasing and entire passages from the U.S. Constitution. They are in the principles of the [[rule of law]] and recognition of individual rights. The American experience of fundamental law with amendments and [[judicial review]] has motivated foreign constitutionalists to reconsider possibilities for their own future.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}} This view informed [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]],{{refn| group=lower-alpha |"Secession was indeed unconstitutional...military resistance to secession was not only constitutional but also morally justified.{{sfn|Farber|2003|p=3}} "the ''primary'' purpose of the Constitution was … to create ‘a more perfect union’... the Constitution was an exercise in nation building.{{sfn|Farber|2003|p=198}}}} his contemporary and ally [[Benito Juarez]] of Mexico,{{refn| group=lower-alpha |Juarez regarded the United States as a model of republican democracy and consistently supported Abraham Lincoln.{{sfn|Stacy|2003|p=436}}}} and the second generation of 19th constitutional nationalists, [[José Rizal]] of the Philippines{{refn| group=lower-alpha |The institutions of the two countries which have most influenced constitutional development are Spain and the United States." One of the reforms, "sine quibus non", to use the words of Rizal and Mabini, always insisted upon by the Filipinos, was Philippine representation in the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish Cortez]], the promulgation in the Islands of the Spanish Constitution, and the complete assimilation equal to that of any in the Spanish provinces on the continent.{{sfn|Malcolm|1920|p=109}}}} and [[Sun Yat-sen]] of China.{{refn| group=lower-alpha |In the modern history of China, there were many revolutionaries who tried to seek the truth from the West in order to overthrow the feudal system of the [[Ching Dynasty]]. [[Sun Yat-sen]] for example was much influenced by American democracy, especially the U.S. Constitution.{{sfn|Qing Yu|1988|p=193}}}} The [[Australian Constitution]] which came into force in 1901 was strongly influenced by the US Constitution, while at the same time preserving Westminster traditions and the British monarchy. It adopted a federal system similar to the US, with a senate that represented the states. It also adopted the concepts of a formal separation of power and judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=George |last2=Brennan|first2=Sean|last3=Lynch|first3=Andrew|title=Blackshield and Williams Australian Constitutional Law and Theory |year=2014 |edition=6 |publisher=Federation Press |location=Leichhardt, NSW |isbn=978-1-86287-918-8| pages=77–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the influence of the Constitution appears in trans-national [[history of ideas]], foreign translations, and exchanges between Americans and their counterparts from the beginning with smuggled translations into [[Hispanic America]] until today with conferences among national legislators. Innovations include [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional conventions]], written constitutions, ratification and [[Constitutional amendment|amendment procedures]]. There are common provisions for presidential executives, [[federalism]] and judicial review.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

[[George Athan Billias]], studying the Constitution and related documents, describes six waves of influence:
# From 1776 to 1811, after the American Revolution began, it influenced northwestern Europe and its colonial connections.
# 1811–1848, after the decline of [[Napoleon]]'s reputation, it was referenced by Latin American, Caribbean, and European nationalists.
# 1898–1918, after the [[Spanish–American War]], nationalist movements borrowed from the U.S. Constitution in Asia and Latin America.
# 1918–1945, after World War I, its influence spread with movements for [[decolonization of Africa]], Mid-east and Asia.
# 1945–1974, after World War II, independence movements consulted it.
# 1974–1989, after [[United Nations]] expansion, once nondemocratic regimes, including European ones, transitioned towards constitutional democracies incorporating elements of the U.S. Constitution.{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

Over its history, the influence of American [[constitutionalism]] has waxed and waned. [[Democratization|Democratizing]] countries often chose the more centralized, consolidated British or French models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Arjomand|editor1-first=Saïd Amir|title=Constitutionalism and political reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004151745|pages=92–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYmmnYKEvE0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;ots=nOUN11pmfK&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author1=Julian Go|chapter=A Globalizing Constitutionalism?, Views from the Postcolony, 1945–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnston|first1=Douglas M.|last2=Reisman|first2=W.

Internationally it appears that those of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Islamic culture]]s do not readily adopt some of its premises. Nevertheless, "the influence of American constitutionalism abroad was profound in the past and remains a remarkable contribution to humankind's search for freedom under a system of laws."{{sfn|Billias|2009|loc=xi–xv}}

According to a 2012 study published in the ''[[New York University Law Review]]'', however, the influence of the U.S. Constitution may be waning. The study examined more than 700 federal constitutions from nearly 200 countries. "Rather than leading the way for global constitutionalism, the U.S. Constitution appears instead to be losing its appeal as a model for constitutional drafters elsewhere," the researchers write. "The idea of adopting a constitution may still trace its inspiration to the United States, but the manner in which constitutions are written increasingly does not."&lt;ref name=jr-diusc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/federalstate/decline-influence-united-states-constitution/ |title=The Declining Influence of the United States Constitution |date=April 9, 2013 |website=Journalist's Resource |publisher=[[Harvard Kennedy School of Government]] [[Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy]] |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=diusc&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Law |first1=David S. |last2=Versteeg |first2=Mila |year=2012 |title=The Declining Influence of the United States Constitution |journal=[[New York University Law Review]] |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=762–858 |ssrn=1923556}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the study found that the U.S. Constitution guarantees relatively few rights compared to the constitutions of other countries and contains less than half (26 of 60) of the provisions listed in the average bill of rights. It is also one of the few in the world today that still features the [[right to keep and bear arms]]; the only others are the constitutions of [[Guatemala]] and [[Mexico]]. Overall, the research suggests that the [[Constitution of Canada]], revised in 1982, is now a leading international model rather than that of the United States.&lt;ref name=jr-diusc /&gt;&lt;ref name=diusc /&gt;

In 1937 the U.S. Post Office released a commemorative stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution. The engraving shown on this issue is after [[commons:File:Washington Constitutional Convention 1787.jpg|an 1856 painting]] by [[Junius Brutus Stearns]] of Washington and shows delegates signing the Constitution at the 1787 Convention. George Washington is on dais with an open document in hand; James Madison sits at the table, taking his famous notes on the convention.

One commemorative of the 19th Amendment (permitting women the right to vote) was celebrated in a commemorative in 1950 and again in 1970. The woman is voting in a curtained mechanical voting booth. She chooses levers to punch or mark her votes on a paper roll. The Model T has a male driver with a banner "Votes for women" on the car, women riders and marchers as though in a parade.

The [[Second Polish Republic]] issued a commemorative of the U.S. and Polish Constitutions in 1938 under the government of Prime Minister, Major General [[Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski|Składkowski]] The stamp features George Washington in military regalia, holding a 48-star American flag and a drawn sword. Thomas Paine holds a book on a rod, and Kosciuszko poses with a cross and saber. The next scene shows a line of infantry flying a Polish flag. The right panel shows the Statue of Liberty imposed in front of the New York 1930s skyline.

In 1937 the [[Second Spanish Republic]] commemorated the 150th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, under the government of Prime Minister [[Juan Negrín]] of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE). The [[Statue of Liberty]] is the central focus, flanked by flags of Spain and the United States. The [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic Flag]] of red, yellow and purple, as battle flag or [[civil ensign]], lacks the [[Coat of arms of the Second Spanish Republic|coat of arms]].
