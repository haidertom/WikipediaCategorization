On 9 September 2011, several thousand protesters forcibly entered the Israeli embassy in [[Giza]], [[Greater Cairo]], after breaking down a recently constructed wall built to protect the compound.&lt;ref name=numprotest /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The return of calm in front of the embassy of Israel in Giza|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-671532|work=CNN iReport|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alabass|first=Bassem|title=Israeli workers in Egypt fly home in fear for safety|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/21049/Business/Economy/Israeli-workers-in-Egypt-fly-home-in-fear-for-own-.aspx|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters later broke into a police station and stole weapons, resulting in police using [[tear gas]] in an attempt to protect themselves. The demonstrators eventually broke through the security wall and entered the offices of the embassy. Six members of the embassy staff, who had been in a "[[safe room]]", were evacuated from the site by Egyptian [[commando]]s, following the personal intervention of United States President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=rescue&gt;{{cite news|last=Hadid|first=Diaa|title=Egypt commandos save 6 Israelis in embassy attack|url=https://news.yahoo.com/egypt-commandos-save-6-israelis-embassy-attack-190607978.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Dan|title=Israel lauds Obama's role in Cairo crisis|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL5E7KA0UV20110910|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama asks Egypt to protect Israeli embassy|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/obama-asks-egypt-protect-israeli-embassy|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{main|Egypt–Israel relations}}
[[File:Burning the Israeli flag at embassy in Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|On 15 May 2011, Egyptian protesters waved [[Palestinian flag]]s in front of the Israeli embassy in [[Giza]] as they burned a makeshift [[Israeli flag]].]]
During 2011, relations between Israel and Egypt deteriorated after the resignation of Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]], reaching their lowest point since peace was established between the nations by the [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|1979 Egypt&amp;ndash;Israel Peace Treaty]]. The Israeli-Egyptian border became a region of conflict and instability due to increased militant activity in Egypt's [[Sinai Peninsula]], and anti-Israeli sentiment was expressed in protests by masses of Egyptians in the streets of Giza.

On 18 August 2011, a squad of militants crossed the border from the Sinai Peninsula into southern Israel, [[2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks|killing eight Israelis]]. The ensuing Israeli counter-terrorist operations in close proximity to the border resulted in the deaths of "at least three" Egyptian soldiers.&lt;ref name=apology&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt says Israel apology of troop deaths is insufficient|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-08-21/world/israel.egypt.tensions_1_israel-and-egypt-egyptian-border-amos-gilad?_s=PM:WORLD|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers' deaths by Israeli fire{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} ignited protests at the Israeli Embassy in Giza. During a demonstration on 20 August 2011, an Egyptian protester climbed 20-feet up the building's facade to remove the [[Israeli flag]].

The Egyptian [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] considered recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Tel Aviv. Eventually, Israel publicly apologized for the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ehud Barak, Israel Defense Minister, Regrets Deaths Of Egyptian Troops|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/20/ehud-barak-egyptian-soldiers_n_932097.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel Apologizes For Deaths Of Egyptian Troops In Shootout With Militants|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/20/israel-apologizes-for-deaths-egyptian-troops-in-shootout-with-militants/|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=20 August 2011|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt stated that Israel's apology was "insufficient."&lt;ref name=apology /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt deems Israel's apology for policemen deaths 'insufficient'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/egypt-deems-israel-s-apology-for-policemen-deaths-insufficient-1.379797|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=Haaretz Daily Newspaper|date=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The attack ==
{{see also|Timeline of the 2011 Egyptian revolution under Supreme Council of the Armed Forces#September}}
On 9 September 2011, hundreds of Egyptian protesters began gathering outside of the Israeli embassy. Around 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, they began to assault a concrete security perimeter wall with hammers and a [[battering ram]]. Egyptian authorities had erected the wall following intense protests in August.

=== Building infiltration ===
At 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Saturday morning, several thousand protesters&lt;ref name="numprotest"/&gt; breached the security wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egyptians protest against military rule|url=http://aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/09/20119993150747146.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. they had entered the lobby and proceeded through the rest of the building. The demonstrators ransacked the embassy, located on the 20th and 21st floors of the building, and threw items including documents, some marked "[[confidential]]", from the windows of the building to the crowded street below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ali|first=Mostafa|title=The storming of Cairo's Israeli embassy: an eyewitness account (part I)|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentP/1/20856/Egypt/The-storming-of-Cairos-Israeli-embassy-an-eyewitne.aspx|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents were quickly scanned and publicly commented on.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Israel later revealed that the remaining Israeli security staff had been separated from the rioters only by the steel door of a safe room in which they had taken refuge.

In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and various other senior Israeli officials watched the events unfold from a direct feed from the surveillance cameras installed in the embassy.

Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor estimated that about 3,000 protesters were involved in destroying the security wall.&lt;ref name=alert /&gt; An Israeli diplomat condemned the attack as a "serious violation" of diplomatic behavior.&lt;ref name=envoy&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel pulls envoy after embassy attack|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/09/201191064219436657.html|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the protesters had infiltrated the embassy, United States Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] received a call from Israeli [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Minister of Defense]] [[Ehud Barak]] asking for help. The United States assisted in assuring the protection of the Israeli embassy personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ravid|first=Barak|title=U.S. told Egypt it must rescue Israeli embassy workers or suffer 'consequences,'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/u-s-told-egypt-it-must-rescue-israeli-embassy-workers-or-suffer-consequences-sources-say-1.383675|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=Haaretz Daily Newspaper|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Netanyahu later emphasized that he "would like to thank the US President Barack Obama for his help" in securing the lives of the Israeli embassy staff.&lt;ref name=envoy /&gt;

=== Rescue of embassy staff and end of the riots===
Six Israeli security staff who were on the premises hid inside a reinforced safe room. Egyptian commando forces entered the embassy building and rescued the six Israeli guards.&lt;ref name=rescue /&gt; All other embassy staff and their family members were escorted to [[Cairo International Airport]]. At 2:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., the Israeli ambassador and approximately 85 other Israeli diplomats and their family members arrived at the airport and were flown out of Egypt. Only the deputy Israeli ambassador remained in Egypt, staying at the United States embassy.&lt;ref name=stance /&gt; A senior Egyptian security official stated that the Egyptian commandos had been sent to the embassy after Israeli Ambassador [[Itzhak Levanon]] spoke on the phone with an anonymous member of [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|Egypt's ruling military council]], and asked him to arrange the safe evacuation of the embassy staff.&lt;ref name=rescue /&gt;

The demonstration and ransacking of the embassy building continued into the early morning hours as the protesters burned tires and set several police cars on fire. The Egyptian police eventually suppressed the riots and dispersed the thousands of rioters by using tear gas and firing warning shots into the air.&lt;ref name=alert /&gt;

Prime Minister Netanyahu and former [[Mossad]] director [[Efraim Halevy]] praised the actions of American president Obama in helping with the evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wexler|first=Robert|title=Defending Obama’s pro-Israel credentials|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=238954|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Following the attack on the embassy, the Egyptian army heightened the state of alert in the country and reinstated martial law, otherwise known as [[State of Emergency]], on a temporary basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt Declares Emergency After Attack on Israeli Embassy|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-10/egypt-declares-state-of-emergency-after-israeli-embassy-struck.html|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of Saturday, 10 September, Egypt's ruling military council rejected resignation requests that had been submitted by Egyptian Prime Minister [[Essam Sharaf]] and several Egyptian ministers. Their request was made because of the failure to handle the disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lina|first=Yang|title=Egypt's ruling military council rejects PM's resignation|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-09/10/c_131132013.htm|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day after the attacks on the embassy, a group of reporters were attacked by a crowd of people still lingering near the scene of the riots. A reporter and producer were knocked to the ground and trampled, but managed to get to a vehicle in which they retreated, with protesters throwing stones at them. They were able to flee the area without sustaining any major injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Ivan|title=Angry crowd turns on journalists reporting embassy attack in Egypt|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/09/10/egypt.journalists.targeted/|accessdate=30 April 2012|date=11 September 2011|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests===
In August 2012, an Egyptian court convicted 76 Egyptians who were linked to the attack on the Israeli embassy. 75 of those convicted received suspended one-year sentences, and one Egyptian, Omar Afifi who had fled abroad,&lt;ref name="Jpost convict"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=282646 | title=Egypt orders man to jail over Israel embassy attack | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | work=Reuters; The Jerusalem Post | date=August 26, 2012 | accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was tried in absentia was given a five-year prison term. Eight charges were listed by the court, including “an assault against diplomatic missions” and “sabotage.”&lt;ref name="TToI Convict"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-76-convicted-for-attack-on-israel-embassy/ | title=Egypt: 76 convicted for last year’s attack on Israeli Embassy | publisher=The Times of Israel | date=August 26, 2012 | accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some monarchies have weak or symbolic legislatures and other governmental bodies the monarch can alter or dissolve at will. Countries where monarchs still maintain absolute power are: [[Brunei]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Swaziland|Eswatini]], [[Vatican City]] and the individual emirates composing the [[United Arab Emirates]], which itself is a [[federation]] of such monarchies – a [[federal monarchy]].&lt;ref name="qat-abs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Qatar: regional backwater to global player|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20890765|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oman-abs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Elections to Oman's Consultative Council|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15288960|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cavendish78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swazi-abs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swaziland profile|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14095303|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vaticancity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/stato-e-governo/organi-dello-stato.html |title=State Departments |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vatican to Emirates, monarchs keep the reins in modern world|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-02/education/29495629_1_monarchy-absolute-power-head|publisher=Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and examples of absolute monarchies==

===Outside Europe===
In [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Pharaoh]] wielded absolute power over the country and was considered a [[thearch|living god]] by his people. In [[ancient Mesopotamia]], many rulers of [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Sumer]] were absolute monarchs as well. In ancient and medieval India, rulers of the [[Maurya]], [[Satavahana Dynasty|Satavahana]], [[Gupta]] and [[Chalukya]] Empires, as well as other major and minor empires, were considered absolute monarchs. In the [[Khmer Empire]], the kings were called "[[Devaraja]]" and "[[Chakravartin]]" (King of the world), and exercised absolute power over the empire and people. 

Throughout [[Imperial China]], many [[Emperor of China|emperors]] and [[Wu Zetian|one empress]] wielded absolute power through the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. In [[pre-Columbian America]], the [[Inca Empire]] was ruled by a [[Sapa Inca]], who was considered the son of [[Inti]], the sun god and absolute ruler over the people and nation. Korea under the [[Joseon dynasty]] and short-lived [[Korean Empire|empire]] was also an absolute monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWNNWVwaUpMC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=joseon+dynasty+absolute+monarchy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pvvg4ATlGS&amp;sig=Lvx9Jlla_3RNFvAKHtxn_42P98Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK_YPu9Y_XAhXDJCYKHT0dASsQ6AEIaDAM#v=onepage&amp;q=joseon+dynasty+absolute+monarchy&amp;f=false|title=Interior Space and Furniture of Joseon Upper-class Houses|first=Sang-hun|last=Choi|date=27 October 2017|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|via=Google Books|page=16|quote=Joseon was an absolute monarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ottoman Empire]], many sultans wielded absolute power through heavenly mandates reflected in their title, the "Shadow of God on Earth".

===Europe===
Throughout much of European history, the [[divine right of kings]] was the theological justification for absolute monarchy. Many European monarchs, such as those of [[Russia]], claimed [[Tsarist autocracy|supreme autocratic power]] by divine right, and that their subjects had no rights to limit their power. [[James I of England|James VI]] of [[Scotland]] (later also James I of [[England]]) and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] of Scotland and England tried to import this principle. Charles I's attempt to enforce [[episcopal polity]] on the [[Church of Scotland]] led to rebellion by the [[Covenanter]]s and the [[Bishops' Wars]], then fears that Charles I was attempting to establish absolutist government along European lines was a major cause of the [[English Civil War]], despite the fact that he did rule this way for 11 years starting in 1629, after dissolving the [[Parliament of England]] for a time. By the 19th century, the Divine Right was regarded as an obsolete theory in most countries in the [[Western world]], except in Russia where it was still given credence as the official justification for the Tsar's power until [[February Revolution]] in 1917.

There is a considerable variety of opinion by historians on the extent of absolutism among European monarchs. Some, such as [[Perry Anderson]], argue that quite a few monarchs achieved levels of absolutist control over their states, while historians such as Roger Mettam dispute the very concept of absolutism.&lt;ref&gt;Mettam, Roger.  ''Power and Faction in Louis XIV's France'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, historians who disagree with the appellation of ''absolutism'' argue that most monarchs labeled as ''absolutist'' exerted no greater power over their subjects than any other ''non-absolutist'' rulers, and these historians tend to emphasize the differences between the absolutist [[rhetoric]] of monarchs and the realities of the effective use of power by these absolute monarchs.  Renaissance historian William Bouwsma summed up this contradiction:
{{quote|Nothing so clearly indicates the limits of royal power as the fact that governments were perennially in financial trouble, unable to tap the wealth of those ablest to pay, and likely to stir up a costly revolt whenever they attempted to develop an adequate income.&lt;ref&gt;Bouwsma, William J., in Kimmel, Michael S. ''Absolutism and Its Discontents: State and Society in Seventeenth-Century France and England''.  New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books, 1988, 15&lt;/ref&gt;|William Bouwsma}}

{{See also|History of the Roman Empire}}

====France====
{{further information|Absolute monarchy in France}}
[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louis XIV of France]]]]
Though some historians{{who|date=October 2018}} doubt if he truly had, [[Louis XIV of France]] (1638&amp;ndash;1715) is often said to have proclaimed "L'état, c'est moi" ("I am the State!").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/topics/france/louis-xiv|title=Louis XIV|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often criticized for his extravagances, such as the [[Palace of Versailles]], he reigned over France for a long period, and some historians consider him a successful absolute monarch. More recently, revisionist historians{{who|date=October 2018}} have questioned whether Louis' reign should be considered 'absolute'{{Such as?|date=October 2018}}, given the reality of the balance of power between the monarch and the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Mettam, R. ''Power and Faction in Louis XIV's France'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=October 2018}}

The King of France concentrated in his person legislative, executive, and judicial powers. He was the supreme judicial authority. He could condemn men to death without the right of appeal. It was both his duty to punish offenses and stop them from being committed. From his judicial authority followed his power both to make laws and to annul them.&lt;ref&gt;Mousnier, R. ''The Institutions of France under the Absolute Monarchy, 1598-2012 V1.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his steps in creating an absolute monarchy in France was to build the Palace of Versailles, where he lived with many of his nobles and other important people, in order to control and watch over them.&lt;ref&gt;Holt World History. ''France in the Age of Absolutism'' Austin: Rinehart and Winston, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark–Norway====
Absolutism was underpinned by a written constitution for the first time in Europe in 1665 ''Kongeloven ("King's Law")'' of [[Denmark-Norway]], which ordered that the Monarch "shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danskekonger.dk/kilder/kongeloven |title=Kongeloven af 1665 |publisher=Danske konger |language=da |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330135036/http://danskekonger.dk/kilder/kongeloven |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A partial English translation of the law can be found in Ernst Ekman, "The Danish Royal Law of 1665" pp. 102-107 in: ''The Journal of Modern History'', 1957, vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the [[Rigsraad|Council of the Realm]].

====Prussia====
In [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], the concept of absolute monarch took a notable turn from the above with its emphasis on the monarch as the "first servant of the state", but it also echoed many of the important characteristics of Absolutism. [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] (r. 1640–1688), known as the Great Elector, used the uncertainties of the final stages of the [[Thirty Years' War]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} to consolidate his territories into the dominant kingdom in northern Germany, whilst increasing his power over his subjects. His actions largely originated the militaristic streak of the [[Hohenzollern]].

In 1653 the Diet of Brandenburg met for the last time and gave Frederick William the power to raise taxes without its consent, a strong indicator of absolutism. Frederick William enjoyed support from the nobles, who enabled the Great Elector to undermine the Diet and other representative assemblies. The leading families saw their future in cooperation with the central government and worked to establish absolutist power.

The most significant indicator of the nobles' success was the establishment of two tax rates – one for the cities and the other for the countryside &amp;ndash; to the great advantage of the latter, which the nobles ruled. The nobles served in the upper levels of the elector's army and bureaucracy, but they also won new prosperity for themselves. The support of the Elector enabled the imposition of serfdom and the consolidation of land holdings into vast estates which provided for their wealth.

They became known as [[Junker]]s (from the German for young lord, ''junger Herr''). Frederick William faced resistance from representative assemblies and long-independent cities in his realm. City leaders often revolted at the imposition of Electorate authority. The last notable effort was the uprising of the city of [[Königsberg]] which allied with the Estates General of Prussia to refuse to pay taxes. Frederick William crushed this revolt in 1662, by marching into the city with thousands of troops. A similar approach was used with the towns of Cleves.&lt;ref&gt;''The Western Experience'', Seventh Edition, Boston: [[McGraw-Hill]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russia====
Until 1905 the [[Tsar]]s of [[Russia]] governed as absolute monarchs. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I the Great]] reduced the power of the [[Boyar|Russian nobility]] and strengthened the central power of the Tsars, establishing a bureaucracy and a [[police state]]. This tradition of absolutism, known as [[Tsarist autocracy]], was expanded by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II the Great]] and her descendants. Although [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] made some reforms and established an independent judicial system, Russia did not have a representative assembly or a constitution until the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Revolution]]. However, the concept of absolutism was so ingrained in Russia that the [[Russian Constitution of 1906]] still described the Tsar as an autocrat. Russia became the last [[Europe]] a country (excluding [[Vatican City]]) to abolish absolutism, and it was the only one to do so as late as the 20th century (the [[Ottoman Empire]] drafted its first constitution in 1877).

====Sweden====
The form of government instituted in [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] under King [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] and passed on to his son, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] is commonly referred to as absolute monarchy; however, the Swedish monarch was never absolute in the sense that he wielded [[arbitrary power]]. The monarch still ruled under the law and could only legislate in agreement with the [[Riksdag of the Estates]]; rather, the absolutism introduced was the monarch's ability to run the government unfettered by the [[Privy Council of Sweden|privy council]], contrary to earlier practice. The absolute rule of Charles XI was instituted by the crown and the Riksdag in order to carry out the [[Reduction (Sweden)|Great Reduction]] which would have been made impossible by the privy council which comprised the high nobility. After the death of Charles XII in 1718, the system of absolute rule was largely blamed for the ruination of the realm in the [[Great Northern War]], and the reaction tipped the balance of power to the other extreme end of the spectrum, ushering in the [[Age of Liberty]]. After half a century of largely unrestricted parliamentary rule proved just as ruinous, King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] seized back royal power in the coup d'état of 1772, and later once again abolished the privy council under the [[Union and Security Act]] in 1789, which, in turn, was rendered void in 1809 when [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]] was deposed in a coup and the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|constitution of 1809]] was put in its place. The years between 1789 and 1809, then, are also referred to as a period of absolute monarchy.

==Contemporary monarchies==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
The popularity of the notion of absolute monarchy declined substantially after the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]], which promoted theories of government based on [[popular sovereignty]].

Many nations formerly with absolute monarchies, such as [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Morocco]], have moved towards [[constitutional monarchy]], although in some cases the monarch retains tremendous power, to the point that the parliament's influence on political life is negligible.

In [[Bhutan]], the government moved from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy following planned parliamentary elections to the [[Tshogdu]] in 2003, and the [[Bhutanese National Assembly election, 2008|election of a National Assembly in 2008]]. [[Nepal]] had several swings between constitutional rule and direct rule related to the [[Nepalese Civil War]], the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Maoist insurgency]], and the 2001 [[Nepalese royal massacre]], with the Nepalese monarchy being abolished on May 28, 2008. In [[Tonga]], the [[King of Tonga|King]] had majority control of the [[Legislative Assembly of Tonga|Legislative Assembly]] until 2010.

On the other hand, [[Liechtenstein]] has moved towards expanding the power of the monarch: the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] was given expanded powers after a [[Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003|referendum]] amending the [[Constitution of Liechtenstein]] in 2003, which led the BBC to describe the prince as an "absolute monarch again".&lt;ref name="Liechtenstein"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2853991.stm |title=Liechtenstein prince wins powers |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2015-10-26 |date=2003-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|ruling Kim family]] of [[North Korea]] ([[Kim Il-sung]], [[Kim Jong-il]] and [[Kim Jong-un]]) has been described as a ''de facto'' absolute monarchy&lt;ref&gt;Young W. Kihl, Hong Nack Kim. ''North Korea: The Politics of Regime Survival''. Armonk, New York, USA: M. E. Sharpe, Inc., 2006. Pp 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Scalapino, Chong-Sik Lee.

{{Main article|Politics of Saudi Arabia}}

Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy, and according to the [[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia]] adopted by royal decree in 1992, the king must comply with [[Shari'a]] (Islamic law) and the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=Cavendish78&gt;{{cite book |title=World and Its Peoples: the Arabian Peninsula |last=Cavendish |first=Marshall |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an and the corpus of [[Sunnah]] (traditions of the Islamic [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]], [[Muhammad]]) are declared to be the Kingdom's constitution, but no written modern constitution has ever been written for Saudi Arabia, which remains one of two Arab nations where no national elections have ever taken place since its founding, with the other being Qatar.&lt;ref name= Gerhard&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of world constitutions, Volume 1 |last=Robbers |first=Gerhard |year=2007 |isbn=0-8160-6078-9 |page=791}}&lt;/ref&gt; No political parties or national elections are permitted and according to ''[[The Economist]]'s'' 2010 [[Democracy Index]], the Saudi government is the seventh most authoritarian regime from among the 167 countries rated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy_Index_2010_web.pdf |title=The Economist Democracy Index 2010 |author=The Economist Intelligence Unit |work=The Economist |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cavendish78/&gt;

==Scholarship==
[[Anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[ethology]] as well as various other disciplines such as [[political science]] attempt to explain the rise of absolute monarchy ranging from extrapolation generally, to certain [[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon|Marxist explanations]] in terms of the [[class struggle]] as the underlying dynamic of human historical development generally and absolute monarchy in particular.

In the 17th century, French legal theorist [[Jean Domat]] defended the concept of absolute monarchy in works such as ''"On Social Order and Absolute Monarchy"'', citing absolute monarchy as preserving natural [[Orderliness|order]] as [[God]] intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://symposium.cornellcollege.edu/2009/04/18/jean-domat-on-defense-of-absolute-monarchy/|title=Jean Domat: On Defense of Absolute Monarchy - Cornell College Student Symposium|date=18 April 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''affair''' is a [[sexual relationship]], [[romantic friendship]], or [[Passion (emotion)|passionate attachment]] between two people without the attached person's [[significant other]] knowing.

==Romantic affair==
[[File:Jean-Honoré Fragonard - The Stolen Kiss.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Stolen Kiss (Fragonard)|The Stolen Kiss]]'' by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]]]
A romantic affair, also called an affair of the heart, may refer to sexual liaisons among unwed or wedded parties, or to various forms of [[forms of nonmonogamy|nonmonogamy]]. Unlike a [[casual relationship]], which is a physical and emotional relationship between two people who may [[having sex|have sex]] without expecting a more formal romantic relationship, an affair is by its nature romantic.
Affair may also describe part of an agreement within an [[open marriage|open marriage or open relationship]], such as [[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinging]], [[dating]], or [[polyamory]], in which some forms of [[extramarital sex|sex with one's non-primary partner(s)]] are permitted and other forms are not. Participants in open relationships, including unmarried couples and polyamorous families, may consider sanctioned affairs the norm, but when a non-sanctioned affair occurs, it is described as [[infidelity]] and may be experienced as [[adultery]], or a [[betrayal]] both of [[trust (sociology)|trust]] and [[integrity]], even though to most people it would not be considered "illicit".

When a romantic affair lacks both overt and covert sexual behavior and yet exhibits intense or enduring emotional intimacy it may be referred to as an emotional affair, platonic love, or a romantic friendship.

=={{anchor|extramarital affair}} Extramarital affair==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Tess]], from [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and from [[Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti]]--&gt;
{{main|Infidelity|Legitimacy (family law)|Adultery|Extramarital sex}}
Extramarital affairs are relationships outside of [[marriage]] where an illicit [[romantic love|romantic]] or [[human sexuality|sexual]] relationship or a [[romantic friendship]] or [[passion (emotion)|passion]]ate attachment occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extramarital|title=Definition of EXTRAMARITAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Affair that continues in one form or another for years, even as one of the partners to that affair passes through marriage, divorce and remarriage, could be considered the primary relationship and the marriages secondary to it. Several people claim the reason of extra marital affair as their unsuccessful marriage and that both spouses failed to please each other. This may be serial polygamy or other [[forms of nonmonogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strean|first1=Herbert S.|title=The Extramarital Affair|date=1980|publisher=Free Press|accessdate=18 November 2015|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Extramarital_Affair.html?id=iDnWSAfBnnUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to pursue serial and clandestine extramarital affairs while safeguarding other secrets and [[conflict of interest]] inherent in the practice, requires skill in [[deception]] and duplicitous [[negotiation (process)|negotiation]]. Even to hide one affair requires a degree of skill or malicious [[gaslighting]]. All these behaviors are more usually called [[lie|lying]].{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

Deception can be defined as the "[[covert]] manipulation of perception to alter thoughts, feelings, or beliefs". The presence of deception may indicate the degree to which the deceiver has breached fundamental conditions of [[fidelity]], of reciprocal [[vulnerability]] and of [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]]. Sometimes these are explicit or assumed pre-conditions of a committed [[intimacy|intimate]] relationship.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}

Individuals having affairs with married men or women can be prosecuted for adultery in some jurisdictions and can be sued by the jilted spouses in others,&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/hate-the-husband-sue-the_b_311419.html |title=Hate the Husband? Sue the Mistress! |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2009-10-07|accessdate=2010-03-01 |first=Jacob M. |last=Appel}}&lt;/ref&gt; or named as 'co-respondent' in divorce proceedings. As of 2009, eight U.S.&amp;nbsp;states permitted such [[alienation of affections]] lawsuits.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt;

==Online affair==
The appearance of [[computer-mediated communication]] introduces a new type of communication and consequently a new type of "affair". There are various kinds of computer-mediated communication that differ in some significant aspects: one-to-one or group communication formats, interrelating with anonymous or identified people, and communicating in synchronous or asynchronous formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ze'ev|title=Flirting On and Offline|journal=International Journal of Research in to New Media Technologies|year=2004|volume=10|issue=24|url=http://con.sagepub.com/content/10/1/24.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online affairs combine features of close and remote relationships. 

Ben Ze'ef argues that an online affair is a unique kind of affair—termed "detached attachment", or just "detachment"—that includes opposing features whose presence in a face-to-face affair would be paradoxical. Like direct, face-to-face affairs, online affairs can be spontaneous and casual and show intensive personal involvement. However, online affairs can also be more of a planned discourse than spontaneous talk; like written letters, online messages can be stored and thus have permanent presence, which is absent from face-to-face affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lea &amp; Spears|title=Love at first Byte|journal=Understudied Relationships|year=1995|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

People participating in online affairs may be strangers to each other in the sense that they have never actually met each other. However, they are also close to each other since they share intimate information. In online affairs, people try to enjoy the benefits of both close and remote affairs, while avoiding their flaws. People enjoy the highly valued products of close affairs while paying the low cost of remote affairs. As one woman wrote: 'He constantly told me that he can not provide me with what I would want and I would always respond with: "I'm not asking anything from you, but simply enjoy your company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cyberlove101.com, story 39|title=An Enchanting Belgian gentleman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birthplace==
According to government records, Fujimori was born on 28 July 1938, in [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores]], a district of [[Lima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Champion|first=Margaret Y.|title=Peru and the Peruvians in the Twentieth Century: Politics and Prospects |year= 2006|publisher=Vantage Press|location=New York|page=476|isbn=0-533-15159-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Naoichi Fujimori (original surname ''Minami'', adopted by a childless relative; 1897–1971) and Mutsue Inomoto Fujimori (1913–2009), were natives of [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]], Japan, who migrated to Peru in 1934.&lt;ref name= "McClintockVallas50"&gt;{{Cite book |last=McClintock |first=Cynthia |author2=Fabián Vallas |title=The United States and Peru |year=2002 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |page=50 |isbn=0-415-93463-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=González Manrique |first= Luis Esteban|title=La encrucijada peruana: de Alan García a Fujimori|year=1993|publisher=Fundación CEDEAL|location= Madrid |page= 467|isbn=84-87258-38-7|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1997, the news magazine ''[[Caretas]]'' alleged that Fujimori had actually been born in Japan, in his father's hometown of [[Kawachi, Kumamoto|Kawachi]], [[Kumamoto Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="Caretas"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Valenzuela|first=Cecilia|title=Buscando La Cuna De Fujimori|url=http://www.caretas.com.pe/1475/fujimori/fujimori.htm |work=[[Caretas]]|year=1997|issue=1475|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Peru's constitution requires the president to have been born in Peru, this would have made Fujimori ineligible to be president.&lt;ref name="McClintockVallas50"/&gt; The magazine, which had been sued for libel by [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] seven years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dartnell|first=Michael York|title=Insurgency Online: Web Activism and Global Conflict|year=2006|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|page=77|isbn=0-8020-8747-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that Fujimori's birth and baptismal certificates might have been altered.&lt;ref name="Caretas"/&gt; ''Caretas'' also alleged that Fujimori's mother declared having two children when she entered Peru;&lt;ref name="Caretas"/&gt; Fujimori is the second of four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= |first= |title=Fujimori's documents raise fresh controversy |url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19970727/20850523.html |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=27 July 1997 |accessdate=7 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108231520/http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19970727/20850523.html |archivedate=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caretas''{{'}} contentions were hotly contested in the Peruvian media; the magazine ''Sí'', for instance, described the allegations as "pathetic" and "a dark page for [Peruvian] journalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Waisbord|first=Silvio Ricardo|title=Watchdog Journalism in South America|year=2000|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York|page=83|isbn=0-231-11975-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin American scholars [[Cynthia McClintock]] and Fabián Vallas note that the issue appeared to have died down among Peruvians after the Japanese government announced in 2000 that "Fujimori's parents had registered his birth in the Japanese consulate in Lima".&lt;ref name="McClintockVallas50"/&gt;

==Early years==
Fujimori obtained his early education at the Colegio Nuestra Señora de la Merced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Prieto Celi|first=Federico|title=Rescate en Lima|year=1997|publisher=Realidades S.A|location=Lima|isbn=|oclc=37997948|page=32|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and La Rectora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jochamowitz|first=Luis|title=Ciudadano Fujimori: la construcción de un político|year = 1994 |edition=2nd|publisher=PEISA|location=Lima|isbn=|oclc=31847656|page=87|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujimori's parents were Buddhists, but he was baptised and raised as a Roman Catholic. While he spoke mainly Japanese at home, Fujimori also learned to become a proficient Spanish speaker during his years at school.&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Wilson Company (1996), p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Fujimori graduated from La gran unidad escolar Alfonso Ugarte in Lima.&lt;ref&gt;Jochamowitz, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to undergraduate studies at the [[La Molina National Agrarian University|Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina]] in 1957, graduating in 1961 first in his class as an [[Agricultural engineering|agricultural engineer]]. The following year he lectured on [[mathematics]] at the university. In 1964 he went to study [[physics]] at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in France. On a Ford scholarship, Fujimori also attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rochester.edu/undergraduate/sums/aftermath/famouspeople.html Famous people major in Mathematics], University of Rochester website. Retrieved on 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States, where he obtained his master's degree in mathematics in 1969. 

In 1974, he married [[Susana Higuchi]], also Japanese-Peruvian. They had four children, including a daughter, [[Keiko Fujimori|Keiko]], and a son, [[Kenji Fujimori|Kenji]], who would later follow their father into politics. 

In recognition of his academic achievements, the sciences faculty of the Universidad Nacional Agraria offered Fujimori the [[Dean (education)|deanship]] and in 1984 appointed him to the [[Rector (academia)|rector]]ship of the university, which he held until 1989. In 1987, Fujimori also became president of the National Commission of Peruvian University Rectors (Asamblea Nacional de Rectores), a position which he has held twice. He also hosted a TV show called ''"Concertando"'' from 1988 to 1989, on Peru's state-owned network, [[TV Perú|Channel 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alberto-Fujimori|title=Alberto Fujimori|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|date=27 December 2017|accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori won the 1990 presidential election as a [[dark horse]] candidate under the banner of  [[Cambio 90]] ("cambio" means "change") beating world-renowned writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] in a surprising upset. He capitalized on profound disenchantment with outgoing president [[Alan García]] and the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] party (APRA). He exploited popular distrust of Vargas Llosa's identification with the existing Peruvian political establishment, and uncertainty about his plans for [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/154825/la-frugalidad-de-cambio-90-y-el-derroche-de-fredemo|title=La frugalidad de "Cambio 90" y el derroche de Fredemo|date=14 April 1990|publisher=El Proceso|language=es|accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign, Fujimori was nicknamed ''El Chino'', which roughly translates to "[[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]]"; it is common for people of any East Asian descent to be called ''chino'' in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, both derogatively and affectionately. Although he is of Japanese heritage, Fujimori has suggested that he was always gladdened by the term, which he perceived as a term of affection.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Fujimori, in Ellen Perry's ''The Fall of Fujimori''&lt;/ref&gt; With his election victory, he became just the second person of [[East Asia]]n descent to become [[head of government]] of a Latin American nation, after [[Fulgencio Batista]] of Cuba and the third of East Asian descent to govern a South American state, after [[Arthur Chung]] of [[Guyana]] and [[Henk Chin A Sen]] of [[Suriname]] (each of whom had served as [[head of state]], rather than head of government).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mMY4-ffumwUC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=fujimori+%22Arthur+Chung%22+%22Henk+Chin+A+Sen+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BY2VdGPRv6&amp;sig=6t6zbibMxRX2jS8ZcFnov9Bzr0E&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmvc2EhqvYAhUI9IMKHSbLDLsQ6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=fujimori%20%22Arthur%20Chung%22%20%22Henk%20Chin%20A%20Sen%20%22&amp;f=false|title=The Affinity of the Eye: Writing Nikkei in Peru|author=Ignacio López-Calvo|date=2013|accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First term==

===Fujishock===
During his first term in office, Fujimori enacted wide-ranging neoliberal reforms, known as Fujishock. During the presidency of [[Alan García]], the economy had entered a period of [[hyperinflation]] and the political system was in crisis due to the country's internal conflict, leaving Peru in "economic and political chaos".&lt;ref name=lp&gt;Benson, Sara and Hellander, Paul and Wlodarski, Rafael. ''[[Lonely Planet]]: Peru''. 2007, pages 37–8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Fujimori's stated objective to pacify the nation and restore economic balance. This program bore little resemblance to his campaign platform and was in fact more drastic than anything Vargas Llosa had proposed.&lt;ref name=gouge3&gt;Gouge, Thomas. ''Exodus from Capitalism: The End of Inflation and Debt''. 2003, page 363.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the ''Fujishock'' succeeded in restoring Peru to the global economy, though not without immediate social cost.&lt;ref name=manz&gt;Manzetti, Luigi. ''Privatization South American Style''. 1999, page 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori's initiative relaxed [[private sector]] [[price controls]], drastically reduced government [[subsidies]] and government employment, eliminated all [[exchange controls]], and also reduced restrictions on investment, imports, and [[capital (economics)|capital]].&lt;ref name=manz /&gt; [[Tariff]]s were radically simplified, the [[minimum wage]] was immediately quadrupled, and the government established a $400 million poverty relief fund.&lt;ref name=manz /&gt; The latter seemed to anticipate the economic agony to come: the price of electricity quintupled, water prices rose eightfold, and gasoline [[price]]s 3,000%.&lt;ref name=gouge3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=manz /&gt;

However, many do not attribute the Fujishock to Fujimori. In the 1980s, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] created a plan for South American economies called the [[Washington Consensus]]. The document, written by [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]] in 1990, consists of ten measures that would lead to a healthy economic policy. Under pressure from the [[International Monetary Fund]]  (IMF), the Peruvian government was to follow the guidelines set by the international finance community. The ten points were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/williamson0904-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

# Fiscal discipline
# Reordering of public expenditure
# Tax reform (Broadening)
# Liberalization of interest rates
# Competitive exchange rate
# Trade liberalization
# Liberalization of foreign direct investment
# Privatization
# Deregulation of barrier entry and exit, safety regulations, and governed prices
# Property rights for the informal sector

The IMF was content with Peru's measures, and guaranteed loan funding for Peru.&lt;ref name=gouge&gt;Gouge, Thomas. ''Exodus from Capitalism: The End of Inflation and Debt''. 2003, page 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Inflation rapidly began to fall and foreign investment capital flooded in.&lt;ref name=gouge /&gt; The [[privatization]] campaign involved selling off of hundreds of state-owned enterprises, and replacing the country's troubled currency, the [[Peruvian inti|inti]], with the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|Nuevo Sol]].&lt;ref name=lp /&gt; The ''Fujishock'' restored [[macroeconomic]] stability to the economy and triggered a considerable long-term economic upturn in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Carol Stokes, Susan. ''Public Support for Market Reforms in New Democracies''. 2001, page 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Peruvian economy grew at a rate of 13%, faster than any other economy in the world.&lt;ref name=cs /&gt;

===Constitutional crisis===
{{Main|1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis}}

During Fujimori's first term in office, APRA and Vargas Llosa's party, the [[Democratic Front (Peru)|FREDEMO]], remained in control of both chambers of Congress, the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Senate]], hampering the enactment of economic reform. Fujimori also had difficulty combatting the [[Maoism|Maoist]] [[Shining Path]] ({{lang-es|Sendero Luminoso}}) guerrilla organization due largely to what he perceived as intransigence and obstructionism in Congress. By March 1992, Congress met with the approval of only 17% of the electorate, according to one poll; the president's approval rate stood at 42%, in the same poll.&lt;ref name=smith234&gt;Smith, Peter H. ''Latin America in Comparative Perspective: New Approaches to Methods and Analysis''. 1995, page 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[1992 Peruvian constitutional crisis|political deadlock]], Fujimori, with the support of the military, on 5 April 1992, carried out a [[self-coup|presidential coup]].&lt;ref&gt;

The coup was welcomed by the public, according to numerous polls.&lt;ref name=smith236&gt;Smith, Peter H. ''Latin America in Comparative Perspective: New Approaches to Methods and Analysis''. 1995, page 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was the coup itself marked by favorable public opinion in several independent polls, but also public approval of the Fujimori administration jumped significantly in the wake of the coup.&lt;ref name=smith236 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Levitt&gt;

Fujimori's coup was immediately met with near-unanimous condemnation from the international community.&lt;ref name=smith236 /&gt; The [[Organization of American States]] denounced the coup and demanded a return to "[[representative democracy]]",&lt;ref name= smith238&gt;Smith, Peter H.

{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations between the OAS, the government, and opposition groups led Albert Fujimori initially to propose a referendum to ratify the auto-coup, but the OAS rejected this. Fujimori then proposed scheduling elections for a Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), which would draft a new constitution to be ratified by a national referendum. Despite a lack of consensus among political forces in Peru regarding this proposal, an ''ad hoc'' OAS meeting of ministers nevertheless endorsed this scenario in mid-May. Elections for the CCD were held 22 November 1992.&lt;ref name=Levitt /&gt;

Various states individually condemned the coup. [[Venezuela]] broke off diplomatic relations, and [[Argentina]] withdrew its ambassador. [[Chile]] joined [[Argentina]] in requesting Peru's suspension from the [[Organization of American States]]. International lenders delayed planned or projected loans, and the United States, Germany and Spain suspended all non-humanitarian aid to Peru. The coup appeared to threaten the reinsertion strategy for economic recovery, and complicated the process of clearing Peru's arrears with the [[International Monetary Fund]].

Peruvian–U.S. relations earlier in Fujimori's presidency had been dominated by questions of [[coca eradication]] and Fujimori's initial reluctance to sign an accord to increase his military's eradication efforts in the lowlands. Fujimori's ''autogolpe'' became a major obstacle to relations, as the United States immediately suspended all military and economic aid, with exceptions for counter-narcotic and humanitarian funds.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after the self-coup, however, the [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] administration changed its position and officially recognized Fujimori as the legitimate leader of Peru, partly because he was willing to implement economic austerity measures, but also because of his adamant opposition to the Shining Path.&lt;ref&gt;

===Post-coup period===
With FREDEMO dissolved and APRA leader [[Alan García]] exiled to [[Colombia]], Fujimori sought to legitimize his position. He called elections for a [[Democratic Constitutional Congress]], to serve as a legislature and a [[constituent assembly]]. The [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] and [[Popular Action (Peru)|Popular Action]] attempted a boycott of this election, but the Popular Christian Party (PPC, not to be confused with PCP, Partido Comunista del Peru) and many left-leaning parties participated in this election. Fujimori supporters won a majority of the seats in this body, and drafted a [[Constitution of Peru|new constitution]] in 1993. In a [[Peruvian constitutional referendum, 1993|referendum]], the coup and the Constitution of 1993 were approved by a narrow margin of less than five percent.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=pe011993 Peru, 31 October 1993: Constitution] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, on 13 November, General [[Jaime Salinas]] led a failed military coup. Salinas asserted that his intentions were to turn Fujimori over to be tried for violating the Peruvian constitution.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1994, Fujimori separated from his wife [[Susana Higuchi]] in a noisy, public divorce. He formally stripped her of the title [[First Lady]] in August 1994, appointing their eldest daughter First Lady in her stead. Higuchi publicly denounced Fujimori as a "tyrant" and claimed that his administration was corrupt. They formally divorced in 1995.

In Fujimori's first term of office, over 3,000 Peruvians were killed in political murders.&lt;ref name="FTWD2" /&gt;{{context needed|Those may be refering to the terrorist killed.}}

==Second term==
The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term, and in April 1995, at the height of his popularity, Fujimori easily won reelection with almost two-thirds of the vote. His major opponent, former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], won only 22 percent of the vote. Fujimori's supporters won comfortable majorities in the legislature. One of the first acts of the new congress was to declare an amnesty for all members of the [[Peruvian military]] or [[Law enforcement in Peru|police]] accused or convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lum.cultura.pe/cdi/documento/fujimori-signs-amnesty-law-fujimori-firma-ley-de-amnist%C3%ADa|title=Fujimori signs amnesty law|publisher=Peruvian Ministry of Culture|accessdate=2017-12-27|author=National Security Archive|date=15 June 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his second term, Fujimori along with [[President of Ecuador|Ecuadorian President]] [[Sixto Durán Ballén]], signed a peace agreement with [[Ecuador]] over a [[History of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute|border dispute]] that had simmered for more than a century. The treaty allowed the two countries to obtain international funds for developing the border region. Fujimori also settled some issues with Chile, Peru's southern neighbor, which had been unresolved since the 1929 [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, Jorge ''et al.'' (2003) ''Boundary Disputes in Latin America'' [[United States Institute of Peace]], Washington, D.C., [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?u=1&amp;num=33&amp;seq=3&amp;view=image&amp;size=100&amp;id=mdp.39015052976985 page 33], {{OCLC|53067610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 election was the turning point in Fujimori's career. Peruvians began to be more concerned about freedom of speech and the press. However, before he was sworn in for a second term, Fujimori stripped two universities of their autonomy and reshuffled the national electoral board. This led his opponents to call him "Chinochet," a reference to his previous nickname and to [[Chile]]an ruler [[Augusto Pinochet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Latin America 2010 |last=Buckman |first=Robert T. |year=2010 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=[[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]] |isbn=978-1-935264-12-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll by the Peruvian Research and Marketing Company conducted in 1997, 40.6% of Lima residents considered President Fujimori an authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;Cathleen Caron, [http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/06/1peru.cfm Judiciary Firmly Under Control in Fujimori's Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207051241/http://www.wcl.american.edu/hrbrief/06/1peru.cfm |date=7 February 2012 }}, ''[[Human Rights Brief]]'', Volume 6 Issue 1 (1999). p.9 ''et. seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Atwood, 'Democratic Dictators: Authoritarian Politics in Peru from Leguia to Fujimori,' ''[[SAIS Review]]'', vol. 21, no. 2 (2001), p. 167.{{ doi|10.1353/sais.2001.0030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, 'Neopopulism and Neoliberalism in Latin America: Unexpected Affinities,' ''[[Studies in Comparative International Development]]'', vol. 31, no. 3 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the fate of democracy under Fujimori, Peruvians were becoming increasingly interested in the myriad allegations of criminality that involved Fujimori and his chief of the [[National Intelligence Service (Peru)|National Intelligence Service (SIN)]], [[Vladimiro Montesinos]]. Using SIN, Fujimori gained control of the majority of the armed forces, with ''[[Financial Times]]'' stating that "[i]n no other country in Latin America did a president have so much control over the armed forces".&lt;ref name="FTWD2"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Financial Times]] World Desk Reference|last1=Heritage|first1=Andrew|date=December 2002|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=|isbn=9780789488053|location=|pages=462-465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 report by Health Minister {{Interlanguage link multi|Fernando Carbone|es|3=Fernando Carbone Campoverde}} later suggested that Fujimori was involved in the [[Compulsory sterilization#Peru|forced sterilizations]] of up to 300,000 indigenous women between 1996 and 2000, as part of a population control program.&lt;ref name="Sterilization" /&gt; A 2004 [[World Bank]] publication said that in this period Montesinos' abuse of the power Fujimori granted him "led to a steady and systematic undermining of the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;"State Society Interactions as Sources of Persistence and Change in Inequality" in ''Inequality in Latin America: Breaking With History?''

==Third term==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2013}}
{{Main|Peruvian national election, 2000}}

The 1993 constitution limited a presidency to two terms. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his supporters in Congress passed a law of "authentic interpretation" which effectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000. A 1998 effort to repeal this law by referendum failed.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1999, Fujimori announced that he would run for a third term. Peruvian electoral bodies, which were politically sympathetic to Fujimori, accepted his argument that the two-term restriction did not apply to him, as it was enacted while he was already in office.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Krauss, [https://www.nytimes.com/library/world/americas/122899peru-fujimori.html Peru's Chief to Seek 3rd Term, Capping a Long Legal Battle], 'New York Times'', 28 December 1999. Retrieved 26 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exit polls showed Fujimori fell short of the 50% required to avoid an electoral runoff, but the first official results showed him with 49.6% of the vote, just short of outright victory. Eventually, Fujimori was credited with 49.89%—20,000 votes short of avoiding a runoff. Despite reports of numerous irregularities, the international observers recognized an adjusted victory of Fujimori. His primary opponent, [[Alejandro Toledo]], called for his supporters to spoil their ballots in the runoff by writing "No to fraud!" on them (voting is mandatory in Peru). International observers pulled out of the country after Fujimori refused to delay the runoff.

In the runoff, Fujimori won with 51.1% of the total votes. While votes for Toledo declined from 37.0% of the total votes cast in the first round to 17.7% of the votes in the second round, invalid votes jumped from 8.1% of the total votes cast in the first round to 31.1% of total votes in the second round.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;{{cite book

Although Fujimori won the runoff with only a bare majority, rumors of irregularities led most of the international community to shun his third swearing-in on 28 July. For the next seven weeks, there were daily demonstrations in front of the presidential palace. As a conciliatory gesture, Fujimori appointed former opposition candidate [[Federico Salas]] as prime minister. However, opposition parties in Parliament refused to support this move, and Toledo campaigned vigorously to have the election annulled. At this point, a corruption scandal involving [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] broke out, and exploded into full force on the evening of 14 September 2000, when the cable television station [[Canal N]] broadcast footage of Montesinos apparently bribing opposition congressman Alberto Kouri for defecting to Fujimori's ''Perú 2000'' party. The video was presented by [[Fernando Olivera]], leader of the FIM (Independent Moralizing Front), who purchased it from one of Montesinos's closest allies{{who|date=June 2016}} (nicknamed by the Peruvian press ''El Patriota'').

Fujimori's support virtually collapsed, and a few days later he announced in a nationwide address that he would shut down the SIN and call new elections, in which he would not be a candidate. On 10 November, Fujimori won approval from Congress to hold elections on 8 April 2001. On 13 November, Fujimori left Peru for a visit to [[Brunei]] to attend the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum. On 16 November, [[Valentín Paniagua]] took over as president of Congress after the pro-Fujimori leadership lost a vote of confidence. On 17 November, Fujimori traveled from Brunei to Tokyo, where he submitted his presidential [[resignation]] via fax. Congress refused to accept his resignation, instead voting 62–9 to remove Fujimori from office on the grounds that he was "permanently morally disabled."

On 19 November, government ministers presented their resignations en bloc. Because Fujimori's first vice president, [[Francisco Tudela]], had broken with Fujimori and resigned a few days earlier, his successor Ricardo Márquez came to claim the presidency. Congress, however, refused to recognize him, as he was an ardent Fujimori loyalist; Márquez resigned two days later. Paniagua was next in line, and became interim president to oversee the April elections.

==Terrorism==

{{See also|Tarata bombing|Japanese embassy hostage crisis}}
When Fujimori came to power, much of Peru was dominated by the [[Maoism|Maoist]] insurgent group Sendero Luminoso ("[[Shining Path]]"), and the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] group [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] (MRTA). In 1989, 25% of Peru's district and provincial councils opted not to hold elections, owing to a persistent campaign of assassination, over the course of which over 100 officials had been killed by the Shining Path in that year alone. That same year, more than one-third of Peru's courts lacked a justice of the peace, because of Shining Path intimidation. Union leaders and military officials were also assassinated throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name= "Freeman"&gt;Freeman, Michael. ''Freedom Or Security: The Consequences for Democracies Using Emergency Powers''. 2003, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zonas donde se ha registrado actividad de Sendero Luminoso.png|thumb|right|200px|Areas where Shining Path was active in Peru.]]

By the early 1990s, some parts of the country were under the control of the insurgents, in territories known as "zonas liberadas" ("liberated zones"), where inhabitants lived under the rule of these groups and paid them taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Michael. ''Freedom Or Security: The Consequences for Democracies Using Emergency Powers''. 2003, page 148.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Shining Path arrived in Lima, it organized "paros armados" ("armed strikes"), which were enforced by killings and other forms of violence. The leadership of the Shining Path was largely university students and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Michael. ''Freedom Or Security: The Consequences for Democracies Using Emergency Powers''. 2003, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Two previous governments, those of [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] and [[Alan García]], at first neglected the threat posed by the Shining Path, then launched an unsuccessful military campaign to eradicate it, undermining public faith in the state and precipitating an exodus of elites.&lt;ref&gt;"By the time Fujimori was elected you had a population in the cities, and particularly in [[Lima]], that was living in fear." [https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2006/falloffujimori/special_goldman.html The Fall of Fujimori: Peru's war on terror] 6 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1992, Shining Path guerrilla attacks had claimed an estimated 20,000 lives over preceding 12 years. On 16 July 1992 the [[Tarata bombing|Tarata Bombing]], in which several car bombs exploded in Lima's wealthiest district, killed over 40 people; the bombings were characterized by one commentator as an "offensive to challenge President Albert Fujimori."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/18/world/car-bomb-blasts-in-peru-kill-18-and-hurt-140-in-wealthy-sector.html Car-Bomb Blasts in Peru Kill 18 And Hurt 140 in Wealthy Sector] 18 July 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The bombing at Tarata was followed up with a "weeklong wave of car bombings ... Bombs hit banks, hotels, schools, restaurants, police stations and shops ... [G]uerrillas bombed two rail bridges from the [[Andes]], cutting off some of Peru's largest copper mines from coastal ports."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/23/world/peruvian-guerrillas-test-government-with-bombs.html Peruvian Guerrillas Test Government With Bombs] 23 July 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori has been credited by many Peruvians with ending the fifteen-year reign of terror of the Shining Path. As part of his anti-insurgency efforts, Fujimori granted the military broad powers to arrest suspected insurgents and try them in secret military courts with few legal rights. This measure has often been criticized for compromising the fundamental democratic and human right to an open trial wherein the accused faces the accuser. Fujimori contended that these measures were both justified and also necessary. Members of the judiciary were too afraid to charge the alleged insurgents, and judges and prosecutors had very legitimate fears of reprisals against them or their families.&lt;ref&gt;Fujimori advances this argument in [[Ellen Perry]]'s documentary film, ''[[The Fall of Fujimori]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Fujimori's government armed rural Peruvians, organizing them into groups known as "[[Ronda Campesina|rondas campesinas]]" ("peasant patrols").

Insurgent activity was in decline by the end of 1992,&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Steve J. ''Shining and Other Paths: War and Society in Peru, 1980–1995''. 1998, page 307.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fujimori took credit for this abatement, claiming that his campaign had largely eliminated the insurgent threat. After the 1992 auto-coup, the intelligence work of the [[DIRCOTE|DINCOTE]] (National Counter-Terrorism Directorate) led to the capture of the leaders from MRTA and the Shining Path, including notorious Shining Path leader [[Abimael Guzmán]]. Guzmán's capture was a political coup for Fujimori, who used it to great effect in the press; in an interview with documentarian [[Ellen Perry]], Fujimori even notes that he specially ordered Guzmán's prison jumpsuit to be white with black stripes, to enhance the image of his capture in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Perry's ''The Fall of Fujimori''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics charge that to achieve the defeat of the Shining Path, the Peruvian military engaged in widespread [[human rights]] abuses, and that the majority of the victims were poor highland countryside inhabitants caught in a crossfire between the military and insurgents. The final report of the Peruvian [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], published on 28 August 2003, brought out that Peruvian armed forces were also guilty of destroying villages and murdering countryside inhabitants whom they suspected of supporting insurgents. The majority of the atrocities committed between 1980 and 1995, however, were indeed the work of the Shining Path.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]] began on 17 December 1996, when fourteen [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]] militants seized the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima during a party, taking hostage some four hundred diplomats, government officials, and other dignitaries. The action was partly in protest of prison conditions in Peru. During the four-month standoff, the ''Emerretistas'' gradually freed all but 72 of their hostages. The government rejected the militants' demand to release imprisoned MRTA members and secretly prepared an elaborate plan to storm the residence, while stalling by negotiating with the hostage-takers.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Paul. ''The Lima Embassy Siege and Latin American Terrorism''. 2006, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 1997, a team of military [[commando]]s, codenamed "[[Chavín de Huantar (military)|Chavín de Huantar]]", raided the building. One hostage, two military commandos, and all 14 MRTA insurgents were killed in the operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginperu.com/blogs/features/234 Japanese embassy hostage crisis in Peru started 10 years ago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106011927/http://www.livinginperu.com/blogs/features/234 |date=6 January 2007 }} 18 December 2006.

==Accusations of human rights abuses==
{{See also|Barrios Altos massacre|La Cantuta massacre|Operation Chavín de Huántar}}
Several organizations criticized Fujimori's methods against the [[Shining Path]] and the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]]. [[Amnesty International]] said "the widespread and systematic nature of human rights violations committed during the government of former head of state Albert Fujimori (1990–2000) in Peru constitute crimes against humanity under international law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kintera.org/site/c.luLVJ8MRKrH/b.1419663/k.BE3C/Home.htm Bring Former President Fujimori to Justice], Amnesty International.

The 1991 [[Barrios Altos massacre]] by members of the death squad ''[[Grupo Colina]]'', made up solely of members of the [[Military of Peru|Peruvian armed forces]], was one of the crimes that Peru cited in its request to Japan for his extradition in 2003.

From 1996 to 2000, the Fujimori government oversaw a massive forced sterilization campaign known as Voluntary Surgical Contraception. [[United Nations|The United Nations]] and other international aid agencies supported this campaign. USAID provided funding and training until it was exposed by objections by churches and human rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightnewstv.com/d68/ Insight News TV | Peru: Fujimori's Forced Sterilization Campaign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106001745/http://www.insightnewstv.com/d68/ |date=6 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nippon Foundation]], headed by [[Ayako Sono]], a Japanese novelist and personal friend of Fujimori, supported as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=20466 Catholic World News Enough Evidence to Extradite? 27 September 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zenit.org/article-2233?l=english Peru Plans a Hot Line to Battle Forced-Sterilizations] The {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118210937/http://zenit.org/article-2233?l=english |date=18 January 2009 }} ZENET LIMA, Peru, 2 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Over 215,000  people, mostly women, entirely [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]], were forced or threatened into sterilization during these years, most of them without a proper anaesthetist.&lt;ref name="Sterilization" /&gt;

The success of the military operation in the [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]] was tainted by subsequent allegations that at least three and possibly eight of the insurgents were summarily executed by the commandos after surrendering. In 2002, the case was taken up by public prosecutors, but the [[Peruvian Supreme Court]] ruled that the military tribunals had jurisdiction. A military court later absolved them of guilt, and the "[[Chavín de Huantar]]" soldiers led the 2004 military parade. In response, in 2003 MRTA family members lodged a complaint with the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) accusing the Peruvian state of human rights violations, namely that the MRTA insurgents had been denied the "right to life, the right to judicial guarantees and the right to judicial protection". The IACHR accepted the case and is currently{{when|date=June 2016}} studying it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidh.org/annualrep/2004eng/Peru.136.03.eng.htm Report Nº 13/04, Petition 136/03, Admissibility, Eduardo Nicolas Cruz Sanchez et al., Peru, 27 February 2004], on the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) site.

He arranged meetings with the Supreme Court, tax authorities, and other powers in Peru to "coordinate the joint efforts to bring the criminal Fujimori from Japan." His vehemence in this matter at times compromised Peruvian law: forcing the judiciary and legislative system to keep guilty sentences without hearing Fujimori's defense; not providing Fujimori with representation when Fujimori was tried ''in absentia''; and expelling pro-Fujimori congressmen from the parliament without proof of the accusations against those congressmen. These expulsions were later reversed by the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/politica/24922_1.php Valle Riestra: Pedido de extradición de Fujimori será rechazado por Chile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124032807/http://www.rpp.com.pe/portada/politica/24922_1.php |date=24 November 2005 }} RPP Noticias, 16 November 2005.

Meanwhile, the Peruvian government found that Japan was not amenable to the extradition of Fujimori; a protracted diplomatic debate ensued, when Japan showed itself unwilling to accede to the extradition request.

In September 2003, Congressman Dora Dávila, joined by Minister of Health Luis Soari, denounced Fujimori and several of his ministers for crimes against humanity, for allegedly having overseen [[forced sterilization]]s during his regime. In November, Congress approved an investigation of Fujimori's involvement in the airdrop of [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] rifles into the [[Colombia]]n jungle in 1999 and 2000 for guerrillas of the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC). Fujimori maintained he had no knowledge of the arms-trading, and blamed Montesinos. By approving the charges, Congress lifted the immunity granted to Fujimori as a former president, so that he could be criminally charged and prosecuted.

Congress also voted to support charges against Fujimori for the detention and disappearance of 67 students from the central Andean city of [[Huancayo]] and the disappearance of several residents from the northern coastal town of [[Chimbote]] during the 1990s. It also approved charges that Fujimori mismanaged millions of dollars from Japanese charities, suggesting that the millions of dollars in his bank account were far too much to have been accumulated legally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3710848.stm New Evidence in Fujimori Scandal]. ''BBC'', 2 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, the Special Prosecutor established to investigate Fujimori released a report alleging that the Fujimori administration had obtained US$2 billion though graft.&lt;ref name="Forero"&gt;Forero, Juan.

Transparency International listed Fujimori as having embezzled an estimated USD $600 million, which would rank seventh in the list of money embezzled by heads of government active within 1984-2004.&lt;ref name="2004ti" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laksamana.net/vnews.cfm?ncat=25&amp;news_id=6841|title=Suharto Tops World Corruption League|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040717153615/http://www.laksamana.net/vnews.cfm?ncat=25&amp;news_id=6841|archivedate=17 July 2004|deadurl=bot: unknown|accessdate=2005-04-02|df=dmy}}, 25 March 2004, Laksamana.Net, Jakarta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujimori dismissed the judicial proceedings underway against him as "politically motivated", citing Toledo's involvement. Fujimori established a new political party in Peru, ''[[Sí Cumple]]'', working from Japan. He hoped to participate in the [[Peruvian general election, 2006|2006 presidential elections]], but in February 2004, the Constitutional Court dismissed this possibility, because the ex-president was specifically barred by Congress from holding any office for ten years. Fujimori saw the decision as unconstitutional, as did his supporters such as ex-congressmembers [[Luz Salgado]], [[Marta Chávez]] and [[Fernán Altuve]], who argued it was a "political" maneuver and that the only body with the authority to determine the matter was the [[National Jury of Elections|Jurado Nacional de Elecciones]] (JNE). [[Valentín Paniagua]] disagreed, suggesting that the Constitutional Court finding was binding and that "no further debate is possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.terra.com.pe/noticias/nacional/18/18990.html No hay nada más que discutir sobre candidatura de Fujimori], ''Noticias'' on terra.com.peru, 27 February 2006 credited to ''Andina''.

Fujimori's ''Sí Cumple'' (roughly translated, "He Keeps His Word") received more than 10% in many country-level polls, contending with [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] for the second place slot,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, James.

By March 2005, it appeared that Peru had all but abandoned its efforts to extradite Fujimori from Japan. In September of that year, Fujimori obtained a new Peruvian passport in Tokyo and announced his intention to run in the [[Peruvian general election, 2006|Peruvian national election, 2006]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He arrived in Chile in November 2005, but hours after his arrival there he was arrested.  Peru then requested his extradition.

While under house arrest in Chile, Fujimori announced plans to run in [[Japanese House of Councillors election, 2007|Japan's Upper House elections in July 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0725/p04s01-woap.html|title=Still wanted in Peru, Alberto Fujimori runs for office in Japan|date=2007-07-25|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2018-10-25|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujimori was extradited from Chile to Peru in September 2007.

===Pardon requests===

Press reports in late 2012 indicated that Fujimori was suffering from tongue cancer and other medical problems. His family asked President [[Ollanta Humala]] for a pardon.&lt;ref&gt;Fujimori Family Requests Pardon for Former Peruvian President, by William Neuman, New York Times, 11 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; President Humala rejected a pardon in 2013, saying that Fujimori's condition was not serious enough to warrant it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Peru president rules out pardon for ex-leader Fujimori|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36892762|accessdate=7 August 2016|work=[[BBC]]|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, with three days left in his term, President Humala said that there was insufficient time to evaluate a second request to pardon Fujimori, leaving the decision to his successor [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Alberto Fujimori Files New Request for Presidential Pardon|url=http://www.peruviantimes.com/25/alberto-fujimori-files-new-request-for-presidential-pardon/27136/|website=Andean Air Mail &amp; Peruvian Times|publisher=Eleanor Griffis|accessdate=7 August 2016|location=[[Lima]]|date=25 July 2016|quote=The Presidential Pardons Commission met this Monday to begin evaluating a request filed on Friday July 22 by ex-President Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for crimes against humanity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taj |first1=Mitra |editor-last1=Fernandez |editor-first1=Clarence |title=Peru's Humala rules out pardoning Fujimori during his term|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/peru-fujimori-idUSL1N1AC05U |accessdate=7 August 2016|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=26 July 2016|quote=Humala, who will be replaced by centrist President-elect Pedro Pablo Kuczynski on Thursday, said in a broadcast interview that a serious evaluation of Fujimori's pardon request would take at least a couple months.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 December 2017, President Kuczynski pardoned him on health grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/25/perus-jailed-ex-president-alberto-fujimori-pardoned-sparking-protests|title=Peru's jailed ex-president Alberto Fujimori pardoned, sparking protests|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 December 2017|author=Dan Collyns|accessdate=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuczynski's office stated that the hospitalized 79-year-old Fujimori had a "progressive, degenerative and incurable disease".

A spokesman for [[Popular Force]] alleged there was a pact that, in exchange for the pardon, Popular Force members helped Kuczynski fight ongoing impeachment proceedings.&lt;ref name="cnn pardon"/&gt;

On 3 October 2018, the Peruvian Supreme Court reversed Fujimori's pardon and ordered his return to prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/03/peru-high-court-overturns-pardon-alberto-fujimori|title=Peru's high court overturns pardon of former strongman Fujimori|last=Collyns|first=Dan|date=2018-10-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

=== Economic achievements ===
Fujimori is credited by many Peruvians for bringing stability to the country after the violence and hyperinflation of the García years. While it is generally agreed that the "Fujishock" brought short/middle-term macroeconomic stability, the long-term social impact of Fujimori's free market economic policies is still hotly debated.

Neoliberal reforms under Fujimori took place in three distinct phases: an initial "orthodox" phase (1990–92) in which technocrats dominated the reform agenda; a "pragmatic" phase (1993–98) that saw the growing influence of business elites over government priorities; and a final "watered-down" phase (1999–2000) dominated by a clique of personal loyalists and their [[Clientelism|clientelist]] policies that aimed to secure Fujimori a third term as president. Business was a big winner of the reforms, with its influence increasing significantly within both the state and society.&lt;ref name = "Arce 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last= Arce |first= Moisés |year= 2005 |title= Market Reform in Society: Post-Crisis Politics and Economic Change in Authoritarian Peru |location= University Park, PA |publisher= [[Penn State University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-271-02542-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High growth during Fujimori's first term petered out during his second term. "[[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]]" phenomena had a tremendous impact on the Peruvian economy during the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Gastón Antonio Zapata Velasco, Kenneth Broad, et al., [http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/un/peru.html Peru Country Case Study: Impacts and Responses to the 1997–98 El Niño Event] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905164739/http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/un/peru.html |date=5 September 2006 }}, Peru Country Case Study supported by the International Research Institute for climate prediction (IRI) and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]'s Office of Global Programs as a contribution to the UNEP/NCAR/WMO/UNU/ISDR study for the UN Foundation.

Furthermore, FAO reported Peru reduced undernourishment by about 29% from 1990–92 to 1997–99.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/y1500e/y1500e03.htm Undernourishment around the world: Reductions in undernourishment over the past decade], part of [http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/y1500e/y1500e00.HTM The state of food insecurity in the world 2001], FAO Corporate Document Repository.

Peru was reintegrated into the global economic system, and began to attract [[Mineral industry of Peru|foreign investment]]. The sell-off of state-owned enterprises led to improvements in some service industries, notably local telephony, mobile telephony and Internet. For example, before privatization, a consumer or business had to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed by the state-run telephone company, at a cost of $607 for a residential line.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.up.edu.pe/ciup/AER/textos/Fernandez-Baca.ppt Las Privatizaciones y la Pobreza en el Perú: Resultados y Desafios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721214646/http://www.up.edu.pe/ciup/AER/textos/Fernandez-Baca.ppt |date=21 July 2006 }} ([[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] presentation), unsigned, undated, on the site of El Área de Economía de la Regulación, Centro de Investigación de la Universidad del Pacífico (CIUP).

By the end of the decade, Peru's international currency reserves were built up from nearly zero at the end of García's term to almost US$10 billion. Fujimori also left a smaller state bureaucracy and reduced government expenses (in contrast to the historical pattern of bureaucratic expansion), a technically minded (but widely perceived as politicized) administration of public entities like [[SUNAT]] (the tax collection agency), a large number of new schools, not only in Lima but in Peru's small towns, more roads and highways, and new and upgraded communications infrastructure.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} These improvements led to a revival in tourism, agroexport, industries and fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www2.congreso.gob.pe/Sicr/Prensa/heraldo.nsf/0/bc520537f55e0ec805256f3a006beff6?OpenDocument Primer reporte-resumen ...

===Criticism===
Detractors have observed that Fujimori was able to encourage large-scale mining projects with foreign corporations and push through mining-friendly legislation laws because the post auto-coup political picture greatly facilitated the process.

Some analysts state that some of the GDP growth during the Fujimori years reflects a greater rate of extraction of non-renewable resources by transnational companies; these companies were attracted by Fujimori by means of near-zero royalties, and, by the same fact, little of the extracted wealth has stayed in the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Chile, Peru – How much do mining companies contribute?

Fujimori's privatization program also remains shrouded in controversy. A congressional investigation in 2002, led by socialist opposition congressman [[Javier Díez Canseco|Javier Diez Canseco]], stated that of the USD $9 billion raised through the privatizations of hundreds of state-owned enterprises, only a small fraction of this income ever benefited the Peruvian people.

In the 2004 Global Transparency Report, Fujimori made into the list of the World's Most Corrupt Leaders. He was listed seventh and he was said to have amassed $600 million, but despite years of incarceration and investigation, none of these supposed stolen funds have ever been located in any bank account anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |title=World's Ten Most Corrupt Leaders1 |publisher=Infoplease.com Source: Transparency International Global Corruption Report 2004.|date= |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.transparency.org/content/download/479/1974/file/2004_GCR_PoliticalCorruption_EN.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |date= |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
Fujimori did have support within Peru. The Universidad de Lima March 2003 poll, taken while he was in Japan, found a 41% approval rating for his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/20/news/adfg-fujimori20 |title=In Japan, Fujimori Covets Post in Peru: Disgraced president plots his return to power in a land that accuses him of murder, treason and embezzlement|date=July 20, 2003|author=Natalie Obiko Pearson |agency=Associated Press|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll conducted in March 2005 by the Instituto de Desarrollo e Investigación de Ciencias Económicas (IDICE) indicated that 12.1% of the respondents intended to vote for Fujimori in the 2006 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewItem&amp;itemID=6543 García, Fujimori Top Candidates In Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025170504/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewItem&amp;itemID=6543 |date=25 October 2005 }}, ''Angus Reid Global Monitor'' (Angus Reid Consultants), 30 March 2005.

According to a more recent [[University of Lima|Universidad de Lima]] survey, Fujimori still retains public support, ranking fifth in personal popularity among other political figures. Popular approval for his decade-long presidency (1990–2000) has reportedly grown (from 31.5% in 2002 to 49.5% in May 2007).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Despite accusations of corruption and human rights violations, nearly half of the individuals interviewed in the survey approved of Fujimori's presidential regime.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In a 2007 [[University of Lima|Universidad de Lima]] survey of 600 Peruvians in Lima and the port of Callao, 82.6% agreed that the former president should be extradited from Chile to stand trial in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/15709 Peruvians Call for Fujimori's Extradition]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Angus Reid Global Monitor'' (Angus Reid Consultants), 12 May 2007. Retrieved 19 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lima-based newspaper ''Perú 21'' ran an editorial noting that even though the [[University of Lima|Universidad de Lima]] poll results indicate that four out of every five interviewees believe that Fujimori is guilty of some of the charges against him, he still enjoys at least 30% of popular support and enough approval to restart a political career.

In the 2006 congressional elections, his daughter [[Keiko Fujimori|Keiko]] was elected to the congress with the highest vote count. She came in second place in the [[Peruvian general election, 2011|2011 Peruvian presidential election]] with 23.2% of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elecciones2011.onpe.gob.pe/resultados2011/1ravuelta/onpe/presidente/rep_resumen_pre.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411191131/http://www.elecciones2011.onpe.gob.pe/resultados2011/1ravuelta/onpe/presidente/rep_resumen_pre.php |archivedate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lost the June run-off against [[Ollanta Humala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/06/06/peru.runoff/index.html|title=Left-leaning Humala wins Peruvian presidential election|author1=Rafael Romo |author2=Helena DeMoura|publisher=CNN|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She again ran for President in the [[Peruvian general election, 2016|2016 election]], narrowly losing the run-off to [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]].

[[Image:Articles page1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Articles of Confederation]]: predecessor to the [[U.S. Constitution]] and  drafted from Anti-Federalist principles]]
'''Anti-Federalism''' was a late-18th century movement that opposed the creation of a stronger U.S. federal government and which later opposed the ratification of the 1787 [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. The previous constitution, called the [[Articles of Confederation]], gave state governments more authority. Led by [[Patrick Henry]] of Virginia, Anti-Federalists worried, among other things, that the position of president, then a novelty, might evolve into a [[monarchy]]. Though the Constitution was ratified and supplanted the Articles of Confederation, Anti-Federalist influence helped lead to the passage of the [[United States Bill of Rights]].

==Major points==
* They believed the Constitution needed a Bill of Rights.
* They believed the Constitution created a presidency so powerful that it would become a monarchy.
* They believed the Constitution did too little with the courts and would create an out-of-control judiciary.
* They believed that the national government would be too far away from the people and thus unresponsive to the needs of localities.

==History==
During the [[American Revolution]] and its immediate aftermath, the term ''federal'' was applied to any person who supported the colonial union and the government formed under the [[Articles of Confederation]]. After the war, the group that felt the national government under the Articles was too weak appropriated the name [[Federalism in the United States|Federalist]] for themselves. Historian Jackson Turner Main wrote, "to them, the man of 'federal principles' approved of 'federal measures,' which meant those that increased the weight and authority or extended the influence of the Confederation Congress."&lt;ref name="Main"&gt;{{cite book |last=Main |first=Jackson Turner |date=1961 |title=The Antifederalists: Critics of the Constitution, 1781-1788 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0tf43-IUWcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Anti+Federalists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-pNCnmI7TAhUIsFQKHSe8A5IQ6AEIOTAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=0-8078-5544-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Federalists moved to amend the Articles, eventually leading to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], they applied the term anti-federalist to their opposition. The term implied, correctly or not, both opposition to Congress and unpatriotic motives. The Anti-Federalists rejected the term, arguing that they were the true Federalists. In both their correspondence and their local groups, they tried to capture the term. For example, an unknown anti-federalist signed his public correspondence as "A Federal Farmer" and the New York committee opposing the Constitution was called the "Federal Republican Committee."  However the Federalists carried the day and the name Anti-Federalist forever stuck.&lt;ref name="Main"/&gt; 
  
The Anti-Federalists were composed of diverse elements, including those opposed to the Constitution because they thought that a stronger government threatened the sovereignty and prestige of the states, localities, or individuals; those that saw in the proposed government a new centralized, disguised "monarchic" power that would only replace the cast-off despotism of Great Britain;&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anti-Federalists|volume=2|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those who simply feared that the new government threatened their personal liberties. Some of the opposition believed that the central government under the Articles of Confederation was sufficient. Still others believed that while the national government under the Articles was too weak, the national government under the Constitution would be too strong. Another complaint of the Anti-Federalists was that the Constitution provided for a centralized rather than federal government (and in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', [[James Madison]] admits that the new Constitution has the characteristics of both a centralized and federal form of the government) and that a truly federal form of government was a leaguing of states as under the Articles of Confederation.

During the period of debate over the ratification of the Constitution, numerous independent local speeches and articles were published all across the country. Initially, many of the articles in opposition were written under pseudonyms, such as "Brutus" (likely [[Melancton Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;Zuckert and Webb. ''The Anti-Federalist Writings of the Melancton Smith Circle'' pp. 418–419&lt;/ref&gt;), "Centinel" (likely [[Samuel Bryan]]), and "[[Federal Farmer]]."  Eventually, famous revolutionary figures such as [[Patrick Henry]] came out publicly against the Constitution. They argued that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to the rights of individuals and that the [[President of the United States|president]] would become a king. They objected to the federal court system created by the proposed constitution. This produced a phenomenal body of political writing; the best and most influential of these articles and speeches were gathered by historians into a collection known as the ''[[Anti-Federalist Papers]]'' in allusion to the ''[[Federalist Papers]]''.

In many states the opposition to the Constitution was strong (although Delaware, Georgia, and New Jersey ratified quickly with little controversy), and in two states—[[North Carolina]] and [[Rhode Island]]—it prevented ratification until the definite establishment of the new government practically forced their adherence. Individualism was the strongest element of opposition; the necessity, or at least the desirability, of a bill of rights was almost universally felt.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In [[Rhode Island]], resistance against the Constitution was so strong that civil war almost broke out on July 4, 1788, when anti-federalist members of the [[Country Party (Rhode Island)|Country Party]] led by Judge [[William West (Rhode Island politician)|William West]] marched into [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] with over 1,000 armed protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Columbian Centinel, July 5, 12, 16, 23, 1788; Pennsylvania Packet, July 30, 1788. (reference to West's anti-Constitution [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] rally)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Federalists played upon these feelings in the ratification convention in [[Massachusetts]]. By this point, five of the states had ratified the Constitution with relative ease, but the Massachusetts convention was far more disputed and contentious. After a long debate, a compromise (known as the "[[Massachusetts compromise]]") was reached. Massachusetts would ratify the Constitution with recommended provisions in the ratifying instrument that the Constitution be amended with a bill of rights. (The Federalists contended that a conditional ratification would be void, so the recommendation was the strongest support that the ratifying convention could give to a bill of rights short of rejecting the Constitution.)

Four of the next five states to ratify, including [[New Hampshire]], [[Virginia]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], included similar language in their ratification instruments. As a result, once the Constitution became operative in 1789, Congress sent a set of twelve amendments to the states. Ten of these amendments were immediately ratified and became known as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], with one of the other two becoming the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|27th Amendment]]—almost 200 years later. Thus, while the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in their quest to prevent the adoption of the Constitution, their efforts were not totally in vain. The Anti-Federalists thus became recognized as an influential group among the founding fathers of the United States.

With the passage of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the Anti-Federalist movement was exhausted. Some activists joined the [[Anti-Administration Party]] that James Madison and Thomas Jefferson were forming about 1790–91 to oppose the policies of Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]]; this group soon became the [[Democratic-Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth F.Warren|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Campaigns, Elections, and Electoral Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zP4wDcT3PeQC&amp;pg=PA176|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antidisestablishmentarianism''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Antidisestablishmentarianism.ogg|ˌ|æ|n|t|i|d|ɪ|s|ɪ|ˌ|s|t|æ|b|l|ɪ|ʃ|m|ə|n|ˈ|t|ɛər|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{small|US also}} {{IPAc-en|audio=Pronunciation of 'antidisestablishmentarianism'.ogg|ˌ|æ|n|t|aɪ|-}}) is a political position that developed in 19th-century Britain in opposition to [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] proposals for the [[disestablishment]] of the [[Church of England]]—meaning the removal of the Anglican Church's status as the [[State religion|state church]] of England, Ireland, and [[Wales]]. The establishment was maintained in England, but in Ireland, the [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglican) was disestablished in 1871. In Wales, four Church of England [[diocese]]s were disestablished in 1920 and became the [[Church in Wales]].&lt;!-- So what does the word mean?  It's still not remotely clear. --&gt;

Antidisestablishmentarianism [[Antidisestablishmentarianism (word)|is also referred to as one of the longest non-scientific words in the English language]].

==History==
The matter of disestablishment of the Church of England is an ongoing issue, often tied with the position of the [[English monarch|Monarchy of the United Kingdom]] as [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|"Supreme Governor" of the Church]] (see [[Act of Settlement 1701]]).

In April 2014, [[Nick Clegg]], then [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats]], said that he thought the Church of England and the British state should be separated "in the long run".&lt;ref name = "clegg"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27154699 |title=Nick Clegg advocates separation of Church and state |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=25 April 2014 |accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Cameron]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] at the time, responded to Clegg's comments by stating that the position was "a long-term Liberal idea, but it is not a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] one", adding that he believed the existence of an established church is beneficial.&lt;ref name = "clegg"/&gt;

==Word length==
{{Main|Antidisestablishmentarianism (word)}}
The word ''antidisestablishmentarianism'' is notable for its unusual length of 28 letters and 12 syllables (an-ti-dis-es-tab-lish-ment-ar-i-an-is-m), and is one of the longest words in the English language.&lt;ref name=oxforddic&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/what-is-the-longest-english-word What is the longest English word?] [[Oxford Dictionaries Online]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the longest non-technical, non-coined word.

The '''Arusha Agreement''' was a treaty signed on 24 September 1969 in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], between the [[European Community]] and the three [[East Africa]]n states of [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and Tanzania. The agreement entered into force on 1 January 1971, concomitant with the second [[Yaoundé Convention]], with the aim of establishing better economic relations between the [[European Community|EC]] and the African states. At the end of their validity time, the [[Lomé Convention]] was signed which substituted the previous agreements and enlarged them to 46 [[ACP countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-ir.info/2011/03/11/from-association-policy-to-cotonou-eu-acp-trade-relations-environmental-protection-and-sustainable-development/ EU-ACP Trade Relations, Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development] Retrieved 11 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1967, three East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) that were not members of the Associated African and Malagasy States (AAMS), but were instead member states of the Commonwealth of Nations combined to establish the East African Community (EAC). On 26 July 1968 the EEC signed an initial Association Agreement with the EAC. That Agreement did not enter into force because it was not ratified by all the countries involved. On 24 September 1969 in Arusha, a second Agreement was signed between the EEC and the EAC. That Agreement was signed at the same time as the Convention of Association between the EEC and the AAMS (Yaoundé II); both the Arusha Agreement and the Yaoundé II Convention entered into force on 1 January 1971 for a period of five years.

== Content ==

The Arusha Agreement established a [[trade association]] (partial free-trade areas and joint institutions) but, unlike the Yaoundé II Convention, without financial and technical cooperation. Accordingly, the Agreement covered trade (Title I), the right of establishment and the provision of services (Title II), payments and capital (Title III), institutional provisions (Title IV), and general and final provisions (Title V).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/cardoc/CAHIER_SPECIAL_2011-WEBEN.pdf] Pg. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astroturfing''' is the practice of masking the [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]s of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or [[public relation]]s) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by [[grassroots]] participants. It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's financial connection. The term ''astroturfing'' is derived from [[AstroTurf]], a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to resemble natural grass, as a play on the word "grassroots." The implication behind the use of the term is that instead of a "true" or "natural" grassroots effort behind the activity in question, there is a "fake" or "artificial" appearance of support.

==Definition==
In political science, it is defined as the process of seeking electoral victory or legislative relief for grievances by helping political actors find and mobilize a sympathetic public, and is designed to create the image of public consensus where there is none.&lt;ref name="Howard2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard|first1=Philip N.|title=Digitizing the Social Contract: Producing American Political Culture in the Age of New Media|journal=The Communication Review|volume=6|issue=3|year=2003|pages=213–45|doi=10.1080/10714420390226270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Philip N. |date=2005 |title=New Media Campaigns and the Managed Citizen |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/american-government-politics-and-policy/new-media-campaigns-and-managed-citizen |location=New York, NY |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=93, 144 |isbn=9780521612272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astroturfing is the use of fake [[grassroots]] efforts that primarily focus on influencing public opinion and typically are funded by corporations and governmental entities to form opinions.&lt;ref name="ChoMartens2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=Charles H.|last2=Martens|first2=Martin L.|last3=Kim|first3=Hakkyun|last4=Rodrigue|first4=Michelle|title=Astroturfing Global Warming: It Isn’t Always Greener on the Other Side of the Fence|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=104|issue=4|year=2011|pages=571–587|issn=0167-4544|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0950-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Internet, astroturfers use software to mask their identity. Sometimes one individual operates through many personas to give the impression of widespread support for their client's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Cory Doctorow, [http://boingboing.net/2011/02/18/hbgarys-high-volume.html "HBGary's high-volume astroturfing technology and the Feds who requested it"], ''boingboing'', February 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ludlow, [http://www.thenation.com/article/174851/strange-case-barrett-brown%23axzz2X9RMrDLN "The Strange Case of Barrett Brown"], ''The Nation'', June 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies suggest astroturfing can alter public viewpoints and create enough doubt to inhibit action.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Lyon and John W. Maxwell, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1430-9134.2004.00023.x/abstract;jsessionid=AC65BEC2EC9B443D3BBF57D9D1098593.f04t02?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= "Astroturf: Interest Group Lobbying and Corporate Strategy"], 'Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy', October 13th, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the first systematic study of astroturfing in the United States, Oxford Professor [[Philip N. Howard]] argued that the internet was making it much easier for powerful lobbyists and political movements to activate small groups of aggrieved citizens to have an exaggerated importance in public policy debates.&lt;ref name="Howard2006"/&gt;

==Policies and enforcement==
Many countries have laws that prohibit more overt astroturfing practices.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malbon|first1=Justin|title=Taking Fake Online Consumer Reviews Seriously|journal=Journal of Consumer Policy|volume=36|issue=2|year=2013|pages=139–157|issn=0168-7034|doi=10.1007/s10603-012-9216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) may send cease-and-desist orders or require a fine of $16,000 per day for those that violate its "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf|title=Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC's guides were updated in 2009 to address social media and word-of-mouth marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/08/pr-firm-settles-with-ftc-over-alleged-app-store-astroturfing/|publisher=Ars Technica|title=PR firm settles with FTC over alleged App Store astroturfing|first=Chris|last=Foresman|date=August 27, 2010 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Giga Om|url=http://gigaom.com/2012/04/26/the-ethics-of-astro-turfing-sleazy-or-smart-business/|first=Jeff|last=Roberts|date=April 26, 2012|accessdate=June 20, 2014|title=The ethics of astro-turfing: sleazy or smart business?}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in the ''Journal of Consumer Policy'', the FTC's guides holds advertisers responsible for ensuring [[blogger (person)|bloggers]] or product endorsers comply with the guides, and any product endorsers with a material connection are required to provide honest reviews.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt;

In the [[European Union]], the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]] requires that paid-for editorial content in the media provide a clear disclosure that the content is a sponsored advertisement.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt; Additionally, it prohibits those with a material connection from misleading readers into thinking they are a regular consumer.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] has the [[Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/08/eu_consumer_protection_laws/|title=EU rolls out out astroturf guide for consumer laws|author=OUTLAW.COM|publisher=The Register|date=2009-12-08|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibits "Falsely representing oneself as a consumer." They allow for up to two years in prison and unlimited fines for breaches.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt; Additionally, the advertising industry in the UK has adopted many voluntary policies, such as the Code of Non-Broadcast Advertising, Sale, Promotion and Direct Marketing. A trade association, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]], investigates complaints of breaches. The policy requires that marketing professionals not mislead their audience, including by omitting a disclosure of their material connection.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt;

In [[Australia]] astroturfing is regulated by Section 18 of the [[Australian Consumer Law]], which broadly prohibits "misleading and deceptive conduct." According to the ''Journal of Consumer Policy'', Australia's laws, which were introduced in 1975, are more vague. In most cases, they are enforced through lawsuits from competitors, rather than the regulatory body, the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]].&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt; There is also an International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN).&lt;ref name="ls"/&gt;

Legal regulations are primarily targeted towards testimonials, endorsements and statements as to the performance or quality of a product. Employees of an organization may be considered acting as customers if their actions are not guided by authority within the company.&lt;ref name="ls"/&gt;

In October 2018, after denying that they had paid for people to show up in support of a controversial power plant development project in New Orleans, [[Entergy]] was fined five million dollars for using astroturf firm The Hawthorn Group to provide actors to prevent real community members' voices from being counted at city council meetings and show false grassroots support.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://www.wdsu.com/article/independent-report-on-entergy-paid-actors-scandal-released/24418971&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==

===Effectiveness===

In the book ''Grassroots for Hire: [[Public affairs industry|Public Affairs]] Consultants in American Democracy,'' Edward Walker defines "astroturfing" as public participation that is perceived as heavily incentivized, as fraudulent (claims are attributed to those who did not make such statements), or as an elite campaign masquerading as a mass movement.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Edward |date=2014 |title=Grassroots for Hire: Public Affairs Consultants in American Democracy |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/grassroots-hire-public-affairs-consultants-american-democracy?format=PB |location=Cambridge and New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=33 |isbn=9781107619012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not all campaigns by professional grassroots [[lobbying]] consultants meet this definition, the book finds that the elite-sponsored grassroots campaigns often fail when they are not transparent about their sources of sponsorship and/or fail to develop partnerships with constituencies that have an independent interest in the issue. Walker highlights the case of [[Working Families for Wal-Mart]], in which the campaign's lack of transparency led to its demise.

A study published in the ''Journal of [[Business Ethics]]'' examined the effects of websites operated by front groups on students. It found that astroturfing was effective at creating uncertainty and lowering trust about claims, thereby changing perceptions that tend to favor the business interests behind the astroturfing effort.&lt;ref name="ChoMartens2011"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that "consumer" reviews are more effective, because "they purport to be testimonials of real people, even though some are bought and sold just like everything else on the commercial Internet."&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; Some organizations feel that their business is threatened by negative comments, so they may engage in astroturfing to drown them out.&lt;ref name="set"/&gt; Online comments from astroturfing employees can also sway the discussion through the influence of [[groupthink]].&lt;ref name="bbctwo"/&gt;

===Justification===
Some astroturfing operatives defend their practice.&lt;ref name=summer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26312.html|title=The Summer of Astroturf|date=August 21, 2009|publisher=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|author=Ben Smith|author-link=Ben Smith (journalist)|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding "movements that have organized aggressively to exaggerate their sway," author Ryan Sager said that this "isn't cheating. Doing everything in your power to get your people to show up is basic politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=opinion|title= Keep Off the Astroturf |accessdate=2009-08-26|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/opinion/19sager.html?_r=1|first=Ryan|last=Sanger | date=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Porter/Novelli executive, "There will be times when the position you advocate, no matter how well framed and supported, will not be accepted by the public simply because you are who you are."&lt;ref name="Beder"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Beder| first = Sharon | title = Public Relations' Role in Manufacturing Artificial Grass Roots Coalitions | journal = Public Relations Quarterly | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 21–3 | publisher = Public Relations Quarterly | date = Summer 1998 | url = http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/PR.html | accessdate = April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on society===
Data mining expert Bing Liu ([[University of Illinois]]) estimated that one-third of all consumer reviews on the Internet are fake.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', this has made it hard to tell the difference between "popular sentiment" and "manufactured public opinion."&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-grandia/bonner-associates-the-lon_b_269976.html |title=Bonner &amp; Associates: The Long and Undemocratic History of Astroturfing|first=Kevin|last=Grandia|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=August 26, 2009|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in the ''Journal of Business Ethics'', astroturfing threatens the legitimacy of genuine grassroots movements. The authors argued that astroturfing that is "purposefully designed to fulfill corporate agendas, manipulate public opinion and harm scientific research represents a serious lapse in ethical conduct."&lt;ref name="ChoMartens2011"/&gt; A 2011 report found that often paid posters from competing companies are attacking each other in forums and overwhelming regular participants in the process.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite arXiv

The author said that it undermines the public's ability to inform potential customers of sub-standard products or inappropriate business practices, but also noted that fake reviews were difficult to detect.&lt;ref name="Malbon2013"/&gt;

==Techniques==
Use of one or more [[front groups]] is one astroturfing technique. These groups typically present themselves as serving the public interest, while actually working on behalf of a corporate or political sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Another technique is the use of [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppets]], where a single person creates multiple identities online to give the appearance of grassroots support. Sockpuppets may post positive reviews about a product, attack participants that criticize the organization, or post negative reviews and comments about competitors, under fake identities.&lt;ref name="set"&gt;"Company Settles With State Attorney General Over Fake Online Customer Reviews."

==History of incidents==

===Origins===
Although the term "astroturfing" was not yet developed, an early example of the practice was in Act 1, Scene 2 of [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. In the play, Cassius writes fake letters from "the public" to convince Brutus to assassinate Caesar.&lt;ref name="ls"/&gt; In the early 1900s [[disposable cup]] vendor [[Dixie Cup]]s convinced travelers to avoid public drinking cups found in trains and shops through a pamphlet called ''The Cup Campaigner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academicmuseum.lafayette.edu/special/dixie/company.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112065042/http://academicmuseum.lafayette.edu/special/dixie/company.html |archivedate=November 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet warned that public drinking cups could spread disease and did not disclose that the message was commercially motivated.&lt;ref name="science"/&gt; The term "astroturfing" was first coined in 1985 by [[Texas]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[United States Senate|senator]] [[Lloyd Bentsen]] when he said, "a fellow from Texas can tell the difference between grass roots and AstroTurf... this is generated mail."&lt;ref name="ls"&gt;Kolivos, Eugenia, and Anna Kuperman.

===Tobacco===
In response to the passage of tobacco control legislation in the US, [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], [[Burson-Marsteller]] and other tobacco interests created the [[National Smokers Alliance]] (NSA) in 1993. The NSA and other tobacco interests initiated an aggressive public relations campaign from 1994 to 1999 in an effort to exaggerate the appearance of grassroots support for smoker's rights. According to an article in the ''Journal of Health Communication'', the NSA had mixed success at defeating bills that were damaging revenues of tobacco interests.&lt;ref name="Givel2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Givel|first1=Michael|title=Consent and Counter-Mobilization: The Case of The National Smokers Alliance|journal=Journal of Health Communication|volume=12|issue=4|year=2007|pages=339–357|issn=1081-0730|doi=10.1080/10810730701326002|pmid=17558787}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
Email, automated phone calls, form letters, and the Internet made astroturfing more economical and prolific in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/feb/23/need-to-protect-internet-from-astroturfing | title = The need to protect the internet from 'astroturfing' grows ever more urgent | first = George | last = Monbiot | date = February 24, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location = London, UK | accessdate = February 24, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110223122306/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/feb/23/need-to-protect-internet-from-astroturfing| archivedate= February 23, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ostler2011"/&gt; In 2001, as [[Microsoft]] was defending itself against an antitrust lawsuit, [[Americans for Technology Leadership]] (ATL), a group heavily funded by Microsoft, initiated a letter-writing campaign. ATL contacted constituents under the guise of conducting a poll and sent pro-Microsoft consumers form and sample letters to send to involved lawmakers. The effort was designed to make it appear as though there was public support for a sympathetic ruling in the antitrust lawsuit.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The LA Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/23/news/mn-37472|title=Lobbyists Tied to Microsoft Wrote Citizens' Letters|date=August 23, 2001|first=Joseph|last=Menn|author2=Edmund Sanders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|title=Report: Microsoft funded 'grass roots' campaign|accessdate=November 19, 2012|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/23/news/mn-37472|date=August 21, 2001|first1=Joseph|last1=Menn|first2=Edmund|last2=Sanders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===

In 2009–2010, an [[Indiana University]] research study developed a software system to detect astroturfing on [[Twitter]] due to the sensitivity of the topic in the run up to the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 U.S. midterm elections]] and account suspensions on the social media platform. The study cited a limited number of examples, all promoting conservative policies and candidates.&lt;ref name="Ratkiewicz 2011 249–252"/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaai/&gt;&lt;ref name=PoliticalAbuse/&gt;

In 2003, GOPTeamLeader.com offered the site's users "points" that could be redeemed for products if they signed a form letter promoting [[George W.

In September 2013, New York Attorney General [[Eric T. Schneiderman]] announced a settlement with 19 companies to prevent astroturfing. "'Astroturfing' is the 21st century's version of false advertising, and prosecutors have many tools at their disposal to put an end to it," said Scheiderman. The companies paid $350,000 to settle the matter, but the settlement opened the way for private suits as well.

{{Neo-fascism}}

'''Authoritarianism''' is a term [[political scientist]]s use for a worldview that values [[orderliness]] and [[authority]], and distrusts outsiders and [[social change]]. As a form of [[government]], it is characterized by strong central power and limited [[political freedom]]s. Individual economic or personal freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional [[accountability]] under an authoritarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11431892/after-trump-how-authoritarian-voters-will-change-american-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite book|title=Government and Politics - Volume I|last=Sekiguchi|first=Masashi|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=9781905839698|page=92|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gkm5DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Linz]]'s influential 1964 description of authoritarianism&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ffbV8ZpQ3MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present]'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), p. 256 (note 67).&lt;/ref&gt; characterized authoritarian [[political system]]s by four qualities:
# Limited [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], that is such regimes place constraints on political institutions and groups like [[legislature]]s, [[Political party|political parties]] and [[interest group]]s;
# A basis for [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]] based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat "easily recognizable societal problems" such as [[underdevelopment]] or [[insurgency]]; 
# Minimal [[social mobilization]] most often caused by constraints on the public such as suppression of political opponents and anti-regime activity;
# Informally defined executive power with often vague and shifting powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Casper, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZVDjmr18f4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fragile Democracies: The Legacies of Authoritarian Rule], pp. 40–50 (citing Linz 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritarian government and states==
===Types===
Linz distinguished new forms of authoritarianism from personalistic dictatorships and totalitarian states, taking [[Francoist Spain]] as an example. Unlike personalistic dictatorships, new forms of authoritarianism have institutionalized representation of a variety of actors (in Spain's case, including the military, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]], [[technocrat]]s and others). Unlike totalitarian states, the regime relies on passive mass acceptance rather than popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Landman, ''Studying Human Rights'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 71 (citing Linz 1964 and others).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars also mention the emergence of a different type of regime - the hybrid regime - in the post-Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mufti |first1=Mariam |title=What Do We Know about Hybrid Regimes after Two Decades of Scholarship? |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=112 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1400 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1400|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several subtypes of authoritarian regimes have been identified by Linz and others.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"&gt;Mark J. Gasiorowski, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=uxO2QHFzlZsC |page=105 }} The Political Regimes Project], in ''On Measuring Democracy: Its Consequences and Concomitants'' (ed. Alex Inketes), 2006, pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Linz identified the two most basic subtypes as traditional authoritarian regimes and bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes:
* Traditional authoritarian regimes are those "in which the ruling authority (generally a single person)" is maintained in power "through a combination of appeals to traditional legitimacy, [[Clientelism|patron-client ties]] and repression, which is carried out by an apparatus bound to the ruling authority through personal loyalties". An example is [[Ethiopia]] under [[Haile Selassie&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; 
* Bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes are those "governed by a [[military junta|coalition of military officers]] and technocrats who act pragmatically (rather than ideologically) within the limits of their bureaucratic mentality."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; [[Mark J. Gasiorowski]] suggests that it is best to distinguish "simple military authoritarian regimes" from "bureaucratic authoritarian regimes" in which "a powerful group of technocrats uses the state apparatus to try to rationalize and develop the economy" such as [[South Korea]] under [[Park Chung-hee]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Linz also has identified three other subtypes of authoritarian regime: [[Corporatism|corporatist]] or organic-statistic, racial and ethnic "democracy" and post-totalitarian.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Corporatist authoritarian regimes "are those in which corporatism institutions are used extensively by the state to coopt and demobilize powerful interest groups". This type has been studied most extensively in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Racial and ethnic "democracies" are those in which "certain racial or ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others are largely or entirely denied those rights", such as in [[South Africa under apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Post-totalitarian authoritarian regimes are those in which totalitarian institutions (such as the party, [[secret police]] and state-controlled mass media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heinrich |first1=Andreas |last2=Pleines |first2=Heiko |title=The Meaning of 'Limited Pluralism' in Media Reporting under Authoritarian Rule |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=103 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1238 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1238|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) remain, but where "ideological orthodoxy has declined in favor of routinization, repression has declined, the state's top leadership is less personalized and more secure, and the level of mass mobilization has declined substantially".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt; Examples include the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern bloc]] states in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Authoritarian regimes are also sometimes subcategorized by whether they are personalistic or [[Populism|populist]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes are characterized by arbitrary rule and [[authority]] exercised "mainly through patronage networks and coercion rather than through institutions and formal rules".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes have been seen in post-colonial Africa. By contrast, populist authoritarian regimes "are mobilizational regimes in which a strong, charismatic, manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower-class groups".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Examples include [[Argentina]] under [[Juan Perón|Perón]],&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Egypt under Nasser&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; and [[Venezuela]]  under [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]] and [[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Onis, [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/juan-de-onis/after-chavez-authoritarianism-still-threatens-latin-america "After Chavez, Authoritarianism Still Threatens Latin America"], ''World Affairs'' (May 15, 2013): "the followers of the late President Hugo Chávez continue to apply the playbook of authoritarian populism throughout Latin America in their pursuit of more power...one of the Mercosur partners are challenging the basic political practices of authoritarian populism implanted in Venezuela."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, [http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/latin-america%E2%80%99s-authoritarian-drift-threat-populist-left "Latin America's Authoritarian Drift: The Threat from the Populist Left"], ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'', Vol. 23, Issue 3 (July 2013), pp. 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and [[Centralized government|centralized]] power maintained by [[political repression]] and the exclusion of potential challengers. It uses [[Political party|political parties]] and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime.&lt;ref name="Vestal"&gt;Theodore M. Vesta, ''[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=XWXtXOl56KkC&amp;c |page=17 }} Ethiopia: A Post-Cold War African State]''. Greenwood, 1999, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Przeworski]] has theorized that "authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies, fear and economic prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Democracy and the Market: Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfjv6snK0-EC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1991-07-26|isbn = 9780521423359|first = Adam|last = Przeworski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of [[Power (politics)|political power]], a leadership that is "self-appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens' free choice among competitors", the arbitrary deprivation of [[civil liberties]] and little tolerance for meaningful [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

A range of [[social control]]s also attempt to stifle [[civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer Y. J.|last2=Hsu|first2=Carolyn L.|last3=Hasmath|first3=Reza|date=2016|title=NGO Strategies in an Authoritarian Context, and their Implications for Citizenship: The Case of the People's Republic of China|ssrn=2657187|journal=|location=|publisher=American Sociological Association Annual Meeting (Seattle), August 20–23.|volume=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the [[military|armed forces]], a bureaucracy staffed by the regime and creation of [[allegiance]] through various means of [[socialization]] and indoctrination.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarian political systems may be weakened through "inadequate performance to demands of the people".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Vestal writes that the tendency to respond to challenges to authoritarianism through tighter control instead of [[adaptation]] is a significant weakness and that this overly rigid approach fails to "adapt to changes or to accommodate growing demands on the part of the populace or even groups within the system".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Because the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state is dependent on performance, authoritarian states that fail to adapt may collapse.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarianism is marked by "indefinite political tenure" of the ruler or [[ruling party]] (often in a [[one-party state]]) or other authority.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; The transition from an authoritarian system to a more [[Democracy|democratic]] form of government is referred to as [[democratization]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

John Duckitt suggests a link between authoritarianism and [[collectivism]], asserting that both stand in opposition to [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Duckitt | first1 = J. | title = Authoritarianism and Group Identification: A New View of an Old Construct | jstor = 3791588 | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–84 | year = 1989 | doi = 10.2307/3791588  |registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duckitt writes that both authoritarianism and collectivism submerge [[individual rights]] and goals to group goals, expectations and [[Conformity|conformities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kemmelmeier | first1 = M. | last2 = Burnstein | first2 = E. | last3 = Krumov | first3 = K. | last4 = Genkova | first4 = P. | last5 = Kanagawa | first5 = C. | last6 = Hirshberg | first6 = M.

===Authoritarianism and totalitarianism===
{{Revolution sidebar}}

[[Totalitarianism]] is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control. Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:&lt;ref name="Sondrol"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sondrol |first1 = P. C. |title = Totalitarian and Authoritarian Dictators: A Comparison of Fidel Castro and Alfredo Stroessner |journal = Journal of Latin American Studies |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |page = 599 |year = 2009 |doi = 10.1017/S0022216X00015868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of [[autocracy]], they differ in "key [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]":
{{quote|(1) Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren, totalitarian dictators develop a [[charisma]]tic "[[Cult of personality|mystique]]" and a mass-based, pseudo-democratic [[interdependence]] with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image.
(2) [[wikt:concomitant|Concomitant]] role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians. Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings largely content to control and often maintain the status quo. Totalitarian self-conceptions are largely [[Teleology|teleological]]. The [[tyrant]] is less a person than an indispensable function to guide and reshape the universe.

(3) Consequently, the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians. Lacking the binding appeal of [[ideology]], authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators, engendering a [[kleptocracy]].&lt;ref name="Sondrol"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Compared to totalitarianism, "the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society. It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty. Totalitarianism, on the other hand, invades [[private life]] and asphyxiates it".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinction is that "authoritarianism is not animated by utopian ideals in the way totalitarianism is. It does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of ... industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism and democracy===
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Authoritarianism and democracy are not fundamentally opposed to one another, as it is possible for democracies to possess authoritarian elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frantz |first1=Erica |title=Authoritarian Politics: Trends and Debates |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1498 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1498|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[illiberal democracy]] (or [[procedural democracy]]) is distinguished from [[liberal democracy]] (or [[substantive democracy]]) in that illiberal democracies lack features such as the [[rule of law]], protections for minority groups and an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Thomas H. Henriksen, ''American Power after the Berlin Wall'' (Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 199: "experts emphasize that elections alone, without the full democratic panoply of an independent judiciary, free press, and viable political parties, constitute, in reality, illiberal democracies, which still menace their neighbors and destabilize their regions."
*  David P. Forsythe, ''Human Rights in International Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 231: "Illiberal democracies may have reasonably free and fair national elections based on broad suffrage, but they do not counteract the tyranny of the majority with effective protections for ethnic and religious minorities or various types of dissenters."
* Rod Hague &amp; Martin Harrop, ''Political Science: A Comparative Introduction'' (7th ed.: Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 259: "The gradual implementation of the rule of law and due process is an accomplishment of liberal politics, provide a basis for distinguishing liberal from illiberal democracies, and both from authoritarian regimes."
* Vladimir Popov, "Circumstances versus Policy Choices: Why Has the Economic Performance of the Soviet Successor States Been So Poor" in ''After the Collapse of Communism: Comparative Lessons of Transition'' (eds. [[Michael McFaul]] &amp; Kathryn Stoner-Weiss: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 20: "The least efficient institutions are in illiberal democracies combining poor rule of law with democracy ... Less democratic regimes with weak rule of law ... appear to do better than illiberal democracies in maintaining institutional capacity."&lt;/ref&gt;

A further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another; research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars (sometimes called [[militarized interstate dispute]]s) causing fewer battle deaths with one another and that democracies have far fewer [[civil war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Some commentators, such as [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], believed that low-income authoritarian regimes have certain technocratic "efficiency-enhancing advantages" over low-income democracies, helping authoritarian regimes generate development.&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;Morton H. Halperin, Joseph T. Siegle, &amp; Michael M. Weinstein, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JiNLH1I50PkC The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace]'' ([[Council on Foreign Relations]]/Psychology Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morton H. Halperin]], Joseph T. Siegle and Michael M. Weinstein (2005) counter this belief, arguing that the evidence has shown that there is no "authoritarian advantage" and that there is a "democratic advantage" instead.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin et al. argue that democracies "realize superior development performance" over authoritarianism. They point out that poor democracies are more likely to have steadier economic growth and less likely to experience economic and humanitarian catastrophes than authoritarian regimes; that civil liberties act as a curb on corruption and misuse of resources; and that democracies are more adaptable.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin point out that the vast majority of refugee crises and financial catastrophes occur in authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt;

Studies suggest that several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita, size of the public sector or income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Franco |first1 = Á. |last2 = Álvarez-Dardet |first2 = C. |last3 = Ruiz |first3 = M.

==Characteristics==
===Systemic weakness and resilience===
[[Andrew J. Nathan]] notes that "regime theory holds that authoritarian systems are inherently fragile because of weak legitimacy, overreliance on coercion, overcentralization of decision making, and the predominance of personal power over institutional norms....Few authoritarian regimes—be they communist, fascist, corporatist, or personalist—have managed to conduct orderly, peaceful, timely, and stable successions".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"&gt;Andrew J. Nathan, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/38546/summary "Authoritarian Resilience"], ''Journal of Democracy'', 14.1 (2003), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to this general trend is the endurance of the authoritarian rule of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which has been unusually resilient among authoritarian regimes.  Nathan posits that this can be attributed to four factors: (1) "the increasingly norm-bound nature of its succession politics"; (2) "the increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the promotion of political elites"; (3) "the differentiation and functional specialization of institutions within the regime"; and (4) "the establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal that strengthen the CCP's legitimacy among the public at large".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"/&gt;

===Gender and authoritarianism===
According to a study by Brandt and Henry, there is a direct correlation between the rates of [[gender inequality]] and the levels of authoritarian ideas in the male and female populations. It was found that in countries with less gender equality where individualism was encouraged and men occupied the dominant societal roles, women were more likely to support traits such as obedience which would allow them to survive in an authoritarian environment and less likely to encourage ideas such as independence and imagination. In countries with higher levels of gender equality, men held less authoritarian views. It is theorized that this occurs due to the stigma attached to individuals who question the cultural norms set by the dominant individuals and establishments in an authoritarian society as a way to prevent the psychological stress caused by the active ostracizing of the stigmatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Brandt |first2=P.

There is no precise definition of authoritarianism, but several annual measurements are attempted, including [[Freedom House]]’s annual [[Freedom in the World]] report.

===Current===
The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of states which are currently (or frequently) characterized as authoritarian:

==Historical trends==
===Anti-authoritarianism===
{{Main|Anti-authoritarianism}}
Both [[World War II]] (ending in 1945) and the later [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1991) resulted in the replacement of authoritarian regimes by either democratic regimes or regimes that were less authoritarian.

[[World War II]] saw the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]]. All the Axis powers — [[Nazi Germany]], Fascist Italy and the [[Empire of Japan]] — had totalitarian or authoritarian governments, and two of the three were replaced by governments based on democratic constitutions. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] were an alliance of Democratic states and (later) the Communist [[Soviet Union]]. At least in Western Europe the initial post-war era embraced pluralism and freedom of expression in areas that had been under control of authoritarian regimes.  The memory of fascism and nazism was denigrated. The new [[Federal Republic of Germany]] banned its expression.  In reaction to the centralism of the Nazi state, for example, the new constitution of West Germany ([[Federal Republic of Germany]]) exercised "[[separation of powers]]" and  placed "[[Law enforcement in Germany|law enforcement]] firmly in the hands" of the sixteen ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' or states of the republic, not with the federal German government (at least not at first).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/security/federal-police/federal-police-node.html The Federal Police]. Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community of Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally there was also a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on [[anti-fascism]] in Western Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from [[German-occupied Europe|occupation]] and to fears arising from the development of [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="swcjsb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sign Wars: The Culture Jammers Strike Back! |last=Cox |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=LedaTape Organisation |isbn=978-0-9807701-5-5 |page=108 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=zKo8DrmamAwC |page= }} |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-authoritarianism also became associated with [[countercultural]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] movements such as the [[Beat Generation]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/beatgeneration.html|title=Retired Site PBS Programs |website=pbs.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hippies]] in the 1960s&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;"The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom&amp;nbsp;... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe."{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "The Way of the Hippy"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Punk subculture|punk]]s in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McLaughlin | first = Paul | title = Anarchism and Authority | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7546-6196-2 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Uruguay moved away from dictatorships to democracy between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The challenge of the past |journal=The Economist |date=22 October 1998 |url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/1998/10/22/the-challenge-of-the-past |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] in [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991]], the other authoritarian/totalitarian "half" of the Allied Powers of WWII collapsed. This led not so much to revolt against authority in general, but to the belief that authoritarian states (and state control of economies) were outdated. 
&lt;ref name="Tharoor-wapo-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tharoor |first1=Ishaan |title=The man who declared `the end of history` fears for democracy's future |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/09/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-fears-for-democracys-future/?noredirect=on |accessdate=4 October 2018 |agency=Washington Post |date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea that "liberal democracy was the final form toward which all political striving was directed",&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; became very popular in Western countries and was celebrated in [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; According to Charles H. Fairbanks, Jr., "all the new states that stumbled out of the ruins of the Soviet bloc, except Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, seemed indeed to be moving toward democracy in the early 1990s," as where the countries of East Central Europe and the Balkans.&lt;ref name="causes-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fairbanks, Jr. |first1=Charles H. |title=Causes of Authoritarianism in the Former Soviet Republics |url=https://ge.boell.org/en/2014/01/16/causes-authoritarianism-former-soviet-republics |website=Heinrich Boell Stiftung |accessdate=5 October 2018 |date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, the "[[Arab Spring]]" arose in response to unrest over economic stagnation but also in opposition to oppressive authoritarian regimes, first in [[Tunisia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/19/uk-tunisia-protests-bouaziziidUKTRE70I7TV20110119|title=Peddler’s martyrdom launched Tunisia’s revolution.

Regimes were toppled in  [[Tunisia]] [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Yemen]], and other countries saw riots, civil wars or insurgencies.&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruthven|first1=Malise|title=How to Understand ISIS|journal=New York Review of Books|date=23 June 2016|volume=63|issue=11|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|accessdate=12 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807014415/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authoritarian revival===
From 2005 to 2015 observers noted what some called a "democratic recession"&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ignatieff |first1=Michael |title=Are the Authoritarians Winning? |journal=New York Review of Books |date=10 July 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/06/28/hitlers-rise-it-can-happen-here/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levitsky |first1=Steven |last2=Way |first2=Lucan |title=The Myth of Democratic Recession |journal=Journal of Democracy |date=January 2015 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=45–58 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Levitsky-26-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although some — Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way — have disputed this theory).&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"/&gt; 
In 2018 [[Freedom House]] declared that from 2006 to 2018, "113 countries" around the world showed "a net decline" in "political rights and civil liberties" while "only 62" experienced "a net improvement."&lt;ref name="FH-2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2018 Democracy in Crisis |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 |website=Freedom House |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2018, U.S. political journalist David Frum stated:

A '''cabinet crisis''' or '''government crisis''' is a situation when the [[government]] is challenged before the [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] period expires, because it threatens to resign over a proposal, or it is at risk at being dismissed after a [[motion of no confidence]], a conflict between the parties in a [[coalition government]] or a [[coup d'état]]. It may also be the result of there being no clear majority willing to work together to form a government.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} During this period a [[caretaker government]] with a limited mandate may take care of the day-to-day affairs of the state, while waiting for a [[snap election]].

{{About|the Jewish-Palestinian ideological movement|ancient Canaanite polytheism|Canaanite religion}}
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
{{Israelis}}
'''Canaanism''' was a cultural and ideological movement founded in 1939 that reached its peak in the 1940s among the [[Jews]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It has had significant effect on the course of Israeli art, [[Israeli literature|literature]] and spiritual and political thought. Its adherents were called '''Canaanites''' ({{lang-he-n|כנענים}}). The movement's original name was the ''Council for the Coalition of Hebrew Youth'' ({{Hebrew|הוועד לגיבוש הנוער העברי}}); "Canaanism" was originally a pejorative term. It grew out of [[Revisionist Zionism]] and according to Ron Kuzar had "its early roots in [[Far-right politics|European extreme right-wing]] movements, notably [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascism]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kuzar 107, 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; which was not anti-Semitic like [[Nazism|German national socialism]]. Most of its members were part of the [[Irgun]] or [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]].&lt;ref name="Kuzar 13"&gt;Kuzar 13&lt;/ref&gt; Canaanism never had more than around two dozen registered members, but because most of these were influential intellectuals and artists, the movement had an influence far beyond its size,&lt;ref name="kuzar107"&gt;Kuzar 197&lt;/ref&gt; Its members believed that much of the Middle East had been a Hebrew-speaking civilization in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Kuzar 12"&gt;Kuzar 12&lt;/ref&gt; Kuzar also says they hoped to revive this civilization, creating a "Hebrew" nation, disconnected from the Jewish past, which would embrace the Middle East's Arab population as well.&lt;ref name="Kuzar 12"/&gt;  They saw both "world Jewry and world Islam" as backward and medieval; Ron Kuzar writes that the movement "exhibited an interesting blend of militarism and power politics toward the Arabs as an organized community on the one hand and a welcoming acceptance of them as individuals to be redeemed from medieval darkness on the other."&lt;ref name="Kuzar 13"/&gt;

==The Canaanites and Judaism==
The movement was founded in 1939. In 1943 the Jewish-Palestinian poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] published an "Epistle to the Hebrew Youth", the first manifesto of the Canaanites. In this tract, Ratosh called upon Hebrew youth to disaffiliate themselves from [[Judaism]], and declared that no meaningful bond united Hebrew youth residing in Palestine and Judaism. Ratosh argued that Judaism was not a [[nation]] but a [[religion]], and as such it was universal, without territorial claims; one could be Jewish anywhere. For a nation to genuinely arise in Palestine, he maintained, the youth must uncouple from Judaism and form a [[Hebrew]] nation with its own unique identity.

The Council for the Coalition of Hebrew Youth calls upon you as a Hebrew, as one for whom the Hebrew homeland is a homeland in actuality: not as vision, nor as desire; and not as solution for the Jewish question, nor as solution to cosmic questions, and not as solution to the variegated neuroses of those stricken by the diaspora. As one for whom the Hebrew language is a language in actuality and practicality, a mother tongue, a language of culture and of the soul; the one and only language for emotion and thought. As one whose character and intellect were determined in the Hebrew reality, whose internal landscape is the landscape of the nation and whose past is the past of the nation alone. As one who, despite the best efforts of rootless parents, teachers, statesmen and religious leaders, could not be made to like and affiliate with the [[Shtetl]] and the history of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], the pogroms and expulsions and martyrs, and whose natural estrangement from all prophets of Zionism, the fathers of Jewish Literature in the Hebrew tongue, and the diaspora mentality and the diaspora problem, cannot be expunged. Whereas all these were conferred upon you by force, like a borrowed cloth, faded and tattered and too-tight.&lt;ref name="epistle"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Out of their estrangement from Judaism the Canaanites were also estranged from [[Zionism]]. The [[Israel|State of Israel]] ought to be, they argued, a [[Jewish state|Hebrew state]], not a solution to the [[Jewish Question]]. Following the first [[Aliyah|Aliyot]], a generation arose in Palestine that spoke Hebrew as a native language and did not always identify with Judaism. Designating the Israeli People as a "Jewish People", the Canaanites argued, was misleading. If it was possible to be a Jew anywhere, then the State of Israel was merely an anecdote in the [[history of Judaism]]. A nation must be rooted in a territory and a language—things which Judaism, in its very nature, could not provide.

==Canaanites and history==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

The movement promoted the idea that the [[Land of Israel]] was that of ancient [[Canaan]] (or, according to others, the whole of the [[Fertile Crescent]]) in which ancient peoples and cultures had lived, and that the historical occasion of the reemergence of an Israeli people constituted a veritable revival of these selfsame ancient Hebrews and their civilization, and consequently a rejection of religious Judaism in favor of a native and rooted Hebrew identity.

Because the Canaanites sought to create in Israel a new people, they mandated the dissociation of [[Israelis]] from Judaism and the history of Judaism. In their stead they placed the culture and history of the [[Ancient Near East]], which they considered the true historical reference. They argued that the people of the Land of Israel in the days of the biblical monarchs had not been [[Jews|Jewish]] but [[Hebrews|Hebrew]], and had shared a cultural context with other peoples of the region. Citing contemporary [[biblical criticism]], the Canaanites argued that the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh]] reflected this ancient history, but only partly, since it had been compiled in the period of the [[Second Temple]] by Jewish [[Scribe|scribes]] who had rewritten the history of the region to suit their world-view.

Much of the Canaanite effort was dedicated to researching the history of the [[Middle East]] and its peoples. The Canaanites cited approvingly the work of [[Umberto Cassuto]], who translated [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] poetry into Hebrew. ([[Ugarit]] was an ancient city located in modern-day northern [[Syria]], where in the early 20th century many important ancient texts, written in the [[Ugaritic language]], were discovered.) Ugaritic verse bore an uncanny resemblance to the language of the [[Tanakh]]. The Canaanites argued that these texts proved that the people of the [[Land of Israel]] had been much closer socially and culturally to other peoples of the region than they had been to Judaism.

==Canaanites and literature==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
In his book, ''Sifrut Yehudit ba-lashon ha-ʻIvrit'' (Jewish Literature in the Hebrew Tongue), Yonatan Ratosh sought to differentiate between [[Hebrew literature]] and [[Jewish literature]] written in the [[Hebrew language]]. Jewish literature, Ratosh claimed, could be and was written in any number of languages. The ideas and writing style that characterize Jewish literature in Hebrew were not substantially different from those of Jewish literature in other languages. Ratosh and his fellow Canaanites (especially [[Aharon Amir]]) thought that Hebrew literature should be rooted to its historical origins in the [[Land of Israel]] and the [[Hebrew language]]. As an example they noted American literature, which in their mind was newly created for the new American people.

Canaanite verse is often obscure to those unfamiliar with ancient Ugaritic and [[Canaanite mythology]]. One of the principal techniques used by the Canaanites to produce Hebrew literature was to adopt words and phrases (especially [[hapax legomenon|hapax legomena]], which the Canaanites regarded as traces of the original unedited Hebraic Tanakh) from the Tanakh, and use them in a poetic that approximated [[Biblical poetry|biblical]] and Ugaritic verse, especially in their use of repetitive structures and [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]. The Canaanites did not rule out the use of new Hebrew words, but many of them did avoid [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Hebrew. However, these characteristics represent only the core of the Canaanite movement, and not its full breadth.

The late literary scholar [[Baruch Kurzweil]] argued that the Canaanites were not ''[[sui generis]]'', but a direct continuation (albeit a radical one) of the literature of [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]].

==Canaanites and language==
Ratosh and his brother, [[Uzzi Ornan]], also sought for the [[Romanization of Hebrew]] in order to further divorce the language from the older [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Writing articles in the Hebrew-language press in the 1960s and 1970s, they criticized the Hebrew alphabet for its graphical shortcomings and relationship with Judaism, and proposed for official Romanization of the language in order to further free secular Hebrew Israelis from the hold of religion and integrate them into the larger [[Levant|Levantine region]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Diamond, Homeland or Holy Land? The ‘Canaanite’ Critique of Israel (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yaakov Shavit, The New Hebrew Nation (London: Frank Cass, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Their proposals for wholesale Romanization met condemnation from various public figures due to the perception that Romanization was a means of assimilation and Levantinization.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Raizen, “Romanization of the Hebrew Script,” 1987. (University of Texas Press) pp. 41–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aytürk later compared the Canaanite proposal for Romanization to the more successful reform of the [[Turkish alphabet]] [[Atatürk's Reforms|as undertaken by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in [[Turkey]]; the reform of Turkish spelling, which had previously been written in the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]-based [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] for over 1,000 years until the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], was similarly motivated by Atatürk's attempts to secularize and modernize post-Ottoman Turkish society.&lt;ref&gt;İlker Aytürk, "Script Charisma in Hebrew and Turkish: A Comparative Framework for Explaining Success and Failure of Romanization," Journal of World History, Volume 21, Number 1, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

The Coalition published a journal, ''[[Aleph]]'', which ran from 1948-1953, featuring the works of several luminaries of the movement including Ratosh, [[Adia Horon]], [[Uzzi Ornan]], [[Amos Kenan]] and [[Benjamin Tammuz]]. It was edited by [[Aharon Amir]], and the journal circulated erratically throughout its existence.

The history of the Coalition and the movement was fraught with controversy and opposition. In 1951, leaflets were distributed by self-identified Canaanites in opposition to Zionism during the [[World Zionist Congress]] in Jerusalem that year. Later that year, the Coalition was formally organized at a conference of ideologues, but the permit to formally register as an NGO was deliberately delayed by the Interior Ministry; the ministry's representative explained that the approval has been delayed because "the group did not complete the standard inquiry of the granting of approvals for political societies". The group claimed as many as 500 members at its height, although outside commentators only assessed the membership at around 100.

After the arrest of Amos Kenan in June 1952 on suspicion of throwing a bomb onto the doorstep of [[David-Zvi Pinkas]], newspaper editorials were lodged against the Canaanite movement and its members. The Coalition claimed to have no connection to Kenan or his act, and both Amir and Ratosh filed a [[defamation|libel suit]] against [[Isaiah Bernstein]] of ''[[HaTzofe]]'' and [[Ezriel Carlebach]] from ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]'' on behalf of the Coalition, but the suit was rejected for technical reasons.

In the 1960s, the movement's members participated in group discussions called "Hebrew Thought Clubs" and issued a booklet of their discussions as "the first claw." Among participants in the discussions were also identified individuals who were Canaanites, as [[Rostam Bastuni]], an Israeli Arab who was a member of the second Knesset for Mapam, and [[Yehoshua Palmon]].

==Scope and influence==
[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|200px|''Nimrod'' (1939) by [[Yitzhak Danziger]], a visual emblem of the Canaanite idea.]]
The political influence of the Canaanites was limited, but their influence on literary and intellectual life in Israel was great. Among the avowed Canaanites were the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] and thinkers such as [[Edya Horon]]. A series of articles which Horon published in the journal "Keshet" in 1965 were compiled after his death into a book and published in 2000. These articles constituted political and cultural manifestos that sought to create a direct connection between [[Semitic culture]] from the second millennium BCE and contemporary Israeli culture, relying on advancements in the fields of [[archeology]] and research of [[Semitic languages]] in [[linguistics]].

Some of the artists who took after the movement were the sculptor [[Yitzhak Danziger]] (whose ''Nimrod'' became a visual emblem of the Canaanite idea), novelist [[Benjamin Tammuz]], writer [[Amos Kenan]], novelist and translator [[Aharon Amir]], thinker and linguist [[Uzzi Ornan]] and many others.

The journalist [[Uri Avnery]] praised Horon's journal ''[[Shem]]'' in 1942 but did not subscribe to Ratosh's orthodoxy; in 1947 he derided the Canaanites as [[Romanticism|romantic]], anachronistic, and divorced from reality.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 135-37, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the influence of Canaanism is still evident in some of his political thought, such as his 1947 proposal for a pan-Semitic union of Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 141&lt;/ref&gt;  Avnery, along with several former Canaanites (notably Kenan and [[Boaz Evron]]) later changed positions drastically, becoming advocates for a Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 151-153&lt;/ref&gt;  Israeli leftists and secularists are sometimes accused of Canaanism or Canaanite influence by their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 20: "Some observers, very ironically, still find strong echoes of Canaanite ideology in what they consider anti-religious and leftist political opinions".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalterraincognita.blogspot.nl/2008/03/terra-incognita-26-jewish-tourism.html "Jewish tourism, mexican racism and canaanism,"] Terra Incognita, Issue 26, A Publication of Seth J.

The idea of creating a new people in Palestine different from the Jewish life in the diaspora which preceded it never materialized in purist Canaanite conception, but nevertheless had a lasting effect on the self-understanding of many spheres of Israeli public life.

==Criticism==
The Canaanite movement, since soon after its inception, has met with heavy criticism. In 1945 [[Nathan Alterman]] published the poem "Merivat Kayitz" (later included in the collection ''Yr HaYona'', published in 1958), which took issue with the central tenets of the Canaanite movement. Alterman and others claimed that so many years in the diaspora cannot be simply expunged. Alterman argued that no one should coerce the Jewish settlement to adopt an identity; its identity will be determined through its experience in time.

Ratosh responded with an article in 1950 in which he claimed that Alterman was dodging important questions about Israeli identity. He argued that a return to ancient Hebrew traditions is not only feasible but necessary.

Alterman was not the only person to speak out against the Canaanites. Among the important critics of the movement was [[Baruch Kurzweil]], who published ''The Roots and Quintessence of the 'Young Hebrews' Movement'' in 1953, which analyzed and sharply criticized Canaanite ideas. Kurzweil argued that the Canaanite ambition to motivate the variegated ethnography of the region in a single direction was not as easy as the Canaanites believed. Kurzweil believed the Canaanites replaced [[logos]] with [[Mythology|mythos]], producing a religious delusion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since it itself neglects the historical continuity of its people, introduces obscure concepts into their political vision in its declarations of a 'Hebrew Land on the Euphrates', and relies on increasingly irrational argumentation, the movement is liable to find itself an escape into the realm of myth.

The Young Hebrews are not the first to launch themselves into the task of mythic renewal. Their original contribution is rather stale. For over a hundred years, the world has pined for a return to the lap of myth.  The escapes into various myths have hitherto inflicted disasters upon humanity. In the spirit of good faith, it is best to assume that the whole chapter of mythic renewal in European thought is unclear to them. For the moment, we shall content ourselves with this quotation from [[Johan Huizinga|Huizinga]]: "Barbarization sets in when, in an old culture… the vapors of the magic and fantastic rise up again from the seething brew of passions to cloud the understanding: when the mythos supplants the logos."&lt;ref name="huizinga"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same article Kurzweil argues that, if no viable alternative was found, the Canaanite movement might become the leading political ideology in Israel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">A '''comeback''', in terms of [[publicity]], is a return by a well-known person to the activity in which they initially obtained their fame. Comebacks can occur in all walks of life, and have been noted to occur in entertainment, sports, and politics.

A comeback may occur after a public figure has been forced to withdraw from the public eye due to a real or perceived scandal.

==Entertainment==
An entertainer may make a comeback after having been absent from their area of entertainment for a time.

In South Korea, [[Comeback (K-pop)]], talent agencies stage-manage the debut of new acts in order to create anticipation for the new act, which will often officially debut live on one of the main television music programs with a "debut stage". For the debut [[Single (music)|single]], acts will have an overall "[[gimmick|concept]]", a marketing hook, which influences the name of the act, clothes, choreography, catch phrases and how they are presented; within bands individual members will have a personal concept, this being a role that they will play within the band, e.g. leader, visual, maknae, rapper e.t.c. Once a rookie act's debut cycle has ended they enter their second promotional cycle with a "comeback", called as such even when the musician or group in question did not go on hiatus.&lt;ref name="ramstadwsj"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramstad|first=Evan|title=Korea Counts Down Not Just To New Year, But to New Girls' Album|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/12/31/korea-counts-down-not-just-to-new-year-but-to-new-girls-album/|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=5 January 2013|quote=One of the unique things about album releases by K-pop artists is that they are routinely called 'comebacks' even when there's been no evidence that the musician or group went away or, in the conventional sports usage of the term, experienced a setback or loss.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each promotional cycle will be presented with its own concept.

==Sports==
{{distinguish|Comeback (sports)}}
In sports, a comeback occurs where an athlete or a team returns to success after a period of poor performance or inactivity. "The comeback may be the most compelling phenomenon in sports. ... Comebacks in individual sports like tennis, boxing, or golf occur more commonly than in team sports, as athletes in these games have more control over their destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Rick Swaine, ''Baseball's Comeback Players: Forty Major Leaguers Who Fell and Rose Again'' (2014), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
A politician may make a comeback after having left public life, either voluntarily or through loss of an election.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Shlomit Barnea, "Chronicles of the Comeback that Was and the One that Almost Was", in Asher Arian, Michal Shamir, ''The Elections in Israel 2009'' (2011), p. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Corngate'''" was a political [[scandal]] which took place in [[New Zealand]] in 2002 and involved the suspected release of [[genetically modified maize]] (corn) seed in 2000. 

==Background==
The possibility of the presence of a small percentage of GE corn in a seed shipment from the [[United States|U.S.]] was raised publicly by [[Nicky Hager]] in his book ''[[Seeds of Distrust]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hager|first=Nicky|title=Seeds of Distrust|publisher=Craig Potton Publishing|location=Nelson, N.Z. |year=2002|isbn=0-908802-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage was found well after sowing to be above "allowable limits" of contamination - the allowable limit being zero as the question of the accidental presence of GE content or the unreliability of low level testing had not been considered. The results showing GE contamination were later seen as being a PCR artifact, likely being due to contamination of the samples rather than the corn.

It became politically important due to the [[New Zealand Green Party]] stance on [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] crops. The ruling [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] policy regarding GE research was brought into the argument allowing Corngate to become an election issue as the book, ''Seeds of Distrust'' was released a few months prior to the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 Parliamentary elections]].

A [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]], including members of the Green Party, was formed to investigate the matter. Green Party statements claim the committee was "obstructed" by [[Syngenta]] refusing to release test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Notes on the select committee's "Corngate" report| work =| publisher =| date =2007-10-19| url =http://www.greens.org.nz/factsheets/notes-select-committees-corngate-report?rnd=3346| doi =| accessdate =2007-11-27| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120612063851/http://www.greens.org.nz/factsheets/notes-select-committees-corngate-report?rnd=3346| archivedate =2012-06-12| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report, released in late 2004, was inconclusive due to a lack of clear evidence, poor reporting in the original incident and the deletion of raw data critical for a full re-evaluation. Scientific assessment highlighted a lack of rigor in the testing procedures at that time and noted failures in the administration and interpretation of the results by the regulatory body, the [[Environmental Risk Management Authority]] (ERMA).

The incident also highlighted the problems of testing for the presence of GMOs down to a regulatory level of zero when all available detection methods have a relatively high base threshold before results become unreliable.   

The scandal was further intensified when news anchor [[John Campbell (broadcaster)|John Campbell]] interviewed Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] about the issue.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dET78Z5b5s Campbell Live video interview with Prime Minister Helen Clark on GE]&lt;/ref&gt; It ended with Clark labelling Campbell a "sanctimonious little creep" due to what she considered the ambush style of the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ME1vBrTXNFwC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22John+Campbell%22+%22Little+creep%22|title=Voters' Veto: The 2002 Election in New Zealand and the Consolidation of Minority Government|isbn=1-86940-309-6|pages=36|first=Jack|last=Vowles|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA) later ruled that the infamous "Corngate" interview was unbalanced, unfair and lacked impartiality and objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Authority Releases Decision On 3 News Special|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0307/S00032.htm|work=Scoop: Politics, 4 July 2003|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Corngate is one of many [[List of scandals with "-gate" suffix|scandals suffixed with "-gate"]], ultimately originating from the [[Watergate scandal]] in U.S. politics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6322">[[File:Australian Senate - Parliament of Australia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Australian Senate]], like other parliaments based on the Westminster system, uses a divided chamber]]

In [[politics]], '''crossing the floor''' is when a politician changes their allegiance or votes against their party in a [[Westminster system]] parliament. Crossing the floor may be voting against the approved party lines, or changing to another party after being elected while a member of a first party. While these practices are legally permissible, crossing the floor can lead to controversy and media attention. As well, voting against party lines may lead to consequences such as losing a position (e.g., as minister or a portfolio critic) or being ejected from the party caucus.  [[Maldives]] and [[Bangladesh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=367&amp;sections_id=24624 |title= Article 70(b) of Constitution of People's Republic of Bangladesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; have laws which removes the member from parliament due to floor-crossing.

==Etymology==
The term originates from the [[British House of Commons]], which is configured with the Government and [[Parliamentary Opposition|Opposition]] facing each other on rows of benches. In consequence, an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] who switches from the governing party to one in opposition (or vice versa) also changes which side of the chamber they sit on. A notable example of this is [[Winston Churchill]], who crossed the floor from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] to the [[Liberal party (UK)|Liberals]] in 1904, before later crossing back in 1924.

==Voting against party lines==
The term has passed into general use in other [[Westminster System|Westminster]] parliamentary democracies (such as [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], [[Politics of Australia|Australia]], [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Politics of South Africa|South Africa]]) even if many of these countries have semicircular or horseshoe-shaped debating chambers and mechanisms for voting without [[Members of Parliament]] leaving their seats. In most countries, it is most often used to describe members of the government party or parties who defect and vote with the opposition against some piece of government-sponsored legislation, but that usage is not widespread in Canada, where the term's usage is restricted to the original definition.

Most political parties let their members have a free vote on some matters of personal conscience.

In Australia, one of the major parties (the [[Australian Labor Party]]) requires its members to pledge their support for the collective decisions of the Caucus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22library%2Fprspub%2F31KH6%22 |title=Crossing the floor in the Federal Parliament 1950 – August 2004 |work=Research Note no. 11 2005–06 |publisher=Australian Parliament |date=October 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which theoretically prohibits them from crossing the floor; however, in practice, some Labor members disregard this pledge despite the disciplinary action which may result. Among other parties, crossing the floor is rare although former Senator [[Barnaby Joyce]] of the [[National Party of Australia]] crossed the floor 19 times under the Howard coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/independently-inclined-20080530-2jzv.html?page=2 |title=Independently inclined |publisher=The Age |first=Penelope |last=Debelle |date=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the record for crossing the floor in the Australian Parliament goes to Tasmanian Senator Sir [[Reg Wright]], who voted against his own party (the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]) on 150 occasions.

==Changing parties==
In the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries, the term is also used to describe leaving one's party entirely and joining another party, such as leaving an opposition party to support the government (or vice versa), or even leaving one opposition party to join another. In both Canada and the United Kingdom, the term carries only this meaning and is not used for a simple vote against the party line on a bill.

In April 2006, the premier of [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], [[Gary Doer]] of the [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba]], proposed a ban on crossing the floor of the Manitoba legislature in response to "the concern some voters have expressed over the high-profile defections of three federal MPs from their parties in just over two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323022203/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864 |archivedate=March 23, 2007|title=Proposed reforms would ban floor-crossing in Man. |first=Michelle |last=Macafee |publisher=Canadian Press |date=April 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting legislation, which amended the provincial ''Legislative Assembly Act'', mandated that Members of the Legislature who quit their political party must serve out the remainder of their term as independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/2006/c01506ee.php |title=The Elections Reform Act - Schedule E |work=Statutes of Manitoba |publisher=Manitoba Laws |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extraordinary example occurred in Alberta, Canada in December 2014 when [[Danielle Smith]], the leader of the official opposition [[Wildrose Party]], and eight of her MLAs crossed the floor together to join the governing [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnews.ca/news/1737886/danielle-smiths-move-to-pcs-unprecedented/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11247">{{For|the crown rabbi in Spain and Portugal in the Middle Ages|Crown rabbi (Iberia)}}
'''Crown rabbi''' ({{lang-rus|казённый раввин|p=kɐˈzʲɵnːɨj rɐˈvʲːin|t=official rabbi}}) was a position in the [[Russian Empire]] given to a member of a [[Russian Jews|Jewish community]] appointed to act as an intermediary between his community and the Imperial government, to perform certain civil duties such as registering births, marriages, and divorces.  Because their main job qualification was fluency in [[Russian language|Russian]], crown rabbis were typically considered agents of the state by members of their own communities, not true [[rabbi]]s, and they often had no education in or knowledge of [[Jewish law]].

== History ==

The origins of the crown rabbinate in [[Imperial Russia]] date to the early 19th century and administrative requirements by the [[tsar]] that the Jewish community maintain and provide civil records to the Imperial government in the [[Russian language]].&lt;ref name="kehila"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/lyakhovichi/rabbonim.htm |title=Rabbonim, Rebbes, and Crown Rabbis of Lyakhovichi-An Original Publication of Lyakovichi Shtetl Website |last1=Glassman |first1=Deborah |date=December 2004 |website=jewishgen.org |publisher=Jewish Gen, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222181250/http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/lyakhovichi/Rabbonim.htm |archivedate=2015-02-22 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion as agent of the state===

The Russian government viewed all permissible religions as agents of the state.  [[Russian Orthodox]] priests, [[Mennonite]] ministers, [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] as well as Jewish rabbis{{ndash}}were all required to perform certain civil duties such as registering births, deaths, and marriages, as well as other duties.  The Russians found this arrangement useful, and employed designated members of these religious communities at a tiny salary (which could be augmented by bribes by the ambitious) to perform these official functions.&lt;ref name="kehila" /&gt;

===Language requirements under Alexander I===

[[Ukase]]s by [[Tsar Alexander I]] (reigned 1801{{ndash}}1825) required the rabbis to maintain civil information in [[Russian language|Russian]] as well as Hebrew.  [[Rabbis]] in the Empire all spoke [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]], but few could speak Russian or other languages considered useful by the Empire such as German and Polish.  For this reason, the Jewish communities chose an individual familiar with Russian and other required languages to perform this role, and put his name forward.  If approved by the governmental administration, they became "official" rabbis, in the sense that they acted as the intermediary between their community and the Imperial government for the required civil and other administrative duties the government required of them.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |editor-last1=Kaplan Appel |editor-first1=Tamar |editor-link1= |title=Crown Rabbi |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=9780300119039 |oclc=170203576 |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327120806/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |archivedate=2015-03-27 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since rabbis most often did not speak Russian, the men put forth by the community typically were men who were not rabbis, and often they were not even particularly familiar with Jewish law.  Because of this, they were looked down upon by their communities as agents or puppets of the government, and not real rabbis, despite the title accorded them by the state.&lt;ref name="Berlin-2011"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion |editor-last1=Berlin |editor-first1=Adele |editor-link=Adele Berlin |last=Himelstein |first=Shmuel |title=Crown Rabbi |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&amp;pg=PA195 |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |volume= |isbn=978-0-19-973004-9 |language= |trans-title= |quote= }} p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution under Nicholas I===

This new position became more formalized under [[Tsar Nicholas I]] (reigned 1825{{ndash}}1855). In 1835, new laws established these appointees as employees and officials of the Imperial government.  While continuing their record-keeping duties as before, they were also now given religious authority by the state and were also to maintain loyalty to the state among their community.  It was under these new regulations that those occupying these official posts came to be called "crown rabbis".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

===Choosing a crown rabbi===

A crown rabbi was either appointed, or elected by members of the Jewish community in which he resided.  In Kiev, shortly after Jewish residents were permitted to settle in the city in 1861, a crown rabbi was appointed.  But the local community objected, and wished to elect someone with the education and stature that they could respect, and elected their own man, Evsei Tsukkerman, instead.  He was then approved by the government, and took up the position of crown rabbi.&lt;ref name="Meir-2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meir |first=Natan M |date=2010 |orig-year= |title=Kiev, Jewish Metropolis: A History, 1859--1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Sc-UJsKq8gC&amp;dq |page=86  |location=[[Bloomington, IN]] |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=0253004330 |series=Kiev, Jewish Metropolis |doi=10.1080/09546545.2012.671454 |oclc=649479079 |access-date=2015-06-01 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State seminaries===

The crown rabbinate evolved, and by mid-century the government opened its own seminaries for training rabbis (supported by taxes on Jewish  communities) with a strong secular syllabus promoting the interests of the state.  The training was seven years undergraduate, followed by three years training in pedagogy or rabbinical studies.  Secular subjects were mandatory; the syllabus did include Rabbinic training ([[Talmud]], [[halakha]]) at the graduate level, but was optional and few graduates took it.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

The first graduates emerged in the 1850s, and by the following decade, new laws were passed obliging the Jewish communities to hire these graduates, although there was a lot of resistance to them as they were viewed as poorly or uneducated in Jewish matters important to the community, and a bad influence because of their years of secular indoctrination.  Few graduates found positions, and the number of them graduating went down to a trickle.  Finally, the government closed the schools down in 1873, realizing that the Jewish community regarded them as unfit for the honored position of rabbi.  The position of crown rabbi outlasted the schools, and while the government viewed the crown rabbis as being the only official rabbis, the communities continued to have rabbis schooled in the traditional ways, with the result that many communities had two rabbis, an "official" one for dealing with the Tsar, and a "spiritual" rabbi for dealing with all the traditional religious and family roles that rabbis usually dealt with.  The official rabbis were universally viewed as agents of the state by the Jewish communities.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

===The dual rabbinate===

The problem of the "dual rabbinate" continued until the 20th century and [[World War I]], with debates raging within the community itself about how to view and react to the situation.  The Orthodox accepted only their traditional spiritual rabbis as legitimate, while progressive Jews thought that rabbis should also play a role in secular concerns such as social, economic, and intellectual aspects of their communities.  Crown rabbis continued to perform their official duties all during this debate, and attended various Russian Rabbinic Congresses, such as the one in 1910.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

At the 1910 Rabinic conference the objective was to get rid of the Crown Rabbinate entirely, but this ran into problems because the Orthodox delegates by and large refused to encourage or require their (legitimate, spiritual, educated) rabbis to take on the administrative tasks fulfilled by the crown rabbis because that would require their learning Russian and to submit to the licensing authority of the Russian state which was far too much in the secular domain for an Orthodox rabbi to go.  This caused a split among the delegates among those who saw nothing wrong with learning Russian and even thought it would avoid much of the misery the Jews had undergone, however this resulted in a stalemate and no new decisions were taken about it.&lt;ref name="Wert-2004"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jack Wertheimer |date=2004-03-20 |title=Jewish Religious Leadership: In Eastern Europe ; In Western and Central Europe ; In the United States ; In North Africa and Israel ; The representation of Jewish leadership |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvUlAQAAIAAJ |volume=II |page=431 |chapter=Reflections on the Russian Rabbinate |last=Stanislawski |first=Michael |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary |isbn=9780873340984 |doi= |oclc= |access-date=2015-06-02 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various men who became well known in the Jewish community initially served as a crown rabbi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11330">'''Cultural dissonance''' (education, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and cultural studies) is an  uncomfortable sense of discord, disharmony, confusion, or conflict experienced by people in the midst of change in their cultural environment. The changes are often unexpected, unexplained or not understandable due to various types of cultural dynamics.&lt;ref name="adt.curtin.edu.au"&gt;[http://adt.curtin.edu.au/theses/available/adt-WCU20020610.140633/  English speaking migrant children in educational and cultural transition.] Curtin University of Technology. (Thesis)&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies into cultural dissonance take on a wide socio-cultural scope of analysis that inquire into [[economics]], [[politics]], [[values]], [[learning styles]], cultural factors, such as [[language]], [[tradition]], [[ethnicity]], [[cultural heritage]], cultural [[history]], educational formats, classroom design, and even socio-cultural issues such as [[ethnocentricism]], [[racism]] and their respective historical legacies in the cultures.

==Research==
Research topics in cultural dissonance tend to be [[interdisciplinary]] drawing from a wide range of disciplines and applying the findings to equally diverse fields and industries.

Edward J. Hedican wrote an article in the Department of Sociology &amp; Anthropology at the [[University of Guelph]], [[Ontario]]. In it he  noted the possibility of alleviating acculturative pressures, and their disruptive effects on the sense of aboriginal sense of worth and identity. He proposed, "...the development of interethnic communication or ethnopolitics of community competence. This, in turn, will lead to increased native control over educational, economic, &amp; political institutions, decreased cultural dissonance, &amp; a more positive native identity." (Hedican)

Paul Bohannan wrote an "anthropological treatise" outlining "Seven organizing principles unique to humans: contract, role, ranking property, markets, networks, &amp; public relations. These characteristics are built on to analyze dyads, triads, &amp; chains, to show how innovation, as well as how cultural dissonance can lead to cultural traps." (Bohannan)

=== Education ===
Winifred L. Macdonald concluded in her thesis that, "... shared markers of language and ethnicity were not sufficient to ensure that the cultural differences in education systems were not experienced by the families." 
Macdonald also observed that cultural dissonance is sometimes said to inhibit socio-cultural adaptation.&lt;ref name="adt.curtin.edu.au"/&gt;

Susan Black, an education research consultant, wrote an article in the ''[[American School Board Journal]]'' of the [[National School Board Association]] that summarized some of the actions recommended by some researchers in education-related cultural dissonance. The recommendations for educators included:
# Recognize [[ethnocentrism]]
# Know and understand the student's [[cultural heritage]]
# Understand social, economic and political issues and [[value (ethics)|values]] in different cultures
# Adopt the attitude that students—all students—can [[learn]]
# Create genuinely caring classrooms where all students are appreciated and accepted.

Other general findings include: 
*Geneva Gay (University of Washington in Seattle, Washington), proposed that differences can erupt into cultural clashes
*Researchers at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory notes that many anecdotal case studies show how culturally responsive practices improve students' behavior and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Susan. American School Board Journal; Jan 2006, Vol. 193 Issue 1, p34-36, 3p&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-generation immigrants ===
In their book ''Children of Immigration'', Carola and Marcelo Suárez-Orozco discuss dissonance as it relates to [[Latino]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Carola and Marcelo Suárez-Orozco, [http://www.hepg.org/her/booknote/112 "Children of Immigration"], Harvard University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Suarez Orozco found that second-generation [[Hispanics]] face more acute forms of cultural dissonance than their first generation parents. They also noticed that second-generation individuals also face "special difficulties" that lead to "three general patterns of adjustment"
# attempts to [[:wikt:synthesize|synthesize]] two cultural traditions
# [[Passing (sociology)|passing]] as a member of the dominant group
# developing of defensive identity such as [[gang]] membership

=== Refugees of war ===
Suárez-Orozco also compared the experience of exiles from [[Cuba]] being reunited with family members with the "...alienated refugees from war-torn Central America..." as they worked through their own adjustment issues, and concluded that Central Americans had to deal with more cultural dissonance than their Cuban counterparts.

=== Law enforcement ===
Larry A. Gould wrote a paper for [[Northern Arizona University]]
"his research reports on the link between feelings of spirituality &amp; how Navajo police officers tend to enforce European-based law. Previous research suggests that a link exists between the officers' depth of feeling of spirituality &amp; the officers' attitude toward the effectiveness traditional methods of social control; however, this research goes a step further &amp; examines the impact of cultural dissonance on the stressors faced by Navajo police officers. The enforcement behavior of the Navajo officers was used as a proxy for the intensity of their feelings concerning the usefulness of traditional vs European-based forces of social control; the underlying assumption being tested is that self-determination is not only a state of law but a state of psychological being. A snowball method of sample development was used to select officers for intensive interviews. The findings suggest that the officers' feeling of spiritual connectedness to his/her culture is inversely related to the strictness of the enforcement of European-based laws. In other words, the more spiritual the officer, the less likely the officer is to rely solely on European-based laws, &amp; the greater the reliance on other methods of problems solving. The finding also suggest that in addition to the stressors normally encounter by all police officers, Navajo officers faced additional stressors that are specific to indigenous officers policing in indigenous communities. 1 Table, 41 References.

=== In sports ===
Tracy Taylor wrote a paper for the ''[[Journal of Sport and Social Issues]]''. In it she wrote "...This research investigates issues of cultural diversity &amp; inclusiveness in women's netball in Australia using the rhetoric of exclusion. Women &amp; girls from culturally diverse backgrounds spoke of reinforced difference &amp; cultural assimilation in their netball experiences. Women born in other English-speaking countries recalled feelings of inclusion &amp; limited cultural dissonance &amp; indicated that netball helped them feel as part of their new community &amp; gain social capital via participation. Although experiences of explicit exclusion or racial discrimination were virtually nonreported, some women felt a strong sense of cultural conformity to Anglo-centric expectations of behavior. The women's stories &amp; experiences suggest that women from culturally diverse backgrounds have found few opportunities to express their cultural distinctiveness through mainstream Australian sports such as netball. The conclusion reached after this examination is that the rhetoric of exclusion is pervasive in Australian netball &amp; unlikely to change in the near future. 1 Table, 76 References.

==Cultural dissonance in popular culture==
Side 2 of the [[Firesign Theatre]]'s 1968 album, ''[[Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him]]'', features a humorous 18-minute radio drama of a traveler experiencing cultural dissonance on his arrival in a foreign country. For example, the traveler struggles to communicate his wish to send a telegram, only to be informed that yes, his telegram has been sent, at considerable cost, and that he will be receiving it in about an hour.

{{Democracy}}
{{Forms of government}}

'''Demoicracy''' (also demoi-cracy) is a polity of multiple distinct people (''demoi''), polity of polities. The term is derived from ''demoi'' (δῆμοι in original [[Ancient Greek]], plural form of δῆμος or ''demos''), meaning "peoples" and ''kratos'' (κράτος) meaning "power" (to govern oneself). It is apparently meant to become an alternative to [[democracy]], understood as power of a single ''demos''. The term is used mainly to describe the genus of the [[European Union]] ([[European Union|EU]]) but is also gaining currency in more general theories of democracy above state level.

==History==
Philippe van Parijs used the term "demoi-cracy" negatively in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Philippe van Parijs 'Should the European union become more democratic?' in Follesdal, Andreas &amp; Koslowski, Peter ''Democracy and the European Union'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the existing state of affair in Europe and in contrast to "European demos-cracy". This is not the meaning of the term in mainstream scholarship today. Instead, the term refers to [[Kalypso Nicolaïdis]] original statement in 2003 that the EU ought to be understood as a demoicracy in the making,  a third way against two alternatives which both equate the possibility of democracy with the existence of a single demos, either national demos (the EU as association of democratic states) or supranational (the EU as a federal state). In contrast, the EU is not and should not be conceived of as any form of state (federal or any other) and does not depend on the existence of a single European demos to be demoicratic.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaïdis, Kalypso 'Our European Demoï-cracy: Is this Constitution a Third Way for Europe?' in Nicolaidis, Kalypso &amp; Weatherill, Stephen ''Whose Europe? National Models and the Constitution of the European Union'', European Studies at Oxford Series, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaidis, Kalypso 'We the Peoples of Europe' in Foreign Affairs, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the concept has both descriptive and normative aspects. It tries to square the circle between the common criticism that the EU is undemocratic (the ''[[democratic deficit]]'' thesis) and the claim that there is no European demos (the ''no demos thesis''), purporting that a demos is not a ''sine qua non'' for democracy and multiple separate demoi can effectively control the government and in that sense exercise [[popular sovereignty]]. Later, Nicolaidis refined her definition of demoicracy as "a Union of peoples who govern together but not as one" [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcms.12006/full  &lt;ref&gt;Nicolaidis, Kalypso 'European Demoicracy and Its Crisis,' Journal of Common Market Studies March Volume 51 No 2: 351–369, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;]

==Philosophy==
Nicolaïdis’s originally advanced the concept as an alternative to the calls of the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]]&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Habermas 'Why Europe Needs Constitution?' in 11 ''New Left Review'' (2001). See also Jurgen Habermas &amp; Jacques Derrida 'February 15, or What Binds Europeans Together' in 10 ''Constellations'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  and by the former German foreign minister [[Joschka Fischer]]&lt;ref&gt;Joschka Fischer 'From Confederacy to Federation: Thoughts on the Finality of European Integration', Speech at the Humboldt University in Berlin, 12 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  that a common European [[Cultural identity|identity]] must and should be ‘forged’. Instead, she argued in favour of a [[community]] which recognises its irreducible internal [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] and is based on [[mutual recognition]] of differences rather than shared values as Habermas would have it.  While both sides of the debate premise their argument on some arguable empirical claims (distinct ‘European’ values or celebration of tolerance respectively), neither of these is necessary for the normative plausibility of demoicracy as a theoretical concept. Currently many other commentators maintain that the concept is uniquely adequate for the age of interdependence of states and globalization of governance which should supersede the 'nation-centred' vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Werner Muller 'The Promise of Demoi-cracy: Diversity and Domination in the European Public Order' in Neyer, Jurgen &amp; Wiener, Antije ''The Political Theory of the European Union''(2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps that is why the term was latter embraced by some of the major proponents of deliberative democracy like [[James Bohman]]&lt;ref&gt;James Bohman 'From Demos to Demoi: Democracy across Borders' in 18 Ratio Juris (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Samantha Besson]]&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Besson 'Deliberative Demoi-cracy in the EU: Towards the Deteritorialisation of Democracy' in Samantha Besson &amp; Jose Luis Marti, ''Deliberative democracy and its discontents'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  (even if not by Habermas himself). With the work of the latter authors the concept gained currency beyond the EU-scholarship and especially among the [[cosmopolitan republicanists]] as the most promising way for realisation of [[transnational democracy]]. Bohman in particular sees demoicracy as an emancipation project. It is meant to avoid domination which can occur across borders (citizens of one state may suffer from decisions of citizens of another which are taken arbitrarily). As domination can occur also internally all oppressed groups may qualify as demoi deserving a voice in governance. Thus, Besson suggests a dynamic concept of ''demoi'', which comprises all those affected by any particular decision (and thus subject to arbitrary domination by the group of the decision-makers).

==European Union==
With regard to the EU the concept has been criticized because it does not provide an answer to the 'no demos thesis' but merely disguises the problem of democratic deficit and forgoes the capacity of peoples to collectively control their fate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Mair]], ‘Ruling the Void? The Hollowing of Western Democracy’ in New Left Review (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet the concept is certainly more than a euphemism or exercise in scholastic creativity&amp;nbsp;– if the EU is qualitatively different from the nation state (and from the federation) it needs to be analysed in different terms as well. As almost all politicians and academics claim the EU is not and should not become a superstate, it would be grossly misleading to evaluate it in terms of a state. Indeed, it makes little sense to claim that the Union is not a state and in the same time to criticise it for not being a democratic one. On the other hand, if it is recognised that the Union, as a polity of its own kind is to be analysed in idiosyncratic terms, we face a problem of circularity&amp;nbsp;– we face an entity which claims to be a standard to itself.
Recognising that, Francis Cheneval and Frank Schimmelfenning propose to extend the moral constructivism of John Rawls to transnational cases: 'the inter-subjective beliefs about the moral purpose of the liberal democratic state do not only imply the normative expectation of rule of law and procedural justice for the fundamental institutions of international society. They also imply normative expectations of democratic government in a society of liberal  democratic states. The inter-subjective beliefs about the moral purpose of the liberal democratic state will eventually filter through into the relational structure of liberal democratic states.'&lt;ref name="euce"&gt;Francis Cheneval &amp; Frank Schimmelfenning 'The Case for Demoicracy in the EU' (2011) available at http://euce.org/eusa/2011/papers/8h_cheneval.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus they set out to derive abstract moral principles for a demoicracy and use them to judge the EU subsequently. Their principles apply to transnational as well as to national level, and they find that the EU is approaching these principle while 'major demoi-cratic deficits remain at the national level.'&lt;ref name="euce" /&gt;  In spite of this optimistic result, there is at least one deficiency of the EU from demoicratic perspective and it is that the governance discourse is almost exclusively elitist. This is especially problematic as demoicracy is calling for even more involvement of citizens on issues of governance.

==Development==
Most demoicracy scholarship is abstract, and very little has been done to flesh out what an actual demoicracy should look like. Yet there are few practical claims that seem shared by all of the commentators. The first is the reliance on networks as agents of democracy beyond the nation-state where discourses are not mediated by states or nationality. The second is the active participation of citizens in these networks so that they are involved in the decision-making, deliberations and contestation at every level. All demoicrats would emphasise the importance of horizontal relationships between citizens, organisations and institutions from the different ''demoi'' on issues of their collective governance or on the governance of other states. Rights and legitimate interests of citizens are not limited to their own demos/polity but are extended across the borders to what is usually considered internal affairs of the other polities and people. This horizontal relationship is what distinguishes a demoicracy from a federation where the internal affairs of a federal unit are insulated from external contestation at least horizontally.

Beyond these general principles however, few details of an actual demoicracy are spelled out. To remedy this, Cheneval and Schimmelfenning with a team of researchers at ETH Zurich have embarked on a project intended 'to map and explain the development of demoicratic institutions.'&lt;ref name="ETH"&gt;The project 'Designing "Demoi-cracy" in the European Union' of the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) Zurich. More information is available at http://www.eup.ethz.ch/research/demoicracy/&lt;/ref&gt; A precious few examples of genuine demoicratic institutions have been identified by other researchers. Bohman celebrates the system of policy coordination through committees and agencies in the EU as a demoicratic mechanism.&lt;ref name="ETH" /&gt; This is noteworthy, as from the traditional, that is ''demo''-cratic, perspective the influence of numerous EU committees and working parties is quite questionable. In the same vein, Michael Buess reconsiders the interaction between the EU agencies and their national counterparts from demoicratic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Buess 'European Union Agencies' Relationships with their National Counterparts' presentation at European Union Studies Association Conference Boston, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example of demoicratically interlinked institutions is the so-called ‘yellow card’ or [[Early Warning Mechanism]] introduced by the [[Lisbon Treaty]]. According to Vesco Paskalev this is an attempt to provide an institutionalized network which enables many ''demoi'' to deliberate together on substantive EU legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Vesco Paskalev 'Lisbon Treaty and the Possibility of a European Network Demoi-Cracy' (2009), European University Institute Working paper available at http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/13005/LAW_2009_20.pdf?sequence=1.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1568">'''Disciplinary institutions''' ([[French language|French]]: ''institution disciplinaire'') is a [[concept]] proposed by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975).  [[School]], [[prison]], [[barracks]], or the [[hospital]] are examples of historical disciplinary [[institution]]s, all created in their modern form in the 19th century with the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Discipline "cannot be identified with any one institution or apparatus," [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]] explains, "precisely because it is a type of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], a technology, that traverses every kind of apparatus or institution, linking them, prolonging them, and making them converge and function in a new way."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1986, 26).&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept may be related to the concept of "[[total institution]]" proposed by [[Erving Goffman]] in 1961, as well as to [[Louis Althusser]]'s [[Ideological State Apparatus]]es (ISA).

{{Ranks of Nobility}}
An '''emperor''' (through [[Old French]] ''empereor'' from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[imperator]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|emperor|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[monarch]], and usually the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] ruler of an [[empire]] or another type of imperial realm. '''Empress''', the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife ([[empress consort]]), mother ([[empress dowager]]), or a woman who rules in her own right ([[empress regnant]]). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher [[honour]] and [[Royal and noble ranks|rank]] than [[king]]s. In [[Europe]], the title of Emperor has been used since the [[Middle Ages]], considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of [[Pope]] due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of [[Western Europe]]. The [[Emperor of Japan]] is the only currently [[List of current sovereign monarchs|reigning monarch]] whose title is translated into English as Emperor.

Both emperors and kings are [[monarch]]s, but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles. In as much as there is a strict definition of emperor, it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation, therefore a king might be obliged to pay [[tribute]] to another ruler,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/south-east-se-asia/china-art/a/forbidden-city|title=The Forbidden City|last=Peng|first=Dr. Ying-chen|date=|website=Khan Academy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion, but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints. However, monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts—the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the [[British Raj|incorporation of India]], though she was declared Empress of India.

In [[Western Europe]], the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of ''{{lang|la|[[translatio imperii]]}}'', i.e. they claimed succession to the authority of the [[Western Roman Emperor]]s, thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology. Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy, by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states. Although technically an elective title, by the late [[16th century]] the imperial title had in practice come to be inherited by the [[Habsburg]] [[Archdukes of Austria]] and following the [[Thirty Years' War]] their control over the states (outside the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], i.e. [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and various territories outside the empire) had become nearly non-existent. However, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was crowned [[Emperor of the French]] in 1804 and was shortly followed by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]], who declared himself [[Emperor of Austria]] in the same year. The position of Holy Roman Emperor nonetheless continued until [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] abdicated that position in 1806. In [[Eastern Europe]], the monarchs of [[Russia]] also used ''translatio imperii'' to wield imperial authority as successors to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Their status was officially recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1514, although not officially used by the Russian monarchs until 1547. However, the Russian emperors are better known by their Russian-language title of [[Tsar]] even after [[Peter the Great]] adopted the title of [[Emperor of All Russia]] in 1721.

Historians have liberally used emperor and empire anachronistically and out of its Roman and European context to describe any large state from the past or the present. Such pre-Roman titles as [[Great King]] or [[King of Kings]], used by the Kings of Persia and others, are often considered as the equivalent. Sometimes this reference has even extended to non-monarchically ruled states and their spheres of influence such as the [[Athenian Empire]] of the late 5th century BC, the [[Angevin Empire]] of the [[Plantagenets]] and the [[Soviet Empire|Soviet]] and [[American imperialism|American]] "empires" of the [[Cold War]] era. However, such "empires" did not need to be headed by an "emperor". Empire became identified instead with vast territorial holdings rather than the title of its ruler by the mid-18th century.

For purposes of protocol, emperors were once given [[Order of precedence|precedence]] over kings in international diplomatic relations, but currently precedence amongst [[heads of state]] who are sovereigns—whether they be kings, queens, emperors, empresses, princes, princesses and to a lesser degree presidents—is determined by the duration of time that each one has been continuously in office. Outside the European context, emperor was the translation given to holders of titles who were accorded the same precedence as European emperors in diplomatic terms. In reciprocity, these rulers might accredit equal titles in their native languages to their European peers. Through centuries of international convention, this has become the dominant rule to identifying an emperor in the modern era.

==Roman tradition==

In the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition a large variety in the meaning and importance of the imperial form of monarchy developed: in ''intention'' it was always the highest office, but it could as well fall down to a redundant title for nobility that had never been near to the "Empire" they were supposed to be reigning. Also the ''name'' of the position split in several branches of Western tradition, see below.

The importance and meaning of [[coronation]] ceremonies and [[regalia]] also varied within the tradition: for instance [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s could only be crowned emperor by the [[Pope]], which meant the coronation ceremony usually took place in Rome, often several years after these emperors had ascended to the throne (as "king") in their home country. The first [[Latin Empire of Constantinople|Latin Emperors of Constantinople]] on the other hand had to be present in the newly conquered capital of their empire, because that was the only place where they could be granted to become emperor.

Early [[Roman Emperor]]s avoided any type of ceremony or regalia different from what was already usual for republican offices in the [[Roman Republic]]: the most intrusive change had been changing the color of their robe to purple. Later new symbols of worldly and/or spiritual power, like the [[Globus cruciger|orb]], became an essential part of the imperial accessories.

Rules for indicating successors also varied: there was a tendency towards ''male'' ''inheritance'' of the supreme office, but as well election by noblemen, as ruling empresses are known (for empires not too strictly under [[salic law]]). Ruling monarchs could additionally steer the succession by adoption, as often occurred in the two first centuries of Imperial Rome. Of course, intrigue, murder and military force could also mingle in for appointing successors; the Roman imperial tradition made no exception to other monarchical traditions in this respect. Probably the epoch best known for this part of the imperial tradition is [[Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century)|Rome's third century]] rule.

==Roman Empire and Byzantine emperors==

===Classical Antiquity===
{{Main|Roman emperor|Imperator}}
[[File:Rimini083.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A statue of the dictator [[Julius Caesar]].]]

When [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]] turned into a ''de facto'' [[monarchy]] in the second half of the 1st century BC, at first there was no name for the title of the new type of monarch.  Ancient Romans abhorred the name [[King of Rome|Rex ("king")]], and it was critical to the political order to maintain the forms and pretenses of republican rule.  [[Julius Caesar]] had been [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], an acknowledged and traditional office in Republican Rome.  Caesar was not the first to hold it, but following his assassination the term was abhorred in Rome{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Augustus]], the first emperor of the Roman Empire.]]
[[Augustus]], considered the first [[Roman emperor]], established his hegemony by collecting on himself offices, titles, and honours of Republican Rome that had traditionally been distributed to different people, concentrating what had been distributed power in one man.  One of these offices was ''[[princeps senatus]]'', ("first man of the Senate") and became changed into Augustus' chief honorific, ''[[Princeps|princeps civitatis]]'' ("first citizen") from which the modern English word and title [[prince]] is descended.  The first period of the [[Roman Empire]], from 27 BC – 284 AD, is called the ''[[principate]]'' for this reason.  However, it was the informal descriptive of ''[[Imperator]]'' ("commander") that became the title increasingly favored by his successors.  Previously bestowed on high officials and military commanders who had ''[[imperium]]'', Augustus reserved it exclusively to himself as the ultimate holder of all ''imperium''.  (''Imperium'' is Latin for the authority to command, one of a various types of authority delineated in Roman political thought.)

Beginning with Augustus, ''Imperator'' appeared in the title of all Roman monarchs through the extinction of the Empire in 1453.  After the reign of Augustus' immediate successor [[Tiberius]], being proclaimed ''imperator'' was transformed into the act of accession to the [[head of state]]. Other honorifics used by the Roman Emperors have also come to be synonyms for Emperor:

*'''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''' (as, for example, in [[Suetonius]]' ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Twelve Caesars]]''). This tradition continued in many languages: in German it became "[[Kaiser]]"; in certain [[Slavic languages]] it became "[[Tsar]]"; in Hungarian it became "[[Császár]]", and several more variants. The name derived from [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[cognomen]] "Caesar": this cognomen was adopted by all Roman emperors, exclusively by the ruling monarch after the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] had died out. In this tradition Julius Caesar is sometimes described as the first Caesar/emperor (following Suetonius). This is one of the most enduring titles, Caesar and its transliterations appeared in every year from the time of [[Caesar Augustus]] to Tsar [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Symeon II of Bulgaria]]'s removal from the throne in 1946.
*'''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''' was the [[honorific]] first bestowed on Emperor Augustus: after him all Roman emperors added it to their name. Although it had a high symbolical value, something like "elevated" or "sublime", it was generally not used to indicate the office of ''Emperor'' itself. Exceptions include the title of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', a semi-historical collection of Emperors' biographies of the 2nd and 3rd century. Augustus had (by his last will) granted the feminine form of this honorific ([[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]) to his wife. Since there was no "title" of Empress(-consort) whatsoever, women of the reigning dynasty sought to be granted this honorific, as the highest attainable goal. Few were however granted the title, and certainly not as a rule all wives of reigning Emperors.
*'''[[Imperator]]''' (as, for example, in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''). In the [[Roman Republic]] Imperator meant "(military) commander". In the late Republic, as in the early years of the new monarchy, ''Imperator'' was a title granted to Roman generals by their troops and the [[Roman Senate]] after a great victory, roughly comparable to [[field marshal]] (head or commander of the entire army). For example, in AD 15 [[Germanicus]] was proclaimed ''Imperator'' during the reign of his adoptive father [[Tiberius]]. Soon thereafter "Imperator" became however a title reserved exclusively for the ruling monarch. This led to "Emperor" in English and, among other examples, "Empereur" in French and "Mbreti" in Albanian. The Latin feminine form [[Imperatrix]] only developed after "Imperator" had taken on the connotation of "Emperor".
*'''[[Autokrator]]''' (Αὐτοκράτωρ) or '''[[basileus#Romans and Byzantines|Basileus]]''' (βασιλεύς): although the Greeks used equivalents of "Caesar" (Καῖσαρ, ''Kaisar'') and "Augustus" (in two forms: transliterated as {{lang|grc|Αὔγουστος}}, ''Augoustos'' or translated as {{lang|grc|Σεβαστός}}, ''[[Sebastos]]'') these were rather used as part of the name of the Emperor than as an indication of the office. Instead of developing a new name for the new type of monarchy, they used {{lang|grc|αὐτοκράτωρ}} (''autokratōr'', only partly overlapping with the modern understanding of "[[Autocracy|autocrat]]") or {{lang|grc|βασιλεύς}} (''[[basileus]]'', until then the usual name for "[[Monarch|sovereign]]"). ''Autokratōr'' was essentially used as a translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' in Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire, but also here there is only partial overlap between the meaning of the original Greek and Latin concepts. For the Greeks ''Autokratōr'' was not a military title, and was closer to the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' concept ("the one with unlimited power"), before it came to mean Emperor. ''Basileus'' appears not to have been used exclusively in the meaning of "emperor" (and specifically, the Roman/Byzantine emperor) before the 7th century, although it was a standard informal designation of the Emperor in the Greek-speaking East.

After the turbulent [[Year of the four emperors]] in 69, the [[Flavian Dynasty]] reigned for three decades. The succeeding [[Nervan-Antonian Dynasty]], ruling for most of the 2nd century, stabilised the Empire. This epoch became known as the era of the ''[[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]]'', and was followed by the short-lived [[Severan Dynasty]].

During the [[Crisis of the 3rd century]], [[Barracks Emperor]]s succeeded one another at short intervals. Three short lived secessionist attempts had their own emperors: the [[Gallic Empire]], the [[Britannic Empire]], and the [[Palmyrene Empire]] though the latter used ''rex'' more regularly.

The [[Principate]] (27 BC – 284 AD) period was succeeded by what is known as the [[Dominate]] (284 AD – 527 AD), during which Emperor [[Diocletian]] tried to put the Empire on a more formal footing.  Diocletian sought to address the challenges of the Empire's now vast geography and the instability caused by the informality of succession by the creation of co-emperors and junior emperors.  At one point, there were as many as five sharers of the ''imperium'' (see: [[Tetrarchy]]).  In 325 AD [[Constantine I]] defeated his rivals and restored single emperor rule, but following his death the empire was divided among his sons. For a time the concept was of one empire ruled by multiple emperors with varying territory under their control, however following the death of [[Theodosius I]] the rule was divided between his two sons and increasingly became separate entities.  The areas administered from Rome are referred to by historians the [[Western Roman Empire]] and those under the immediate authority of Constantinople called the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] or (after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636 AD) the [[Byzantine Empire|Later Roman or Byzantine Empire]].  The subdivisions and co-emperor system were formally abolished by [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] in 480 AD following the death of [[Julius Nepos]] last Western Emperor and the ascension of [[Odoacer]] as the ''de facto'' King of Italy in 476 AD.

===Byzantine period===
{{Main|Byzantine Emperor}}

====Before the 4th Crusade====
[[File:Sanvitale03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Under [[Justinian I]], reigning in the 6th century, parts of Italy were for a few decades (re)conquered from the [[Ostrogoths]]: thus, this famous [[mosaic]], featuring the Byzantine emperor in the center, can be admired at [[Ravenna]].]]

Historians generally refer to the continuing Roman Empire in the east as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after [[Byzantium]], the original name of the town that [[Constantine I]] would elevate to the Imperial capital as [[New Rome]] in AD 330. (The city is more commonly called [[Constantinople]] and is today named [[Istanbul]]). Although the empire was again subdivided and a co-emperor sent to Italy at the end of the fourth century, the office became unitary again only 95 years later at the request of the [[Roman Senate]] and following the death of [[Julius Nepos]], last Western Emperor. This change was a recognition of the reality that little remained of Imperial authority in the areas that had been the Western Empire, with even Rome and Italy itself now ruled by the essentially autonomous [[Odoacer]].

These Later Roman "Byzantine" Emperors completed the transition from the idea of the Emperor as a semi-republican official to the Emperor as an [[absolute monarch]]. Of particular note was the translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' into the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'', after Emperor [[Heraclius]] changed the official language of the empire from Latin to Greek in AD 620. Basileus, a title which had long been used for [[Alexander the Great]] was already in common usage as the Greek word for the Roman emperor, but its definition and sense was "King" in Greek, essentially equivalent with the Latin ''Rex''. Byzantine period emperors also used the Greek word "autokrator", meaning "one who rules himself", or "monarch", which was traditionally used by Greek writers to translate the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]''. Essentially, the Greek language did not incorporate the nuances of the Ancient Roman concepts that distinguished ''imperium'' from other forms of political power.

In general usage, the Byzantine imperial title evolved from simply "emperor" (''basileus''), to "emperor of the Romans" (''basileus tōn Rōmaiōn'') in the 9th century, to "emperor and autocrat of the Romans" (''basileus kai autokratōr tōn Rōmaiōn'') in the 10th.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Alexandrovič Ostrogorsky|George Ostrogorsky]], "Avtokrator i samodržac", ''Glas Srpske kraljevske akadamije'' CLXIV, Drugi razdred 84 (1935), 95–187&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, none of these (and other) additional epithets and titles had ever been completely discarded.

One important distinction between the post Constantine I (reigned AD 306–337) emperors and their pagan predecessors was [[cesaropapism]], the assertion that the Emperor (or other head of state) is also the head of the Church. Although this principle was held by all emperors after Constantine, it met with increasing resistance and ultimately rejection by bishops in the west after the effective end of Imperial power there. This concept became a key element of the meaning of "emperor" in the Byzantine and Orthodox east, but went out of favor in the west with the rise of [[Roman Catholicism]].

The Byzantine empire also produced three women who effectively governed the state: the Empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] and the Empresses [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zoe]] and [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]].

====Latin emperors====
In 1204 Constantinople fell to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and the [[Franks]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]].  Following the tragedy of the horrific [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking]] of the city, the conquerors declared a new "Empire of Romania", known to historians as the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]], installing [[Baldwin IX]], [[Count of Flanders]], as Emperor. However, Byzantine resistance to the new empire meant that it was in constant struggle to establish itself.  Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos succeeded in recapturing Constantinople in 1261.  The [[Principality of Achaea]], a vassal state the empire had created in [[Morea]] (Greece) intermittently continued to recognize the authority of the crusader emperors for another half century.  Pretenders to the title continued among the European nobility until circa 1383.

====After the 4th Crusade====
With Constantinople occupied, claimants to the imperial succession styled themselves as emperor in the chief centers of resistance:  The [[Laskaris|Laskarid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Komnenos|Komnenid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Trebizond]] and the [[Doukas|Doukid]] dynasty in the [[Despotate of Epirus]].  In 1248, the Epirus recognized the Nicaean Emperors, who then recaptured Constantinople in 1261.  The Trebizond emperor formally submitted in Constantinople in 1281,&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, Donald MacGillivray, ''The Last Centuries of Byzantium'', second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; but frequently flouted convention by styling themselves emperor back in Trebizond thereafter.

==Ottoman Empire==
[[File:Suleiman Agostino.JPG|thumb|190px|[[Agostino Veneziano]]'s [[engraving]] of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor Suleiman the Magnificent wearing his [[Süleyman the Magnificent's Venetian Helmet|Venetian Helmet]].&lt;ref&gt;Agostino never saw the Sultan, but probably did see and sketch the helmet in Venice.&lt;/ref&gt; Note the four tiers on the helmet, symbolizing his imperial power, and excelling the three-tiered [[papal tiara]].&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1968. "Turquerie" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series 26 (5): 229.&lt;/ref&gt; This tiara was made for 115,000 [[ducats]] and offered to Suleiman by the French ambassador [[Antonio Rincon]] in 1532.&lt;ref&gt;Garnier, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; This was a most atypical piece of headgear for a Turkish sultan, which he probably never normally wore, but which he placed beside him when receiving visitors, especially ambassadors. It was crowned with an enormous feather.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rulers]] held several titles denoting their Imperial status. These included:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Sultan]], [[Khan (title)|Khan]], Sovereign of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Imperial House of Osman]], [[Sultan of Sultans]], [[Khan of Khans]], [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]] and [[Caliph|Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe]], Protector of the Holy Cities of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jerusalem]], Emperor of The Three Cities of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Edirne|Adrianopole]] and [[Bursa]] as well as many other cities and countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobility of the World Volume VIII- Turkey|url=http://www.almanachdegotha.org/id244.html|website=Almanch De Saxe Gotha|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Ottoman capture of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultans began to style themselves '''Kaysar-i Rum''' (Emperor of the Romans) as they asserted themselves to be the heirs to the Roman empire by right of conquest.  The title was of such importance to them that it led them to eliminate the various Byzantine successor states — and therefore rival claimants — over the next eight years.  Though the term "emperor" was rarely used by Westerners of the Ottoman sultan, it was generally accepted by Westerners that he had imperial status.

==Holy Roman Empire==
{{Main|Holy Roman Emperor}}
The ''Emperor'' of the Romans' title was a reflection of the ''[[translatio imperii]]'' (''transfer of rule'') principle that regarded the Holy Roman Emperors as the inheritors of the title of Emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]], despite the continued existence of the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire]] in the east.

From the time of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] onward, much of the former [[Carolingian]] kingdom of [[Eastern Francia]] became the Holy Roman Empire. The  [[prince-elector]]s elected one of their peers as [[King of the Romans]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]] before being crowned by the [[Pope]]. The Emperor could also pursue the election of his heir (usually a son) as King, who would then succeed him after his death. This junior King then bore the title of Roman King (King of the Romans). Although technically already ruling, after the election he would be crowned as emperor by the Pope. The last emperor to be crowned by the pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]; all emperors after him were technically ''emperors-elect'', but were universally referred to as ''Emperor''.

==Austrian Empire==
{{Main|Emperor of Austria}}
The first Austrian Emperor was the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II. In the face of aggressions by [[Napoleon]], Francis feared for the future of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He wished to maintain his and his family's Imperial status in the event that the Holy Roman Empire should be dissolved, as it indeed was in 1806 when an Austrian-led army suffered a humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. After which, the victorious Napoleon proceeded to dismantle the old ''Reich'' by severing a good portion from the empire and turning it into a separate [[Confederation of the Rhine]].  With the size of his imperial realm significantly reduced, Francis II, ''Holy Roman Emperor'' became Francis I, ''Emperor of Austria''. The new imperial title may have sounded less prestigious than the old one, but Francis' [[dynasty]] continued to rule from Austria and a Habsburg monarch was still an emperor (''Kaiser''), and not just merely a king (''König''), in name.

The title lasted just a little over one century until 1918, but it was never clear what territory constituted the "[[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]]".  When Francis took the title in 1804, the Habsburg lands as a whole were dubbed the ''Kaisertum Österreich''.  ''Kaisertum'' might literally be translated as "emperordom" (on analogy with "kingdom") or "emperor-ship"; the term denotes specifically "the territory ruled by an emperor", and is thus somewhat more general than [[Reich]], which in 1804 carried connotations of universal rule.  Austria proper (as opposed to the complex of Habsburg lands as a whole) had been an Archduchy since the 15th century, and most of the other territories of the Empire had their own institutions and territorial history, although there were some attempts at centralization, especially during the reign of Marie Therese and her son Joseph II and then finalized in the early 19th century.  When Hungary was given self-government in 1867, the non-Hungarian portions were called the Empire of Austria and were officially known as the "Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] (''Reichsrat'')".  The title of Emperor of Austria and the associated Empire were both abolished at the end of the First World War in 1918, when [[German Austria]] became a [[republic]] and the other kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council established their independence or adhesion to other states.

==Emperors of Europe==
[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]'s close cultural and political interaction with its Balkan neighbors [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]], and with Russia (Kievan Rus', then Muscovy) led to the adoption of Byzantine imperial traditions in all of these countries.

===Bulgaria===
In 913, [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] was crowned Emperor ([[Tsar]]) by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and imperial regent [[Nicholas Mystikos]] outside the Byzantine capital. In its final simplified form, the title read "Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans" (''Tsar i samodarzhets na vsichki balgari i gartsi'' in the modern vernacular). The Roman component in the Bulgarian imperial title indicated both rulership over Greek speakers and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans, however this component was never recognised by the Byzantine court.

Byzantine recognition of Simeon's imperial title was revoked by the succeeding Byzantine government. The decade 914–924 was spent in destructive warfare between Byzantium and Bulgaria over this and other matters of conflict. The Bulgarian monarch, who had further irritated his Byzantine counterpart by claiming the title "Emperor of the Romans" (''basileus tōn Rōmaiōn''), was eventually recognized, as "Emperor of the Bulgarians" (''basileus tōn Boulgarōn'') by the Byzantine Emperor [[Romanus I|Romanos I Lakapenos]] in 924. Byzantine recognition of the imperial dignity of the Bulgarian monarch and the patriarchal dignity of the [[Patriarch of All Bulgaria|Bulgarian patriarch]] was again confirmed at the conclusion of permanent peace and a Bulgarian-Byzantine dynastic marriage in 927. In the meantime, the Bulgarian imperial title may have been also confirmed by the [[pope]].  The Bulgarian imperial title "tsar" was adopted by all Bulgarian monarchs up to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule. 14th-century Bulgarian literary compositions clearly denote the Bulgarian capital ([[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]) as a successor of Rome and [[Constantinople]], in effect, the "Third Rome".

After Bulgaria obtained full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1908, its monarch, who was previously styled ''Knyaz'', [prince], took the traditional title of ''Tsar'' [king] and was recognized internationally as such.{{by whom|date=November 2016}}

===France===
The kings of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' and the [[July Monarchy]] used the title ''Empereur de France'' in diplomatic correspondence and treaties with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor from at least 1673 onwards. The Ottomans insisted on this elevated style while refusing to recognize the Holy Roman Emperors or the Russian tsars because of their rival claims of the [[translatio imperii|Roman crown]]. In short, it was an indirect insult by the Ottomans to the HRE and the Russians. The French kings also used it for [[Morocco]] (1682) and [[Persia]] (1715).

====First French Empire====
{{See also|First French Empire}}
[[File:NapoleanCoronationDavid.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the most famous Imperial coronation ceremonies was that of Napoleon, crowning himself Emperor in the presence of [[Pope Pius VII]] (who had blessed the [[regalia]]), at the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris]].&lt;br&gt;The painting by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] commemorating the event is equally famous: the gothic cathedral restyled ''[[Empire (style)|style Empire]]'', supervised by the [[Letizia Ramolino|mother of the Emperor]] on the balcony (a fictional addition, while she had not been present at the ceremony), the pope positioned near the altar, Napoleon proceeds to crown his then wife, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] as Empress.]]
[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who was already First Consul of the French Republic (''Premier Consul de la République française'') for life, declared himself '''[[Emperor of the French]]''' (''Empereur des Français'') on 18 May 1804, thus creating the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (''Empire Français'').

Napoleon relinquished the title of Emperor of the French on 6 April and again on 11 April 1814.
Napoleon's infant son, [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II]], was recognized by the Council of Peers, as Emperor from the moment of his father's abdication, and therefore reigned (as opposed to ruled) as Emperor for fifteen days, 22 June to 7 July 1815.

====Elba====
Since 3 May 1814, the Sovereign Principality of [[Elba]] was created a miniature non-hereditary Monarchy under the exiled French Emperor Napoleon I. Napoleon I was allowed, by the treaty of Fontainebleau with (27 April), to enjoy, for life, the imperial title. The islands were ''not'' restyled an empire.

On 26 February 1815, Napoleon abandoned Elba for France, reviving the French Empire for a [[Hundred Days]]; the Allies declared an end to Napoleon's sovereignty over Elba on 25 March 1815, and on 31 March 1815 Elba was ceded to the restored [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] by the Congress of Vienna. After his final defeat, Napoleon was treated as a general by the British authorities during his second exile to Atlantic Isle of [[St. Helena]]. His title was a matter of dispute with the governor of St Helena, who insisted on addressing him as "General Bonaparte", despite the "historical reality that he had been an emperor" and therefore retained the title.&lt;ref&gt;''Napoleon'', Vincent Cronin, p419, HarperCollins, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Napoleon'', Frank McLynn, p644, Pimlico 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Mémorial de Sainte Hélène'', Emmanuel De Las Cases, Tome III, page101, published by Jean De Bonnot, Libraire à l'enseigne du canon, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second French Empire====
{{See also|Second French Empire}}
Napoleon I's nephew, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], resurrected the title of emperor on 2 December 1852, after establishing the [[Second French Empire]] in a presidential [[coup]], subsequently approved by a plebiscite. His reign was marked by large scale public works, the development of social policy, and the extension of France's influence throughout the world. During his reign, he also set about creating the [[Second Mexican Empire]] (headed by his choice of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], a member of the [[House of Habsburg]]), to regain France's hold in the Americas and to achieve greatness for the 'Latin' race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1O6HwzwQs4C&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Race and nation in modern Latin America |first1=Nancy P. |last1=Appelbaum |first2=Anne S. |last2=Macpherson |first3=Karin Alejandra |last3=Rosemblatt |publisher=UNC Press Books |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8078-5441-9 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon III was deposed on 4 September 1870, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  The [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] followed and after the death of his son Napoleon (IV), in 1879 during the Zulu War, the Bonapartist movement split, and the Third Republic was to last until 1940.

===Iberian Peninsula===
====Spain====
The origin of the title ''[[Imperator totius Hispaniae]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Emperor of All [[Hispania|Spain]]''&lt;ref&gt;Notice that, before the emergence of the modern country of Spain (beginning with the union of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] in 1492), the Latin word ''[[Hispania]]'', in any of the [[Iberian Romance languages]], either in singular or plural forms (in English: Spain or Spains), was used to refer to the whole of the Iberian Peninsula, and not exclusively, as in modern usage, to the country of Spain, thus excluding Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt;) is murky. It was associated with the [[List of Leonese monarchs|Leonese monarchy]] perhaps as far back as [[Alfonso the Great]] (''r.'' 866–910). The last two kings of its [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]] were called emperors in a contemporary source.

King [[Sancho III of Navarre]] conquered Leon in 1034 and began using it. His son, [[Ferdinand I of Castile]] also took the title in 1039. Ferdinand's son, [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] took the title in 1077. It then passed to his son-in-law, [[Alfonso I of Aragon]] in 1109. His stepson and Alfonso VI's grandson, [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]] was the only one who actually had an imperial coronation in 1135.

The title was not exactly hereditary but self-proclaimed by those who had, wholly or partially, united the Christian northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], often at the expense of killing rival siblings. The popes and Holy Roman emperors protested at the usage of the imperial title as a usurpation of leadership in western Christendom. After Alfonso VII's death in 1157, the title was abandoned, and the kings who used it are not commonly mentioned as having been "emperors", in Spanish or other historiography.

After the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the legitimate heir to the throne, [[Andreas Palaiologos]], willed away his claim to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] in 1503.

====Portugal====
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Debret - Retrato de Dom João VI (MNBA).jpg|thumb|[[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal and the Algarves]], [[Emperor of Brazil]].]]
After the independence and proclamation of the [[Empire of Brazil]] from the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Kingdom of Portugal]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]], who became Emperor, in 1822, his father, King [[John VI of Portugal]] briefly held the honorific style of Titular [[Emperor of Brazil]] and the treatment of ''His Imperial and Royal Majesty'' under the 1825 [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)|Treaty of Rio de Janeiro]], by which Portugal recognized the independence of Brazil. The style of Titular Emperor was a life title, and became extinct upon the holder's demise. John VI held the imperial title for a few months only, from the ratification of the Treaty in November 1825 until his death in March 1826. During those months, however, as John's imperial title was purely honorific while his son, Pedro I, remained the sole monarch of the Brazilian Empire.

===Great Britain===
{{Main|British Emperor}}
In the late 3rd century, by the end of the epoch of the ''barracks emperors'' in Rome, there were two [[List of Roman Emperors#Britannic Empire 286 to 297|Britannic Emperors]], reigning for about a decade. After the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]], the Imperator [[Cunedda]] forged the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in northern Wales, but all his successors were titled kings and princes.

====England====
There was no consistent title for the king of England before 1066, and monarchs chose to style themselves as they pleased. Imperial titles were used inconsistently, beginning with [[Athelstan]] in 930 and ended with the [[Norman conquest of England]]. [[Empress Matilda]] (1102–1167) is the only English monarch commonly referred to as "emperor" or "empress", but she acquired her title through her marriage to [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]].

During the rule of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] declared that 'this realm of England is an Empire...governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the [[imperial Crown]] of the same'. This was in the context of the divorce of [[Catherine of Aragon]] and the [[English Reformation]], to emphasize that England had never accepted the quasi-imperial claims of the papacy.  Hence England and, by extension its modern successor state, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], is according to English law an Empire ruled by a King endowed with the imperial dignity. However, this has not led to the creation of the ''title'' of Emperor in England, nor in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], nor in the United Kingdom.

====United Kingdom====
[[File:George V of the united Kingdom.jpg|thumb|right|[[George V]], [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]], [[Emperor of India]].]]
In 1801, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] rejected the title of Emperor when offered. The only period when British monarchs held the title of ''Emperor'' in a dynastic succession started when the title [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]] was created for [[Queen Victoria]]. The government led by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], conferred the additional title upon her by an Act of Parliament, reputedly to assuage the monarch's irritation at being, as a mere Queen, notionally inferior to her own daughter ([[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]], who was the wife of the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|reigning German Emperor]]); the Indian Imperial designation was also formally justified as the expression of Britain succeeding the former [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] as [[suzerain]] over hundreds of [[princely state]]s. The [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] provided for the abolition of the use of the title "[[Emperor of India]]" by the [[British monarch]], but this was not executed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] until a [[royal proclamation]] on 22 June 1948. Despite this, George VI continued as king of India until 1950 and as king of Pakistan until his death in 1952. 

The last Empress of India was George VI's wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].

===German Empire===
{{Main|German Empire}}
[[File:Kohner - Kaiser Wilhelm II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[German Emperor]] and the [[King of Prussia]].]]
Under the guise of idealism giving way to realism, German nationalism rapidly shifted from its liberal and democratic character in 1848 to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] prime minister [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s authoritarian ''[[Realpolitik]]''. Bismarck wanted to unify the rival German states to achieve his aim of a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany. Three wars led to military successes and helped to convince German people to do this: the [[Second war of Schleswig]] against Denmark in 1864, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] against the [[Second French Empire]] in 1870–71. During the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] in 1871, the [[North German Confederation]], supported by its allies from [[southern Germany]], formed the [[German Empire]] with the proclamation of the Prussian king [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] as German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the [[Palace of Versailles]], to the humiliation of the French, who ceased to resist only days later.

After his death he was succeeded by his son [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] who was only emperor for 99 days. In the same year his son [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] became the third emperor within a year. He was the last German emperor. After the empire's defeat in World War I the empire, called in German ''Reich'', had a president as head of state instead of an emperor. The use of the word ''Reich'' was abandoned after the Second World War.

===Russia===
[[File:Profile portrait of Catherine II by Fedor Rokotov (1763, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|Empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great]]]]
In 1472, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Sophia Paleologue|Sophia Palaiologina]], married [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], grand prince of Moscow, who began championing the idea of Russia being the successor to the Byzantine Empire. This idea was represented more emphatically in the composition the monk Filofej addressed to their son [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]]. After ending Muscovy's dependence on its [[Mongol]] overlords in 1480, Ivan III began the usage of the titles [[Tsar]] and Autocrat (''samoderzhets''). His insistence on recognition as such by the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since 1489 resulted in the granting of this recognition in 1514 by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to Vasili III. His son [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] emphatically crowned himself [[Tsar of Russia]] on 16 January 1547. The word "Tsar" derives from Latin Caesar, but this title was used in Russia as equivalent to "King"; the error occurred when medieval Russian clerics referred to the biblical Jewish kings with the same title that was used to designate Roman and Byzantine rulers — "Caesar".

On 31 October 1721, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] was proclaimed Emperor by the Senate. The title used was Latin "''Imperator''", which is a westernizing form equivalent to the traditional Slavic title "''Tsar''". He based his claim partially upon a letter discovered in 1717 written in 1514 from Maximilian I to Vasili III, in which the Holy Roman Emperor used the term in referring to Vasili.

A formal address to the ruling Russian monarch adopted thereafter was 'Your Imperial Majesty'. The crown prince was addressed as 'Your Imperial Highness'.

The title has not been used in Russia since the abdication of Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] on 15 March 1917.

[[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] produced four reigning Empresses, all in the eighteenth century.

===Serbia===
{{main|Emperor of Serbia}}
In 1345, the Serbian King [[Stefan Dusan|Stefan Uroš IV Dušan]] proclaimed himself Emperor ([[Tsar]]) and was crowned as such at [[Skopje]] on [[Easter]] 1346 by the newly created [[Serbian Patriarch]], and by the Patriarch of Bulgaria and the autocephalous Archbishop of Ohrid. His imperial title was recognized by Bulgaria and various other neighbors and trading partners but not by the Byzantine Empire. In its final simplified form, the Serbian imperial title read "Emperor of Serbs and Greeks" (''цар Срба и Грка'' in modern Serbian). It was only employed by Stefan Uroš IV Dušan and his son Stefan Uroš V in Serbia (until his death in 1371), after which it became extinct. A half-brother of Dušan, [[Simeon Uroš]], and then his son [[Jovan Uroš]], claimed the same title, until the latter's abdication in 1373, while ruling as dynasts in [[Thessaly]]. The "Greek" component in the Serbian imperial title indicates both rulership over Greeks and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans.

==Emperors in the Americas==

===Pre-Columbian traditions===
The Aztec and Inca traditions are unrelated to one another. Both were conquered under the reign of King [[Charles I of Spain]] who was simultaneously emperor-elect of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the fall of the Aztecs and fully emperor during the fall of the Incas. Incidentally by being king of Spain, he was also Roman (Byzantine) emperor in pretence through [[Andreas Palaiologos]]. The translations of their titles were provided by the Spanish.

====Aztec Empire====
The only [[pre-Columbian]] North American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' of the [[Aztec Empire]] (1375–1521). It was an [[elected monarchy]] chosen by the elite. Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hernán Cortés]] slew Emperor [[Cuauhtémoc]] and installed puppet rulers who became vassals for Spain.

====Inca Empire====
The only pre-Columbian South American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Sapa Inca]]'' of the [[Inca Empire]] (1438–1533). Spanish conquistador [[Francisco Pizarro]], conquered the Inca for Spain, killed Emperor [[Atahualpa]], and installed puppets as well. Atahualpa may actually be considered a usurper as he had achieved power by [[Inca Civil War|killing his half-brother]] and he did not perform the required coronation with the imperial crown ''[[mascaipacha]]'' by the ''Huillaq Uma'' (high priest).

===Post-Columbian Americas===

====Brazil====
[[File:Pedro Américo - D. Pedro II na abertura da Assembléia Geral.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperor of Brazil]] in [[regalia]] at the opening of the General Assembly (oil painting by [[Pedro Américo]]).]]
When [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] ordered the invasion of Portugal in 1807 because it refused to join the [[Continental System]], the Portuguese [[House of Braganza|Braganzas]] moved their capital to [[Rio de Janeiro]] to avoid the fate of the [[Spanish Bourbons]] (Napoleon I arrested them and made his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] king). When the French general [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] arrived in [[Lisbon]], the Portuguese fleet had already left with all the local elite.

In 1808, under a British naval escort, the fleet arrived in Brazil. Later, in 1815, the Portuguese Prince Regent (since 1816 [[John VI of Portugal|King João VI]]) proclaimed the ''[[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]'', as a union of three kingdoms, lifting Brazil from its colonial status.

After the fall of Napoleon I and the [[liberal Wars|Liberal revolution]] in Portugal, the Portuguese royal family returned to Europe (1821). Prince Pedro of Braganza (King João's older son) stayed in South America acting as regent of the local kingdom, but, two years later in 1822, he proclaimed himself [[Peter I of Brazil|Pedro I]], first [[Emperor of Brazil]]. He did, however, recognize his father, João VI, as ''Titular Emperor of Brazil'' —a purely honorific title—until João VI's death in 1826.

The empire came to an end in 1889, with the overthrow of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] (Pedro I's son and successor), when the Brazilian republic was proclaimed.

====Haiti====
[[Haiti]] was declared an empire by its ruler, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who made himself Jacques I, on 20 May 1805. He was assassinated the next year. Haiti again became an empire from 1849 to 1859 under [[Faustin Soulouque]].

====Mexico====
[[File:X-Large Portrait of Maximiliano.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]]]]

In Mexico, the [[First Mexican Empire]] was the first of two empires created. After the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|declaration of independence]] on September 15, 1821, it was the intention of the Mexican parliament to establish a commonwealth whereby the [[King]] of Spain, [[Fernando VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], would also be [[Emperor of Mexico]], but in which both countries were to be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for a member of the [[House of Bourbon]] to accede to the Mexican throne.

Ferdinand VII, however, did not recognize the independence and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. By request of Parliament, the president of the regency [[Agustín de Iturbide]] was proclaimed emperor of Mexico on 12 July 1822 as [[Agustín I]]. Agustín de Iturbide was the general who helped secure Mexican independence from Spanish rule, but was overthrown by the [[Plan of Casa Mata]].

In 1863, the invading French, under [[Napoleon III]] (see above), in alliance with Mexican conservatives and [[Mexican nobility|nobility]], helped create the [[Second Mexican Empire]], and invited Archduke Maximilian, of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], younger brother of the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef I]], to become emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian I of Mexico]]. The childless Maximilian and his consort [[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of [[Leopold I of Belgium]], adopted Agustín's grandsons Agustin and Salvador as his heirs to bolster his claim to the throne of Mexico. Maximilian and Carlota made [[Chapultepec Castle]] their home, which has been the only palace in North America to house sovereigns. After the withdrawal of French protection in 1867, Maximilian was captured and executed by the liberal forces of [[Benito Juárez]].

This empire led to French influence in the Mexican culture and also [[French Mexican|immigration from France]], Belgium, and Switzerland to Mexico.

==Persia (Iran)==
{{further|Shah|King of Kings}}

In [[Iran|Persia]], from the time of [[Darius the Great]], Persian rulers used the title "[[King of Kings]]" (''[[Shah]]anshah'' in Persian) since they had dominion over peoples from the borders of India to the borders of Greece and Egypt. [[Alexander]] probably crowned himself ''shahanshah'' after conquering Persia{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, bringing the phrase ''basileus ton basileon'' to Greek. It is also known that [[Tigranes the Great]], king of Armenia, was named as the king of kings when he made his empire after defeating the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. Georgian title "mephet'mephe" has the same meaning.

The last ''shahanshah'' ([[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]) was ousted in 1979 following the [[Iranian Revolution]]. ''Shahanshah'' is usually translated as ''king of kings'' or simply ''king'' for ancient rulers of the [[Achaemenid]], [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]], and [[Sassanid]] dynasties, and often shortened to ''shah'' for rulers since the [[Safavid]] dynasty in the 16th century.  Iranian rulers were typically regarded in the West as emperors.

==Indian subcontinent==
{{main|Chakravartin}}
The Sanskrit word for emperor is ''[[Samrāj]]'' or ''Chakravartin''. This word has been used as an epithet of various Vedic deities, like Varuna, and has been attested in the [[Rigveda|Rig-Veda]], possibly the oldest compiled book among the Indo-Europeans. ''Chakravarti'' refers to the king of kings. A ''Chakravarti'' is not only a sovereign ruler but also has feudatories.

Typically, in the later Vedic age, a Hindu high king (''[[Maharaja|Maharajah]]'') was only called ''Samrāṭ'' after performing the Vedic ''[[Rajasuya]]'' sacrifice, enabling him by religious tradition to claim superiority over the other kings and princes. Another word for emperor is ''sārvabhaumā''. The title of ''Samrāṭ'' has been used by many rulers of the Indian subcontinent as claimed by the Hindu mythologies. In proper history, most historians call [[Chandragupta Maurya]] the first ''samrāṭ'' (emperor) of the Indian subcontinent, because of the huge empire he ruled. The most famous emperor was his grandson [[Ashoka the Great]]. Other dynasties that are considered imperial by historians are the [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]], [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]], [[Kakatiya Empire|Kakatiya]], [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysala]] and the [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]].

[[Rudhramadevi]] (1259–1289) was one of the most prominent rulers of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] on the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] Plateau, being one of the few ruling queens (empress) in Indian history.

After India was invaded by the Mongol Khans and Turkic Muslims, the rulers of their major states on the subcontinent were titled ''Sultān'', In this manner, the only empress-regnant ever to have actually sat on the throne of Delhi was [[Razia Sultana|Razia Sultan]].  The [[Mughal Emperor]]s were the only Indian rulers for whom the term was consistently used by Western contemporaries. For the period from 1877 to 1947 when British Emperors ruled [[British India]] as the pearl in the crown of the British Empire, see above.

{{Main|Emperor of Ethiopia}}
[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] from 1930 to 1974.]]
From 1270 the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] used the title {{transl|am|Nəgusä Nägäst}}, literally "King of Kings". The use of the ''king of kings'' style began a millennium earlier in this region, however, with the title being used by the Kings of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]], beginning with [[Sembrouthes]] in the 3rd century.

Another title used by this dynasty was {{transl|am|Itegue Zetopia}}. {{transl|am|Itegue}} translates as Empress, and was used by the only reigning Empress, [[Zauditu of Ethiopia|Zauditu]], along with the official title {{transl|am|Negiste Negest}} ("Queen of Kings").

In 1936, the Italian king [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] claimed the title of [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] after Ethiopia was occupied by Italy during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. After the defeat of the Italians by the British and the Ethiopians in 1941, [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] was restored to the throne but Victor Emmanuel did not relinquish his claim to the title until 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vadala|first=Alexander Attilio|date=2011-01-01|title=Elite Distinction and Regime Change: The Ethiopian Case|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156913311x590664|journal=Comparative Sociology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=636–653|doi=10.1163/156913311X590664|issn=1569-1330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central African Empire===
{{Main|Emperor of Central Africa}}
In 1976, President [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] of the [[Central African Republic]], proclaimed the country to be an autocratic [[Central African Empire]], and made himself Emperor as Bokassa I. The expenses of his coronation ceremony actually bankrupted the country. He was overthrown three years later and the republic was restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/heads-of-states-and-governments-a-worldwide-encyclopedia-of-over-2300-leaders-1945-through-1992/oclc/30075961|title=Heads of states and governments: a worldwide encyclopedia of over 2,300 leaders, 1945 through 1992|last=Lentz|first=Harris M|date=1994-01-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0899509266|location=Jefferson, N.C.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Asian tradition==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
The rulers of China and (once Westerners became aware of the role) Japan were always accepted in the West as emperors, and referred to as such.  The claims of other East Asian monarchies to the title may have been accepted for diplomatic purposes, but it was not necessarily used in more general contexts.

===China===
{{Main|Emperor of China}}
[[File:Qin Shi Huang BW.png|thumb|upright|Qin Shi Huang]]

The [[East Asian]] tradition is different from the Roman tradition, having arisen separately. What links them together is the use of the Chinese logographs 皇 (''huáng'') and 帝 (''dì'') which together or individually are imperial. Because of the cultural influence of China, China's neighbors adopted these titles or had their native titles conform in ''[[hanzi]]''. Anyone who spoke to the emperor was to address himself as bìxià (陛下, lit. the "Bottom of the Steps"), corresponding to "[[Imperial Majesty (style)|Imperial Majesty]]"; shèngshàng (聖上, lit. Holy Highness); or wànsuì (萬歲, lit. "You, of Ten Thousand Years").

In 221 BC, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], who was [[Chinese sovereign|king]] of [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] at the time, proclaimed himself ''[[Shi Huangdi]]'' (始皇帝), which translates as "first emperor". ''Huangdi'' is composed of ''huang'' ("august one", 皇) and ''di'' ("sage-king", 帝), and referred to legendary/mythological [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|sage-emperors]] living several millennia earlier, of which three were ''huang'' and five were ''di''. Thus Zheng became [[Qin Shi Huang]], abolishing the system where the ''huang''/''di'' titles were reserved to dead and/or mythological rulers. Since then, the title "king" became a lower ranked title, and later divided into two grades. Although not as popular, the title 王 ''wang'' (king or prince) was still used by many monarchs and dynasties in China up to the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taipings]] in the 19th century. 王 is pronounced ''vương'' in Vietnamese, ''ō'' in Japanese, and ''wang'' in Korean.

The imperial title continued in China until the [[Qing Dynasty]] was overthrown in 1912. The title was briefly revived from 12 December 1915 to 22 March 1916 by President [[Yuan Shikai]] and again in early July 1917 when General [[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]] attempted to restore last Qing emperor [[Puyi]] to the throne. Puyi retained the title and attributes of a foreign emperor, as a personal status, until 1924. After the Japanese occupied [[Manchuria]] in 1931, they proclaimed it to be the Empire of [[Manchukuo]], and Puyi became emperor of Manchukuo. This empire ceased to exist when it was occupied by the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1945. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In general, an emperor would have one empress (''Huanghou'', 皇后) at one time, although posthumous entitlement to empress for a [[concubines|concubine]] was not uncommon. The earliest known usage of ''huanghou'' was in the [[Han Dynasty]]. The emperor would generally select the empress from his [[concubine]]s. In subsequent dynasties, when the distinction between wife and concubine became more accentuated, the [[crown prince]] would have chosen an empress-designate before his reign. [[Early Imperial China|Imperial China]] produced only one reigning empress, [[Wu Zetian]], and she used the same Chinese title as an emperor (''Huangdi'', 皇帝). Wu Zetian then reigned for about 15 years (690–705 AD).

===Japan===
{{Main|Emperor of Japan}}
[[File:Emperor Showa.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Hirohito]] (裕仁), or the [[Shōwa Emperor]] (昭和天皇), the last Japanese Emperor having ruled with prerogative powers, combined with assumption of divinity (photographed 1926).]]
{{cleanup|section|reason=The second paragraph contains many grammar mistakes.|date=June 2014}}

The earliest Emperor recorded in [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]] is [[Emperor Jimmu]], who is said to be a descendant of [[Amaterasu]]'s grandson Ninigi who descended from Heaven ([[Tenson kōrin]]). If one believes what is written in [[Nihon Shoki]], the Emperors have an unbroken direct male lineage that goes back more than 2,600 years.

In ancient Japan, the earliest titles for the sovereign were either ヤマト大王/大君 (''yamato ōkimi'', Grand King of Yamato), 倭王/倭国王 (''waō''/''wakokuō'', King of Wa, used externally), or 治天下大王 (''amenoshita shiroshimesu ōkimi'', Grand King who rules all under heaven, used internally). As early as the 7th century the word 天皇 (which can be read either as ''sumera no mikoto'', divine order, or as ''tennō'', Heavenly Emperor, the latter being derived from a Tang Chinese term referring to the Pole star around which all other stars revolve) began to be used. The earliest use of this term is found on a wooden slat, or ''[[mokkan]]'', unearthed in Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture in 1998. The slat dated back to the reign of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jitō]]. The reading 'Tennō' has become the standard title for the Japanese sovereign up to the present age. The term 帝 (''mikado'', Emperor) is also found in literary sources.

Japanese monarchs were given their official title by the Chinese emperor. The new Japanese monarch after coming into power would send a representative to China and receive the anointment. They would receive their official title on several golden plates of several meters tall. Since the Japanese monarchs changed their title to 天皇 (Heavenly Emperor) in 607, the Chinese emperor refused to anoint the Japanese king, thus, ending relations with Japan for the next few hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/02/15/national/history/once-upon-a-time-china-anointed-a-king-of-japan/#.U2exSPldVRY|title=Once upon a time, China anointed a 'King of Japan' - The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Japanese emperors used Chinese imperial titles,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}, rarely was the Chinese-style "[[Emperor of China|Son of Heaven]]" used. In the Japanese language, the word ''tennō'' is restricted to Japan's own monarch; ''kōtei'' (皇帝) is used for foreign emperors. Historically, [[Daijō-tennō|retired emperors]] often kept power over a child-emperor as de facto regent. For a long time, a ''[[shōgun]]'' (formally the imperial generalissimo, but made hereditary) or an [[Sesshō and Kampaku|imperial regent]] wielded actual political power. In fact, through much of Japanese history, the emperor has been little more than a figurehead.

After World War II, all claims of divinity were dropped (see [[Ningen-sengen]]). The Diet acquired all prerogative powers of the Crown, reverting the latter to a ceremonial role.&lt;ref&gt;Although the [[Emperor of Japan]] is classified as constitutional monarch among political scientists, the current constitution of Japan defines him only as 'a symbol of the nation' and no subsequent legislation states his status as the ([[head of state]]) or equates the Crown synonymously with any government establishment.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 20th century, Japan was the only country with an emperor on the throne.

As of the early 21st century, Japan's succession law prohibits a female from ascending the throne. With the birth of a daughter as the first child of the current [[crown prince]], [[Crown Prince Naruhito|Naruhito]], Japan [[Crown Prince Naruhito#Marriage and Family|considered abandoning that rule]]. However, shortly after the announcement that [[Princess Akishino|Princess Kiko]] was pregnant with her [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|third child]], the proposal to alter the [[Imperial Household Law]] was suspended by [[Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]]. On 3 January 2007, after the birth of her son, [[Prince Hisahito]], Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] announced that he would drop the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070103/ap_on_re_as/japan_imperial_succession&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Keep this section updated in line with the page for Emperor of Japan --&gt;

Currently, many{{who|date=November 2016}} believe the new prince of Japan will ascend the throne, as the law defines. Historically, Japan has had eight reigning empresses who used the genderless title ''Tennō'', rather than the female consort title ''kōgō'' (皇后) or ''chūgū'' (中宮). There is ongoing discussion of the [[Japanese Imperial succession controversy]].
&lt;!--
Emperor's highest wife is called Kogo, and the female emperor is not called Kogo but Tenno as her male counterparts. The female emperor should be called (天皇 Ten-no) but Empress is usual in Western parlances. However, how should female emperor's husband be called? It has not been provided in Japan yet, because no female emperor was married when reigning: only single women (widows, unmarrieds) have been female emperors in history, or a wife or widow of an emperor or Crown Prince was made female Tenno (i. e., she was already Kogo or something like it).
--&gt;
Although current Japanese law prohibits female succession, all Japanese emperors claim to trace their lineage to ''[[Amaterasu]]'', the Sun Goddess of the [[Shinto|Shintō]] [[religion]]. &lt;!-- Shinto religion does not recognize a "supreme" kami, rather, kami and humans alike are viewed equally.--&gt; Thus, the Emperor is thought to be the highest authority of the Shinto religion, and one of his duties is to perform Shinto rituals for the people of Japan.

===Korea===
[[File:Gojong of the Korean Empire 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Gojong]] of the [[Korean Empire]]]]

The rulers of [[Goguryeo]] (37 BC-668 AD) used the title of ''[[Taewang]]'' ([[Hangul]]: 태왕, [[Hanja]]: 太王), literally translated as the ''Greatest of the Kings''. Also some [[Silla]] (57 BC-935 AD) rulers including [[Beopheung of Silla|Beopheung]] and [[Jinheung of Silla|Jinheung]] used this title for their declaration of independence from the influence of [[Goguryeo]].

The rulers of [[Balhae]] (698–926) internally called themselves ''Seongwang'' ([[Hangul]]: 성왕, [[Hanja]]: 聖王).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:新唐書/卷219|New Book of Tang vol.209]]&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of [[Goryeo]] used the titles of emperor and [[Son of Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Em |first1=Henry |title=The Great Enterprise: Sovereignty and Historiography in Modern Korea |date=2013 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822353725 |pages=24–26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxAd2Aw_jP0C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongolian invasions]] (1231–1258), however, Korea relinquished the imperial title.

The rulers of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1897) still used the term "King of the Joseon" ([[Hangul]]: 조선국왕, [[Hanja]]: 朝鮮國王). In the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–'95, Japan defeated the [[Qing Dynasty]] China, and the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was concluded in which Japan had China recognize the independence and autonomy of Korea. However, [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]] used term of "His Majesty the Great Monarch" ([[Hangul]]: 대군주폐하, [[Hanja]]: 大君主陛下), not an official imperial title.

In 1897, King Gojong proclaimed the founding of the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910), and became emperor of Korea. [[Emperor Gojong]] declared the new [[Korean era name|era name]] "Gwangmu" ([[Hangul]]: 광무, [[Hanja]]: 光武, Warrior of light). The Korean Empire maintained their state until 1910 — though it was an Empire by name, it was in fact in the process of being absorbed by Japan.

===Mongolia===
Pre-Mongol Kingdoms such as the Xiongnu used the title "[[Chanyu|Chanu]]" meaning "Ruler of all" in old Mongolian. However it was not until the Chanu name was dropped and instead replaced by "Khan" that the rulers of Mongolia claimed the divine right as the ruler of all under the blue sky, this rule was closely tied with the ancient religious beliefs of the people of Mongolia ([[Tengrism]]). The title [[Khagan]] ([[Khan (title)|khan]] of khans or grand khan) was held by [[Genghis Khan]], founder of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1206. After 1271, the emperors of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] also took the Chinese title ''huangdi'', or [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]]. Only the Khagans from Genghis Khan to the fall of the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 are normally referred to as Emperors in English.

===Vietnam===
[[File:Bảo Đại au pouvoir.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bảo Đại]], the last Emperor of Vietnam]]
Ngô Quyền, the first ruler of [[Đại Việt]] as an independent state, used the title ''Vương'' (王, ''King''). However, after the death of Ngô Quyền, the country immersed in a civil war known as [[12 Warlords Rebellion|Chaos of the 12 Lords]] that lasted for over 20 years. In the end, [[Đinh Bộ Lĩnh]] unified the country after defeating all the warlords and became the first ruler of Đại Việt to use the title ''Hoàng Đế'' (皇帝, ''Emperor'') in 968. Succeeding rulers in Vietnam then continued to use this Emperor title until 1806 when this title was stopped being used for a century.

Đinh Bộ Lĩnh wasn't the first to claim the title of ''Đế'' (帝, ''Emperor''). Before him, [[Lý Bí]] and [[Mai Thúc Loan]] also claimed this title. However, their rules were very short lived.

The Vietnamese emperors also gave this title to their ancestors who were lords or influence figures in the previous dynasty like the Chinese emperors. This practice is one of many indications of the idea "Vietnam's equality with China" which remained intact up to the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Tuyet Nhung Tran, Anthony J. S. Reid|title=Việt Nam Borderless Histories|year=2006|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-299-21770-9|ref=harv|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 the newly established Nguyễn dynasty requested canonization from Chinese [[Jiaqing Emperor]] and received the title ''Quốc Vương'' (國王, ''King of a State)'' and the name of the country as ''An Nam'' (安南) instead ''Đại Việt'' (大越). To avoid unnecessary armed conflicts, the Vietnamese rulers accepted this in diplomatic relation and use the title Emperor only domestically. However, Vietnamese rulers never accepted the vassalage relationship with China and always refused to come to Chinese courts to pay homage to Chinese rulers (a sign of vassalage acceptance). China waged a number of wars against Vietnam throughout history, and after each failure, settled for the tributary relationship. The Yuan dynasty under [[Kublai Khan]] waged three wars against Vietnam to force it into a vassalage relationship but after successive failures, [[Kublai Khan]]'s successor, [[Temür Khan]], finally settled for a tributary relationship with Vietnam. Vietnam sent tributary missions to China once in three years (with some periods of disruptions) until the 19th century, [[Sino-French War]] France replaced China in control of northern Vietnam.

The emperors of the last dynasty of Vietnam continued to hold this title until the French conquered Vietnam. The emperor, however, was then a puppet figure only and could easily be disposed of by the French for more pro-France figure. Japan took Vietnam from France and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]-occupied Vietnam was declared an [[Empire of Vietnam|empire]] by the Japanese in March 1945. The line of emperors came to an end with [[Bảo Đại]], who was deposed after the war, although he later served as head of state of [[South Vietnam]] from 1949-55.

==Oceania==
The lone holders of the imperial title in [[Oceania]] were the heads of the semi-mythical [[Tuʻi Tonga Empire]].

[[Image:Offering by Lund.jpg|thumb|right|250px|upright|A depiction of a goði leading the people in sacrificing to [[Thor]] in this painting by [[J. L. Lund]]]]

A '''goði''' or '''gothi''' (plural '''goðar''') is an [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] term for a [[tribal chief|chieftain]]-[[priest]]. '''Gyðja''' is the female form. The title is primarily known from medieval Iceland where it lived on as a secular political title after Christianization.

==History==
During the pagan era, the ''goði'' was a local chieftain who also functioned as a heathen priest. After the Settlement in Iceland, the ''hofgoði'' was a temple priest; this was usually a wealthy and respected man in his district, for he had to maintain the communal hall or ''hof'' in which community religious observances and feasts were held. The area over which a ''goði'' had leadership was termed a ''goðorð''. Over time, and especially after 1000, when the Christian conversion occurred in Iceland, the term ''goði'' lost its sacred connotations and came to mean simply "chieftain".

==Etymology==
The name appears in [[Wulfila]]'s [[Gothic language]] [[Codex Argenteus|translation of the Bible]] as ''gudja'' for "priest", but in Old Norse it is only the feminine form ''gyðja'' that perfectly corresponds to the Gothic form.&lt;ref name="gothi"&gt;[http://lexicon.ff.cuni.cz/png/oi_cleasbyvigfusson/b0208.png ''An Icelandic-English dictionary''] by [[Richard Cleasby]] and [[Gudbrand Vigfusson]] (1874) p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Norse morphology#Weak nouns|corresponding masculine]] Old Norse form would have been an unattested *''gyði''.&lt;ref name="gothi"/&gt;

In [[Scandinavia]] there are surviving early attestations in the [[Proto-Norse]] form ''gudija'' from the Norwegian Nordhuglo runestone ([[Rundata]] N KJ65 U),&lt;ref name="gotiska"&gt;The article ''gotiska'' in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the later Old Norse form ''goði'' from two Danish runestones, the [[Glavendrup stone]] (DR 209) and the Helnæs Runestone (DR 190).&lt;ref name="gothi"/&gt; There are also a few placenames, such as ''Gudby'' in [[Södermanland]], [[Sweden]], that probably retain the name.&lt;ref&gt;Hellquist, Elof. (1966). ''Svensk etymologisk ordbok''. C.W.K. Gleerups förlag, Lund. p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, there are no further surviving attestations except from Iceland where the ''goðar'' would be of historical significance.

==Neopaganism==

The term ''goði'' is often used as a priestly title by modern adherents of various denominations of [[Germanic Neopaganism]].

==See also==
* [[Althing]], a plain in medieval Iceland where the goðar assemble to decide on legislation and dispense justice.
* [[Allsherjargoði]], a goði who sanctifies the Althing, or the chief religious official of the modern [[Ásatrúarfélagið]] organisation.

Various governmental [[accounting system]]s are used by various [[public sector]] entities. In the [[United States]], for instance, there are two levels of government which follow different accounting standards set forth by independent, private sector boards. At the federal level, the [[Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board]] (FASAB) sets forth the accounting standards to follow. Similarly, there is the [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]] (GASB) for state and local level government. '''Government accounting''' can, therefore, be referred to as the process of recording and the management of all financial transactions incurred by the government which includes its income and expenditures.

==Public vs. private accounting==
There is an important difference between [[Accountancy|private sector accounting]] and governmental accounting. The main reasons for this difference is the environment of the accounting system. In the government environment, public sector entities have different goals, as opposed to the private sector entities' one main goal of gaining profit. Also, in government accounting, the entity has the responsibility of [[Fiscal policy|fiscal accountability]] which is demonstration of compliance in the use of resources in a budgetary context. In the private sector, the budget is a tool in financial planning and it isn't mandatory to comply with it. [source needed]

Government accounting refers to the field of accounting that specifically finds application in the public sector or government. A special field of accounting exists because:- 
- The objectives to which accounting reports to differ significantly from that for which generally accepted accounting practice has been developed for in the private (business) sector; &amp;
- The usage of the results of accounting processes of government differs significantly from the use thereof in the private sector.

An exception exists on the above-mentioned differences in the case of public utility businesses (for example Electricity Services) that may be intended to produce a net income or profit, but a significant debate exists over whether there should be such an exception. Nationalisation includes, amongst others, the argument that entities should be either private or public, and that the objectives of public entities should differ significantly from that of private entities. In other words, is the generation and reticulation of electricity with the objective to generate a profit in the public interest or not? And if it is the best way, shouldn’t it then be completely private instead of having access to public funds and monopolies?

Governmental accounting standards are currently being dominated by the accounting standards (internationally sometimes referred to as IFRS) originally designed for the private sector. The so-called Generally Recognised Accounting Practices (GRAP) that are being enforced in the public sector of countries such as South Africa, one of the front-runners in this regard is based on the Generally Accepted Accounting Practices originally developed for the private sector. The above and common sense raises the question of whether this is the best solution. It is, of course, cheaper and it is alleged that the history of separate development of accounting practices for government has not been successful. Even at the onset of the current fiscal crisis in Europe and other parts of the world, it was argued authoritatively that the sometimes inapplicable accounting practices of the private sector being used, have contributed to the origination of, and belated reaction to, the fiscal crisis.(1)

The governmental accounting system sometimes uses the historic system of [[fund accounting]]. A set of separate, self-balancing accounts are responsible for managing resources that are assigned to specific purposes based on [[regulations]] and [[Budget constraint|limitations]].

The governmental accounting system has a different focus for measuring accounting than private sector accounting.  Rather than measuring the flow of [[Resource (economics)|economic resources]], governmental accounting measures the flow of [[financial resources]]. Instead of recognizing [[revenue]] when they are earned and [[expenses]] when they are incurred, revenue is recognized when there is money available to liquidate [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] within the current accounting period, and expenses are recognized when there is a drain on current resources.

Governmental financial statements must be accompanied by required supplementary information (RSI).  The RSI is a comparison of the actual expenses compared to the original budget created at the beginning of the [[fiscal year]] for the Government's General Fund and all major Special Revenue Funds.

==Objectives==

The unique objectives of government accounting do not preclude the use of the double entry accounting system. There can, however, be other significant differences with private sector accounting practices, especially those that are intended to arrive at a net income result. The objectives for which government entities apply accountancy that can be organized in two main categories:
- The accounting of activities for accountability purposes. In other words, the representatives of the public, and officials appointed by them, must be accountable to the public for powers and tasks delegated. The public, who have no other choice but to delegate, are in a position that differs significantly from that of shareholders and therefore need financial information, to be supplied by accounting systems, that is applicable and relevant to them and their purposes.
- Decision-making purposes. The relevant role-players, especially officials and representatives, need financial information that is accounted, organized and presented for the objectives of their decision-making. These objectives bear, in many instances, no relation to net income results but are rather about service delivery and efficiency. The taxpayer, a very significant group, simply wants to pay as little as possible taxes for the essential services for which money is being coerced by law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">The '''Hamas–UNRWA Holocaust dispute''' erupted on  31 August 2009 following a perception in the [[Gaza Strip]] that the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) planned to include a course on human rights that speaks about the [[Holocaust]] in the eighth-grade curriculum of preparatory schools it runs in the territory. Militant Islamic movement [[Hamas]], which controls the [[Gaza Strip]], protested, calling the Holocaust "a lie made up by the [[Zionist]]s" and demanding the removal of the offending content from the curriculum. Some officials of the United Nations agency initially responded by denying that it teaches the subject of the Holocaust in its schools or that it plans to teach it in its new curriculum.&lt;ref name=argue&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/31/content_11973740.htm | title=Hamas, UNRWA argue over "Holocaust" lessons in Gaza | publisher=[[Xinhua News]] |location=Gaza| date=August 31, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Saud Ramadan, Emad Drinly| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314231647/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/31/content_11973740.htm| archivedate=March 14, 2017 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=caught&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newsday.com/news/world/un-caught-in-gaza-dispute-over-study-of-holocaust-1.1430963 | title=UN caught in Gaza dispute over study of Holocaust | work=[[Newsday]] | date=September 8, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Laub, Karin | agency=[[Associated Press]] | location=Gaza City, Gaza Strip}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slams&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSTRE57T1JW20090830 | title=Hamas slams UN over "Holocaust classes" in Gaza | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=August 31, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Nidal al-Mughrabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This denial drew criticism from various groups and individuals.

==Background==
UNRWA runs 221 of more than 600 primary and secondary schools in the Gaza Strip, educating some 200,000 children between the ages of 6 and 15.&lt;ref name=argue/&gt; The Gaza Strip has been ruled by Hamas since it seized control of the enclave in June 2007 by defeating Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]]' security forces. According to the Associated Press, "Hamas has been trying to cement control over Gaza, while the U.N. agency is increasingly emerging as a shadow government, providing services to some 1 million of Gaza's 1.4 million people".&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The Holocaust is not taught in U.N.-run schools for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, nor is it taught in Palestinian government schools in the West Bank or Gaza.&lt;ref name=caught/&gt; There is also no evidence that it was taught in Palestinian schools when these were under Israeli control between 1967 and 1994.

==Hamas protest==
Protesting what it said were plans to teach eighth-graders in U.N. schools about the Holocaust, the Hamas-affiliated [[Popular Committee of Palestinian refugees]] sent an open letter to the chief of UNRWA offices calling the Holocaust "a lie made up by the Zionists" and demanding it "immediately" erase the part that speaks about the Holocaust from the Palestinian pupils' curriculum. Husam Ahmed, the Popular Committee's coordinator in the Gaza Strip, said the material, which was to be included in a course on [[human rights]], "was formed in a way that shows sympathy with the Jews".&lt;ref name=argue/&gt;

The interior ministry of the Hamas de facto government in Gaza expressed astonishment over the UNRWA curriculum's acknowledgement of the Holocaust." "We reject teaching our pupils such thoughts that contradicts with our Palestinian beliefs," said the interior ministry statement, which called on the ministry of education "to check if such news is right."&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The head of Hamas' education committee in Gaza, [[Abdul Rahman el-Jamal]], said that the Holocaust was a "big lie".&lt;ref name=condemns&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8230483.stm Hamas condemns Holocaust lessons], BBC News 31-08-2009&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Hamas Education Minister Muhammad Askol criticized UNRWA, saying it was not respecting Hamas's "sovereignty" over Gaza. He said he planned to ask for a meeting with agency officials to "assure the necessary coordination".&lt;ref name=objects/&gt;

Hamas spiritual leader [[Yunis al-Astal]] said teaching children about the Nazi genocide of Jews would be "marketing a lie", and characterized the possible introduction of the subject into Gaza schools as a "war crime".&lt;ref name=objects&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/01/AR2009090102496.html?hpid=sec-world | title=Hamas Objects to Possible Lessons on Holocaust in U.N.-Run Schools in Gaza | work=[[Washington Post]] September 2, 2009| accessdate=January 19, 2018 | author=Schneider, Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamas spokesman [[Sami Abu Zuhri]] said that Hamas rejects any attempt to introduce the Holocaust into the curriculum as "a kind of normalization with Israel and an attempt to bridge the psychological gap between Israel and the Palestinians".&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

[[Jamila al-Shanti]], a Hamas [[Palestinian Legislative Council|legislative official]], said: "Talk about the Holocaust and the execution of the Jews contradicts and is against our culture, our principles, our traditions, values, heritage and religion".&lt;ref name=objects/&gt;

Mustafa al-Sawwaf, editor of the Hamas-run newspaper [[Filastin (newspaper)|Filastin]], said the U.N. "should also be prevented from implementing this destructive policy that harms our history and civilization as well as our people's culture."&lt;ref name=learn&gt;{{cite web | url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/08/hamas-and-the-holocaust/ | title=EDITORIAL: Hamas and the Holocaust | work=Washington Times | date=September 8, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNRWA response==
UNRWA denied that it teaches the Holocaust in preparatory schools or that the Holocaust is included in the pupils' curriculum. Adnan Abu Hasna, UNRWA spokesman in Gaza, said: "Such reports are totally untrue. The current curriculum that is taught to pupils at UNRWA schools doesn't contain any indication to the subject of the Holocaust".&lt;ref name=argue/&gt;

Similarly, according to the [[Ma'an News Agency]], UNRWA Commissioner-General [[Karen Abu Zayd]] said at a press conference on 1 September, "I can refute allegations that UN school curriculum includes anything about the Holocaust. Anyone can have a look at the school books. Really we focus on human rights in [the] curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=222848 UNRWA chief: Gaza school curriculum does not include Holocaust], [[Ma'an News Agency]] 01-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of this report was later contested by UNRWA.

The agency also denied that it was planning to include the subject in its new curriculum. Mahmoud al-Hemdeyat, director of education department of UNRWA in the Gaza Strip, said: "UNRWA hasn't finished yet from finalizing the new curriculum... As far as I know, the curriculum doesn't include anything about the Holocaust".&lt;ref name=argue/&gt;

According to the [[Associated Press]] (AP), Karen Abu Zayd suggested information about the Holocaust could be included in later years, but the curriculum being developed was still in draft stage. AP also wrote that UNWRA's website mentioned general plans to include the Holocaust in lessons on the "historical context" that gave rise to the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;
 
UNRWA chief in Gaza [[John Ging]] said he believed the dispute over the syllabus had more to do with attempts by Hamas to meddle in the U.N. organization's affairs than with the Holocaust. Ging added that he felt any human rights course is incomplete without discussing the Holocaust, but it would exceed UNWRA's mandate to write texts about the Holocaust and the Palestinian uprooting. According to one UN source, the lessons had been under consideration for the 2009-10 human rights course.&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

===Disputed quotes===
A statement by UNRWA on 4 September denied unspecified quotes which it said the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] had attributed to Karen Abu Zayd and John Ging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=434 Statement by UNRWA on Holocaust Education], UNRWA, 4 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Center had previously quoted Abu Zayd as saying "we focus on human rights in curriculum" and "the murder of 6 million Jews and 5 million other undesirables ... is not a human-rights issue", and Ging as saying "There is no intention to integrate materials and topics [on the Holocaust] that are inconsistent with the desire of Palestinian society." According to one journalist, Abu Zayd's quotes were "untraceable" and Ging's quote was "based on a computer-generated translation of an Arabic-language report by PalToday, a Gaza Strip-based news agency with Islamist sympathies, quoting a Hamas official who purported to quote Ging".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/19543/ UNRWA Denies Holocaust Quotes WASHINGTON (JTA)], Jewish Exponent 10-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of UNRWA==
The United Nations agency was criticized by various parties following initial reports that it would not be introducing discussion of the Holocaust in its human rights education:

United States Congresswoman [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] (R-Fla.) said in a statement that "by disconnecting the Holocaust from human rights, (the U.N. agency) is highlighting the [[antisemitic]] bias that pervades the U.N. system."&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] called for the dismissal of Abu Zayd and Ging and demanded the United States and Canada suspend funding for the U.N. agency pending the resolution of the issue. The United States was the second-largest donor to the agency in 2008, providing nearly $96 million of its $541.8 million budget.&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

The [[American Jewish Congress]] said in a statement: "It is... discouraging... that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency did not criticize Hamas for denying the children of Gaza knowledge of one of the central events of the 20th century. Instead, it rushed to deny that the Holocaust was being taught in its schools or that it was contemplating teaching it in the future".&lt;ref name=asked&gt;[http://www.jewishtribune.ca/TribuneV2/index.php/200909082049/UNRWA-asked-to-teach-Holocaust-defy-Hamas.html UNRWA asked to teach Holocaust, defy Hamas], Jewish Tribune 08-09-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other responses==
Jihad Zakarneh, the deputy education minister in the [[West Bank]], said teaching Palestinian children about the Holocaust has to wait until there is a peace agreement with Israel. "When Israel ends its occupation of our land and our people and gives us our right of independence and self-determination, then we discuss this issue with them".&lt;ref name=caught/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In October 2009, John Ging told ''[[The Independent]]'' that he was "confident and determined" that the Holocaust would feature in the curriculum, saying, "no human-rights curriculum is complete without the inclusion of the facts of the Holocaust, and its lessons". At the time, the curriculum was expected to be completed within weeks and then put out for consultation with parents and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Macintyre, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/un-to-teach-children-about-holocaust-in-gaza-schools-1797763.html "UN to teach children about Holocaust in Gaza schools]," The Independent, 5 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Ging confirmed in an interview that the Holocaust was being discussed in UNRWA schools in Gaza, noting "we enrich the curriculum with our human rights program, for all ages. We teach the children about the history of the human rights movement. We grounded our program in the universal declaration of human rights, which is borne out of the horrors of the Second World War. So we teach the children the horrors of the war, including the Holocaust. We are also teaching the kids about the unanimously adopted resolution on Holocaust remembrance, which is a 2005 UN resolution proposed by the state of Israel adopted in the General Assembly".&lt;ref&gt;Adi Schwartz, "[http://www.adi-schwartz.com/unrwas-existence-failure/ UNRWA’s existence is a failure]" (interview with John Ging), Adi Schwartz blog, 15 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

UNRWA efforts brought continued criticism from some Palestinian Islamists. One writer for the pro-Hamas [[Palestine Information Center]] warned that "some circles within UNRWA... have been trying to introduce 'the holocaust' {{sic}} into Palestinian school curricula in the Gaza Strip". He suggested that these efforts indicated "a virulent Zionist propensity to brainwash Palestinians, particularly young generations, into accepting or at least understanding Zionism, a hateful fascist political ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Khalid Ameyreh, "[http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/en/default.aspx?xyz=U6Qq7k%2bcOd87MDI46m9rUxJEpMO%2bi1s7uHZEh0iPWAeNUyBMO4MjFv9Au5eS55O7W1IUimwfbTHIB1SRXbZ6ivf8O4STvfR%2fDU2rfcRzzUiB8PGCHwJfENvTsdBBw26fNjv1YTwCB2o%3d We must not accept holocaust propaganda in our schools]," Palestine Information Center, 5 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further controversy erupted when it became known that UNRWA, as part of a project that brought its top human rights students from Gaza to the United States for a visit, had taken them to an exhibit on the Holocaust at UN headquarters in New York.&lt;ref&gt;No Sharp Objects (documentary, 2010), video excerpts available on "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2010/dec/10/gaza-boys-no-sharp-objects-documentary Documentary follows 15 boys from Gaza on trip to US]," ''The Guardian'', 10 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/19/hamas-un-palestinian-trip-holocaust Hamas in dispute with UN over school trips for Palestinian pupils]," The Guardian, 19 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://prrnblog.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/hamas-unrwa-and-human-rights-education/ Hamas, UNRWA, and Human Rights Education]," Palestinian Refugee ResearchNet blog, 20 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a statement issued by the Hamas refugee department, "We denounce this suspicious act in hopes that UNRWA education officials in the Gaza Strip will not repeat it; and we hope the Palestinian Authority will take a national stand to put a stop to ideological corruption on Palestine's youth."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.palestine-info.co.uk/En/default.aspx?xyz=U6Qq7k%2bcOd87MDI46m9rUxJEpMO%2bi1s7BHZU4scReZyDBxFz4OdzpiDXqBEyPlODlakAb9ziW3S81rjt02%2fmxJPu3m89trJ5utY7XE1dAj0jhK7WY4wVYVRCVKLHQ2WK0978wpmpSDM%3d Hamas castigates UNRWA for taking students to sightsee holocaust centers]," Palestine Information Center, 18 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schlaegel und Eisen nach DIN 21800.svg|thumb|150px|right|Hammer and Pick]]
The '''hammer and pick''', rarely referred to as '''hammer and chisel''', is a symbol of mining, often used in [[heraldry]]. It can indicate mining, [[Mining|mines]] (especially on maps or in [[cartography]]), or miners, and is also borne as a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] in the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[mining town]]s.

The symbol represents the [[gezähe|traditional tools]] of the [[miner]], a [[hammer]] and a [[chisel]] on a handle, similar to a [[pickaxe]], but with one blunt end. They are pictured in the way a right-handed worker would lay them down: the pick with the point to the right and the handle to the lower left, the hammer with the handle to the lower right and the head to the upper left. The handle of the pick protrudes over the head, because the head is not permanently fixed, but can be swapped for a newly sharpened head when it is blunt from use. In coats of arms the symbol is often shown in black ([[Johanngeorgenstadt]], [[Hövels]]), but also in natural colours ([[Telnice (Ústí nad Labem District)|Telnice]]) or in gold and/or silver ([[Abertamy]], [[Bodenwöhr]], [[Gelsenkirchen]]).

{{voting}}

The term '''issue voting''' describes when [[Voting|voters]] cast their vote in [[election]]s based on [[political issue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of an election, issues include "any questions of [[public policy]] which have been or are a matter of controversy and are sources of disagreement between [[political party|political parties]].”&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of issue voting, voters compare  the [[Candidate#Candidates in elections|candidates']] respective [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] against their own in order to decide for whom to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A voter does not need to have an in-depth understanding of every issue and knowledge of how a [[candidate]] stands on every issue, but rather a sense of which candidate they agree with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 132&lt;/ref&gt; Voters use many different tactics to rationalize their view on a particular issue. Some people look at what has happened in the past and predict how they think a particular issue will affect them in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue voting is often contrasted with party voting. A 2010 [[University of California, Davis]] study found that voters switch between issue voting and party voting depending on how much information is available to them about a given candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Highton, 455-458&lt;/ref&gt; [[Low information voter|Low-information elections]], such as those for [[Elections in the United States#Congressional elections|congressional candidates]], would thus be determined by [[Party politics|party voting]], whereas [[Elections in the United States#Presidential elections|presidential elections]], which tend to give voters much more information about each candidate, have the potential to be issue-driven.&lt;ref&gt;Enelow, 217-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters typically choose a political party to affiliate with in one of two ways.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; The voter will create an opinion of an issue without consulting what a political party thinks about it, then choose the political party that best fits the opinion they already have, or the voter will study the opinions of the different parties and decide which party he or she agrees with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 79, 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter's understanding of parties' principles is strengthened and developed over time as a person gains experience with more political events.&lt;ref&gt;Denver,21-23&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an issue to create the foundation for [[Political party|party]] choice, a voter must first be concerned about a particular issue and have some knowledge about that issue.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a person to be an issue voter, they must be able to recognize that there is more than one opinion about a particular issue, have formed a solid opinion about it and be able to relate that to a specific [[Political parties in the United States|political party]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 246&lt;/ref&gt; According to Campbell, only 40 to 60 percent of the informed population even perceives party differences, and can thus partake in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 104&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest that it is common for individuals to develop opinions of issues without the aid of a political party.

==History of issue voting==
Prior to [[Paul Lazarsfeld|''The People's Choice'']] study in 1944, it was assumed by political scientists that voting was based solely on issues.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 1, 2, 22&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study found little evidence of issue voting in the [[United States presidential election, 1940|United States presidential election of 1940]]. Rather, the researchers found that issues reinforced [[political party]] loyalties. Research stemming from the study concluded that voters' motivations could be broken down into three categories: [[party identification]], [[candidate]] orientation, and issue orientation. ''[[The American Voter]]'' in 1960 determined that party identification was the primary force, which in turn strongly influenced the other two categories. These three factors make up the Michigan School's approach to modeling voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, "Issue Voting"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest research on issue voting done in 1960 found that voters often did not have enough information to link specific issues to individual candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 109-102&lt;/ref&gt; Converse, in 1964, also concluded that voters did not have a sophisticated enough understanding of issues to be able to link them to candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Converse, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Key was one of the first people to conclude that voters are able to connect issues to certain candidates and cast their vote based on that information.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing knowledge of the field, reliable evidence didn't begin to appear until the 1970s. ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a symposium that hypothesized that there was a rise in issue voting in the 1960s. Nie and Anderson published an analysis of correlations with issue orientations in 1974 that attempted to revise the Michigan School's theory of the public's political belief systems' inherent limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Nie (1974) 541-591&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nie et all in ''The Changing American Voter'' attempted to explain the rise in issue voting through the fall in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Nie 47-73&lt;/ref&gt; This decline of party voting, they claimed, came about because the proportion of the electorate with no party affiliation had fallen, and because the proportion of voters who cast votes for candidates from other parties had risen.

===Rise in issue voting===
In recent years, the United States has seen a rise in issue voting.  This can be attributed to the increased [[Political polarization|polarization]] in the last century between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these parties have become more extreme in their issue viewpoints. This has alienated [[moderate]]s from their parties.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Since a large portion of American voters are moderates, an increase has been seen in the number people who choose to affiliate as [[Independent (voter)|Independent]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
Identifying as an independent allows voters to avoid the constraints of a polarized political party. An independent voter can hand-pick a candidate based upon their positions on various issues rather than on their political party.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Church|Catholics]] face the "issue voting vs. party voting" dilemma. Many Catholics support the [[opposition to legal abortion|pro-life]] stance which is backed by Republicans, but strongly oppose the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], which the Republican Party also supports. Extreme party polarization might cause Catholic voters to feel uncomfortable about both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[trade union|labor unions]] strongly identify with the Democratic Party's advocacy for workers' rights, but unions also tend to not support [[gay rights]], a stance which more closely aligns with Republican views.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications regarding issue voting==
Many factors can complicate issue voting. First, issues are not always [[dichotomy|dichotomous]]; there are often many stances one could take.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 460&lt;/ref&gt; Voters often must settle for the candidate whose stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  This can prove difficult when two or more candidates have similar opinions, or when candidates have positions that are equally far from a voter's. An example of an issue which might be difficult to issue vote on is [[Education in the United States|education]] spending. A voter may have a drastically different opinion from the available candidates on how much money should be spent on schools; this could lead the individual to vote based on party affiliation instead.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

A second complexity is that, oftentimes, problems do not line up on linear bases. That is, some issues may make it hard to even determine the candidate with the closest position.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 US presidential election]] the growing threat of [[Communism]] in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] was a salient issue for voters.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many proposed solutions to this problem; [[Ronald Reagan]] endorsed military intimidation through increased spending and innovation (the [[Reagan Doctrine]]), [[Jimmy Carter]] proposed diplomatic efforts to keep peace, and the independent [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] advocated a return to the [[containment]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bisnow, 24&lt;/ref&gt; None of these answers are [[mutually exclusive]], and they cannot be linearly plotted.  The voter would instead have to choose the candidate whose opinion represented the closest mix of possible solutions to their own.

A third problem that can complicate issue voting is if there are multiple issues that are equally salient to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate may have a similar position to a given voter on one issue, but may take a considerably different stance on another.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this occurred in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential election]]. During this election, two issues dominating attention were the economy and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Many viewed these issues as equally salient, and had a hard time picking one issue to vote on. These three complexities in issue voting have provided problems in using this tactic to choosing candidates.

A fourth problem is that voters may be unsophisticated and lack the knowledge necessary to vote based on issues. Political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] has argued that voters are generally uninformed and that their actual vote choices do not reflect the vote choices that a fully informed voter would make. He concludes that since voters lack full information, they cannot truly be issue voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-bartels3-2008nov03-story.html|title=How smart is the American voter?|date=2008-11-03|work=|publisher=LA Times|via=|last1=Bartels|first1=Larry M.|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of issue voting==
While scholars employ many models to study voting habits, there are three primary models used in statistical studies of issue voting: the linear position model, the spatial model and the salience model. Each model takes a different approach to issue voting into account.

[[File:Linear Model of Issue Voting, April 2012.jpg|thumb|Linear Model of Issue Voting|right]]
*The Linear Position Model attempts to predict how strongly an individual will issue vote in an election. The model suggests that the more a voter and candidate agree on a particular issue, the better chance the candidate has of receiving the individual's vote.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, a graph is used to display the relationship between the number of people voting for the party and the consistency of the issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; The equation “Y = a + bX” is used, where the variable “a” represents the minimal numbert of people voting for the party, “b” is a variable used to ensure that there is a positive gradient, "X" represents the consistency of the party's issue position, and Y represents the number of people who vote for the party.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426-429&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Spatial Model attempts to show the perceptions and decisions of voters when issue voting strategies are used in elections.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, 275&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes that if someone’s issue preferences are placed on a hypothetical spatial field along with all possible candidates’ policy positions, the individual will vote for the candidate whose political stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough,199-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other models that follow the idea of “closeness” are called proximity models.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 93, 96&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Salience Model asserts that the two major parties in the [[United States]] are associated with certain goals or views on an issue, and that the voter’s decision in selecting a candidate depends on the actual salience of the issue to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 93&lt;/ref&gt; This model is important when considering issue voting because it utilizes election agenda data to predict election outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niemi,1212&lt;/ref&gt; A simple view of this model can be summarized with the equation:

::Vote=a(Saliency of the party's issues)+b(Saliency of the party's issues)

::where "a"=Party 1, and "b"=Party 2

:The more important the issue becomes, the more a voter favors a particular candidate or party on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Land and Liberty''' ({{lang-es|"Tierra y Libertad"}}, {{lang-ru|Zemlya i Volya}}) is an [[anarchist]] slogan. It was originally used as a name of the Russian revolutionary organization [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Zemlya i Volya]] in 1878, then by the revolutionary leaders of the [[Mexican Revolution]]; the revolution was fought over land rights, and the leaders such as [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] were fighting to give the land back to the natives from whom it was expropriated either by force or by some dubious manner. Without land, the peasants were at the mercy of landowners for subsistence.

Similarly, during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the main concern of the peasants was to free themselves from subservience to landowners, to get a plot of land if they had none, or to expand on their land holdings. Consequently, the Russian peasants welcomed the Russian Revolution under the banner "Zemlya i Volya": "Land and Liberty".

The slogan of "Tierra y Libertad" was also used during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] (1936–1939). In 1995, a film covering the [[Spanish Civil War]] was released with the title ''[[Land and Freedom]]''.

== Meaning ==

In a narrow sense, the possession of land meant freedom from the landowner. And this may have been the main concern of both the Mexican and Russian peasants.

In a broader sense, the slogan can be interpreted to mean that the necessary (though not the sufficient) condition of liberty is something like possession or access to subsistence land. If possession or access to land is a necessary condition of liberty, then its deprivation results in some form of slavery: [[tenancy]], [[sharecropping]], [[wage-slavery]]. Access to land is only a necessary condition because even with access, the government may impose taxes to such an extent that one is not free. For example, in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1932–1933, the government was removing from the peasants their agricultural products to the extant that it produced an artificial{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} famine which directly or indirectly killed roughly 2.582 million&lt;ref name="Vallin2"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jacques Vallin |author2=France Mesle |author3=Serguei Adamets |author4=Serhii Pyrozhkov  | doi=10.1080/00324720215934 |title=A New Estimate of Ukrainian Population Losses during the Crises of the 1930s and 1940s |journal=[[Population Studies]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |date=November 2002 |pages=249–264 |jstor=3092980 |pmid=12553326}}&lt;/ref&gt; people only in [[Ukraine]]. (See [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].) So, the possession of or access to subsistence land is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for liberty.

In the following passage, [[Friedrich Albert Lange]] points out the relation of the possession of land to liberty:
"In former times the marauding minority of mankind, by means of physical violence, compelled the working majority to render feudal services, or reduced them to a state of slavery or serfdom, or at least made them pay a tribute. Nowadays the dependence of the working classes is secured in a less direct but equally efficacious manner, viz. by means of the superior power of capital; the labourer being forced, in order to get his subsistence, to place his labour power entirely at the disposal of the capitalist. So there is a semblance of liberty; but in reality the labourer is exploited and subjected, because, all the land having been appropriated, he cannot procure his subsistence directly from nature, and, goods being produced for the market and not for the producer's own use, he cannot subsist without capital. Wages will rise above what is wanted for the necessaries of life, where the labourer is able to earn his subsistence on free land, which has not yet become private property. But wherever, in an old and totally occupied country, a body of labouring poor is employed in manufactures, the same law, which we see at work in the struggle for life throughout the organized world, will keep wages at the absolute minimum".&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Albert Lange]], ''Die Arbeiterfrage. Ihre Bedeutung für Gegenwart und Zukunft''. Vierte Auflage. 1861, pp.&amp;nbsp;12, 13. Quoted by H. J. Nieboer, [http://www.ditext.com/nieboer/title.html ''Slavery: As an Industrial System''] (Ethnological Researches), 2nd edition, 1909, p.&amp;nbsp;421.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appropriation as title ==
''Land and Liberty'' is the title of a publication produced in Britain by the supporters of the land value taxation programme described by Henry George in his book ''Progress and Poverty''. The journal was first published towards the end of the nineteenth century, originally under the name "Land Values". It was given its present title just before World War I. At present, the journal is quarterly. Articles are mostly about economics and political topics, with special reference to their relationship to land tenure and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;An almost-complete archive of Land Values and ''Land and Liberty'' is held at the library of [http://www.schooleconomicscience.org The School of Economic Science] in Mandeville Place, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1605">The terms "'''mathematical elimination'''" and "'''mathematically eliminated'''" mean to be excluded in a decision, based on numerical counts, due to insufficient total numbers, even if all remaining events were 100% in favor. The excluded outcome is considered to be eliminated due to the mathematical [[probability]] being zero (0%).

The term is used in elections when a candidate lacks sufficient votes to win, even if that candidate could garner all remaining votes. In sports, the term "mathematically eliminated"

refers to situations where there are not enough future games or competitive events remaining to be played to avoid defeat, even if all future events were won.

although the meaning has varied. In a 1904 article, in the ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]'', Volume XV, errors of measurement were described as quantifiable to be "mathematically eliminated" from the analysis of the remaining data.&lt;ref name=AJP/&gt;

'''Mobutism''', also spelled '''Mobutuism''', was an official party ideology of the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] (''Mouvement Populaire de la Revolution'', MPR) as well as the official state ideology in [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) during the latter half of the 20th century. Mobutism encompassed and glorified the thoughts, visions, and policies of Zairian president and self-proclaimed "Father of the Nation," [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]. The ideology included such major Mobutu initiatives as "[[Zairianization]]."

The [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] (MPR) was entrenched as the single legal political party in a [[one-party state]] in Zaire.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Crawford; Turner, Thomas. ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State''. University of Wisconsin Press, 1985. Pp. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally Mobutu designed the [[constitution of Zaire]] to have a figurehead opposition party but later claimed that the constitution only recommended but did not demand this and thus a one-party state was created and all other political parties were banned afterwards in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iPuTjqaNOp8C&amp;lpg=PA480&amp;dq=mobutu%20ban%20political%20parties%201966&amp;pg=PA480#v=onepage&amp;q=mobutu%20ban%20political%20parties%201966&amp;f=true ''Encyclopedia of Conflict Since World War II''], James Ciment, Kenneth Hill
Routledge, 1999, page 480&lt;/ref&gt; The ideology laid down in the [[Manifesto of N'sele]], incorporated "[[Zairian nationalism|nationalism]]," "[[revolution]]," and "[[Authenticité (Zaire)|authenticity]]."&lt;ref&gt;Young, Crawford; Turner, Thomas. ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State''. University of Wisconsin Press, 1985. Pp. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Revolution was described as a "truly national revolution, essentially pragmatic," which called for "the repudiation of both capitalism and communism," favoured "national revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Young, Crawford; Turner, Thomas. ''The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State''. University of Wisconsin Press, 1985. Pp. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifesto of N'sele also laid out the intentions of the government which included expansion of the national government's authority, a program committed to upgrading labour standards, having the country gain economic independence, and the creation of an "authentic nationalism" in Zaire.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Andrew. Language and Nationality in Africa. Oxford University Press, 2008. Pp. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobutu led the MPR and Zaire as a dictator, and denounced the idea of multiple leaders and political parties in the country saying: "In our African tradition there are never two chiefs….That is why we Congolese, in the desire to conform to the traditions of our continent, have resolved to group all the energies of the citizens of our country under the banner of a single national party."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aipzAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=That+is+why+we+Congolese%2C+in+the+desire+to+conform+to+the+traditions+of+our+continent%2C+have+resolved+to+group+all+the+energies+of+the+citizens+of+our+country+under+the+banner+of+a+single+national+party&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22a+single+national+party%22 ''The rise and decline of the Zairian state''], Crawford Young, Thomas Turner, University of Wisconsin Press, 1985, page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobutu and the MPR were presented in propaganda as being attributed to the divine and sought to replace [[Christianity]] in Zaire with a [[Cult of Personality|religious devotion]] to Mobutu and the MPR with interior minister Engulu Baanga Mpongo once saying to supporters of the MPR: "God has sent a great prophet, our prestigious Guide Mobutu. This prophet is our liberator, our Messiah. Our Church is the MPR. Its chief is Mobutu. We respect him like one respects a Pope. Our gospel is Mobutuism. That is why the crucifixes must be replaced by the image of our Messiah."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1pizmqizePEC&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;ots=3SnnKWmIBe&amp;dq=Our%20gospel%20is%20Mobutuism.%20That%20is%20why%20the%20crucifixes%20must%20be%20replaced%20by%20the%20image%20of%20our%20Messiah&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q=Our%20gospel%20is%20Mobutuism.%20That%20is%20why%20the%20crucifixes%20must%20be%20replaced%20by%20the%20image%20of%20our%20Messiah&amp;f=false ''The Fate of Africa. Martin Meredith''], Public Affairs, 2006, page 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobutu and the MPR pursued a national cultural revival program in Zaire called ''Authenticité'' beginning in 1967 which sought to purge colonial European culture from Zaire and restore local culture, such as by forbidding Christian names and culture while promoting local African names and culture as well as forbidding [[Western world|western]] suits and creating a state-authorized uniform called the ''[[abacost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TKa2e3UvGMkC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=abacost%20mobutu&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q=abacost%20mobutu&amp;f=false ''The Tragic State of the Congo: From Decolonization to Dictatorship''], Jeanne M. Haskin, Algora Publishing, 2005, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideology survives today in such organizations as [[Nzanga Mobutu]]'s [[Union of Mobutuist Democrats]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16434">The '''National Socialist Program''', also known as the '''25-point Program''' or the '''25-point Plan''' ({{Lang-de|25-Punkte-Programm}}), was the party program of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP). Originally the name of the party was the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP), but on the same day as the announced party program it was renamed the NSDAP, ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''. [[Adolf Hitler]] announced the party's program on 24 February 1920 before approximately 2,000 people in the Munich Festival of the [[Hofbräuhaus]]. The National Socialist Program originated at a DAP congress in [[Vienna]], then was taken to [[Munich]], by the civil engineer and theoretician [[Rudolf Jung]], who having explicitly supported Hitler had been expelled from [[Czechoslovakia]] because of his political agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Leftism Revisited |first=Erik von |last=Kuehnelt-Leddihn |publisher=Regnery Gateway |location=Washington, DC |year=1990 |pages=147–149 |ref=harv |isbn=0-89526-537-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] summarizes the program by saying that its components were "hardly new" and that "German, Austrian, and Bohemian proponents of anti-capitalist, nationalist-imperialist, anti-Semitic movements were resorted to in its compilation," but that a call to "breaking the shackles of finance capital" was added in deference to the ''[[idee fixe (psychology)|idee fixe]]'' of [[Gottfried Feder]], one of the party's founding members, and Hitler provided the militancy of the stance against the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and the insistence that the points could not be changed, and were to be the permanent foundation of the party.  Bracher characterizes the points as being "phrased like slogans; they lent themselves to the concise sensational dissemination of the 'anti' position on which the party thrived. ... Ideologically speaking, [the program] was a wooly, eclectic mixture of political, social, racist, national-imperialist wishful thinking..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Dietrich Bracher|Bracher, Karl Dietrich]] (1970) ''The German Dictatorship'', Steinberg, Jean (translator). New York: [[Penguin Books]]. p.115 {{isbn|0-14-013724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|US Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the 25-point program "remained the party's official statement of goals, though in later years many points were ignored."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/before-1933/nazi-party-platform|title=Nazi Party Platform — United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|website=www.ushmm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German Party program==
In Munich, on 24 February 1920, Hitler publicly proclaimed the 25-point Program of the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party), when the Nazis were still known as the DAP ([[German Workers Party]]).&lt;ref&gt;Some 2000 people attended the meeting at the [[Hofbrauhaus]]; Hitler offered the program point-by-point, to an approving crowd. {{cite book  | last = Toland | first = John  | title = Adolf Hitler  | author-link=John Toland (author) |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company |pages=94–98 |year=1976 |location=New York  | isbn = 0-385-03724-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They retained the National Socialist Program upon renaming themselves as the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (NSDAP) in February 1920 and it remained the Party’s official program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kershaw | first = Ian | title = Hitler: A Biography | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | location = New York | year = 2008 | page = 87 | isbn = 978-0-393-06757-6 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 25-point Program was a German adaptation — by [[Anton Drexler]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Gottfried Feder]] and [[Dietrich Eckart]] — of Rudolf Jung’s Austro–Bohemian program. Unlike the Austrians, the Germans did not claim to being either liberal or democratic and opposed neither political [[Reactionary|reaction]] nor the [[Junker|aristocracy]], yet advocated democratic institutions (i.e. the German central parliament) and voting rights solely for Germans — implying that a Nazi government would retain popular [[suffrage]].

The Austrian monarchist [[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]] proposed that the 25-point Program was pro-labour: "[T]he program championed the [[Right to work|right to employment]], and called for the institution of [[profit sharing]], confiscation of [[Profiteering (business)|war profits]], prosecution of usurers and profiteers, nationalization of [[Trust law|trusts]], communalization of department stores, extension of the old-age [[pension]] system, creation of a [[Public education|national education]] program of all classes, prohibition of [[child labour]], and an end to the dominance of [[Financial capital|investment capital]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Liberty or Equality |edition=Fortieth anniversary |last=Kuehnelt-Leddihn |first=Erik von |publisher=Christendom Press |location=Front Royal, VA |origyear=1952 |year=1993 |page=257 |isbn=0-931888-51-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas historian [[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] proposes that said program points and party founder [[Anton Drexler]]’s statements indicate that the Nazi Party (NSDAP) originated as a [[working-class]] political party.&lt;ref name="Brustein 141"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Logic of Evil: The Social Origins of the Nazi Party, 1925–1933 |first=William |last=Brustein |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |year=1996 |page=141 |isbn=0-300-06533-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of pursuing public office, the agrarian failures of the 1920s prompted Hitler to further explain the "true" meaning of Point 17 ([[land reform]], legal land [[Nationalization|expropriation]] for public utility, abolishment of the [[land value tax]] and proscription of land [[speculation]]), in the hope of winning the farmers' votes in the May 1928 elections. Hitler disguised the implicit contradictions of Point 17 of the National Socialist Program, by explaining that "gratuitous expropriation concerns only the creation of legal opportunities, to expropriate, if necessary, land which has been illegally acquired, or is not administered from the view-point of the national welfare. This is directed primarily against the Jewish land-speculation companies".&lt;ref&gt;http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/1708-ps.asp/&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1920s, other members of the NSDAP, seeking ideologic consistency, sought either to change or to replace the National Socialist Program. In 1924, the economist [[Gottfried Feder]] proposed a 39-point program retaining some original policies and introducing new policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry A. |last=Turner |title=German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1985 |isbn=0-19-503492-9 |page=62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler suppressed every instance of programmatic change by refusing to broach the matters after 1925, because the National Socialist Program was “inviolable”, hence immutable.&lt;ref&gt;In February 1926, at the [[Bamberg Conference]], the dissident NSDAP faction endeavored to change the Program, but Hitler declared change intolerable, lest it be an insult to the memory of Nazi brethren killed at the [[Feldherrnhalle]] during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. Three months later, at the NSDAP’s annual general meeting, the National Socialist Program was declared immutable.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Henry Ashby Turner|Henry A. Turner]] notes that Hitler "conspicuously" omitted the text of the program from his political biography, ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925, 1926), where he referred to it as "the so-called program of the movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry A. |last=Turner |title=German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1985 |isbn=0-19-503492-9 |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]] writes that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;To [Hitler, the program] was little more than an effective, persuasive propaganda weapon for mobilizing and manipulating the masses.  Once it had brought him to power, it became pure decoration: 'unalterable', yet unrealized in its demands for nationalization and expropriation, for land reform and 'breaking the shackles of finance capital'.  Yet it nonetheless fulfilled its role as backdrop and pseudo-theory, against which the future dictator could unfold his rhetorical and dramatic talents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Dietrich Bracher|Bracher, Karl Dietrich]] (1970) ''The German Dictatorship'', Steinberg, Jean (translator). New York: [[Penguin Books]]. p.116 {{isbn|0-14-013724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The 25-point Program of the NSDAP===
# We demand the unification of all Germans in the [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] on the basis of the people's [[right to self-determination]].
# We demand equality of rights for the [[German people]] in respect to the other [[nations]]; abrogation of the [[peace treaties]] of [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|St. Germain]].
# We demand land and territory ([[colonies]]) for the sustenance of our people and colonization for our surplus population.
# Only a member of the race can be a [[citizen]]. A member of the race can only be one who is of German blood, without consideration of [[creed]]. Consequently, no [[Jew]] can be a member of the race.
# Whoever has no citizenship is to be able to live in Germany only as a guest and must be under the authority of [[legislation]] for [[alien (law)|foreigners]].
# The right to determine matters concerning [[administration (law)|administration]] and [[law]] belongs only to the citizen. Therefore, we demand that every [[public office]], of any sort whatsoever, whether in the [[Reich]], the [[county]] or [[municipality]], be filled only by citizens. We combat the corrupting [[parliamentary]] economy, office-holding only according to party inclinations without consideration of character or abilities.
# We demand that the [[State (polity)|state]] be charged first with providing the opportunity for a [[livelihood]] and way of life for the citizens. If it is impossible to sustain the total population of the State, then the members of foreign nations (non-citizens) are to be expelled from the Reich.
# Any further [[immigration]] of non-citizens is to be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since 2 August 1914, be forced immediately to leave the Reich.
# All citizens must have equal rights and obligations.
# The first [[obligation]] of every citizen must be to productively work mentally or physically. The activity of individuals is not to counteract the interests of the universality, but must have its result within the framework of the whole for the benefit of all. Consequently, we demand:
# Abolition of [[unearned income|unearned (work and labour) incomes]]. Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery.
# In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice in property and blood that each [[war]] demands of the people, personal enrichment through a war must be designated as a [[crime]] against the people. Therefore, we demand the total [[confiscation]] of all [[War profiteering|war profits]].
# We demand the [[nationalisation]] of all (previous) associated industries ([[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]]).
# We demand a division of [[Profit (economics)|profits]] of all [[heavy industries]].
# We demand an expansion on a large scale of [[pension|old age welfare]].
# We demand the creation of a healthy [[middle class]] and its conservation, immediate communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in [[contracts]] with the State, county or municipality.
# We demand a [[land reform]] suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free [[expropriation]] of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of [[land value tax|taxes on land]] and prevention of all [[speculation]] in land.
# We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, [[usury|usurers]], profiteers and so forth are to be [[capital punishment|punished with death]], without consideration of confession or race.
# We demand substitution of a German [[common law]] in place of the [[Roman Law]] serving a materialistic world-order.
# The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national [[education]] program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain [[higher education]] and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the state must be striven for by the school [''Staatsbürgerkunde''] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the state of outstanding intellectually [[gifted children]] of poor parents without consideration of position or profession.
# The state is to care for the elevating national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing [[child-labor]], by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young.
# We demand abolition of the [[mercenary]] troops and formation of a national army.
# We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the [[News media|press]]. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that: 
#: a. All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race;
#: b. Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the state to be published. They may not be printed in the German language;
#: c. Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications or any influence on them and as punishment for violations the closing of such a publication as well as the immediate [[wikt:expulsion|expulsion]] from the Reich of the non-German concerned. Publications which are counter to the [[general good]] are to be forbidden. We demand legal [[prosecution]] of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands.
# We demand [[freedom of religion]] for all [[religious denominations]] within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the [[moral]] senses of the [[Germanic race]]. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a [[positive Christianity]] without binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework: "The good of the community before the good of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Heiden, ''A History of National Socialism'', 1935. Translated by Alfred A. Knopf, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; ("GEMEINNUTZ GEHT VOR EIGENNUTZ" [all caps in original])&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Miller Lane, Leila J. Rupp, introduction and translation ''Nazi Ideology Before 1933: A Documentation'', Manchester University Press (1978) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;
# For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general. The forming of state and profession chambers for the execution of the laws made by the Reich within the various states of the confederation. The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support by the execution of the points set forth above without consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5433">'''Parity of esteem''' is a concept which can be applied in a variety of contexts.

==As a political philosophy==
Parity of esteem can be used to establish a theory to overcome inter-communal conflict. Promoters of the theory argue that ''"parity of esteem"'' "offers a language for negotiation of a post-conflict equilibrium". This negotiation begins with the communities recognising the stalemate of their position. Rather than continue trying to out-do each other, the communities should attempt to negotiate a peaceful coexistence in a shared physical space despite their cultural differences.

''"Parity of esteem"'' can be described as a [[Age of Enlightenment|post-Enlightenment]] theory as it differs drastically from classical [[Liberalism|liberal]] or [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[rationalism]] and is contrary to 20th-century ideas of "[[self-determination]]" or the 19th-century idea of the [[nation-state]]. Many of these anticipated a "withering away of [[nationalism]]" once minorities were brought within the nation-state. These concepts are today the most dominant within contemporary political theory. As [[Ernest Gellner]] writes, "the idea that political boundaries must be congruent with ethnic ones, that rulers must not be ethnically distinguishable from the ruled now has a salience and authority which it has never possessed in the previous history of mankind". Where Enlightenment theories addressed issues of inter-communal conflict, it did so either by promoting "non-sectarianism" against "tribalism" (liberalism) or emphasising "class politics" against "[[bourgeois nationalism]]" (Marxism). Neither of these approaches recognised the traditions of belligerents in inter-communal conflicts. ''"Parity of esteem"'' on the other hand can accepts various nationalist traditions within one state.

Interest in ''"parity of esteem"'' approaches emerged during the mid-1980s and accelerated following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the early 1990s. It was recognised that while there were 184 independent states, there were more than 600 living [[Language family|language groups]] and more than 5,000 [[ethnic groups]]. Simply put, without enough [[Geo-politics|geo-political space]], slogans such as the Serb nationalist claim for "All Serbs in One State" were simply unworkable. Since the end of the 1990s, ''"Parity of esteem"'' is a core concept to the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].

==Health care==
''"Parity of Esteem for Mental Health"'' is an issue for many [[healthcare system]]s because of the pervasive [[Mental disorder#Stigma and discrimination|stigma of mental illness]]. People with diagnosed mental illness die on average around 20 years earlier than those without such a diagnosis, some because of suicide, but mostly because of poorly treated physical illness. Mental illness has been assessed as constituting around a quarter of the [[disease burden]] in developed countries.  There is much bigger [[Global mental health#Treatment gap|treatment gap]] for mental illness than for physical illness.  

In the USA legislation was enacted in 2006 which attempted to achieve equality in health insurance coverage between surgical treatment and mental health treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parity of Esteem for Mental Health|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PN-485/POST-PN-485.pdf|accessdate=13 September 2015|issue=485|publisher=Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the UK [[Norman Lamb]] campaigned for mental health to be given parity of esteem with physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norfolk MP Norman Lamb defeated by Tim Farron in his bid to lead the LiberalD emocrats|url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/politics/norfolk_mp_norman_lamb_defeated_by_tim_farron_in_his_bid_to_lead_the_liberal_democrats_1_4156211|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] proposed that parity of esteem should be defined as "Valuing mental health equally with physical health". In practice most arguments have been centred on levels of funding.  Expenditure on mental health services provided by NHS trusts fell by around 8.25% between 2010 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mental health trust funding down 8% from 2010 despite coalition’s drive for parity of esteem|url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2015/03/20/mental-health-trust-funding-8-since-2010-despite-coalitions-drive-parity-esteem/|accessdate=13 September 2015|publisher=Community Care|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Dr Phil Moore chair of the Mental Health Commissioners Network at NHS Clinical Commissioners discussions in 2016 had degenerated into a funding dispute.  He wanted to see discussions about the degree to which mental health is embedded into other services, including the integration of psychological services with general practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal||title=\CCG deputy chair urges commissioners to refocus 'parity of esteeem'talks|journal=Commissioning Review|issue=Summer 2016|pages=36-38|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 he was elected to the [[Sejm]] from the [[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]] electoral list, and in 2001, after participating in a secession from that party, he successfully ran under the [[Civic Platform]] banner. In 2004 he was the Secretary General of Civic Platform.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 11 April 2004, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/11/eu.features In from the cold]&lt;/ref&gt; He has been elected Member of the [[European Parliament]] in 2004. April 26, 2006 excluded from the Civic Platform{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. Since February 2009 he has been the chairman of the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Newsweek.pl, 21 February 2009, [http://www.newsweek.pl/artykuly/sekcje/polska/pawel-piskorski-nowym-szefem-sd,36713,1 Paweł Piskorski nowym szefem SD]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged corruption==

In April 2006 Polish newspaper "Dziennik" informed about the purchased transaction performed in 2005 by Pawel Piskorski with his wife of more than 320 hectares of land for afforestation. The total cost of the purchase amounted to 1.25 million zł. According to the journalist of this newspaper, this amount exceeded the value of assets declared by an MEP in a financial statement for that year.&lt;ref&gt;Bankier.pl,April 2006, [http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Skad-Piskorski-mial-pieniadze-na-zakup-lasu-1426101.html Where did Piskorski had the money to purchase the forest from?]&lt;/ref&gt; Pawel Piskorski had explained that the money came from the sale of housing, credit, savings and current income him and his wife. That declaration had not been officially challenged by any public authority. Nevertheless, Piskorski's reputation has been irrecoverably damaged. The day after the publication of the national board of the PO decided about his exclusion from the party, which was followed on May 17 be removal of all his  ten collaborators, among others, Piotr Fogler. The official reason stated was damages to the image of the Civic Platform.&lt;ref&gt;wp.pl, April 2006,[http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1342,wid,8288689,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=16d71, Pawel Piskorski removed from Civic Platform ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009 Piotr Piskorski joined the Democratic Party, thus becoming the only MEP of the party, as well as declaring his intention to run for the position of chairman. This position is obtained at an extraordinary congress Democratic Party, held on February 21 the same year. However, his nomination was followed by the publication of his statements given to National Revenue Service agency to explain sources of his income. He tried to explain that he earned money by persistent winnings at the casino and by art trading. The public  opinion has taken these clarifications with disbelief, which torpedoed election campaign of the Democratic Party.

In January 2010, introduced prosecutor charged him with the use of a forged document (contract with an antique dealer) in tax proceedings. Pawel Piskorski pleaded not guilty to committing this act.

Piskorski is listed in the [[Panama Papers]] as a beneficiary or shareholder in an [[offshore company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/|title=The Power Players|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4355">'''Peripheral nationalism''' refers to the [[nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments of some regions or territorial entities within a [[sovereign state]], in occasions in conflict with the larger concept of the [[nation-state]] in which they reside, and trying to construct a minority social space.&lt;ref name=regionales&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revistaestudiosregionales.com/pdfs/pdf345.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203055324/http://www.revistaestudiosregionales.com/pdfs/pdf345.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2014|title=El nacionalismo, un factor de desarrollo|last1=Barriuso Díaz|first1=Santos|last2=Castro Ruano|first2=José Luis|work=Estudios Regionales No. 30|year=1991|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peripheral nationalism is so called because the regions in which it exists are at the "periphery" as opposed to the "center" of the territory of the State.

Peripheral nationalism occurs in a culturally or linguistically distinctive territory —  and oftentimes with a different socioeconomic degree of development — that resists incorporation or assimilation into an expanding State,&lt;ref name=hechter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalismproject.org/what/hechter.htm|title=Types of Nationalism|last=Hechter|first=Michael|work=The Nationalism Project|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or resists the larger Statewide nationalist construction. Existing theories of peripheral nationalism explain that the emergence of peripheral nationalism occurs in regions with a larger or greater degree of economic development in relation to the rest of the State, overlapping spatially delimited ethnic communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kevsam.com/mmw6researchpape/657890.pdf|title=Patterns of Development and Nationalism: Basque and Catalan Nationalism before the Spanish Civil War|last=Diez Medrano|first=Juan|publisher=Theory and Society, Vol. 23, No. 4|date=August 1994|pages=541–56|accessdate=29 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204104249/http://www.kevsam.com/mmw6researchpape/657890.pdf|archivedate=4 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is the case in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] or [[Catalonia]] in [[Spain]], or [[Xinjiang]] in [[China]].&lt;ref name=wang&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/~ymz8097/Wang-Xinjiang%20nationalism.pdf|title=Toward a Synthesis of the Theories of Peripheral Nationalism: A Comparative Study of China’s Xinjiang and Guangdon|author=Yuan-Kang Wang|work=Asian Ethnicity, Volume 2, Number 2|date=September 2001|accessdate=3 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213222008/http://homepages.wmich.edu/~ymz8097/Wang-Xinjiang%20nationalism.pdf|archivedate=13 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, peripheral nationalism may also emerge in regions with ''lesser'' economic development, as was the case in [[Ireland]] or [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=wang/&gt; Peripheral nationalism may also emerge in opposition to the State seeking legitimacy through hegemony or domination by imposing a nationalistic sentiment which is then resisted by the smaller peripheral nationalisms, which defend their "cultural nation."&lt;ref name=seiler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ips.sagepub.com/content/10/3/191.abstract|title=Peripheral Nationalism Between Pluralism and Monism|author=D.L.

Even if the aim of peripheral nationalists is emancipation, their solution may not be the creation of a nation-state for themselves, in which case a federal solution is preferred, according with the concept of "regional pluralism" in opposition to [[monism]] or imperialism.&lt;ref name=seiler/&gt; Peripheral nationalisms may demand a recognition of the national identity of their own regions (i.e. their own existence as a "nation"). The existence of such nations may coexist within the State they belong to (e.g. by proposing the concept of a "nation composed of several nations" or a "[[plurinationalism|nation of nations]]"), or they may defend their right to self-determination, secession, and the ability to create their own independent State.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10179">The '''political climate''' is the aggregate mood and opinions of a political society at a particular time. It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable rather than in a state of equilibrium. The phrase has origins from both [[ancient Greece]] and medieval-era [[France]].

While the concept of a political [[climate]] has been used historically to describe both [[politics]] and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier “political” to the base “climate” has been fairly recent. [[Public opinion]] is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate.

As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, [[Opinion poll|polls]] are used to estimate what the political climate "feels" like on a regular basis. However, this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once.

==Etymology==

===Climate===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the base climate comes from the Middle French ''climat'', which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.&lt;ref&gt;"climate." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50041503?query_type=word&amp;queryword=climate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-tXioM1-15462&amp;hilite=50041503&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded uses of climate as a description of prevailing political attitudes was in The Vanity of Dogmatizing by [[Joseph Glanvill]] in 1661 where he mentions “divers Climates of Opinions”.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Joseph. The Vanity of Dogmatizing. London: H. Eversden, 1661. 227. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The modifier (''politic'' with the ''–al'' suffix) comes originally from the ancient Greek noun ''polis'' which referred to both a Greek city state, and the ideal state or government.&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary"&gt;"politic." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182868?query_type=word&amp;queryword=politic&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-Cqhody-15489&amp;hilite=50182868&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this evolved through the Latin noun ''politicus'' which is defined as the civil government,&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary" /&gt; to the Middle French adjective ''politique'' which is the state of government, or relating to government.&lt;ref&gt;"polis." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182842?query_type=word&amp;queryword=polis&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=T1SE-DsbNxa-15502&amp;result_place=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===Historical example===
{{Main article|Trial of Socrates}}
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787).]]

From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Gutenburg: Project Gutenburg, 2009. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic. 

Socrates—the self-described "gadfly" of Athens because of his practice of ''elenchos'' (critical interrogation)—was seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government.&lt;ref&gt;Bagby, Laurie. Political Thought: A Guide to The Classics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group, 2002. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, C.D.C. ''The Trials of Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
{{Main article|Public opinion}}
The phrase originates from the French term ''opinion publique'', which was first attributed to [[Montaigne]], the father of modern [[Skepticism]] and a major figure of the [[French Renaissance]], around 1588 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. [[Public opinion]] is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are.

Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over [[Proposition 8]] in [[California]] brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the [[United States]] as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Maura. "Prop. 8: Protesters on both sides of gay-marriage issue make their views known outside courthouse." Los Angeles Times 6 December 2010: Web. 8 December 2010. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/demonstrators-proposition-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion polls===
An [[opinion poll]] is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a [[cross-sectional data|cross-section]] of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the [[Wall Street Journal]] estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as [[response bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Bialik, Carl. "Grading the Pollsters." Wall Street Journal 16 November 2006: Web. 22 September 2010.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116360961928023945%23mod=2_1125_1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the [[1948 US presidential election]], in which the prediction was that [[Thomas Dewey]] would easily defeat [[Harry Truman]]. Major polling organizations, including [[George Gallup|Gallup]] and [[Elmo Roper|Roper]], indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, Steve. "Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election." Gallup Brain: A Publication of Gallup, Inc. (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7444/gallup-brain-strom-thurmond-1948-election.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK "[[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit]]" referendum and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|US presidential election]] were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/09/how-the-pollsters-got-the-us-election-wrong---just-like-brexit/|title=How the pollsters got the US election wrong - just like Brexit|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls widely predicted a win for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton]], while instead [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate Donald J. Trump]] won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and, therefore, the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/|title=Why 2016 election polls missed their mark|date=2016-11-09|newspaper=Pew Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political corruption sidebar}}

'''Political corruption''' is the use of powers by government officials or their network contacts for illegitimate private gain. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, is done under [[color of law]] or involves [[Influence peddling|trading in influence]].

Forms of [[corruption]] vary, but include [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[parochialism]], [[patronage]], [[influence peddling]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. Corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking]], though is not restricted to these activities. Misuse of [[government]] power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is also considered political corruption. [[Corruption in Lithuania#Examples post-2016|Masiulis case]] is a typical example of political corruption.

The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, some political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or ill-defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.
Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title=African corruption 'on the wane'|date=10 July 2007|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning "rule by thieves".

Some forms of corruption – now called "institutional corruption"&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis. ''Ethics in Congress: From Individual to Institutional Corruption'' (Washington DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1995).  {{ISBN|0-8157-8423-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; – are distinguished from bribery and other kinds of obvious personal gain.  A similar problem of corruption arises in any institution that depends on financial support from people who have interests that may conflict with the primary purpose of the institution.

Over time, corruption has been defined differently. For example, in a simple context, while performing work for a government or as a representative, it is unethical to accept a gift. Any free gift could be construed as a scheme to lure the recipient towards some biases. In most cases, the gift is seen as an intention to seek certain favors such as work promotion, tipping in order to win a contract, job or exemption from certain tasks in the case of junior employee giving the gift to a senior employee who can be key in winning the favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=Vito|date=1998-12-01|title=Corruption Around the World: Causes, Consequences, Scope, and Cures|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.2307/3867585|journal=Staff Papers|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=559–594|doi=10.2307/3867585|issn=0020-8027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
===Effects on politics, administration, and institutions===
In politics, corruption undermines democracy and [[good governance]] by flouting or even subverting formal processes. Corruption in elections and in the legislature reduces accountability and distorts representation in policymaking; corruption in the judiciary compromises the [[rule of law]]; and corruption in [[public administration]] results in the inefficient provision of services.  It violates a basic principle of [[republicanism]] regarding the centrality of civic virtue.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank"/&gt;

More generally, corruption erodes the institutional capacity of government if procedures are disregarded, resources are siphoned off, and public offices are bought and sold. Corruption undermines the legitimacy of government and such democratic values as trust and tolerance. Recent evidence suggests that variation in the levels of corruption amongst high-income democracies can vary significantly depending on the level of accountability of decision-makers.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first= Alexander |year=2013 |title= Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf |format=PDF |publisher= World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from [[fragile state]]s also shows that corruption and bribery can adversely impact trust in institutions.&lt;ref name="bath.ac.uk"&gt;Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J. (2014) The Tribes that Bind: Attitudes to the Tribe and Tribal Leader in the Sudan. Bath Economic Research Papers 31/14. [http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/31-14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, A 2014"&gt;Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J. (2014) Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan. Bath Economic Research Papers 30/14.[http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/30-14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can also impact government’s provision of goods and services. It increases the costs of goods and services which arise efficiency loss. In the absence of corruption, governmental projects might be cost-effective at their true costs, however, once corruption costs are included projects may not be cost-effective so they are not executed distorting the provision of goods and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Economic effects===
{{see also|Economics of corruption|Corporate crime}}
In the [[private sector]], corruption increases the cost of business through the price of illicit payments themselves, the management cost of negotiating with officials and the risk of breached agreements or detection. Although some claim corruption reduces costs by cutting [[bureaucracy]], the availability of bribes can also induce officials to contrive new rules and delays. Openly removing costly and lengthy regulations are better than covertly allowing them to be bypassed by using bribes. Where corruption inflates the cost of business, it also distorts the field of inquiry and action, shielding firms with connections from competition and thereby sustaining inefficient firms.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros, [http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think "Corruption and development.

Corruption may have a direct impact on the firm's effective marginal tax rate. Bribing tax officials can reduce tax payments of the firm if the marginal bribe rate is below the official marginal tax rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in Uganda, bribes have a higher negative impact on firms’ activity than taxation. Indeed, a one percentage point increase in bribes reduces firm’s annual growth by three percentage points, while an increase in 1 percentage point on taxes reduces firm’s growth by one percentage point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisman|first=Raymond|last2=Svensson|first2=Jakob|date=2007|title=Are corruption and taxation really harmful to growth? Firm level evidence|url=|journal=Journal of Development Economics|volume=83|issue=1|pages=63–75|doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2005.09.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption also generates economic distortion in the [[public sector]] by diverting public investment into capital projects where bribes and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] are more plentiful. Officials may increase the technical complexity of public sector projects to conceal or pave the way for such dealings, thus further distorting investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uneca.org/aec/documents/Mina%20Baliamoune-Lutz_%20Leonce%20Ndikumana.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309123826/http://www.uneca.org/aec/documents/Mina%20Baliamoune-Lutz_%20Leonce%20Ndikumana.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-09 |title=Corruption and growth in African countries: Exploring the investment channel, lead author Mina Baliamoune-Lutz, Department of Economics |publisher=University of North Florida |page=1,2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption also lowers compliance with construction, environmental, or other regulations, reduces the quality of government services and infrastructure, and increases budgetary pressures on government.

Economists argue that one of the factors behind the differing [[economic development]] in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] is that in Africa, corruption has primarily taken the form of [[rent seeking|rent extraction]] with the resulting [[financial capital]] moved overseas rather than invested at home (hence the stereotypical, but often accurate, image of African dictators having [[Swiss bank|Swiss bank accounts]]). In [[Nigeria]], for example, more than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/nigerias-corruption-busters.html |title=Nigeria's corruption busters |publisher=Unodc.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] researchers estimated that from 1970 to 1996, [[capital flight]] from 30 [[Sub-Saharan]] countries totaled $187bn, exceeding those nations' external debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200503140015 |title=When the money goes west |publisher=New Statesman |date=2005-03-14 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706191351/http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200503140015 |archivedate=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The results, expressed in retarded or suppressed development, have been modeled in theory by economist [[Mancur Olson]].) In the case of Africa, one of the factors for this behavior was political instability and the fact that new governments often confiscated previous government's corruptly obtained assets. This encouraged officials to stash their wealth abroad, out of reach of any future [[Nationalization|expropriation]]. In contrast, Asian administrations such as [[Suharto]]'s [[Orde Baru|New Order]] often took a cut on business transactions or provided conditions for development, through infrastructure investment, law and order, etc.

===Environmental and social effects===
{{further|Human impact on the environment}}
[[File:Corrupt-Legislation-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|Detail from ''Corrupt Legislation'' (1896) by [[Elihu Vedder]]. Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
Corruption is often most evident in countries with the smallest per capita incomes, relying on foreign aid for health services. Local political interception of donated money from overseas is especially prevalent in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n nations, where it was reported in the 2006 [[World Bank|World Bank Report]] that about half of the funds that were donated for health usages were never invested into the health sectors or given to those needing medical attention.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=10.2307/20032209|title=The Challenge of Global Health on JSTOR|publisher=|doi=10.2307/20032209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the donated money was expended through "[[Counterfeit medications|counterfeit drugs]], siphoning off of drugs to the black market, and payments to ghost employees". Ultimately, there is a sufficient amount of money for health in developing countries, but local corruption denies the wider citizenry the resource they require.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Corruption facilitates environmental destruction. While corrupt societies may have formal legislation to protect the environment, it cannot be enforced if officials can easily be bribed. The same applies to social rights worker protection, [[Trade union|unionization]] prevention, and [[child labor]]. Violation of these laws rights enables corrupt countries to gain illegitimate economic advantage in the international market.

The [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Amartya Sen]] has observed that "there is no such thing as an apolitical food problem." While drought and other naturally occurring events may trigger [[famine]] conditions, it is government action or inaction that determines its severity, and often even whether or not a famine will occur.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/15/wipro-tata-corruption-ent-law-cx_kw_0814whartonindia.html|title=Will Growth Slow Corruption In India?|publisher=Forbes | date=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments with strong tendencies towards [[kleptocracy]] can undermine [[food security]] even when harvests are good. Officials often steal state property. In [[Bihar]], [[India]], more than 80% of the subsidized food aid to poor is stolen by corrupt officials.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; Similarly, food aid is often robbed at gunpoint by governments, criminals, and warlords alike, and sold for a profit. The 20th century is full of many examples of governments undermining the food security of their own nations – sometimes intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheeter |first=Laura |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm |title=Ukraine remembers famine horror |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-11-24 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on humanitarian aid===
The scale of [[humanitarian aid]] to the poor and unstable regions of the world grows, but it is highly [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] to corruption, with food aid, construction and other highly valued assistance as the most at risk.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Sarah Bailey (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2385&amp;title=corruption-risks-perceptions-prevention-humanitarian-assistance Need and greed: corruption risks, perceptions and prevention in humanitarian assistance] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Food aid can be directly and physically diverted from its intended destination, or indirectly through the manipulation of assessments, targeting, registration and distributions to favor certain groups or individuals.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In construction and shelter there are numerous opportunities for diversion and profit through substandard workmanship, kickbacks for contracts and favouritism in the provision of valuable shelter material.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Thus while humanitarian aid agencies are usually most concerned about aid being diverted by including too many, recipients themselves are most concerned about exclusion.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Access to aid may be limited to those with connections, to those who pay bribes or are forced to give sexual favors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Equally, those able to do so may manipulate statistics to inflate the number of beneficiaries and siphon off additional assistance.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Malnutrition, illness, wounds, torture, harassment of specific groups within the population, disappearances, extra-judicial executions and the forcible displacement of people are all found in many armed conflicts. Aside from their direct effects on the individuals concerned, the consequences of these tragedies for local systems must also be considered: the destruction of crops and places of cultural importance, the breakdown of economic infrastructure and of health-care facilities such as hospitals, etc., etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jpcj.htm|title=The impact of humanitarian aid on conflict development - ICRC|first=Pierre|last=Perrin|date=30 June 1998|website=www.icrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on health===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

Corruption plays a huge role in health care system starting from the hospital, to the government and lifted to the other institutions that promote quality and affordable health care to the people. The efficiency of health care delivery in any country is heavily dependent on accountable and transparent systems, proper management of both financial and human resources and timely supply of services to the vulnerable populace of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nazim|first=Habibov|date=March 2016|title=Effect of corruption on healthcare satisfaction in post-soviet nations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.01.044|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|pages= 119–124|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the basic level, greed skyrockets corruption. When the structure of the health care system is not adequately addressed beginning from oversight in healthcare delivery and supply of drugs and tendering process, mismanagement and misappropriation of funds will always be observed.Corruption also can undermine health care service delivery which in turn disorients the lives of the poor. Corruption leads to violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms as people supposed to benefit from the basic health care from the governments are denied due to unscrupulous processes driven by greed. Therefore, for a country to keep citizens healthy there must be efficient systems and proper resources that can tame the evils like corruption that underpin it.

=== Effects on Education ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

Education forms the basis and the fabric in which a society is transformed and different facets of well-being are shaped.Corruption in higher education has been prevalent and calls for immediate intervention. Increased corruption in higher education has led to growing global concern among governments, students and educators and other stakeholders. Those offering services in the higher education institutions are facing pressure that highly threatens the integral value of higher education enterprise. Corruption in higher education has a larger negative influence, it destroys the relation between personal effort and reward anticipation. Moreover, employees and students develop a belief that personal success does not come from hard work and merit but through canvassing with teachers and taking other shortcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borcan|first=Oana|date=February 2017|title=Fighting corruption in education|url=|journal=American Economic Journal|volume= 9|pages= 180–209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic promotions in the higher education institutions have been disabled by unlimited corruption. Presently, promotion is based on personal connections than professional achievements. This has led to dramatic increase in the number of professors and exhibits their rapid status loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altbach|first=Philiph|date=2015|title=The Question of Corruption|url=|journal=International Higher Education|volume= 34|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utmost the flawed processes in the academic institutions has led to unbaked graduates who are not well fit to the job market. Corruption hinders the international standards of an education system. Additionally, Plagiarism is a form of corruption in academic research, where it affects originality and disables learning. Individual violations are in close relation to the operation ways of a system.

Furthermore, the universities may be in relationships and dealings with business and people in government, which majority of them enrol in doctoral studies without the undergraduate program.Consequently, money, power and related influence compromise education standards since they are fueling factors. A Student may finish thesis report within a shorter time upon which compromises the quality of work delivered and questions the threshold of the higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heyneman|first=Stephen|date=2015|title=The corruption of ethics in higher education|url=|journal=International Higher Education|volume= 62|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other areas:public safety, trade unions, police corruption etc. ===
{{see also|academic corruption}}
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}&lt;!--many scandalous examples, each of which should have a reference to serious documentation--&gt;
Corruption is not specific to poor, developing, or transition countries. In western countries, cases of bribery and other forms of corruption in all possible fields exist: under-the-table payments made to reputed surgeons by patients attempting to be on top of the list of forthcoming surgeries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Cash+bribes+patients+atop+surgery+waiting+lists/3893239/story.html |title=Cash bribes put patients atop surgery waiting lists |publisher=''The Vancouver Sun'' |date=November 27, 2010 |last=Fidelman |first=Charlie |accessdate=2011-01-21 }}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; bribes paid by suppliers to the automotive industry in order to sell low-quality connectors used for instance in safety equipment such as airbags, bribes paid by suppliers to manufacturers of defibrillators (to sell low-quality capacitors), contributions paid by wealthy parents to the "social and culture fund" of a prestigious university in exchange for it to accept their children, bribes paid to obtain diplomas, financial and other advantages granted to unionists by members of the executive board of a car manufacturer in exchange for employer-friendly positions and votes, etc. Examples are endless.

These various manifestations of corruption can ultimately present a danger for public health; they can discredit specific, essential institutions or social relationships.   Osipian summarized a 2008 "study of corruption perceptions among Russians ... .30 percent of the respondents marked the level of corruption as very high, while another 44 percent as high. 19 percent considered it as average and only 1 percent as low. The most corrupt in people's minds are traffic police (33 percent), local authorities (28 percent), police (26 percent), healthcare (16 percent), and education (15 percent). 52 percent of the respondents had experiences of giving money or gifts to
medical professionals while 36 percent made informal payments to educators." He claimed that this corruption lowered the rate of economic growth in Russia, because the students disadvantaged by this corruption could not adopt better work methods as quickly, lowering thereby [[total factor productivity]] for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osipian|first1=Ararat|title=Education Corruption, Reform, and Growth: Case of Post-Soviet Russia|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/17447/|website=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|publisher=Munich University Library|accessdate=2016-05-21|date=2009-09-22|ref = MPRA Paper No. 17447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can also affect the various components of sports activities (referees, players, medical and laboratory staff involved in anti-doping controls, members of national sport federation and international committees deciding about the allocation of contracts and competition places).

Cases exist against (members of) various types of non-profit and non-government organizations, as well as religious organizations.

Ultimately, the distinction between public and private sector corruption sometimes appears rather artificial, and national anti-corruption initiatives may need to avoid legal and other loopholes in the coverage of the instruments.

==Types==

===Bribery===
{{Main|Bribery}}
In the context of political corruption, a bribe may involve a payment given to a government official in exchange of his use of official powers. [[Bribery]] requires two participants: one to give the bribe, and one to take it. Either may initiate the corrupt offering; for example, a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed (or disallowed) goods, or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage. In some countries the culture of corruption extends to every aspect of public life, making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes. Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do. They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations. In addition to their role in private financial gain, bribes are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another (i.e. no financial incentive).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In some developing nations, up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |title= How common is bribe-paying? |quote=...a relatively high proportion of families in a group of Central Eastern European, African, and Latin American countries paid a bribe in the previous twelve months. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120405045051/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |archivedate= April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]] dissociates active and passive bribery and to incriminates them as separate offences:

* One can define '''active bribery''' as "the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage to any of its public officials, for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions" (article 2 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168007f3f5 |title= Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 173 |publisher= Conventions.coe.int |accessdate= 2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Council of Europe]]). 
* '''Passive bribery''' can be defined as "when committed intentionally, the request or receipt by any [...] public officials, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions" (article 3 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

This dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a "fee" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174):&lt;ref name="conventions"/&gt;  ''For the purpose of this Convention, "corruption" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.

===Trading in influence===
{{Main|Influence peddling}}
[[File:The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|"The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler" (1889)|Reformers like the American [[Joseph Keppler]] depicted the Senate as controlled by the giant moneybags, who represented the nation's financial trusts and monopolies.]]
Trading in influence, or [[influence peddling]], refers a person selling his/her influence over the decision making process to benefit a third party (person or institution). The difference with bribery is that this is a tri-lateral relation. From a legal point of view, the role of the third party (who is the target of the influence) does not really matter although he/she can be an accessory in some instances. It can be difficult to make a distinction between this form of corruption and some forms of extreme and loosely regulated [[lobbying]] where for instance law- or decision-makers can freely "sell" their vote, decision power or influence to those lobbyists who offer the highest compensation, including where for instance the latter act on behalf of powerful clients such as industrial groups who want to avoid the passing of specific environmental, social, or other regulations perceived as too stringent, etc. Where lobbying is (sufficiently) regulated, it becomes possible to provide for a distinctive criteria and to consider that trading in influence involves the use of "improper influence", as in article 12 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; of the [[Council of Europe]].

===Patronage===
{{Main|Patronage}}
[[Patronage]] refers to favoring supporters, for example with government employment. This may be legitimate, as when a newly elected government changes the top officials in the administration in order to effectively implement its policy. It can be seen as corruption if this means that incompetent persons, as a payment for supporting the regime, are selected before more able ones. In nondemocracies many government officials are often selected for loyalty rather than ability. They may be almost exclusively selected from a particular group (for example, [[Sunni]] Arabs in [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq, the [[nomenklatura]] in the [[Soviet Union]], or the [[Junker]]s in [[Imperial Germany]]) that support the regime in return for such favors. A similar problem can also be seen in Eastern Europe, for example in [[Romania]], where the government is often accused of [[patronage]] (when a new government comes to power it rapidly changes most of the officials in the public sector).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher |first=Tom |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443792604577572910124653818 |title=The EU Can't Ignore Its Romania Problem |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The above was replaced 2014-09-03 with the following reference to Pakistan.  This is unacceptable, because it is potentially libelous without a citation to a credible source.  I'm placing this comment here, because the edit was made anonymously, i.e., by an IP number -- and it was made it 2 steps, which meant that I couldn't just revert it.  If the author is invited to insert this change here again with an appropriate source but without destroying the reference to Romania.  It might be appropriate to add sections on both Romania and Pakistan to the Wikipedia article on "Patronage".  If that was done, it might be appropriate to delete the reference to Romania here, retaining the one to Pakistan -- provided it was supported by solid reference(s). // Addition deleted:  "[[Pakistan]], where the government is often accused of patronage ; namely Benazir, Zardari and Mian Nawaz Sharif are labeled corrupt politicians having numerous cases of corruption. Currently the Prime minister of Pakistan Mian Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz Sharif are accused of murder."  --&gt;

===Nepotism and cronyism===
{{Main|Nepotism|Cronyism}}
Favoring relatives ([[nepotism]]) or personal friends ([[cronyism]]) of an official is a form of illegitimate private gain. This may be combined with [[bribery]], for example demanding that a business should employ a [[kinship|relative]] of an official controlling regulations affecting the business. The most extreme example is when the entire state is inherited, as in [[North Korea]] or [[Syria]]. A lesser form might be in the Southern United States with [[Good ol' boy]]s, where women and minorities are excluded. A milder form of cronyism is an "[[old boy network]]", in which appointees to official positions are selected only from a closed and exclusive social network – such as the alumni of particular universities – instead of appointing the most competent candidate.

Seeking to harm enemies becomes corruption when official powers are illegitimately used as means to this end. For example, trumped-up charges are often brought up against journalists or writers who bring up politically sensitive issues, such as a politician's acceptance of bribes.

===Gombeenism and parochialism===
{{Main|Gombeen man|Parochialism}}
[[Gombeen man|Gombeenism]] refers to an individual who is dishonest and corrupt for the purpose of personal gain, more often through monetary, while, [[parochialism]] which is also known as parish pump politics relates to placing local or vanity projects ahead of the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R.

===Electoral fraud===
{{Main|Electoral fraud}}
'''Electoral fraud''' is illegal interference with the process of an [[election]]. Acts of [[fraud]] affect vote counts to bring about an election result, whether by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Also called '''voter fraud''', the mechanisms involved include illegal voter registration, intimidation at polls, voting computer [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], and improper vote counting.

===Embezzlement===
{{Main|Embezzlement}}
[[Embezzlement]] is the theft of entrusted funds. It is political when it involves public money taken by a public official for use by anyone not specified by the public. A common type of embezzlement is that of personal use of entrusted government resources; for example, when an official assigns public employees to renovate his own house.

===Kickbacks===
{{main|Kickback (bribery)}}
{{see also|Anti-competitive practices|Bid rigging|Fraud|Charbonneau Commission}}
A [[Money trail|kickback]] is an official's share of misappropriated funds allocated from his or her organization to an organization involved in corrupt [[bidding]]. For example, suppose that a politician is in charge of choosing how to spend some public funds. He can give a [[contract]] to a [[General contractor|company]] that is not the best bidder, or allocate more than they deserve. In this case, the company benefits, and in exchange for betraying the public, the official receives a kickback payment, which is a portion of the sum the company received. This sum itself may be all or a portion of the difference between the actual (inflated) payment to the company and the (lower) market-based price that would have been paid had the bidding been competitive.

Another example of a kickback would be if a judge receives a portion of the profits that a business makes in exchange for his judicial decisions.

Kickbacks are not limited to government officials; any situation in which people are entrusted to spend funds that do not belong to them are susceptible to this kind of corruption.

===Unholy alliance===
{{Main|Unholy alliance (geopolitical)}}
An [[Unholy alliance (geopolitical)|unholy alliance]] is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups for [[ad hoc]] or hidden gain, generally some influential non-governmental group forming ties with political parties, supplying funding in exchange for the favorable treatment. Like patronage, unholy alliances are not necessarily illegal, but unlike patronage, by its deceptive nature and often great financial resources, an unholy alliance can be much more dangerous to the [[public interest]]. An early use of the term was by former US President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt]]:

:"To destroy this invisible Government, to dissolve the '''unholy alliance''' between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day." – 1912 [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] Platform, attributed to Roosevelt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patricia O''Toole Sunday, Jun. 25, 2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1207791-2,00.html |title=O'Toole, Patricia, "The War of 1912," TIME in Partnership with CNN, Jun. 25, 2006 |publisher=Time.com |date=2006-06-25 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quoted again in his autobiography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/55/15b.html |title=Roosevelt, Theodore. ''An Autobiography:'' XV. The Peace of Righteousness, Appendix B, New York: Macmillan, 1913 |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he connects [[trust (19th century)|trusts]] and [[monopoly|monopolies]] (sugar interests, [[Standard Oil]], etc.) to [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Howard Taft]], and consequently both major [[political parties]].

===Involvement in organized crime===
An illustrative example of official involvement in [[organized crime]] can be found from 1920s and 1930s [[Shanghai]], where Huang Jinrong was a police chief in the [[French concession]], while simultaneously being a gang boss and co-operating with [[Du Yuesheng]], the [[Green Gang|local gang]] ringleader. The relationship kept the flow of profits from the gang's gambling dens, prostitution, and protection rackets undisturbed.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The United States accused [[Manuel Noriega]]'s government in [[Panama]] of being a "[[narcokleptocracy]]", a corrupt government profiting on [[illegal drug trade]]. Later the U.S. invaded Panama and captured Noriega.

==Conditions favorable for corruption==
It is argued that the following conditions are favorable for corruption:
* Information deficits
** Lacking [[freedom of information legislation]]. In contrast, for example: The Indian [[Right to Information Act]] 2005 is perceived to have "already engendered mass movements in the country that is bringing the lethargic, often corrupt bureaucracy to its knees and changing power equations completely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |title=AsiaMedia :: Right to Information Act India's magic wand against corruption |publisher=Asiamedia.ucla.edu |date=2006-08-31 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926172330/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |archivedate=2008-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Lack of investigative reporting in the local media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/investigative_journalists_as_anti_corruption_activists_interview_gerardo_re |title=Investigative journalists as anti-corruption activists: An interview with Gerardo Reyes |publisher=Transparency.org |date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Contempt for or negligence of exercising [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]].
** Weak [[accounting]] practices, including lack of timely financial management.
** Lack of measurement of corruption. For example, using regular surveys of households and businesses in order to quantify the degree of perception of corruption in different parts of a nation or in different government institutions may increase awareness of corruption and create pressure to combat it. This will also enable an evaluation of the officials who are fighting corruption and the methods used.
** [[Tax haven]]s which tax their own citizens and companies but not those from other nations and refuse to disclose information necessary for foreign taxation. This enables large-scale political corruption in the foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,,1994976,00.html |title=Western bankers and lawyers 'rob Africa of $150bn every year |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2009-12-05 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Mathiason}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* Lacking control of the government.
** Lacking [[civic society]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s which monitor the government.
** An individual voter may have a [[rational ignorance]] regarding politics, especially in nationwide elections, since each vote has little weight.
** Weak [[civil service]], and slow pace of [[Civil service reform in developing countries|reform]].
** Weak [[rule of law]].
** Weak [[Lawyer|legal profession]].
** Weak [[judicial independence]].
** Lacking protection of [[whistleblower]]s.
*** [[Government Accountability Project]]
** Lack of [[benchmarking]], that is continual detailed evaluation of procedures and comparison to others who do similar things, in the same government or others, in particular comparison to those who do the best work. The Peruvian organization Ciudadanos al Dia has started to measure and compare transparency, costs, and efficiency in different government departments in Peru. It annually awards the best practices which has received widespread media attention. This has created competition among government agencies in order to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more |title=Why benchmarking works – PSD Blog – World Bank Group |publisher=Psdblog.worldbank.org |date=2006-08-17 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920181947/http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more |archive-date=2009-09-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Individual officials routinely handle cash, instead of handling payments by [[giro]] or on a separate cash desk – illegitimate withdrawals from supervised bank accounts are much more difficult to conceal.
** Public funds are centralized rather than distributed. For example, if $1,000 is embezzled from a local agency that has $2,000 funds, it is easier to notice than from a national agency with $2,000,000 funds. See the [[subsidiarity|principle of subsidiarity]].
** Large, unsupervised public investments.
** Pay disproportionately lower than that of the average citizen. 
** Government licenses needed to conduct business, e.g., [[import license]]s, encourage bribing and kickbacks.
** Long-time work in the same position may create relationships inside and outside the government which encourage and help conceal corruption and favoritism. Rotating government officials to different positions and geographic areas may help prevent this; for instance certain high rank officials in French government services (e.g. [[Trésor public|treasurer-paymasters general]]) must rotate every few years.
** Costly [[political campaign]]s, with expenses exceeding normal sources of political funding, especially when funded with taxpayer money.
** A single group or family controlling most of the key government offices.  Lack of laws forbidding and limiting number of members of the same family to be in office .
** Less interaction with officials reduces the opportunities for corruption. For example, using the Internet for sending in required information, like applications and tax forms, and then processing this with automated computer systems. This may also speed up the processing and reduce unintentional human errors. See [[e-Government]].
** A windfall from exporting abundant natural resources may encourage corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/cies/papers/0320.pdf |title=Resources for Sale: Corruption, Democracy and the Natural Resource Curse |format=PDF |last1=Damania |first1=Richard |first2=Erwin |last2=Bulte |date=July 2003 |publisher=Centre for International Economic Studies, University of Adelaide |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906123659/http://www.adelaide.edu.au/cies/papers/0320.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See [[Resource curse]])''
** [[War]] and other forms of conflict correlate with a breakdown of [[public security]].
* Social conditions
** Self-interested closed cliques and "[[old boy network]]s".
** Family-, and clan-centered social structure, with a tradition of [[nepotism]]/favouritism being acceptable.
** A [[gift economy]], such as the Soviet [[Blat (term)|blat]] system, emerges in a Communist [[centrally planned economy]].
** Lacking [[literacy]] and [[education]] among the population.
** Frequent [[discrimination]] and [[bullying]] among the population.
** Tribal solidarity, giving benefits to certain ethnic groups.  In India for example, the political system, it has become common that the leadership of national and regional parties are passed from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/soutikbiswas/2011/01/is_india_sliding_into_a.html |title=Is India sliding into a hereditary monarchy?|author=Soutik Biswas |date=2011-01-18 |work=BBC |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/column/the-gandhi-dynasty-politics-as-usual/20110805.htm|title=The Gandhi dynasty: Politics as usual|first1=Manjeet|last1=Deo|last2=Kripalani |date=2011-08-05 |work=Rediff|publisher=Rediff News|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** creating a system in which a family holds the center of power. Some examples are most of the Dravidian parties of south India and also the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]], which is one of the two major political parties in India.
** Lack of strong laws which forbid members of the same family to contest elections and be in office as in India where local elections are often contested between members of the same powerful family by standing in opposite parties so that whoever is elected that particular family is at tremendous benefit.

===Media===
[[q:Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]] observed a tendency for "The functionaries of every government ... to command at will the liberty and property of their constituents.  There is no safe deposit [for liberty and property] ... without information. Where the press is free, and every man able to read, all is safe."

Recent research supports Jefferson's claim.  Brunetti and Weder found "evidence of a significant relationship between more press freedom and less corruption in a large cross-section of countries." They also presented "evidence which suggests that the direction of causation runs from higher press freedom to lower corruption."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Snyder and Strömberg found "that a poor fit between newspaper markets and political districts reduces press coverage of politics. ... Congressmen who are less covered by the local press work less for their constituencies: they are less likely to stand witness before congressional hearings ... . Federal spending is lower in areas where there is less press coverage of the local members of congress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

An analysis of the evolution of mass media in the [[United States]] and [[European Union]] since World War II noted mixed results from the growth of the Internet:  "The digital revolution has been good for freedom of expression [and] information [but] has had mixed effects on freedom of the press":  It has disrupted traditional sources of funding, and new forms of Internet journalism have replaced only a tiny fraction of what's been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Starr| first = Paul | year = 2012

===Size of public sector===
Extensive and diverse public spending is, in itself, inherently at risk of cronyism, kickbacks, and embezzlement. Complicated regulations and arbitrary, unsupervised official conduct exacerbate the problem. This is one argument for [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]]. Opponents of privatization see the argument as ideological. The argument that corruption necessarily follows from the opportunity is weakened by the existence of countries with low to non-existent corruption but large public sectors, like the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs110 |title=Lessons From the North|publisher=Project Syndicate |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries score high on the [[Ease of Doing Business Index]], due to good and often simple regulations and have [[rule of law]] firmly established. Therefore, due to their lack of corruption in the first place, they can run large public sectors without inducing political corruption. Recent evidence that takes both the size of expenditures and regulatory complexity into account has found that high-income democracies with more expansive state sectors do indeed have higher levels of corruption.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank" /&gt;

Like other governmental economic activities, also privatization, such as in the sale of government-owned property, is particularly at the risk of cronyism. Privatizations in Russia, Latin America, and East Germany were accompanied by large-scale corruption during the sale of the state-owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have reported widely the grand corruption that accompanied the sales, studies have argued that in addition to increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less.&lt;ref&gt;Privatization in Competitive Sectors: The Record to Date. Sunita Kikeri and John Nellis. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 2860, June 2002. [http://www.econ.chula.ac.th/about/member/sothitorn/privatization.pdf Econ.Chula.ac.th] artimort.pdf IDEI.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325112620/http://www.econ.chula.ac.th/about/member/sothitorn/privatization.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the principle of subsidiarity is applied: a government service should be provided by the lowest, most local authority that can competently provide it. An effect is that distribution of funds in multiple instances discourages embezzlement because even small sums missing will be noticed. In contrast, in a centralized authority, even minute proportions of public funds can be large sums of money.

==Governmental corruption==
If the highest echelons of the governments also take advantage of corruption or embezzlement from the state's treasury, it is sometimes referred to the [[neologism]] ''[[kleptocracy]]''. Members of the government can take advantage of the [[natural resource]]s (e.g., diamonds and oil in a few prominent cases) or state-owned productive industries. A number of corrupt governments have enriched themselves via foreign aid. Indeed, there is a positive correlation between aid flows and high levels of corruption within recipient countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Svensson |first=Jakob |year=2000 |title=Foreign Aid and Rent-Seeking |doi=10.1016/S0022-1996(99)00014-8 |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=437–461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alesina |first=Alberto |authorlink=Alberto Alesina |last2=Weder |first2=Beatrice |authorlink2=Beatrice Weder di Mauro |year=2002 |title=Do Corrupt Governments Receive less Foreign Aid? |doi=10.1257/00028280260344669 |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corrupt [[dictatorship]] typically results in many years of general hardship and suffering for the vast majority of citizens as [[civil society]] and the [[rule of law]] disintegrate. In addition, corrupt dictators routinely ignore economic and [[society|social]] problems in their quest to amass ever more wealth and power.

The classic case of a corrupt, exploitive dictator often given is the regime of [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko]], who ruled the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (which he renamed [[Zaire]]) from 1965 to 1997. It is said that usage of the term [[kleptocracy]] gained popularity largely in response to a need to accurately describe Mobutu's regime. Another classic case is [[Nigeria]], especially under the rule of General [[Sani Abacha]] who was ''[[de facto]]'' president of Nigeria from 1993 until his death in 1998.  He is reputed to have stolen some [[US$]]3–4 billion.  He and his relatives are often mentioned in [[Advance-fee fraud|Nigerian 419 letter scams]] claiming to offer vast fortunes for "help" in laundering his stolen "fortunes", which in reality turn out not to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Who wants to be a millionaire? – An online collection of Nigerian scam mails&lt;/ref&gt; More than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nigeria's corruption totals $400 billion |publisher=''[[Malaysia Today]]'' |date=June 27, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211033642/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/06/nigerias-corruption-totals-400-billion.htm |archivedate=2007-12-11|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/06/nigerias-corruption-totals-400-billion.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, articles in various financial periodicals, most notably ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, have pointed to [[Fidel Castro]], General Secretary of the Republic of [[Cuba]] from 1959 until his death in 2016, of likely being the beneficiary of up to $900 million, based on "his control" of state-owned companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/2006-05-04-castro_x.htm |title=Fidel Castro net worth rises, according to 'Forbes' |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-05-04 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of his regime claim that he has used money amassed through weapons sales, narcotics, international loans, and confiscation of private property to enrich himself and his political cronies who hold his dictatorship together, and that the $900 million published by [[Forbes]] is merely a portion of his assets, although that needs to be proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Ben |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BenShapiro/2006/08/02/the_death_of_fidel_castro |title=Ben Shapiro :: Townhall.com :: The death of Fidel Castro |publisher=Townhall.com |date=2006-08-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judiciary corruption==
There are two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private. [[Budget]] of the judiciary in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the [[constitutional economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judicial corruption]] can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pahis|first1=Stratos|title=Corruption in Our Courts: What It Looks Like and Where It Is Hidden|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=2009|volume=118|accessdate=1 August 2015|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/corruption-in-our-courts-what-it-looks-like-and-where-it-is-hidden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the anti-corruption bureau fights against corruption, and a new ombudsman bill called [[Jan Lokpal Bill]] is being prepared.

In the 1990s, initiatives were taken at an international level (in particular by the [[European Community]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[OECD]]) to put a ban on corruption: in 1996, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/cm/Home_en.asp |title=Committee of Ministers – Home |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, adopted a comprehensive Programme of Action against Corruption and, subsequently, issued a series of anti-corruption standard-setting instruments:
* the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173);&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
* the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174);&lt;ref name="conventions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=174&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=7/18/2008&amp;CL=ENG |title=Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 174 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight against Corruption (Resolution (97) 24);&lt;ref name="coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/documents/Resolution(97)24_EN.pdf |title=Council of Europe: Resolution (97) 24: On the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight Against Corruption |publisher=Coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Recommendation on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials (Recommendation No. R (2000) 10);&lt;ref name="Rec 2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/documents/Rec(2000)10_EN.pdf |title=Recommendation No. R (2000) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials |publisher=Coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of these instruments was to address the various forms of corruption (involving the public sector, the private sector, the financing of political activities, etc.) whether they had a strictly domestic or also a transnational dimension. To monitor the implementation at national level of the requirements and principles provided in those texts, a monitoring mechanism – the [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (also known as GRECO) (French: Groupe d'Etats contre la corruption) was created.

Further conventions were adopted at the regional level under the aegis of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS or OEA), the [[African Union]], and in 2003, at the universal level under that of the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]].

==Whistleblowers==&lt;!-- dummy edit to identify attribution ; can be deleted. --&gt;

{{Main|Whistleblower}}
A whistleblower (also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower) is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct within an organization that is either private or public. The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways: violation of company policy/rules, law, regulation, or threat to public interest/national security, as well as fraud, and corruption. Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to the surface either internally or externally. Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor. Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned. Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.

Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on private sector, or public sector. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.

Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an ethical approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of ongoing ethical debate. Leading arguments in the ideological camp that whistleblowing is ethical to maintain that whistleblowing is a form of civil disobedience, and aims to protect the public from government wrongdoing. In the opposite camp, some see whistleblowing as unethical for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information. Legal protection can also be granted to protect whistleblowers, but that protection is subject to many stipulations. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and legal trouble. However, the decision and action have become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and communication. Whistleblowers frequently face reprisal, sometimes at the hands of the organization or group they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law. Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing, the moral responsibility of whistleblowing, and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of political ethics.

==Measuring corruption==
Measuring corruption accurately is difficult if not impossible due to the illicit nature of the transaction and imprecise definitions of corruption.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |title=A Users' Guide to Measuring Corruption |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131012755/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Few reliable measures of the magnitude of corruption exists and among those, there is a high level of heterogeneity. One of the most common ways to estimate corruption is through perception surveys. They have the advantage of good coverage, however, they do not measure corruption precisely.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olken|first=Benjamin A.|last2=Pande|first2=Rohini|date=|title=Corruption in Developing Countries|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/73081/1/Olken_Corruption%20in.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Economics|volume=4|pages=479–509|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110917}}&lt;/ref&gt; While "corruption" indices first appeared in 1995 with the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] CPI, all of these metrics address different proxies for corruption, such as public perceptions of the extent of the problem.&lt;ref name="Galtung, Fredrik 2006"&gt;Galtung, Fredrik (2006). "Measuring the Immeasurable: Boundaries and Functions of (Macro) Corruption Indices," in Measuring Corruption, Charles Sampford, Arthur Shacklock, Carmel Connors, and Fredrik Galtung, Eds. (Ashgate): 101–130.&lt;/ref&gt; However, over time the refinement of methods and validation checks against objective indicators has meant that, while not perfect, many of these indicators are getting better at consistently and validly measuring the scale of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf |title= Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand? A Comparative Analysis of Different Indicators of Corruption|last=Hamilton|first= Alexander|date=2017|website=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transparency International]], an anti-corruption [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], pioneered this field with the CPI, first released in 1995. This work is often credited with breaking a taboo and forcing the issue of corruption into high-level development policy discourse. Transparency International currently publishes three measures, updated annually: a CPI (based on aggregating third-party polling of public perceptions of how corrupt different countries are); a Global Corruption Barometer (based on a survey of general public attitudes toward and experience of corruption); and a [[Bribe Payers Index]], looking at the willingness of foreign firms to pay bribes. The Corruption Perceptions Index is the best known of these metrics, though it has drawn much criticism&lt;ref name="Galtung, Fredrik 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sik |first=Endre |year=2002 |chapter=The Bad, the Worse and the Worst: Guesstimating the Level of Corruption |title=Political Corruption in Transition: A Skeptic's Handbook |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Kotkin |editor2-first=Andras |editor2-last=Sajo |location=Budapest |publisher=Central European University Press |pages=91–113 |isbn=963-9241-46-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, Christiane and Charles Oman (2006).

This index evaluates the risk of corruption in countries' military sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transparency is feasible |author=Mark Pyman |publisher=dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/transparency-international-assesses-82-governments-defence-related-corruption-risks-first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank collects a range of data on corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/governance/data/ |title=WBI Governance &amp; Anti-Corruption – Data |publisher=Worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; including survey responses from over 100,000 firms worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/Data/ExploreTopics/corruption |title=Corruption – World Bank Survey of Business Managers |publisher=Enterprisesurveys.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a set of indicators of governance and institutional quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.worldbank.org/IU54LJVHT0 |title=Public Sector Governance – Indicators of Governance &amp; Institutional Quality |publisher=Go.worldbank.org |date=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, one of the six dimensions of governance measured by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] is Control of Corruption, which is defined as "the extent to which power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as 'capture' of the state by [[elite]]s and private interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance |year=2007 |publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, The World Bank |page=3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527211855/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the definition itself is fairly precise, the data aggregated into the Worldwide Governance Indicators is based on any available polling: questions range from "is corruption a serious problem?" to measures of public access to information, and not consistent across countries. Despite these weaknesses, the global coverage of these datasets has led to their widespread adoption, most notably by the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]].&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

A number of parties have collected survey data, from the public and from experts, to try and gauge the level of corruption and bribery, as well as its impact on political and economic outcomes.&lt;ref name="bath.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, A 2014"/&gt;
A second wave of corruption metrics has been created by [[Global Integrity]], the International Budget Partnership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalbudget.org|title=Home - International Budget Partnership|website=International Budget Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many lesser known local groups. These metrics include the [[Global Integrity Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://report.globalintegrity.org/ |title=The Global Integrity Report &amp;#124; Global Integrity |publisher=Report.globalintegrity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308204055/http://report.globalintegrity.org/ |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; first published in 2004. These second wave projects aim to create policy change by identifying resources more effectively and creating checklists toward incremental reform. Global Integrity and the International Budget Partnership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalbudget.org/ |title=International Budget Partnership |publisher=Internationalbudget.org |date=2012-05-28 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; each dispense with public surveys and instead uses in-country experts to evaluate "the opposite of corruption" – which Global Integrity defines as the public policies that prevent, discourage, or expose corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://report.globalintegrity.org/methodology/whitepaper.cfm |title=The Global Integrity Report: 2009 Methodology White Paper |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307194427/http://report.globalintegrity.org/methodology/whitepaper.cfm |archivedate=2011-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches compliment the first wave, awareness-raising tools by giving governments facing public outcry a checklist which measures concrete steps toward improved governance.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

Typical second wave corruption metrics do not offer the worldwide coverage found in first wave projects and instead focus on localizing information gathered to specific problems and creating deep, "unpackable"{{clarify|date=December 2014}} content that matches quantitative and qualitative data.

Alternative approaches, such as the British aid agency's Drivers of Change research, skips numbers and promotes understanding corruption via political economy analysis of who controls power in a given society.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

==Institutions dealing with political corruption==
* [[Global Witness]], an international NGO established in 1993 that works to break the links between natural resource exploitation, conflict, poverty, corruption, and human rights abuses worldwide
* [[Group of States Against Corruption]], a body established under the Council of Europe to monitor the implementation of instruments adopted by member states to combat political corruption
* [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (disambiguation)]]
* [[International Anti-Corruption Academy]]
* [[The Sovereign American Commission for Political Corruption Accountability (SACPCA)]] was originally a subsidiary of the non-profit organization, 'the U.S. Civil Rights Enforcement Authority (USCREA),' and formed in March 2017 to investigate a number of anonymous emails USCREA had then received related to President Trump's unexpected removal of Preet Bharara as Assistant U.S. Attorney (Southern District of New York).  SACPCA was restructured in July 2017 as a public benefit corporation having the corporate purpose of "identifying, investigating &amp; prosecuting politically corrupt practices," and presently operates under a legal mandate whereby the identities of its shareholders and directors are kept strictly confidential. &lt;http://sacpca.ltd{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&gt;

Precedence to modern fascism can be seen in the culture and government of older nations based heavily on law and order, such as the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[ancien régime|anciens régimes]] of Europe.

Other people that have been labeled proto-fascist are [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Charles Maurras]] and [[Ion Dragoumis]] (by John Mazis in his book "A Man For All Seasons"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ethnikonkratos.gr/2017/06/05/%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BC%CE%AC%CE%B6%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BF-%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BC%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%BD-%CE%AD%CF%87%CF%89-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BC/|title=Γιάννης Μάζης: «Ο Δραγούμης δεν έχω καμία αμφιβολία ότι ήταν ένας πρωτοφασίστας»|date=2017-06-04|work=Εθνικόν Κράτος|access-date=2018-10-23|language=el-GR}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Public interest''' is "the [[welfare]] or [[well-being]] of the [[general public]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/public+interest "Public interest"], ''[[Random House Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Economist Lok Sang Ho in his ''Public Policy and the Public Interest''&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, 2012 (first published published in 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the public interest must be assessed impartially and, therefore, defines the public interest as the "''[[ex ante]]'' welfare of the representative individual." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415664660/ Ho, Lok Sang, Public Policy and the Public Interest, Routledge, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[thought experiment]], by assuming that there is an equal chance for one to be anyone in society and, thus, could benefit or suffer from a change, the public interest is by definition enhanced whenever that change is preferred to the status quo ''ex ante''. This approach is "''ex ante''", in the sense that the change is not evaluated after the fact but assessed before the fact without knowing whether one would actually benefit or suffer from it.

This approach follows the "[[veil of ignorance]]" approach, which was first proposed by [[John Harsanyi]] but popularized by [[John Rawls]] in his 1971 ''Theory of Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John (1971) ''A Theory of Justice'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, however, the approach can be traced to [[John Stuart Mill]], who, in his letter to [[George Grote]], explained that "human happiness, even one's own, is in general more successfully pursued by acting on general rules, than by measuring the consequences of each act; and this is still more the case with the general happiness, since any other plan would not only leave everybody uncertain what to expect, but would involve perpetual quarrelling..."&lt;ref&gt;Francis E. Mineka and Dwight N. Lindley (ed.), ''The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume XIV - The Later Letters of John Stuart Mill 1849-1873 Part I, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972, Vol. XV, p.&amp;nbsp;762, 1862.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] argues that applying a detailed definition is likely to result in [[unintended consequences]], in [http://www.icaew.com/publicinterest Acting in the Public Interest](2012). Instead, each circumstance needs to be assessed based on criteria such as the relevant public, wants, and constraints. The key to assessing any public interest decision is transparency of the decision-making process, including balancing competing interests.

==Law==
{{main|Public interest law}}
[[File:Brandeis office 1916.jpg|thumb|Brandeis (center) in his office 1916.]]
“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built upon a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. 
In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists" (http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html); Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14(2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work — wishing to have an effect on the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest law does not describe a body of law or a legal field; the term was adopted to describe whom the public interest lawyers were representing, rather than what matters they would work on. Instead of representing powerful economic interests, they chose to be advocates for otherwise underrepresented individuals. Consequently, a significant current in public interest lawyering has always emphasized the need to provide legal services to those living in poverty. The term has grown, however, to encompass a broader range of activities of lawyers and non-lawyers working toward a multitude of objectives, including civil rights, civil liberties, women’s rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on. Nevertheless, a common denominator for public interest lawyers in the United States and in a growing number of countries remains the ethic of “fighting for the little guy”—that is, representing the underrepresented and vulnerable segments of society.&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;Scott L. Cummings &amp; Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

{{globalize|date=February 2017}}

Public interest has been considered as the core of "[[democratic theories of government]]” and often paired with two other concepts, "[[convenience]]" and "[[Need|necessity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Napoli, Philip M. (2001). Foundations of Communications Policy. Principles and Process in the Regulation of Electronic Media. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press&lt;/ref&gt; Public interest, convenience and necessity appeared for the first time in the Transportation Act of 1920 and also appeared in the [[Radio Act of 1927]]. After that, these three concepts became critical criteria for making communication policies and solving some related disputes.

'''Sidney (or Sydney) Stanley''' (''né'' '''Solomon Wulkan''', alias '''Solomon Koszyski''',&lt;ref name="wb161"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''161&lt;/ref&gt; alias '''Stanley Rechtand''',&lt;ref name="WB136"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''136&lt;/ref&gt; later '''Schlomo ben Chaim'''&lt;ref name="WB246"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''246&lt;/ref&gt;) (1899/1905&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) at ''p.''63 claims that Stanley was 43 at the time of the tribunal but at ''pp''136–137 he suggests that he was 14 in 1913&lt;/ref&gt; – 1969) was a Polish ''émigré'' to the UK who became a dubious businessman of precarious ethics before claiming to be a ''contact man'', able to influence politicians and civil servants in return for cash bribes, claims that led to a great scandal and investigation by the [[Lynskey tribunal]] of 1948. There is also evidence that Stanley [[espionage|spied]] against the UK for the armed nationalist activist [[Irgun]] organisation. Stanley was ordered deported, but had lost his Polish nationality, and as a result was a [[statelessness|stateless person]]. Stanley was then placed under heavy restrictions and police surveillance. In 1949, he evaded police and fled to [[France]] and thence to [[Israel]], where he was granted citizenship through right-of-return. There he lived out the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.

==Early life==
Stanley was the eldest son of twelve children born in Poland. He had emigrated to Britain with his father&lt;ref name="dispatch"&gt;Account of his wife, published in the ''Sunday Dispatch'' 30 January 1949, quoted in Wade Baron (1966), ''p.''237&lt;/ref&gt; in 1913,&lt;ref name="WB136"/&gt; the rest of the family following when the two had settled in [[Aldgate]].&lt;ref name="dispatch"/&gt; He later said he was born in [[Oświęcim]]. He was granted a [[Polish passport]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron 1966) ''p.''242&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a fairly ambiguous account of his early career but seems to have been employed from the age of 14 in garment sales and trading, especially in government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''136–137&lt;/ref&gt; He took his mother's name Koszyski.&lt;ref name="wb161"/&gt;

He married his first wife Kate Zeitlin after World War I and the couple lived in [[Stoke Newington]] with Zeitlin's mother.&lt;ref name="dispatch"/&gt;

Stanley was made bankrupt in 1927, under the name Wulkan, and again in 1936, under the name Blotz.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''143&lt;/ref&gt; A [[deportation]] order was made against him in 1933 for [[conspiracy to defraud]]&lt;ref name="wb161"/&gt; though he proved untraceable.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''243&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1946, he had established himself in a luxurious seven-room apartment in [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meeting with Gibson==
According to Stanley, in 1946, he was returning by train from a business trip to [[Manchester]] when the guard enquired whether he would make up a foursome for a game of [[solo whist]] with some other men. He consequently met [[George Gibson (trade unionist)|George Gibson]], a director of the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref name="WB139"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''139&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's account is that his party had asked Stanley for small change for their game and that Stanley had recognised Gibson through a common acquaintance, Cyril Ross.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''170&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson met Stanley several more times on the Manchester train before, in April 1947, running into him in the company of Marcus Wulkan, an American who had been involved in economic assistance to Britain during World War II and who was slightly known to Gibson. Stanley represented Wulkan as being his brother. Gibson invited the two to dinner, where they now met junior government minister [[John Belcher (politician)|John Belcher]], and after that Gibson visited Stanley's Park Lane home frequently.&lt;ref name="WB139"/&gt; At a subsequent dinner party attended by [[Morgan Phillips]] and four other [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs, Stanley became involved in raising finance for the [[anti-communist]] "Freedom and Democracy" organisation,&lt;ref name="WB139"/&gt; though he appears to have done little more than donate a cheque for £50 which was dishonoured.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''180&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1946, Stanley approached fur-dealer Cyril Ross, the common acquaintance from the Manchester train, with a business proposition. Ross said that he would be interested in a multiple store such as J.&amp;nbsp;Jones of Manchester. Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for flotation as a public company from the [[Capital Issues Committee]]. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.&amp;nbsp;Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1948, Gibson introduced [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] [[Glenvil Hall]] to Stanley, believing that Marcus Wulkan might be in a position to arrange an American loan of £250 million to the UK government. At a dinner for Gibson on 23 March, Stanley ensured that he sat next to [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''361&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertaining Mr Belcher==
Belcher was keen to network with industrialists and was flattered by Stanley's apparent solicitude. The two rapidly became friends and Stanley offered Belcher use of a house that he had rented at [[Margate]] for the duration of the 1947 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference. Belcher took the opportunity to invite his wife, children and mother for a two-week vacation, and it soon became apparent to Stanley that the party was too large for his rented house. Stanley booked the party into a hotel in [[Cliftonville]] and, though Belcher at this point became nervous, Stanley insisted and prevailed. In the end, Belcher indulged himself thoroughly and the friendship between the pair became increasingly intimate.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley pressed more and more gifts of food and wine, a gold cigarette-case and ultimately a suit of a quality beyond the means, and clothing coupons, of a junior minister in post-war Britain. Stanley was full of rather vague industrial and commercial propositions that never came to any resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''23&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley also paid for suits for Gibson and [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Minister of Works]] [[Charles Key]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''121&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people warned of Stanley's unreliability including [[Hugh Dalton]], [[Leonard Joseph Matchan]] and Morgan Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spying==
In November 1947 an [[MI5]] report recorded that a man named "Stanley" had been passing information to Irgun from cabinet minister [[Manny Shinwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''360&lt;/ref&gt; Shinwell certainly knew Stanley whom he had approached for help in finding employment for his son Ernie, and Stanley had obtained information on the disbandment of the [[Transjordan Frontier Force]] from some government source.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt;

==Football pools==
Harry Sherman was a director of [[Shermans Pools Ltd]] of [[Cardiff]], a [[football pools]] promoter. The post-war paper-shortage had led the government to make an allocation of paper to the [[Football Pool Promoters' Association]] and to leave the association to share it among its members.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard,18 November 1947 adjournment debate 18 November 1947 (football pools reorganization)&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman believed his share to be unjust and took every opportunity to canvass anyone who could influence his case or find him an alternative source. However, Sherman's record of complaints of his misconduct in a closely regulated industry led the [[Board of Trade]] to start a [[prosecution]] against the company in January 1948. The [[magistrate]] who heard the case died before giving judgment and Sherman and his legal team galvanised into action to prevent a new hearing. Belcher was the minister responsible and was inundated with protests.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley contacted Sherman sometime in May, claiming to have already discussed the paper problems with Sherman's brother.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, D. "[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Generous+Sherman+brothers+should+not+be+forgotten%3B+Time+to+remember.-a080221051|Generous Sherman brothers should not be forgotten; Time to remember]", ''South Wales Echo'', 19 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, Stanley introduced Sherman to Gibson and to Glenvil Hall. Sherman sought a public flotation of Shermans Ltd but needed the permission of the Capital Issues Committee though neither politician was optimistic. Stanley also canvassed Key over some premises that he was attempting to sell to Sherman.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''91&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April, Stanley invited Belcher to stop by his Park Lane apartment. When he arrived he found Sherman. Belcher left angrily and later rebuked Stanley. Belcher decided to drop the prosecution against Sherman but the allocation of paper was now under his direct control and Sherman became still more insistent in seeking to increase his ration. Stanley continued to intercede on Sherman's behalf and Belcher agreed to meet with Sherman and the civil servant in charge of paper rationing on 24 June. At this meeting, Sherman revealed that he had been routinely exceeding his allocation. The government team were appalled and stopped the meeting indicating that they considered the matter a serious one and that an investigation would be inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the investigation could get under way, Sherman alleged that he had paid Stanley so that Stanley, in turn, could pay [[GBP]]2,500 each to Belcher and Sir [[Frank Soskice]], the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]]. Sherman also claimed that he had loaned GBP12,000 to Stanley, secured by a GBP27,000 [[cheque]] made out to Lass &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''29&lt;/ref&gt; The cheque turned out to be a forgery, made out on a stolen blank cheque.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''32&lt;/ref&gt; Appalled, and becoming increasingly aware that rumours were beginning to circulate, Belcher tried to warn Gibson but could not contact him. Senior civil servants had now become aware of the allegations and the police were involved. Belcher agreed that the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt]] should be alerted and asked to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''33–34&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September, Belcher received a request from Jowitt that he provide a statement about his dealings with Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''36&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October, the first rumours, though no names, appeared in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stanley's arrest==
Jacob Harris was a supplier of amusement machines whose solicitor also acted for Stanley. The solicitor had originally met Stanley through [[service (law)|serving]] a bankruptcy notice on him and had ended up as his attorney. The original debtor never got paid. Stanley boasted of his surplus import licenses and the solicitor advised Harris whom he knew wanted to import [[pinball]] machines.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''72&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1948, Harris approached fellow supplier Francis Price with a proposal that they meet with Stanley. Stanley claimed that he could bribe Belcher and [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] Glenvil Hall to obtain licenses. After canvassing some commercial and political confidantes, Price contacted the police. Press speculation intensified.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''37–39&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August, Stanley asked Gibson to write letters of introduction for his wife, who was about to leave for the US, to some of Gibson's trade union colleagues there. Gibson complied and Stanley used the letters to attempt to obtain from [[HM Treasury]] foreign currency above the usual allowance. Stanley's approach alerted officials to the possibility that he was about to flee the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''178&lt;/ref&gt; 27 August was also the day when Gibson sent a cheque for GBP500 to Stanley as deposit on a share offer in Gray's Carpets Ltd. Gibson heard nothing more from Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''172&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley was arrested on 18 October and held in [[Brixton Prison]]. Spartan though his surroundings were, he was able to order meals from a restaurant and pay another detainee for domestic duties.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''39–40&lt;/ref&gt; He was bailed on 21 October and returned to his Park Lane flat where his movements were restricted under the [[Aliens Order 1946]].&lt;ref&gt;SR&amp;O No.395. of 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tribunal==
{{main|Lynskey tribunal}}
A tribunal was convened. Stanley, dapper in appearance, proved a self-important, self-aggrandising witness who amused the tribunal with his idiosyncratic, colourful, yet ambiguous and contradictory, responses to the questioning.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt; The tribunal found that Belcher and Gibson had acted improperly and they were fortunate to escape prosecution, gladly accepting the proffered alternative of resignation. [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] Sir [[Hartley Shawcross]] expressed the opinion that Stanley could not be prosecuted as the notoriety he gained from the tribunal would inhibit a [[fair trial]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''232&lt;/ref&gt; The spying allegations were not raised in the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''362&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the tribunal==
On 23 December, Stanley applied for cancellation of his deportation order but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.'' 225&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Gibson and Belcher were resigning in disgrace, Stanley and his wife were enjoying their notoriety and celebrity, attending the [[Chelsea Arts Ball]] at New Year.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.'' 226&lt;/ref&gt;

In a debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 3 February 1949, Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] expressed the government view that Stanley should be deported as the deportation would be "conducive to the public good". Attlee was probably principally motivated by the spying allegations and Stanley's Zionist connections.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.'' 362&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the deportation order, the British government found that it could not deport Stanley, because no country was willing to receive him. He had lost citizenship in his home country of Poland, which was unwilling to take him in. Due to the changes in Poland's borders since [[World War II]], the Polish government required all Polish citizens to re-register home and abroad. Stanley had not done so, and in addition, the Polish Foreign Ministry announced that he would not be allowed to return. As a result, Stanley was rendered a [[statelessness|stateless person]], and could not be deported unless his country of origin or some other country was willing to receive him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19490217&amp;id=BwIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-SMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3967,3950397 Britain Has Its Hands Full in Ousting of Stateless Man], February 17, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1949, Stanley applied for [[Israel]]i nationality. On 13 February, his application was rejected on the grounds that he was an undesirable. The Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' attacked Stanley as a Jew who "suddenly discovered his love for [[Zion]]" when in difficulties and there was speculation that Stanley had done his case no good when he criticised the conduct of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] during his tribunal testimony. Stanley continued to entertain and enjoy his celebrity, despite continued calls for his deportation, while he was again pursued by the bankruptcy courts.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp'' 242–244&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley threatened to sue Israel for denying him entry, and empowered his lawyers in Israel to take action in court to get him an immigration visa. His lawyers in Israel argued that under the new state's proposed constitution, no Jew could be barred from immigrating to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19490212&amp;id=14Y0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RtwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6162,3671203 Jew Threatens to Sue to Get Into Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley was still required daily to report to police but reported for the last time on 1 April and an [[arrest warrant]] was issued. Stanley, it appears, drove to [[Ramsgate]], where a personal friend took him by sea to a port near [[Boulogne]] in France, possibly [[Dunkirk]]. He was taken from there by car to [[Abbeville]]. On 13 April, Israel announced that it would accept Stanley's application for an immigration visa and admit him to the country on the eve of [[Passover]] as "an act of grace and mercy". After about a month in France, Stanley travelled to [[Marseilles]], where he boarded the Israeli ship ''Atzmaut''. On 9 May, he arrived in [[Haifa]] aboard the ''Atzmaut'' together with about 2,000 other immigrants to Israel. He then held a press conference announcing that his name was now '''Shlomo Ben-Chaim'''. He made various claims regarding his disappearance, including that he had been kidnapped and held in France for a month, that he had escaped from Britain disguised as an admiral, and then as a military officer who became a passenger on a British destroyer. His lawyer, Max Seligman, said he was a "psychological case".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19490513&amp;id=RB0QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IZMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1590,1891857 Stanley Outstays His Welcome in Tel Aviv]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime later in 1949, Stanley returned to France with some thoughts of re-establishing himself in business, but moved back to Israel in 1950, where he spent the remainder of his life in obscurity, save for the wild allegations and stories that he continued to press on the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp'' 244–250&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley died in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19690526&amp;id=VZZAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6215,4192005 Death of Sidney Stanley recalls 1949 scandal]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albania Soviet Union Locator.png|thumb|right|250px|A map depicting the locations of Albania and the Soviet Union.]]
The '''Soviet–Albanian split''' refers to the worsening of relations between the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], which occurred in the 1955&amp;ndash;1961 period as a result of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s rapprochement with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] along with his "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]" and subsequent [[de-Stalinization]], including efforts to extend these policies into Albania as was occurring in other [[Eastern Bloc]] states at the time. The Albanian leadership under [[Enver Hoxha]] perceived Khrushchev's policies as contrary to [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] doctrine and his denunciation of [[Joseph Stalin]] as an opportunistic act meant to legitimize [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] within the [[International communism|international communist movement]]. Occurring within the context of the larger [[Sino-Soviet split|split between China and the USSR]], the Soviet–Albanian split culminated in the rupturing of [[Soviet-Albanian relations|relations]] in 1961.

==Origins==
The Communist Party of Albania (known as the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] after 1948) was founded in November 1941 in the context of the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–1943)|foreign occupation]] of the country, with the majority of its members including its leader, [[Enver Hoxha]], having no connection to the [[Comintern]].{{sfn|Held|1992|p=29}} Historian [[Jon Halliday]] has commented that "it was set up without any known direct contact with Moscow. It was not at all a 'Moscow creation'&amp;nbsp;... the bulk of the founding leadership were middle-class intellectuals on whom the strongest influences were ''Western'' intellectual traditions."{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=22}} Albania furthermore was the only country in Eastern Europe, except Greece, which had liberated itself without the presence of the [[Red Army]] on its soil.{{sfn|Held|1992|p=33}} A combination of these factors led Stalin to initially have been "both curious and suspicious about the only leader of a Communist regime in the Soviet bloc who escaped from any historical ties or contact with the Soviet Union." This, Halliday continues, "was true not just of Hoxha as an individual, but of almost the entire leading group in Albania."{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=6}} Despite this, however, Hoxha was "the quintessential Stalinist. Many of the descriptions Nikita Khrushchev used to denounce Josef Stalin&amp;nbsp;... could easily be applied to Enver Hoxha."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=195}}

Following Albania's liberation on November 29, 1944 the country's economic and foreign policies were dominated by its neighbor [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]], and Albania became in the words of historian Miranda Vickers a "sub-[[Satellite state|satellite]]."{{sfn|Vickers|1999|p=173}} During this period ties with the Soviet Union remained limited, though formal diplomatic relations were established in December 1945.{{sfnm |1a1=Pano |1y=1968 |1p=86 |2a1=Omari| 2a2=Pollo |2y=1988 |2p=82}}

===Soviet–Yugoslav split===
Within the leadership of the Communist Party of Albania tensions arose between pro- and anti-Yugoslav factions and personalities, with the former increasingly coming under attack by [[Koçi Xoxe]], the head of the pro-Yugoslav faction.{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=93&amp;ndash;100}} Hoxha was threatened on the basis of his opposition to the pro-Yugoslav line, as Xoxe's final goal was to overthrow Hoxha and to incorporate Albania into Yugoslavia as its Seventh Republic.{{sfn|Vickers|1999|p=173}} The [[Soviet–Yugoslav split]] in 1948, however, had allowed Albania to break from Yugoslav dominance, and it became the first state to side with the Information Bureau (better known in the West as the [[Cominform]]) with its resolution attacking the Yugoslav leadership for allegedly pursuing a road of nationalist deviation and capitalist restoration.{{sfn|Pano|1968|pp=83&amp;ndash;86}} From that point onwards relations between Albania and the Soviet Union "remained quite close until March 5, 1953," when Stalin died.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=38}} In the words of historian Nicholas C. Pano, "by the beginning of 1949, Albania had progressed from the status of a sub-satellite to that of a full-fledged satellite of the Soviet Union."{{sfn|Pano|1968|p=89}} Albania became a member of [[Comecon]] in 1949 and the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Treaty]] upon its founding in 1955.{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=153&amp;ndash;154}} In addition the Soviets built a submarine base at [[Vlora]] in 1952.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|pp=37-38}}

===Stalin's death===
In his memoirs Hoxha recounts the apprehension he and others had about the post-Stalin leadership, just days after Stalin's death. "The way in which the death of Stalin was announced and his funeral ceremony was organized created the impression&amp;nbsp;... that many members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] had been awaiting his death impatiently."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=13&amp;ndash;14}} A meeting with Soviet leaders held in June that year further raised his suspicions about the intentions of the new leadership, as did a reduction in Soviet and [[Eastern Bloc]] aid to Albania early in 1954 as Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] "seemed to believe that the high cost of aid to support Albania was not worth the return in terms of Soviet strategic interests in the country."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|pp=38&amp;ndash;39}} Reacting to early post-Stalin Soviet pressure on the East European countries to pursue economic and political reforms, Albania announced slight changes in planning priorities and some willingness to improve state relations with Yugoslavia as the Soviets were doing.{{sfn|Pano|1968|pp=113&amp;ndash;114}} There was also a reshuffling of political portfolios in line with the Soviet re-emphasis on the principle of [[collective leadership]].{{sfn|Pano|1968|pp=113&amp;ndash;114}}

Hoxha regarded Soviet pressure as acting in the service of ulterior, [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]] aims in an effort to unseat or otherwise undermine "Stalinist" leaders. Thus in a meeting with Khrushchev on the issue of collective leadership, he recalled that, "Khrushchev told us that the other sister parties had been told of the Soviet 'experience' of who should be first secretary of the party and who prime minister in the countries of people's democracy. 'We talked over these questions with the Polish comrades before the congress of their party,' Khrushchev told us. 'We thrashed matters out thoroughly and thought that Comrade [[Bolesław Bierut|Bierut]] should remain chairman of the Council of Ministers and Comrade [[Edward Ochab|Ochab]] should be appointed first secretary of the party&amp;nbsp;...' Hence, right from the start Khrushchev was for pushing Bierut aside in the leadership of the party&amp;nbsp;... [the Soviets] were giving the green light for all the revisionist elements, who, up till yesterday, were wriggling and keeping a low profile, awaiting the opportune moments. Now these moments were being created by Khrushchev who, with his actions, stands and 'new ideas', was becoming the inspirer and organizer of 'changes' and 'reorganizations'."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=38-39}}

==Beginnings of the split==
Jon Halliday has noted that, "On the surface, relations between Moscow and Tirana seemed good right up to the late 1950s" but that Khrushchev's rapprochement with Yugoslavia in 1955 and his denunciation of Stalin in 1956 were the two main issues responsible for the deterioration of relations between the two states.{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=143}} In June 1954 Khrushchev sent a letter to the leaders of the parties of the Eastern Bloc in which the Cominform resolutions denouncing Yugoslavia in the 1948&amp;ndash;49 period were criticized for allegedly forcing Tito and the rest of the Yugoslav leadership "into the arms of the United States and Great Britain and had led to Yugoslavia's [[Balkan Pact (1953)|conclusion of a military pact]] with two NATO members."{{sfn|Kola|2003|p=113}} Hoxha, however, disagreed with this view, later writing that "even if the Yugoslav leadership had been unjustly condemned in 1949, as Khrushchev was claiming, nothing could permit or justify its falling into the lap of imperialism."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=110&amp;ndash;111}}

In May 1955 Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade with the aim of [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitating]] Tito, a move which encouraged reformist and dissident trends in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=115&amp;ndash;116}} The Albanian government had received a letter two days before the Soviet delegation was to leave Moscow: in it, the Soviets requested that the Albanians approve a statement drawn up by Khrushchev in the name of the Information Bureau even though he had not convened it. The move was refused by the Albanians "on the grounds that there had been no change in the line of the Yugoslav leadership since it had been condemned by the 1948 resolution of communist and workers' parties represented on the Bureau."{{sfn|Ash|1974|p=182}} On May 25 the Central Committee of the Party of Labour sent a letter to its Soviet counterpart stating among other things that, "In our opinion such a hasty (and ill-considered) decision on an issue of great importance and of principle" was conducted "without first making a profound analysis together with all the parties interested in this issue."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=122}} With only Albania among the Eastern Bloc states opposing Khrushchev's move, the Soviets succeeded in unilaterally rehabilitating Tito's standing within the international communist movement and apologized for past Soviet activities in relation to Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Kola|2003|p=114}}

===Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union===
At the [[Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in February 1956 Khrushchev issued, in addition to his main report, his "[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|Secret Speech]]" denouncing Stalin. Hoxha later remarked of the Congress that, in addition to its attack on Stalin, "All the distortions of the major issues of principle, such as those about the character of our epoch, the roads of transition to socialism, peaceful coexistence, war and peace, the stand towards modern revisionism and towards imperialism, etc., etc., which later became the basis of the great, open polemic with modern revisionism, have their official beginning in Khrushchev's report to the 20th Congress&amp;nbsp;... we saw how the Khrushchevites, in order to consolidate their power, operated allegedly with 'a great party spirit', 'free from the fear of Stalin'&amp;nbsp;... Every good thing of the past was distorted, allegedly in light of the 'new situations', 'new developments', 'new roads and possibilities', in order to go ahead."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=185&amp;ndash;186}}

A notable event at the Congress was the promotion of the policy of "peaceful coexistence" by Khrushchev, which officially was a policy to increase East-West collaboration against the threat of nuclear war, but which [[anti-revisionism|anti-revisionists]] believed "was merely a way to divide the world in to spheres of influence inside which each side would enjoy unquestioned supremacy."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=42}} One anti-revisionist author described Khrushchev's policy as follows: "Khrushchev made it clear that he was prepared to give up international class struggle, renouncing on behalf of the colonial peoples any right to liberate themselves from oppression and reassuring capitalist governments by emphasising 'peaceful transition to socialism' or the Parliamentary road&amp;nbsp;..." He then quoted Khrushchev as saying that "'if any mad man wanted war, we [the Soviet Union and the United States], the two strongest countries in the world, would have but to shake our fingers to warn him off.'"{{sfn|Ash|1974|pp=183&amp;ndash;184}}

=== Third Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania===
One of Tito's preconditions for improving relations with the Soviets was for a Soviet-backed removal of "Stalinist" leaders in Eastern Europe, such as [[Mátyás Rákosi]] of Hungary and [[Valko Chervenkov]] of Bulgaria; Hoxha was also an obvious target for removal due to his intransigent position on Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Griffith|1963|p=24}} The Soviets sought without success to force Hoxha to rehabilitate Koçi Xoxe.{{sfnm |1a1=Freedman |1y=1970 |1p=61 |2a1=O'Donnell|2y=1999 |2p=40 |3a1=Vickers|3y=1999 |3p=181}} In April 1956 a party conference was held in Tirana: various delegates, inspired by Khrushchev's actions, attacked the line of the Party of Labour, calling for a review of the case of Xoxe along with other political and economic policies and phenomena.{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=119&amp;ndash;120}}  However, Hoxha entered the conference and managed to defeat these proposals.{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=119&amp;ndash;120}} The Third Congress of the Party of Labour was convened a month later, electing a Central Committee and Politburo "composed of staunch Hoxha loyalists" while also demonstrating "Hoxha's first public defiance of the Soviet Union" by refusing to rehabilitate Xoxe and other persons linked with, or otherwise supportive of, rapprochement with Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Held|1992|p=37}}

Although the Third Party Congress did not openly criticize the 20th Party Congress of the CPSU in part because "the real aims of [the Soviets] were still not fully recognized" and there was a perceived need to keep intact the unity of the international communist movement, it did declare that the line of the Party of Labour which had been "followed up to now has been correct" and thus tacitly rejected Khrushchev's "[[de-Stalinization]]" policies.{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=165}}

Following the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] in November 1956 relations between Albania and the Soviet Union improved somewhat due to Yugoslavia's part in the event, which caused friction in Yugoslav-Soviet relations. On November 7 Hoxha wrote an article for ''[[Pravda]]'' denouncing Tito for encouraging the activity of the rebels, though the Soviets rebuked Hoxha for his harsh tone soon after.{{sfnm |1a1=Logoreci |1y=1977 |1p=122 |2a1=Freedman |2y=1970 |2p=62}} Soviet efforts to improve relations with Yugoslavia resumed before long, prompting a further deterioration in Soviet–Albanian relations.

===1957 plenum===
In a February 1957 speech to a [[Plenary session|plenum]] of the Central Committee of the Party subsequently published in the newspaper ''[[Zëri i Popullit]]'', Hoxha defended Stalin's legacy and attacked the Yugoslavs (but not the Soviet leadership by name.){{sfn|Hoxha|1975|p=691}}  He added that, "In blackening Stalin, the enemies are not concerned about him as a person, but their aim is to discredit the Soviet Union, the socialist system, and the international communist movement, consequently, to undermine the workers' faith in socialism."{{sfn|Hoxha|1975|p=691}}

As a result of the February plenum of 1957, which was seen as directly rebuffing many post-Stalin Soviet views, the Soviet leadership invited Hoxha to visit Moscow in April that year allegedly for consultations. Instead, Khrushchev called on Hoxha to rehabilitate and reinstate party members who had been sacked for their support of Yugoslavia and the theses of the 20th Party Congress; Hoxha refused. In response to this Khrushchev accused Hoxha of sectarianism and of being "hell-bent on pursuing Stalinist policies."{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|p=123}} Hoxha later recalled the meeting as follows: Khrushchev advised the Albanians to improve their relations with Yugoslavia, to which Hoxha replied, "We have always wanted to have good relations with Yugoslavia, but to put it bluntly, we do not trust the Yugoslav leaders, because they speak against the social system in our countries and are opposed to the foundations of Marxism-Leninism. In all their propaganda, they do not say one word against imperialism, on the contrary, [they] have joined the chorus of the Western powers against us." He once more said that the Yugoslav leadership failed to understand "any of its grave mistakes and deviations," to which Khrushchev replied that Yugoslavia did not betray Marxism–Leninism though it had "slipped" from its positions. "According to you," Khrushchev continued, "we ought to return to what Stalin did, which caused all these things we know about." The meeting became increasingly acrimonious and when the subject of rehabilitating disgraced Albanian politicians came up Khrushchev eventually concluded, "You are like Stalin who killed people," to which Hoxha replied, "Stalin killed traitors, and we kill them, too."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=364-365, 374}}

===Trade===
In an effort to persuade the Albanian leadership to reconcile itself with the Soviets, the USSR gave a credit of $160 million [[Soviet ruble|ruble]] loan to Albania in late 1957 for Albania's Third Five-Year Plan and among other things forgave $105 million in past debts Albania owed the Soviet Union. These efforts proved unsuccessful in persuading the Albanians to change their course.{{sfnm |1a1=Logoreci |1y=1977 |1p=123 |2a1=Vickers |2y=1999 |2p=183}} James S. O'Donnell remarked that the Soviets, then in an early stage of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], may have also tried to demonstrate Soviet "generosity" in an effort to counteract the amount of trade Albania was conducting with the [[People's Republic of China]].{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=44}} Albania's passive trade balance with China had grown from 4.2% in 1955 to 21.6% in 1957.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=44}}

===Moscow Conference===
Relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia deteriorated further following Tito's refusal to attend the [[1957 International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties]], the goal of which was to establish the general line and common positions of the international communist movement.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=45}} As Hoxha later wrote, "Khrushchev and Co. made feverish efforts not only to ensure that the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] would take part as a 'party of a socialist country', but if possible also, to ensure that Tito would reach agreement with Khrushchev over the platform&amp;nbsp;...  Each side wanted to exploit the meeting for its own aims: Khrushchev, to declare 'unity', even with painful concessions to satisfy and draw in Tito, while the latter, to urge the others to openly and finally abandon Marxism-Leninism, the struggle against modern revisionism and any principled stand."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=334-335}} The Albanian delegation led by Hoxha worked with the Chinese and other like-minded delegations to the Conference in drafting a declaration alongside the CPSU and the pro-Soviet parties, with the resulting document being described by some Western observers as a compromise; historian William E. Griffith wrote that "the statement leaned strongly toward the Russian position but usually was sufficiently ambiguous so that the Chinese and Albanians could (and did) interpret it in their favor."{{sfn|Griffith|1963|pp=57&amp;ndash;59}} In a notable example, the Albanian and Chinese view that revisionism was the "principal danger in the communist world" existed alongside the Soviet view that the Twentieth Party Congress "opened a new stage in the international communist movement," but despite this the declaration was considered overall by both Albania and China as an ideological victory.{{sfn|Ash|1974|pp=192&amp;ndash;193}} In Hoxha's view, "The whole concern of the Soviet Khrushchevites was 'to preserve unity', to keep the socialist countries and the communist parties of different countries in check&amp;nbsp;... They retreated, held back temporarily, in order to gather strength and take their revisionist revenge in the future."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=344-345}} O'Donnell states that after the Moscow Conference any trouble in Soviet–Albanian relations "was kept strictly private" until June 1960.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=46}}

==The split deepens==
At the end of 1958 Comecon had begun to push for what was later termed an "international socialist division of labor," in which Albania was relegated to "the task of supplying the member states with agricultural and mineral raw materials."{{sfn|Pano|1968|pp=130-131}} In May 1959 Khrushchev paid a visit to Albania with the aim of pressuring Albania's leadership into building up Yugoslav–Albanian and Soviet–Albanian ties and also to, in the words of historian Miranda Vickers, "focus their economy on the growing of citrus fruits rather than concentrate on industrialization and the expansion of their oil industry&amp;nbsp;... Khrushchev's visit was clouded by an atmosphere of mistrust, which culminated in a hurried departure two days earlier than scheduled."{{sfn|Vickers|1999|p=184}} According to Hoxha, Khrushchev displayed contempt for Albanian archaeology in [[Butrint]] and said to [[Rodion Malinovsky]], the Soviet Defense Minister who was visiting the country with him, "Look, how marvelous this is! An ideal base for our submarines could be built here. These old things [reference to archaeological findings] should be dug up and thrown into the sea&amp;nbsp;... We shall have the most ideal and most secure base in the Mediterranean. From here we can paralyze and attack everything."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=385}} He was also said to have remarked to Hoxha to turn his country "into a flourishing garden," suggested he make it an attractive holiday spot for Soviet tourists, and that rather than produce grain, Albania should focus on growing oranges for export.{{sfn|Ash|1974|p=195}} Khrushchev allegedly said, "The Soviet Union has such an abundance of grain that the mice eat more than you can produce here."{{sfn|Ash|1974|p=195}}

By the beginning of 1960 Albania and China had concurred "on such questions as Yugoslav revisionism, global strategy, and de-Stalinization" and the Albanian leadership made "little secret of their sympathies for the Chinese stand."{{sfn|Pano|1968|p=134}} With the Sino-Soviet split also deepening the Soviet leadership began applying its first signs of economic pressure on Albania in March 1960, stating its intention to alter a scholarship agreement for Albanians to study in the USSR in which the Soviets paid 60% of tuition costs and upkeep for the students; this threat was subsequently retracted on the eve of the Bucharest Conference in June that year, possibly in an attempt not to push Albania further into the Chinese orbit.{{sfn|Freedman|1970|p=71}}

Early in June, however, Khrushchev met with Greek politician [[Sophocles Venizelos]] and reacted positively to the latter's suggestion of greater autonomy for [[Greeks in Albania]]; O'Donnell comments that, "The obvious purpose of this discussion was to infuriate Enver Hoxha as Albanian-Greek relations were strained at this time. It became known that Khrushchev had hinted to Venizelos that the Soviet Union would not be against territorial and/or [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] to the Greeks by the Albanians&amp;nbsp;... It is likely that Khrushchev used the meeting with Venizelos as a way to pay back Hoxha for snubbing him during his visit to Albania."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=46}} Griffith comments that, "Hoxha viewed this move by Khrushchev as an implicit threat to partition Albania – the overwhelming traditional fear of all Albanian nationalists."{{sfn|Griffith|1963|p=40}}

===Bucharest Conference===
At the opening of the Bucharest Conference on June 21, 1960, which was held on the occasion of the Third Congress of the [[Romanian Workers' Party]], Hoxha was not among the various heads of [[communist parties]] and [[Communist state|state]]s in attendance; Politburo member [[Hysni Kapo]] took his place.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|pp=46-47}} The stated purpose of the Conference was to have "the character of a preliminary meeting of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties, mainly for the purpose of 'exchanging opinions' and taking a joint decision on the date and place of a future meeting of the communist and workers' parties of the world."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=201}} In his memoirs Hoxha describes the Conference as being a "putsch" and adds, "The revisionist renegades needed another meeting of international communism to gain approval for their old plan for the final legitimization of modern revisionism," he did not attend because "[we] suspected that the problem of the differences which had emerged between China and the Soviet Union would be discussed&amp;nbsp;... we had heard only one side of the argument, the Soviet side, and we were not acquainted with the objections of the Chinese&amp;nbsp;... They had to be thrashed out thoroughly, they had to be studied carefully, and time was required for this. Therefore our Party sent Comrade Hysni Kapo to Bucharest to discuss only the date of the future meeting," for decisions besides this date were not to be taken at the Conference itself.{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=394, 400&amp;ndash;401}}

In the words of Nicholas C. Pano, "Khrushchev attempted to transform the Bucharest Conference into a communist summit meeting for the purpose of securing the condemnation of the Chinese" with Kapo being the only representative of a European party "to refrain from criticizing Peking, to attack Yugoslav revisionism, and to refuse to alter his stand on the Chinese and Yugoslav issues despite Soviet pressure. Khrushchev's hopes of bringing the Albanians to heel by means of peaceful persuasion were certainly shattered by the time the Bucharest Conference had come to an end."{{sfn|Pano|1968|p=136}} During the Conference Hoxha communicated with Kapo via radiogram, stating for instance on June 24, in response to a lengthy document distributed at the Conference by the Soviets attacking the Chinese, "When you make your speech at the meeting you should declare: 'I am not authorized to make statements on these matters because our leadership knows that these matters will be discussed at the forthcoming Meeting of representatives of the parties, as we have all agreed.'&amp;nbsp;... We understand your difficult situation, but don't worry at all, for we are on the right road."{{sfn|Hoxha|1976|pp=15&amp;ndash;16}}

===Hostilities===
After the Conference ended Khrushchev stepped up economic pressure on Albania, delaying a reply concerning 50,000 tons of requested grain to offset an acute food shortage caused by drought, and then issuing significant reductions in the amount of grain shipments.{{sfnm |1a1=Freedman |1y=1970 |1p=61 |2a1=O'Donnell|2y=1999 |2p=72 |3a1=O'Donnell|3y=1999 |3p=47 |4a1=Pano |4y=1968 |4p=137}} According to an Albanian account, the Soviet Union began to "cut systematically all economic aid to Albania. It delayed and in some cases ceased altogether the delivery of goods and industrial equipment to Albania, refused to ship the grain our people were in urgent need of&amp;nbsp;... sell[ing it] not through clearing but in free currency&amp;nbsp;... stopped all supplies for the Albanian People's Army, from food and clothing to weapons and technical equipment whose delivery had been approved by the Joint Command of the Warsaw Treaty. The countries of Eastern Europe, too, set out on the course of aggravating relations with the PRA [People's Republic of Albania] and created a difficult situation by setting up a blockade on Albania jointly with the Soviet government."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=203&amp;ndash;204}}

The Soviets also attempted to threaten the Albanians with force; [[Andrei Grechko]], then Commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Treaty forces, remarked to an Albanian military delegation that they would not get military equipment agreed upon beforehand, saying, "You are only in the Warsaw Pact for the time being, anyway."{{sfn|Ash|1974|p=197}} Attempts were made to inoculate anti-government views in Albanian students studying abroad in the USSR and to convince the armed forces to go against the government.{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|p=127}} According to an Albanian account, the Soviet embassy in Albania also "carried out intensive diversionist activity in order to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and ideological confusion about the correct line of the PLA [Party of Labour of Albania]."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=202}} In July a military plot headed by Soviet-trained Rear Admiral Teme Sejko was uncovered and the plotters executed.{{sfnm |1a1=O'Donnell |1y=1999 |1pp=47-48 |2a1=Pano |2y=1968 |2pp=137-138}}

===Pro-Soviet faction in Albania===
Within the Party itself an effort was also made by pro-Soviet elements to overthrow Hoxha. In June Politburo member Liri Belishova visited China, giving a speech on June 6 which, in the words of Griffith, "could hardly have made her pro-Soviet sympathies clearer," having been full of praise for the Soviet Union, with said praise being omitted when the text was published the day after in the Party newspaper ''Zëri i Popullit''.{{sfn|Griffith|1963|pp=38-39}} While in China Belishova made contact with the Soviet embassy there, telling them what the Chinese had told her without authorization from the Albanian Politburo.{{sfn|Hoxha|1976|pp=92&amp;ndash;93}} Belishova and Koço Tashko, Chairman of the Central Auditing Committee, shared leadership of the pro-Soviet faction.  Foreign journalist Harry Hamm was told by Albanian functionaries that "Belishova and Tashko had never made any secret of their pro-Soviet leanings, and that they had maintained their attitude long after the decision had been made to move closer to [[Beijing|Peking]]'s general line. Their stubborn attitude was bound to lead to their expulsion from the Party and to their being relieved of all their offices."{{sfn|Hamm|1963|p=14}} Tashko, asked to speak on his own behalf, had his text prepared beforehand by the Soviet embassy and, having gotten confused, accidentally read the punctuation mark for a [[full stop]] in Russian amid a burst of laughter from those present.{{sfnm |1a1=O'Donnell |1y=1999 |1p=48 |2a1=Hoxha |2y=1976 |2pp=109-110}} Both Belishova and Tashko were expelled from the Party in September.{{sfn|Pano|1968|p=137}}

=== International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties===
In October 1960 a preparatory Commission for the upcoming International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties scheduled for November that year was held from October 1&amp;ndash;21, with the Albanian delegation being led by Hysni Kapo and [[Ramiz Alia]]. Alia later recalled that "the aim of the Soviets was to ensure that our Party did not come out against their party and Khrushchev, did not bring the fight out in the open, and speak about Bucharest and the contradictions which existed. To this end, they created around our delegation a harsh and dangerous atmosphere, in which open threats were combined with cunning flattery."{{sfn|Alia|1988|p=265}} Hoxha once again communicated via radiogram, writing to Kapo on October 13 that, "We are not of the same opinion as those who are trying to smooth out the problems by means of phrases in resolutions or declarations&amp;nbsp;... ''We are for carrying the matter through to the end.'' If this is not understood, ''it means that the danger which the Khrushchev group represents for the world communist movement is not understood.'' It does not depend on us whether this group should continue in power or not, but ''it is essential that we, should expose this group with Khrushchev at the head, as they deserve''&amp;nbsp;... we shall not allow ourselves to be impressed by those who say: 'How can one attack the glorious Soviet Union or the great Communist Party of Lenin for the faults of a few rascals?' We say: ''Precisely to defend the Soviet Union and the Party of Lenin, these 'rascals' must be exposed, and there must be no toning down of criticism or covering up of the deviationists.''"{{sfn|Hoxha|1976|pp=151&amp;ndash;152}}

On October 22, after the work of the Commission had ended, Khrushchev invited the delegates to a dinner which, according to Alia, was used "to threaten those parties which might oppose the line of the Soviets in November." He gave as an example an exchange between Soviet Politburo member [[Yekaterina Furtseva]] and Kapo, in which the former asked, "Are you Hysni Kapo?! I've heard so much about you&amp;nbsp;..." Kapo replied, "For good or bad?" to which Furtseva stated, "You have attacked the Soviet Union, but you are heading for trouble on that course," getting "the reply she deserved" from Kapo, with Alia further writing that "her mission was just to transmit the signal. Throughout the whole dinner she did not speak to us again."{{sfn|Alia|1988|pp=278-279}}

From November 3&amp;ndash;25 Enver Hoxha headed the Albanian delegation which would present its case at the Second International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties together with Kapo, Alia, and others.{{sfn|Alia|1988|pp=282&amp;ndash;283}}  Alia later noted, "The Soviets' aim was to ensure that Comrade Enver did not speak openly in Moscow, that, at the most, he should restrict himself to general criticisms on a theoretical plane&amp;nbsp;... they brought all-sided pressure to bear on our delegation&amp;nbsp;... even us[ing] the official reception for the celebration of [[October Revolution|November 7]] against our delegation for these purposes."{{sfn|Alia|1988|pp=282&amp;ndash;283}} On November 5 a 125-page letter was sent from the Central Committee of the CPSU to its Chinese counterpart ignoring the existence of Albania as a socialist country and "malign[ing] the Party of Labour of Albania."{{sfnm |1a1=Logoreci |1y=1977 |1p=126 |2a1=Hoxha |2y=1980 |2pp=70}} Later noting this letter in regards to China, Hoxha wrote that, "They distributed this voluminous material against China before the meeting, in order to prepare the terrain and to brainwash the delegations of other parties, and to intimidate the Chinese, to compel them to take a moderate stand, if they would not submit. This anti-Chinese material did not surprise us, but it strengthened the conviction we had in the correctness of the line and the Marxist-Leninist stands of our Party in defence of the Communist Party of China."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=444}}

On November 10, 1960 the second International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was convened.{{sfn|Pano|1968|p=139}} As Hoxha recalled, "In his speech Khrushchev expressed the revisionist views completely and attacked the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, as well as those who were going to follow these parties, but without mentioning any names&amp;nbsp;... wanted to keep all the communist and workers' parties of the world under his conductor's baton, under his dictate."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=446&amp;ndash;447}} On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership, which "showed that no compromise between them was possible."{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|p=126}} During the meeting Hoxha noted that "[The Soviet ambassador to Albania] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal. This question he addressed to our generals at the airport, in the presence of one of your generals. Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, to the Party of Labour and socialism." Khrushchev replied, "If our ambassador said such a thing, he was foolish." Hoxha in turn replied, "He was no fool. He committed this 'foolishness' following the Bucharest Meeting." The subject eventually came to the [[Vlora]] naval base, which was the subject of a Soviet–Albanian dispute to become acute months later. Khrushchev threatened Hoxha, saying, "We can dismantle the base if you like." Hoxha replied, "If you dismantle the base you will be making a big mistake. We have fought empty-bellied and bare-footed, but have never kowtowed to anybody." As the meeting's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared, "You flare up in anger. You spat on me; no one can talk to you." The meeting ended after Kapo declared, "I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this."{{sfn|Hoxha|1980|pp=84&amp;ndash;92}}

Hoxha delivered his speech to the Conference on November 16; he "spoke of the tremendous Soviet pressures to which the Albanian party and government had been subjected after the Bucharest meeting&amp;nbsp;... The only crime his régime had committed, the Albanian leader added, was that it did not agree that the Chinese communist party should be summarily and unjustly condemned. For this it had been treated in a manner that was shabby, anti-Marxist and uncomradely. Hoxha's speech had a shattering effect on the Moscow gathering."{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=127-128}} Amongst other things Hoxha said that, according to Khrushchev, the Party of Labour and Albania itself "should merely applaud and approve, but express no opinion of its own. But this is neither Marxist nor acceptable. Marxism-Leninism has granted us the right to have our say, and no one can take this from us, either by means of political and economic pressure, or by means of threats and names they might call us."{{sfn|Hoxha|1980|pp=126-127}} According to Alia, Khrushchev "tried to appear calm" when first replying, reading his written text "almost mechanically" in regards to China but as soon as he began to reply to Hoxha's speech "he lost his head and began to shout, scream and splutter."{{sfn|Alia|1988|p=289}} Khrushchev was said to have angrily remarked, "Comrade Hoxha, you have poured a bucket of filth over me: you are going to have to wash it off again."{{sfn|Hamm|1963|p=19}} Jon Halliday states that, "On this occasion Hoxha truly succeeded in putting himself and Albania on the world map. His denunciation of Khrushchev made headlines round the world and even his harshest critics usually concede that Hoxha turned in an able performance and showed personal courage."{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=227}} In retirement Khrushchev later recalled the Conference and said that Hoxha "bared his fangs at us even more menacingly than the Chinese themselves. After his speech, comrade [[Dolores Ibarruri]], an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement, got up indignantly and said, very much to the point, that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=47}}

Alia relates that during the Conference a Soviet security officer had said to both him and Kapo that the Soviet leadership might have been contemplating Hoxha's assassination.{{sfn|Alia|1988|pp=284&amp;ndash;285}} For this reason, as Hoxha relates in his memoirs, "The Khrushchevites were capable of anything and we took our own measures&amp;nbsp;... Hysni and Ramiz stayed on in Moscow, as they had to sign the declaration" while Hoxha left the Soviet Union by train and "arrived in Austria, went down by train through Italy and from Bari returned safe and sound to Tirana on our own aircraft and went directly to the reception organized on the occasion of the [[Albanian independence day|28th]] and [[Liberation Day (Albania)|29th of November]]."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|p=455}}

At the Conference itself the Albanian delegation played a leading role together with its Chinese counterpart in giving the draft declaration "Marxist-Leninist content" and that, despite "serious flaws" (in the view of these delegations) "the Declaration eventually signed by the 81 parties was a repudiation of revisionist theses&amp;nbsp;... [and] condemned the Yugoslav form of 'international opportunism which is a concentrated expression of the theories of modern revisionism.'&amp;nbsp;... the Soviet revisionists and the revisionists in other countries and parties demonstrated [in the view of Albania and China] their opportunistic character by completely disregarding the principles set forth in a document they had found it expedient to sign."{{sfn|Ash|1974|pp=201-202}}

On December 19 Hoxha delivered his report to a plenum of the Central Committee of the Party concerning the Moscow Conference, remarking on the mutual defenses Albania and China provided for each other at Bucharest and Moscow and adding, "In the future our Party will strengthen its ties and friendship with the Communist Party of China and the great Chinese people, always upholding the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and the correct line always pursued by the Central Committee of our Party."{{sfn|Hoxha|1976|p=277}}

==Culmination==
At the Fourth Congress of the Party of Labour held in February 1961 Hoxha declared—although still not mentioning the Soviets by name—that, "During the past few years, our Party and other Marxist-Leninist parties have waged a successful struggle against the views of modern revisionists&amp;nbsp;... But in spite of all the crushing blows and defeats it has received, revisionism&amp;nbsp;... remains the main danger to the international communist movement&amp;nbsp;... a resolute and uncompromising struggle must be waged against revisionism until it is utterly destroyed."{{sfn|Hoxha|1980|pp=278&amp;ndash;278}} According to an Albanian account, "Right after the 4th Congress of the PLA, when it became clear that its attempts at imposing its will on Albania were futile, the Soviet leadership cut off all the credits envisaged in the agreements between the two countries."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=213}} The Congress, which was the last one in which Soviet and East European representatives from other parties would attend, "confirmed that the rift with Russia was almost complete and the alliance between China and Albania an accomplished fact."{{sfn|Logoreci|1977|pp=128-129}}

On January 20 that year the Soviets announced that their oil specialists would be withdrawn within a seven- to ten-day period. The Albanians later claimed that the specialists had sabotaged Albania's oil installations before departing.{{sfn|Freedman|1970|pp=76-77}}  Although Khrushchev had symbolically delivered blueprints for the [[Palace of Culture of Tirana]] on the occasion of his 1959 visit, all Soviet construction efforts on it ceased by April 1961. A shipment of materials for the Palace, which arrived in [[Durrës]], was "withdrawn at once on the pretext that the materials 'had been loaded by mistake and were not really intended for Albania.'"{{sfnm |1a1=Ash |1y=1974 |1p=204 |2a1=Hamm |2y=1963 |2pp=34}} On April 23 a Sino–Albanian trade agreement was concluded; Soviet First Deputy Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] sent a letter five days later which effectively signaled an end to Soviet–Albanian trade agreements. Among other things it stated that "It is understandable that the Albanian leadership cannot expect in the future that the USSR will help it as it has in the past, with aid from which only true friends and brothers have a right to benefit."{{sfn|Freedman|1970|pp=77-78}} On August 19 the Soviet ambassador to Albania left Tirana "and was never to return."{{sfnm |1a1=Freedman |1y=1970 |1p=79 |2a1=Ash |2y=1974 |2pp=205}} On August 26, "only five days before the beginning of the fall semester," the Soviets canceled scholarships for Albanian students studying in the USSR; these students given a deadline to leave by October.{{sfnm |1a1=Freedman |1y=1970 |1p=79 |2a1=Ash |2y=1974 |2pp=205}} An Albanian account of the economy during this period states that, "The foreign specialists left unfinished about 40 important objects of the 2nd Five-year Plan in the industrial sector alone. Difficulties increased even more after the cessation of military aid. Thus in the first years of the 3rd Five-year Plan the fulfillment of the plan in many sectors of the economy was made very difficult and to a certain extent the development of the Albanian economy as a whole was impaired."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|p=214}}

Military pressure was stepped up still further; during summer "the training of all Albanian officers, cadets, and noncoms in the Soviet Union or the East European satellite countries was brought to a stop. Since then, there has been not a single Albanian studying at a military academy in the Eastern Bloc. It has been impossible, therefore, for the Tirana Government to keep its army up-to-date on military theory."{{sfn|Hamm|1963|p=28}} In March Albania had not been invited to attend a meeting of the Warsaw Treaty states.{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|p=53}} Hoxha later recalled that "When we returned from Moscow [in November 1960], the provocations at the [Vlora submarine] base were increased and in order to exert pressure on and impress us, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, Firyubin, came to Tirana with two other 'deputies': the first deputy-chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army and Navy, Antonov, and the deputy chief of the Supreme Staff of the Soviet Navy, Sergeyev. They came allegedly 'to reach agreement', but in fact they brought us an ultimatum: The Vlora base must be put completely and solely under Soviet command, which was to be subordinate to the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=466-467}}

An Albanian account describes the dispute as follows: "By violating the formal Albanian-Soviet agreements signed in September 1957 an May 1959, the Soviet government did everything in its power to put under its control this Albanian base which at the same time served the defence of the socialist countries&amp;nbsp;... On April 5, 1961, in a letter addressed to the governments of the Soviet Union and the East-European states it resolutely reaffirmed that it accepted only one solution of the problem: the base of Vlora belonged to Albania and all the naval means that were its property should be handed over to Albanian crew as soon as possible. Any other solution was an act which would lead to the unilateral violation on the part of the Soviet Union of the existing Albanian-Soviet agreements of the years 1957 and 1959."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=282-283}} In May 1961 the Soviets began dismantling the base and tried to seize the submarines, seizing some Albanian ships undergoing repairs at [[Sevastopol]] in the process.{{sfnm |1a1=Pano |1y=1968 |1p=148 |2a1=Logoreci |2y=1977 |2p=129}} As the Albanian account describes it, "The Soviet sailors and officers carried out numerous provocations, trying by all manner of means to create a pretext for the Soviet military intervention in Albania&amp;nbsp;... On May 26, 1961 it seized in a demonstrative manner 8 submarines, the floating base 'Kotelnikov', as well as the Albanian warships that were laid for repair in the port of Sevastopol. On June 5, 1961 the personnel of Soviet advisers left the base at Vlora, too."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=285-286}} Hoxha's account is as follows: Admiral [[Vladimir Kasatonov]] of the Black Sea fleet "came to Tirana with the mission of seizing not only the eight submarines&amp;nbsp;... but even the submarines which we had taken over earlier. We told him bluntly: Either you hand the submarines over to us according to the agreement, or within a short time (we set the date) you must withdraw immediately from the bay&amp;nbsp;... He did not hand over the submarines, but went to Vlora, boarded the command submarine and lined up the others in fighting formation. We gave orders to close the Sazan Narrows and to train the guns on the Soviet ships. Admiral Kasatonov, who had wanted to frighten us, was frightened himself. He was caught like a rat in a trap and if he attempted to implement his plan he might find himself at the bottom of the sea. In these conditions the admiral was obliged to take only the submarines with Soviet crews, and he sailed out of the bay back home with his tail between his legs."{{sfn|Hoxha|1984|pp=467-468}}

At the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Twenty-Second Congress of the CPSU]] in October that year Khrushchev openly attacked the Albanian leadership, proclaiming Hoxha a "leftist nationalist deviationist" and calling for his overthrow, declaring that, "We are certain the time will come when the Albanian communists and the Albanian people will have their say, and then the Albanian leaders will have to answer for the harm they have done their country, their people and the cause of socialist construction in Albania."{{sfn|Freedman|1970|p=79}} He further stated that "The imperialists are always prepared to pay thirty pieces of silver to those who split the Communist ranks." To this Hoxha replied in a November 7 speech, "the Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver'&amp;nbsp;... They would rather die honourably on their feet than live in shame on their knees."{{sfn|O'Donnell|1999|pp=56-57}} Nicholas C. Pano noted that "[Khrushchev's] pronouncements [at the Twenty-Second Congress], at least insofar as the Soviet leadership was concerned, had made the policies of de-Stalinization, peaceful coexistence, and reconciliation with Yugoslavia adopted at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU binding upon the members of the communist system."{{sfn|Pano|1968|pp=150-151}} Despite Albanian calls for the continued existence of state relations between the two countries, the Soviet government formally withdrew its ambassador on November 25 and on December 3 withdrew "the whole personnel of its embassy and commercial representation from the PRA, while at the same time demanding that the personnel of the Albanian embassy and the Albanian commercial adviser should leave the territory of the Soviet Union." "Thus," the Albanian account continues, "the Khrushchev revisionist group, consistent in its line, cut off all relations with socialist Albania at a time when it maintained contacts with and was drawing ever closer to the most reactionary regimes of the world."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=287-288}}

In a December 10 ''Zëri i Popullit'' article, Hoxha wrote that, "The real cause" of the break in diplomatic relations "must be sought in the revisionist views of Khrushchev and in his anti-Marxist efforts to impose them on the other parties by any means&amp;nbsp;... with a view to silencing our Party, to subjugating it and giving a lesson to anyone that would dare to oppose him, Khrushchev extended the ideological disagreements to the field of state relations and began to behave with the PRA as towards an enemy country&amp;nbsp;... he aims to intimidate and subjugate the PLA, to shift it from its revolutionary Marxist-Leninist positions, to shake the confidence of our people in the PLA and its leadership, to upset the feelings of friendship of the Albanian people towards the Soviet Union&amp;nbsp;... But Khrushchev is trying in vain&amp;nbsp;... Under the leadership of the PLA, the Albanian people have scored historic victories in the course of these twenty years: they liberated the country from the fascist invaders and established the people's state power, reconstructed the war-ravaged country, liquidated the centuries-old backwardness and achieved great successes in the construction of socialist society&amp;nbsp;... Our Party is fighting for a great cause, for the truth of Marxism-Leninism&amp;nbsp;... On this course, marching shoulder to shoulder with the sister Marxist-Leninist parties and the fraternal peoples of the socialist countries, as well as with all the revolutionary forces of the world, our Party and people will score complete victory over the imperialist and revisionist enemies. Marxism-Leninism cannot be vanquished! Socialism and communism will triumph!"{{sfn|Hoxha|1980|pp=352-356}}

==Subsequent developments==
In his memoirs Khrushchev described the Albanian leadership as "monsters," saying that, "The rift which developed between the Soviet Union and Albania stemmed mainly from the Albanians' fear of democratisation."{{sfn|Halliday|1986|p=143}} The downfall of Khrushchev in 1964 saw Hoxha write an article for ''Zëri i Popullit'' in which he stated that, "Despite the fact that Khrushchev was the head of modern revisionism, his political liquidation as a person does not mean the liquidation of his political, ideological, economic and organizational course&amp;nbsp;... Khrushchevite revisionism is not dead, his ideology and policy expressed in the line of the 20th and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU are not liquidated."{{sfn|Hoxha|1980|p=663}} In the view of [[William Ash (writer)|William Ash]], writing in support of the Albanian position, "The final proof of the correctness of Albania's characterisation of Soviet revisionism came with the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion and military occupation of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 – 'Khrushchevism without Khrushchev', since Brezhnev who succeeded the deposed revisionist leader followed the same line."{{sfn|Ash|1974|p=207}} An Albanian account discussing the invasion notes that, "Albania resolutely denounced this act, calling it 'an aggression of the fascist type' which 'represented the greatest debasement of the honour and authority of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people on the part of the Khrushchevite revisionist Brezhnev-Kosygin clique'&amp;nbsp;... the Warsaw Treaty had completely been transformed from a means of defence into a means of aggression" and that, having been ''[[de facto]]'' excluded from the Pact since 1961, "on September 13, 1968, at an extraordinary session the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania decided to denounce this Treaty and exonerate Albania from any obligation deriving from it."{{sfn|Omari|Pollo|1988|pp=289-290}} In the 1970s the alliance between Albania and China against perceived Soviet revisionism gradually began to break down, resulting in the [[Sino–Albanian split]].

Writing in 1988, Ramiz Alia reiterated the Albanian view that, "The revisionist current most dangerous to the world communist movement has been and still is Soviet revisionism" and that, "To oppose the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which had great political and theoretical authority, meant to isolate oneself, at least for a time, from most of the communist parties of the world. Precisely here lies the heroism of the Party of Labour of Albania, the majesty of its decision, and its courage and determination for the cause of Marxism-Leninism, for the cause of socialism and communism."{{sfn|Alia|1988|p=236, 238-239}}

In July 1990, after the fall of the Eastern Bloc and political upheaval in Albania itself, Alia announced the restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Vickers|1999|p=215}} In an official communiqué the Soviets "attributed the normalisation [of diplomatic relations] to the better political climate in Europe, and the state radio reported that, as the Soviet Union was on course for reform, 'there has been a marked trend recently towards democratisation of Albanian society'."{{sfn|Kola|2003|p=196}} In June 1991 the ruling Party of Labour became the social-democratic [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist Party]], dropping its prior commitment to Marxism–Leninism, and in December 1991 the Soviet Union was dissolved.

{{Tony Blair sidebar}}
The '''timeline for the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] leadership elections of 2007''' is a timeline of events relating to the final years of [[Tony Blair]]'s tenure as leader of the party and Prime Minister and the leadership elections to find replacements for him and Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]], from his announcement that he would not lead Labour into a fourth General Election, concluding with [[Gordon Brown]] becoming Prime Minister.

==Initial signals that Blair's leadership was to end==
{{see also|2004 in the United Kingdom|2005 in the United Kingdom}}
On 30 September 2004, [[Tony Blair]] said he would not seek a fourth term as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Labour went on to win a third successive term at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|May 2005 General Election]] with a decreased majority of 66, with Blair pledging to serve another full term.

Labour and Blair subsequently had a surge in popularity at the time of [[Timeline of the 2005 London bombings|terrorist bombings of London]] of July 2005, but by the Spring of 2006 were facing significant difficulties, most notably with scandals over failures by the [[Home Office]] to deport illegal immigrants and national campaigns by many political parties and think tanks saying that the United Kingdom was being overrun by immigrants. Worries over the potential increase of support for the [[British National Party]] during the [[UK local elections, 2006|2006 Local Election]] campaign saw many Labour backbenchers and activists begin to demand a timetable from Blair for his departure, with many suggesting that it should be sooner rather than later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2006/election_2006/default.stm | title =Election 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=23 April 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation over the timing of Blair's resignation had been amplified by a variety of politicians and newspapers making their own predictions.  On 6 September 2006, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported that Blair would announce a timetable on 31 May 2007, with his replacement to take office by the end of July,&lt;ref name="The Sun"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2006410396,00.html | title =Blair tells aides he quits May 31 | author =George Pascoe-Watson | date =6 September 2006 | work =[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 21 April [[The Guardian]] reported that the Brown camp were working on the assumption that Blair would announce the candidacy open on 9 May 2007, the day after power-sharing was due to start in [[Northern Ireland]], following which the new Labour leader would be elected on 15 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2062309,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=11| title = Brown shows his hand to stifle challenge from left| date =21 April 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=David | last=Hencke | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talk of [[David Miliband]], [[Alan Milburn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2077454,00.html | title =Blair backs Brown as chancellor launches campaign | author = Deborah Summers and agencies| date =11 May 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Clarke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/04/23/nbrown23.xml
| title = Reid and Clarke may challenge Brown| author=George Jones, Political Editor| date =23 April 2007 | work =[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_2084141.html | title =Reid not ruling out leadership bid | date =20 November 2006 | work =[[The Guardian]] | publisher =ananova.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; as possible candidates was almost constant, although the former consistently denied any ambition to stand and the latter three refused to make a decision until there was a vacancy, ultimately declining in the week before Blair requested the NEC to find a successor.

==Demands for Tony Blair to announce a resignation timetable==
{{see also|2006 in the United Kingdom}}
On 15 July 2006, [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] became the first Labour MP to announce an intention to stand for the leadership when Blair resigned.

On 5 September 2006, 17 Labour [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s signed a letter asking Blair to resign, accompanied by press reports alleging that up to 80 MPs were willing to sign. Later, senior party members stated that [[Tony Blair]] would not be Prime Minister at the next Labour Party conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5318354.stm | title =PM gone within year, allies say | date =6 September 2006 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 6 September, [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]], one of the MPs who signed the letter, resigned as [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Junior Defence Minister]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5321296.stm | title =In full: MPs call for Blair to go | date =6 September 2006 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with seven [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|Parliamentary Private Secretaries]]: [[Khalid Mahmood (politician, born 1961)|Khalid Mahmood]], [[Wayne David]], [[Ian Lucas]], [[Mark Tami]], [[Chris Mole]], [[David Wright (politician)|David Wright]] and [[Iain Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5320760.stm | title =In full: Resignation letters | date =6 September 2006 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September, [[Jack Straw]] stated that he expected the Prime Minister to announce a timetable for his departure in May 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5322094.stm | title =I will quit within a year – Blair | date =7 September 2006 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blair announced that the September 2006 Labour Party Conference and [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] Conference would be the last he would attend as party leader, despite which he was [[Heckler|heckled]] at the [[Trades Union Congress]] on 12 September by members calling for him to resign immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5336884.stm | title =Blair's 'brutal truth' to unions | date =12 September 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September, John Hutton became the first serving Cabinet Minister to say that [[Gordon Brown]] should face a serious challenger for Labour's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5372832.stm | title =Hutton call to 'challenge' Brown | date=23 September 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Labour Party (UK) Conference#2006 Manchester|2006 Labour Party Conference]] on 25 September, Brown announced his candidacy for the leadership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5376760.stm | title =Brown sets out leadership vision |date=25 September 2006| publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; while three days later at the same conference [[John Prescott]] announced that he would stand down when Blair resigned as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5386428.stm | title =Prescott tells Labour: I'm sorry | date = 28 September 2006| publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the debate on [[State Opening of Parliament|The Queen's Speech]] on 15 November, Blair said [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[David Cameron]] was a "[[flyweight]] against a [[heavyweight]]" at the next general election, widely interpreted as implicit support for Brown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061115/debtext/61115-0005.htm | title =House of Commons Hansard ("Debates") 15 Nov 2006 : Column 27 | date =15 November 2006 | work=Hansard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigning commences==
In January 2007, Brown outlined a number of his potential policies for Britain, mentioning citizen responsibility, education, efforts to solve problems in Africa and "a new style of politics" as his priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6238565.stm | title =Brown outlines patriotic vision | date =7 January 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6259131.stm | title =Brown outlines vision for Britain | date =13 January 2007 |publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January, he spoke of "a new world order" while on a tour of India, and announced backing for India's bid for a place as a permanent member on the [[UN Security Council]], and on many other international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6269653.stm | title =Brown backs stronger India role | date =17 January 2007 | work [[BBC News]]= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March, at 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm, he delivered the budget for the 2007–08 financial year, his last budget as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

On 16 January, Blair declared his intention to attend a summit of EU leaders as Prime Minister on 21–22 June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1991702,00.html | title =Of course I will stay till June, says Blair | date =16 January 2007 | agency =[[Press Association]] | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 28 January stated that he was "not finished yet", and intended to complete the public sector reforms he had started, as well as leading Labour into local and devolved Elections on 3 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6307541.stm | title =I am not finished yet, says Blair | date =28 January 2007 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 January, [[left-wing]] MP [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] claimed that support for his leadership challenge had grown to within striking distance of the necessary backing. Michael Meacher, former [[Minister of State|Minister of State for the Environment]] in the [[Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions|DETR]] and its successor [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Defra]] announced that he was also seeking nominations from MPs and was considering standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,1992396,00.html | title =Labour rebel claims growing support for leadership bid | author =Hélène Mulholland | date =17 January 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 February he became the third Labour MP to announce his intention to stand for the leadership, although critics in the media expressed doubt over the extent of backbench support for either challenger at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2019175,00.html | title =Left without direction | date =22 February 2007 | publisher =[[BBC News]] | location=London | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March, [[Jack Straw]] casually declined to run for the leadership after reports that someone had placed a £500 bet on his winning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2318734.ece | title =Brown squeezes public sector pay to prepare for Tory battle | author =Colin Brown | date =2 March 2007 | work =[[The Independent]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March, the Labour Party NEC met to decide on rules for the upcoming leadership elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://www.labour.org.uk/nec_reports| title = Labour NEC Reports | date = 20 March 2007| work = [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] website }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April, Brown met US President [[George W. Bush]] for the first time, in a reportedly amicable discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=aN9kLwDL3F3 | title =Gordon Brown 'Got on Very Well' With Bush in First Meeting  | date =15 April 2007 | publisher =[[Bloomberg L.P.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April he encouraged rivals to "bring it on", in response to numerous reports suggesting that he would face three or four contenders for the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=gang-of-four--&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18910619&amp;siteid=89520-name_page.html | title=Chancellor tells likely rivals to 'feel free' to stand against him | author =Oonagh Blackman | date =16 April 2007 | work =[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Miliband]] declared on 17 April that he would not be a candidate for the Labour leadership or [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy leadership]], and had not wavered in his position on that issue in the past three years. He subsequently announced his support for Brown in any leadership election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6580589.stm | title= Miliband promises to back Brown | date =22 April 2007| publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 April, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that many of Blair's closest allies were eager to unite the Blair and Brown camps and prevent any challenge to Gordon Brown from dividing the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2465958.ece| title =  Blairites: Clarke challenge could split party| date =20 April 2007 | work =[[The Independent]] | location=London | first1=Colin | last1=Brown | first2=Andrew | last2=Grice | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that 217 MPs had already signed up to back Gordon Brown's leadership. There were also reports that even among the undecided, many were keen to prevent the progress of Michael Meacher and John McDonnell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2062309,00.html| title = Brown shows his hand to stifle challenge from left| date =21 April 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=David | last=Hencke | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April, [[Michael Meacher]] and [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] agreed that whichever had fewer supporters the day after Blair resigned as Labour leader would step aside, to allow the other a stronger chance to secure the support of the 45 MPs necessary to qualify for the ballot paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6598683.stm | title=Left rivals unite to target Brown| date=27 April 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May, Blair announced that he would announce his resignation as Labour leader the following week, following which he expected a campaign of about seven weeks. He also announced his support for Brown to succeed him as Labour leader and Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6610623.stm | title =Brown to be PM 'in weeks' – Blair| publisher=[[BBC News]] | date =1 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May, the day after Blair and Brown's tenth anniversary as Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, elections were held for [[UK local elections, 2007|English and Scottish Local Government]], [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|the Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly election, 2007|the Welsh Assembly]]. Labour faced mixed results, making gains in some areas, with slightly higher support than the previous year in the Local Elections and fairly minimal losses in the devolved elections, remaining the largest party in Wales and having one less seat than the SNP in Scotland, while losing many English council seats, mainly to the Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2007/election_2007/default.stm | title = Election 2007 | date =4 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May, [[Charles Clarke]] changed his position towards Brown, praising him publicly and denying that he was poised to challenge for the Labour leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.politics.co.uk/news/features/labour-leadership/clarke-rules-out-leadership-with-praise-brown-$472810.htm  | title = Clarke rules out leadership with praise for Brown | date =3 May 2007 | publisher=Politics.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' the following day, he claimed that he could get a sufficient number of nominations to stand for the Labour leadership, but that the Labour Party did not "have the appetite" for such a contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6627153.stm  | title = Clarke 'will not challenge Brown' | date =4 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Reid and John Hutton also announced their support for Brown, Reid going on to announce that he would be stepping down as Home Secretary upon the departure of Blair and Prescott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=700982007 | archive-url =https://archive.is/20120713205606/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=700982007 | dead-url =yes | archive-date =13 July 2012 | title =Reid gives Brown clear run to No 10 | date =6 May 2007 | work =[[Scotland on Sunday]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6629877.stm  | title = Reid to quit as home secretary | date =6 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the ''[[News of the World]]'' on 6 May, Blair said that while [[David Cameron]] had learned the tactics of opposition, Labour could still win the next General Election and that Brown had shown sound judgement in his steering of the economy, which was the way to win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/blair_0605.shtml  | title = Tony Blair Writes Exclusively for the News of the World | author=Tony Blair | date =6 May 2007 | work =[[News of the World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May, in the last Prime Minister's Questions before Blair announced the vacancy for the Labour leadership, [[David Cameron]] described the Labour government as "like [[Living Dead|The Living Dead]]". Blair ignored Cameron's taunts regarding the possible chaos caused by interim arrangements for election of a new Labour leader and the upcoming resignation of John Reid from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6638569.stm | title =PMQs: The living dead clash | date = 9 May 2007| publisher=[[BBC News]]| first=Nick | last=Assinder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tony Blair asks Labour NEC to seek a new leader==
On 10 May Blair announced to the [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] Labour Party that he would stand down as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007, and that he would be requesting Labour's NEC to seek a new party leader. Shortly afterwards, [[John Prescott]] announced that he would stand down as Deputy Prime Minister on the same day and that he had written to the NEC to announce his resignation as party Deputy Leader. Labour's NEC met on 13 May to finalise a timetable for the handover, confirming that Blair would remain leader until a new leader was elected, and giving any potential candidates three active Parliament days in which to submit their papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6639945.stm | title =Blair will stand down on 27 June | date =10 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6642805.stm | title =Prescott to quit as deputy leader | date =10 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6633989.stm | title =Q&amp;A: Blair's exit plans | date =11 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown, Michael Meacher and John McDonnell held a joint policy debate in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://news.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=738472007 | title =Campaigning Brown offers vision of NHS | date =12 May 2007 | work =[[The Scotsman]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May, [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] and [[Michael Meacher]] delayed a decision over which one should run, describing their respective levels of support as "too close to call".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6642331.stm | title =Brown rivals delay bid decision | date =10 May 2007 | work=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed by ''[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]'', John McDonnell stated that he could and would not support Michael Meacher, since he had voted with [[New Labour]] on many issues, and that it was a matter of them sitting down together to compare how many votes they had and decide a way forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.tni.org/detail_page.phtml?act_id=16809 | title =Challenging Brown from the Left? Meacher and McDonnell interviewed | author = Oscar Reyes | date =11 May 2007 | work =[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]] | publisher = [[Transnational Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May [[Michael Meacher]] declared that he would not be a candidate in the Labour leadership election, since he did not have enough MPs support to get onto the ballot paper, going on to say he would be backing [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] to get a left-wing candidate onto the ballot paper, though the possibility of this was still in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6652651.stm | title =Johnson doubts Brown challenger | date =15 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May, [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Peter Hain]] and [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Harriet Harman]] both announced that they had more than the minimum necessary number of nominations to appear on the Ballot paper for the Deputy Leadership Election, claiming 47 and 44 nominations respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/deputyleader/story/0,,2076881,00.html | title =Hain and Harman claim places on deputy ballot | date =10 May 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=David | last=Hencke | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership elections==
As nominations opened on 15 May it became clear that Brown was well past the minimum requirement of nominations, with the support of around 282 MPs, while John McDonnell had only 27 nominations, still well short of the 45 required. In the Deputy Leadership Race, Harriet Harman, Hazel Blears, Peter Hain and Alan Johnson all had more than the minimum required nominations, with [[Jon Cruddas]] having 44 nominations and Hilary Benn 34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKL1464496220070515 | title =McDonnell short for leadership race | date =15 May 2007 | agency =[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May John McDonnell alleged that many of Brown's supporters were using wrecking tactics to ensure that the decision did not proceed to a ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourleadership/story/0,,2081121,00.html | title=Brown trying to prevent contest, claims McDonnell | date =16 May 2007 | work =[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Hélène | last=Mulholland | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day Brown secured 308 nominations, to John McDonnell's 29; although nominations were to be open for another day there were insufficient undeclared MPs remaining for anyone except Gordon Brown to be on the ballot, meaning he need only attend [[husting]]s and wait to be declared leader by the NEC. At this stage John McDonnell conceded defeat. In the Deputy Leadership Race, Jon Cruddas and Hilary Benn secured the required nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6660565.stm | title =Brown will enter No 10 unopposed | date =16 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6663653.stm | title =Deputy hopefuls make their case | date =16 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nominations closed on 17 May, with Brown having secured 313 nominations compared to John McDonnell's 29. [[Harriet Harman]] (65 nominations), [[Hazel Blears]] (49 nominations), [[Peter Hain]] (51 nominations), [[Alan Johnson]] (73 nominations), [[Jon Cruddas]] (49 nominations) and [[Hilary Benn]] (47 nominations) all qualified to appear on the Deputy leadership ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6457597.stm | title =Labour leader election timetable | date =9 May 2007 | publisher =[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/nominations_close_-_1230_thursday_17_may | title =Labour leadership, close of nominations | date =17 May 2007 | work =[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] website | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070921050327/http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/nominations_close_-_1230_thursday_17_may | archivedate =21 September 2007 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the husting at the [[University of Warwick]] on 20 May, Brown was heckled regarding the [[Iraq War|2003 War in Iraq]]. He replied by saying that although there had been mistakes, it had been the right thing to do. Candidates for the Deputy Leadership election were asked which factors they considered important to the next General Election. Jon Cruddas named the issue of insecurity at work; Hilary Benn said that more housing was needed; Peter Hain described inequality as "the biggest challenge we face as a government"; Alan Johnson focused on social mobility; Hazel Blears mentioned education and employment opportunities; Harriet Harman said that Labour needed to "win back the trust and the confidence of the British people" and emphasised the importance of policy implementation. Blears, Harman and Benn all focused on the importance of party unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/hustings | title =Leadership Contest hustings | work =[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] website }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6673719.stm | title =Iraq decision was right – Brown | date=20 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Bradford husting on 27 May, [[Jan Wilson]], leader of [[Sheffield City Council]], told Gordon Brown that the shadow of Iraq hung over the party and that Brown had had an easy time on it during the leadership campaign. Brown said he was happy to discuss the decision to remove the Ba'athist regime, but that his priority now was to focus on the next steps, with numbers of UK troops decreasing and UK forces taking an "overwatch role".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6696993.stm | title =Brown warned on 'shadow' of Iraq | date=27 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the BAME ([[Black people|black]], [[British Asian|Asian]] and [[Minority group|minority ethnic]]) husting in [[Leicester]] on 30 May, Deputy Leadership candidates were split on the question of whether there should be all-ethnic minority shortlists; Hazel Blears, Jon Cruddas and Peter Hain all backed the idea, to increase numbers of Black and Asian MPs. Alan Johnson said that shortlists could reflect a need for more ethnic minority MPs, but that he was not sure that all-minority shortlists were the answer, and Hilary Benn said that he was not persuaded of the case for such shortlists either. [[Harriet Harman]] made no comment on the issue, except to say that there needed to be more MPs from ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6706499.stm | title =MP shortlists divide candidates | date=31 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June, ballot papers were sent out to Labour MPs, Labour MEPs, Labour Party members and members of affiliated unions for the position of Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6457597.stm | title = Labour leader election timetable| date =14 May 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Cardiff]] husting on 9 June, Brown described the Conservatives as caught between "what they think they should say" and "what they really believe". He accused them of being obsessed with [[Grammar school]]s, and said that parts of the Conservative Party wanted to scrap the [[National Health Service|NHS]].  He associated himself with decisions taken over the war in Iraq again, saying again that although mistakes had been made it had been the right thing to do. He also pledged that if necessary he would find more money to prevent job losses at [[Remploy]], a provider of jobs for the disabled, and that promises made at the G8 summit to tackle [[poverty in Africa]] would be kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6737257.stm | title =Brown taunts Tories over grammars | date=9 June 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Oxford]] Youth husting (for people under the age of 27) on 10 June, Gordon Brown said that Labour must modernise and reform again to further involve young people in decision making, including the use of online facilities such as MySpace. Hilary Benn was critical of [[Bob Geldof]] and defended the settlement of the recent G8 Summit in Germany, while Hazel Blears focused on anti-social behaviour. Peter Hain accused [[Home Secretary]] John Reid of "fanning up" the previous week's debate over possible introduction of new stop and search powers for police, saying "I don't believe in macho posturing on law and order and terrorism". Harriet Harman said that she felt the law needed changing to ensure that the government was informed if terrorist suspects en route to other countries faced the possibility of torture on arrival, and Jon Cruddas focused heavily on allegations of [[Extraordinary rendition|special rendition]] of terrorist suspects to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].  Alan Johnson stated the need for testing in schools to assess how well schools and individual pupils were doing; Jon Cruddas agreed but said he felt that it had gone too far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6738823.stm | title =Brown says Labour must modernise | date=10 June 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deputy Leadership Ballot closed at 17:00 UTC+1 on 22 June. Brown was declared leader at a special conference on 24 June, while in an election on the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] system, [[Harriet Harman]] won the Deputy Leadership by 50.4% to [[Alan Johnson]]'s 49.6% after preferences were re-distributed, Jon Cruddas coming narrowly third. Harman had been behind until the last round of redistributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6234692.stm | title =Harman wins deputy leader contest | date=24 June 2007 | publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/deputyleader/story/0,,1974851,00.html | title = Deputy leadership contest: the rules explained| author =Hélène Mulholland | date =18 December 2006 | work = [[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to Prime Minister Gordon Brown==
[[Tony Blair]] tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to the Queen on 27 June 2007 and [[Gordon Brown]] was asked by the Queen to form a new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6245682.stm | title =Brown is UK's new prime minister | publisher =BBC News | date=27 June 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Blair with [[John Prescott]], Brown opted to keep his new deputy, [[Harriet Harman]], out of the position of [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].

'''Totalitarianism''' is a political concept of a mode of government which prohibits opposition parties, restricts individual opposition to the state and its claims, and exercises an extremely high degree of control over public and private life. It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of [[authoritarianism]]. [[Political power]] in totalitarian states has often been held by [[Dictatorship|rule by one leader]] which employ all-encompassing [[propaganda]] campaigns broadcast by state-controlled [[mass media]]. Totalitarian regimes and are often marked by [[political repression]], [[personality cultism]], [[Command economy|control over the economy]], [[censorship|restriction of speech]], [[mass surveillance]] and widespread use of [[state terrorism]]. Historian Robert Conquest describes a "totalitarian" state as one recognizing no limits to its authority in any sphere of public or private life and which extends that authority to whatever length feasible.&lt;ref name="reflections2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first developed in the 1920s by both [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] jurist (and later [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] academic) [[Carl Schmitt]] and, concurrently, by the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]]. Italian fascist [[Benito Mussolini]] said "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state". Schmitt used the term ''Totalstaat'' in his influential 1927 work on the legal basis of an all-powerful state, ''[[The Concept of the Political]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Schmitt|date=1927|title=The Concept of the Political (German: Der Begriff des Politischen)|isbn=0-226-73886-8|edition=1996 University of Chicago Press|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the concept was used extensively to [[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism|compare Nazism and Stalinism]].  The Economist has described [[China]]'s recently developed [[Social Credit System|social credit system]] to screen and rank its citizens based on their personal behavior as "totalitarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/12/17/china-invents-the-digital-totalitarian-state |title=China invents the digital totalitarian state |last= |date=17 December 2017 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4|title=China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system — here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish you|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/china-experiments-with-sweeping-social-credit-system/a-42030727|title=China experiments with sweeping Social Credit System |date=4 January 2018 |publisher=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian regimes are different from other [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian ones]]. The latter denotes a state in which the single power holder – an individual "[[dictator]]", a committee or a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] or an otherwise small group of political elite – monopolizes political power. "[The] authoritarian state [...] is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarianism "does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; In contrast, a totalitarian regime attempts to control virtually all aspects of the social life, including the economy, education, art, science, private life and morals of citizens. Some totalitarian governments may promote an elaborate ideology: "The officially proclaimed [[ideology]] penetrates into the deepest reaches of societal structure and the totalitarian government seeks to completely control the thoughts and actions of its citizens".&lt;ref name="regime"/&gt; It also mobilizes the whole population in pursuit of its goals. [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of [...] industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

==Early concepts and use==
The notion of totalitarianism as a "total" political power by the state was formulated in 1923 by [[Giovanni Amendola]], who described [[Italian Fascism]] as a system fundamentally different from conventional [[dictatorship]]s.&lt;ref name="regime"&gt;* {{citation| author =Richard Pipes | author-link =Richard Pipes | publication-date = | year =1995 | title = Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime | place =New York | publisher =Vintage Books, Random House Inc. | isbn =0394502426 | page =243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later assigned a positive meaning in the writings of [[Giovanni Gentile]], Italy’s most prominent philosopher and leading theorist of [[fascism]]. He used the term ''totalitario'' to refer to the structure and goals of the new state, which were to provide the "total representation of the nation and total guidance of national goals".&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G., ''Fascism: Comparison and Definition'' (UW Press, 1980), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He described totalitarianism as a society in which the ideology of the state had influence, if not power, over most of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Giovanni and Benito Mussolini in "La dottrina del fascismo" (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Benito Mussolini]], this system politicizes everything spiritual and human: "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state".&lt;ref name="regime"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Conquest, Robert, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment'' (Oxford University Press, 1990) {{ISBN|0-19-507132-8}}, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first to use the term "totalitarianism" in the English language was the Austrian writer [[Franz Borkenau]] in his 1938 book ''The Communist International'', in which he commented that it united the Soviet and German dictatorships more than it divided them.&lt;ref&gt;Nemoianu, Virgil, "Review of ''End and Beginnings''" pp. 1235–38 from MLN, Volume 97, Issue #5, December 1982, p.1235.&lt;/ref&gt; The label "totalitarian" was twice affixed to the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler regime]] during [[Winston Churchill]]'s speech of October 5, 1938&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston, [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1930-1938-the-wilderness/the-munich-agreement Speech to the House of Commons, October 5, 1938]: "We in this country, as in other Liberal and democratic countries, have a perfect right to exalt the principle of self-determination, but it comes ill out of the mouths of those in totalitarian states who deny even the smallest element of toleration to every section and creed within their bounds."

"Many of those countries, in fear of the rise of the Nazi power, ... loathed the idea of having this arbitrary rule of the totalitarian system thrust upon them, and hoped that a stand would be made."&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in opposition to the [[Munich Agreement]], by which France and Great Britain consented to [[Nazi Germany]]'s annexation of the [[Sudetenland]]. Churchill was then a [[backbencher]] MP representing the [[Epping (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping constituency]]. In a radio address two weeks later, Churchill again employed the term, this time applying the concept to "a Communist or a Nazi tyranny".&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston, [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1930-1938-the-wilderness/the-defence-of-freedom-and-peace Radio Broadcast to the United States and to London, October 16, 1938]&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the historic Spanish [[reactionary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael |date=2004 |title=Fascists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTE7ytbtp_cC |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=331 |isbn=9780521831314 |author-link=Michael_Mann_(sociologist) }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservatism|conservative]] party called the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] declared his intention to "give Spain a true unity, a new spirit, a totalitarian polity" and went on to say: "[[Democracy]] is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state. When the time comes, either [[Cortes Generales|parliament]] submits or we will eliminate it".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Preston. ''The Spanish Civil War: reaction, revolution and revenge''. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York: Norton &amp; Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 pp. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] made frequent use of the word totalitarian and its cognates in multiple essays published in 1940, 1941 and 1942. In his essay ''[[Why I Write]]'', he wrote: "The [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish war]] and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for [[democratic socialism]], as I understand it".&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George, [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300011h.html#part47 "Why I Write"], Gangrel (Summer) 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 1945 lecture series entitled ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World'' (published as a book in 1946), the pro-Soviet British historian [[E. H. Carr]] claimed: "The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable" and that [[Marxism–Leninism]] was by far the most successful type of totalitarianism as proved by Soviet industrial growth and the [[Red Army]]'s role in defeating Germany. Only the "blind and incurable" could ignore the trend towards totalitarianism, said Carr.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution'', New York: Scribner, 1987, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' (1961), [[Karl Popper]] articulated an influential critique of totalitarianism: in both works, he contrasted the "open society" of [[liberal democracy]] with totalitarianism and argued that the latter is grounded in the belief that history moves toward an immutable future in accordance with knowable laws.

In ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]] argued that [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Communism|Communist]] regimes were new forms of government and not merely updated versions of the old [[tyrannies]]. According to Arendt, the source of the mass appeal of totalitarian regimes is their [[ideology]], which provides a comforting, single answer to the mysteries of the past, present and future. For Nazism, all history is the history of [[race struggle]] and for [[Marxism]] all history is the history of [[class struggle]]. Once that premise is accepted, all actions of the state can be justified by [[appeal to nature]] or the [[Historicism|law of history]], justifying their establishment of authoritarian state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Richard Villa (2000), ''The Cambridge Companion to Hannah Arendt''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 2–3. {{ISBN|0-521-64571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Arendt, many scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds and ideological positions have closely examined totalitarianism. Among the most noted commentators on totalitarianism are [[Raymond Aron]], Lawrence Aronsen, Franz Borkenau, [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Robert Conquest]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], Eckhard Jesse, [[Leopold Labedz]], [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Claude Lefort]], [[Juan Linz]], [[Richard Löwenthal]], Karl Popper, [[Richard Pipes]], [[Leonard Schapiro]] and [[Adam Ulam]]. Each one of these describes totalitarianism in slightly different ways, but they all agree that totalitarianism seeks to mobilize entire populations in support of an official state ideology and is intolerant of activities which are not directed towards the goals of the state, entailing repression or state control of [[business]], [[labour union]]s, [[non-profit organizations]], religious organizations and buildings and [[political party|political parties]].

==Cold War anti-totalitarianism&lt;!--'Anti-totalitarianism', 'Antitotalitarianism', 'Anti-totalitarian', and 'Anti-totalitarian' redirect here--&gt;==
The concept became prominent in [[Western world|Western]] [[anti-communist]] political discourse during the [[Cold War]] era as a tool to convert pre-war [[anti-fascism]] into postwar anti-communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Brook|last=Defty|date=2007|title=Britain, America and Anti-Communist Propaganda 1945–1953|publisher=The Information Research Department|others=Chapters 2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Achim Siegel, ''The totalitarian paradigm after the end of Communism: towards a theoretical reassessment'', 1998, p. 200 "Concepts of totalitarianism became most widespread at the height of the Cold War. Since the late 1940s, especially since the Korean War, they were condensed into a far-reaching, even hegemonic, ideology, by which the political elites of the Western world tried to explain and even to justify the Cold War constellation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Guilhot, ''The democracy makers: human rights and international order'', 2005, p. 33 "The opposition between the West and Soviet totalitarianism was often presented as an opposition both moral and epistemological between truth and falsehood. The democratic, social, and economic credentials of the Soviet Union were typically seen as "lies" and as the product of a deliberate and multiform propaganda...In this context, the concept of totalitarianism was itself an asset. As it made possible the conversion of prewar anti-fascism into postwar anti-communism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Caute, ''Politics and the novel during the Cold War'', 2009, pp. 95–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George A Reisch, ''How the Cold War transformed philosophy of science: to the icy slopes of logic'', 2005, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scientists [[Carl Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] were primarily responsible for expanding the usage of the term in university social science and professional research, reformulating it as a paradigm for the [[Soviet Union]] as well as [[fascist]] regimes. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that a totalitarian system has the following six, mutually supportive, defining characteristics:
# Elaborate guiding [[ideology]].
# [[one-party state|Single mass party]], typically led by a [[dictator]].
# [[state terrorism|System of terror]], using such instruments as violence and [[secret police]].
# Monopoly on weapons.
# Monopoly on the [[Mass media|means of communication]].
# Central direction and control of the economy through [[state planning]].

Totalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union had initial origins in the chaos that followed in the wake of [[World War I]] and allowed totalitarian movements to seize control of the government while the sophistication of modern weapons and communications enabled them to effectively establish what Friedrich and Brzezinski called a "totalitarian dictatorship". Some [[Social science|social scientists]] have criticized Friedrich and Brzezinski's '''anti-totalitarian'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; approach, arguing that the Soviet system, both as a political and as a social entity, was in fact better understood in terms of [[interest group]]s, competing elites, or even in [[social class|class]] terms (using the concept of the ''[[nomenklatura]]'' as a vehicle for a [[New class|new ruling class]]).&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 186–89, 233–34&lt;/ref&gt; These critics pointed to evidence of popular support for the regime and widespread dispersion of power, at least in the implementation of policy, among sectoral and regional authorities. For some followers of this [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] approach, this was evidence of the ability of the regime to adapt to include new demands. However, proponents of the totalitarian model claimed that the failure of the system to survive showed not only its inability to adapt, but the mere formality of supposed popular participation.

The German historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], whose work is primarily concerned with Nazi Germany, argues that the "totalitarian typology" as developed by Friedrich and Brzezinski is an excessively inflexible model and failed to consider the "revolutionary dynamic" that Bracher asserts is at the heart of totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold; New York p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Bracher maintains that the essence of totalitarianism is the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society combined with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totalitarian "closed" understanding of politics from the "open" democratic understanding.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25"/&gt; Unlike the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition, Bracher argued that totalitarian regimes did not require a single leader and could function with a [[collective leadership]], which led the American historian [[Walter Laqueur]] to argue that Bracher's definition seemed to fit reality better than the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter'' The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The True Believer]]'', [[Eric Hoffer]] argues that mass movements like [[Stalinism]], [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]] had a common trait in picturing Western democracies and their values as [[decadent]], with people "too soft, too [[Hedonism|pleasure-loving]] and too [[selfish]]" to [[sacrifice]] for a higher cause, which for them implies an inner moral and biological decay. He further claims that those movements offered the prospect of a glorious future to frustrated people, enabling them to find a refuge from the lack of personal accomplishments in their individual existence. The individual is then assimilated into a compact collective body and "fact-proof screens from reality" are established.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2002), {{ISBN|0-06-050591-5}}, pp. 61, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later research==
In the 1990s, [[François Furet]] used the term "[[totalitarian twins]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Furet, borrowing from [[Hannah Arendt]], describes [[Bolshevik]]s and [[Nazism|Nazis]] as totalitarian twins, conflicting yet united." [http://www.thenation.com/doc/19950417/singer Singer, Daniel, ''The Nation'' (April 17, 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; to link [[Stalinism]]&lt;ref&gt;"The totalitarian nature of Stalin's Russia is undeniable." [http://www.thenation.com/doc/19991213/singer/3 Singer, Singer,''The Nation'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;"The government of [[Nazi Germany]] was a fascist, totalitarian state." [http://www.remember.org/guide/Facts.root.nazi.html Grobman, Gary M.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Hobsbawm]] criticized Furet for his temptation to stress a common ground between two systems of different ideological roots.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Hobsbawm (2012), ''Revolutionaries''. Abacus, Ch. 7. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of Soviet history, the totalitarian concept has been disparaged by the [[historical revisionism|revisionist]] school, some of whose more prominent members were [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]], [[Jerry F. Hough]], William McCagg, [[Robert W. Thurston]] and [[J. Arch Getty]].&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227"&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225–27&lt;/ref&gt; Though their individual interpretations differ, the revisionists have argued that the Soviet state under [[Joseph Stalin]] was institutionally weak, that the level of terror was much exaggerated and that—to the extent it occurred—it reflected the weaknesses rather than the strengths of the Soviet state.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227"/&gt; Fitzpatrick argued that the Stalin's purges in the Soviet Union provided an increased social mobility and therefore a chance for a better life.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225, 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Sheila, ''Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1987, [[Walter Laqueur]] said that the revisionists in the field of Soviet history were guilty of confusing popularity with morality and of making highly embarrassing and not very convincing arguments against the concept of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian state.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 228"&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Laqueur argued that the revisionists' arguments with regard to Soviet history were highly similar to the arguments made by [[Ernst Nolte]] regarding German history.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 228"/&gt; Laqueur asserted that concepts such as modernization were inadequate tools for explaining Soviet history while totalitarianism was not.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laqueur's argument has been criticized by modern revisionist historians, such as [[Paul Buhle]], who claim that Laqueur wrongly equates Cold-war revisionism with the German revisionism. The latter reflected a "revanchist, military-minded conservative nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Buhle and Edward Francis Rice-Maximin (1995), ''William Appleman Williams: The Tragedy of Empire''. Psychology Press, p. 192. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Enzo Traverso]] has attacked the creators of the concept of totalitarianism, who invented it to designate the enemies of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Enzo Traverso (2001), ''Le Totalitarisme: Le XXe siècle en débat''. Poche. {{ISBN|978-2020378574}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Domenico Losurdo]], totalitarianism is a polysemic concept with origins in [[Christian theology]], and that applying it to the political sphere requires an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place [[fascist]] regimes and the [[USSR]] in the dock together, serving the [[anti-communism]] of [[Cold War]]-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research. Other scholars, such as [[F. William Engdahl]], [[Sheldon Wolin]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]], have linked totalitarianism to capitalism and liberalism and used concepts, such as [[totalitarian democracy]], [[inverted totalitarianism]] or [[totalitarian capitalism]].

In the 2010s, Vladimir Tismaneanu, Richard Shorten and Aviezer Tucker argued that totalitarian ideologies can take different forms in different political systems, but all of them focus on utopianism, scientism and/or political violence. They think that both Nazism and Soviet Communism emphasised the role of specialisation in modern societies and saw [[polymathy]] as "a thing of the past"; both claimed to have statistical scientific support for their claims, which led to a strict "ethical" control of culture, psychological violence and persecution of entire groups.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten "Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present", Palgrave, 2012; Vladimir Tismaneanu, “The Devil in History: Communism, Fascism, and Some Lessons of the Twentieth Century”, University of California Press, 2012; Aviezer Tucker "The Legacies of Totalitarianism: A Theoretical Framework", Cambridge University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Their arguments have been criticised by other scholars due to their partiality and anachronism. For instance, Juan Francisco Fuentes treats totalitarianism as an “[[invented tradition]]” and the use of notion of “modern [[despotism]]” as a “reverse anachronism”. For Fuentes, “the anachronistic use of totalitarian/totalitarianism involves the will to reshape the past in the image and likeness of the present.”&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco Fuentes, “How Words reshape the Past: The ‘Old, Old Story’ of Totalitarianism”, Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totalitarianism in architecture==
{{main|Totalitarian architecture}}
Non-political aspects of the culture and motifs of totalitarian countries have themselves often been labeled innately "totalitarian". For example, [[Theodore Dalrymple]], a British author, physician and political commentator, has written for ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'' that [[Brutalism|brutalist structures]] are an expression of totalitarianism given that their grand, concrete-based design involves destroying gentler, more-human places such as [[gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian|date=Autumn 2009|author=[[Theodore Dalrymple]]|publisher=''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, author [[George Orwell]] described the [[Ministry of Truth]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as an "enormous, pyramidal structure of white concrete, soaring up terrace after terrace, three hundred metres into the air". [[Columnist]] [[Ben Macintyre]] of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that it was "a prescient description of the sort of totalitarian architecture that would soon dominate the Communist bloc".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article1588757.ece|title=Look on those monuments to megalomania, and despair|date=March 30, 2007|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=[[Ben Macintyre]]|accessdate=January 5, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829160102/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article1588757.ece|archivedate=August 29, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of totalitarianism in architecture is the [[Panopticon]], a type of institutional building designed by English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] in the late eighteenth century. The concept of the design is to allow a watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without their being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. It was invoked by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' as metaphor for "disciplinary" societies and their pervasive inclination to observe and normalise.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
