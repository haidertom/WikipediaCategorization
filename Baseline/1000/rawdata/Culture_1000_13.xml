"'''Holy…!'''" (for example "Holy cow!", "Holy mackerel!" or "Holy smoke!") is an [[wikt:exclamation|exclamation]] of [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]] used mostly in English-speaking countries.

[[Robin (comics)|Robin]] of the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]] is noted for his many [[catchphrase]] '''"Holy…"''' exclamations. The lines in the 1960s TV series were uttered by [[Burt Ward]] who played Robin, who delivered the exclamations in a nasal voice. Many of the camp quips are directly related to the plot; for example, "Holy [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]!" is uttered by Robin upon seeing an aerial balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://holysmokesbatman.com/tracks/holy-graf-zeppelin.html | title=Holy Graf Zeppelin | publisher=Holysmokesbatman.com | accessdate=10 August 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909091548/http://holysmokesbatman.com/tracks/holy-graf-zeppelin.html | archive-date=9 September 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/robins-oddest-holy-exclamations-from-the-batman-tv-series-3896999|title=Robin's 20 Oddest "Holy" Exclamations From the Batman TV Series|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
According to New York [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] expert Scott A. Morofsky, Robin would "inevitably refer to an intense experience with a loud, 'Holy... Batman, what do we do now?'".&lt;ref name="Morofsky2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morofsky|first=Scott A.|title=WellativityTM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pIJkN_au0EC&amp;pg=PA211|date=9 July 2013|publisher=WestBow Press|isbn=978-1-4497-9839-0|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley J. Ricca, comic book scholar at [[Case Western Reserve University]], suggests that: "Robin exists as a media entity inextricably linked with Batman and shares nearly as much ubiquity in American culture".&lt;ref name="DuncanSmith2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Randy|last2=Smith|first2=Matthew J.|title=Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_bRZ_et8BIC&amp;pg=PA612|date=29 January 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39924-4|page=612}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers Robin's famous "Holy..." catchphrases to have been grossly overused in the series, popularizing it in the American vernacular.&lt;ref name="DuncanSmith2013"/&gt; Cartoons such as ''[[The Super Friends]]'' continued to make use of Robin and his catchphrases, "spouting 'Holy' in front of every noun imaginable" and Robin's exclamations still remain closely associated with his character in popular culture.&lt;ref name="DuncanSmith2013"/&gt;

American author [[David Shields]] notes how much in contrast Robin's "Holy..." outbursts, his [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]], his fast riffs" were to the laconic Batman.&lt;ref name="Shields2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shields|first=David|title=Remote: Reflections on Life in the Shadow of Celebrity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCdih1A7l40C&amp;pg=PA95|date=30 October 2003|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-19363-8|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to film critics Deborah Cartmell and Imelda Whelehan, Robin's quip "Holey Rusted Metal!" in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' was an "explicit in-joke".&lt;ref name="CartmellWhelehan2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cartmell|first1=Deborah|last2=Whelehan|first2=Imelda|title=Adaptations: From Text to Screen, Screen to Text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OU5cpcFqMgkC&amp;pg=PA196|date=17 June 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-21959-7|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp humour,&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Misiroglu|first=Gina|title=The Superhero Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0zLRBmMZk0C&amp;pg=PA434|date=1 October 2004|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=978-1-57859-370-5|page=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Robin's exclamations and other circumstances in the Batman series, have led some commentators to speculate on [[Homosexuality in the Batman franchise|homosexual undertones]] in the relationship between Batman and Robin.&lt;ref name="Halfyard2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Halfyard|first=Janet K.|title=Danny Elfman's Batman: A Film Score Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OGOYqpxsyRgC&amp;pg=PA42|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5126-9|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image Entertainment]] paid homage to Robin's quips with the title "Batman: Holy Batmania" in a 2004 2-disc DVD release containing four documentaries discussing the sixties TV series.

{{Main article|Genre fiction}}

'''Action fiction''' is the [[literary genre]] that includes [[Spy fiction|spy novels]], [[Adventure fiction|adventure]] stories, tales of terror and intrigue ("[[cloak and dagger]]"), and [[Mystery fiction|mysteries]].  This kind of story utilizes [[Thriller (genre)|suspense]], the tension that is built up when the reader wishes to know how the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]] between the [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]] is going to be resolved or what the solution to the puzzle of a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|pp=58,116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre fiction==
Action fiction is a form of [[genre fiction]] whose subject matter is characterized by emphasis on exciting [[Action (narrative)|action]] sequences. This does not always mean they exclude character development or story-telling.  Action fiction is related to other forms of [[fiction]], including [[action film]]s, [[action game]]s and analogous media in other formats such as [[manga]] and [[anime]]. It  includes martial arts action, extreme sports action, car chases and vehicles, suspense action, and action [[comedy]], with each focusing in more detail on its own type and flavor of action. It is usually possible to tell from the creative style of an action sequence, the emphasis of an entire work, so that, for example, the style of a combat sequence will indicate whether the entire work can be classified as action adventure, or a martial work. Action is mainly defined by a central focus on any kind of exciting movement.

An '''animal epithet''' is a name used to label a person or group, by association with some perceived quality of an [[animal]]. [[Epithet]]s may be formulated as [[simile]]s, explicitly comparing people with the named animal, or as [[metaphor]]s, directly naming people as animals. Animal epithets may be [[pejorative]], readily giving offence, and they are sometimes used in political campaigns. One English epithet, lamb, is always used positively.

Animal similes and metaphors have been used since classical times, for example by [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], to heighten effects in literature, and to sum up complex concepts concisely.

Surnames that name animals are found in different countries. They may be [[metonym]]ic, naming a person's profession, generally in the [[Middle Ages]]; [[toponym]]ic, naming the place where a person lived; or [[nickname]]s, comparing the person favourably or otherwise with the named animal.

==History==

[[File:Mnesterophonia Louvre CA7124.jpg|thumb|left|[[Odysseus]], slaughtering Penelope's suitors on his return home at the end of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', is compared by [[Homer]] to a lion.&lt;ref name=Campbell2014/&gt; Bell-[[krater]], c. 330 BC]]

In the cultures of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], animal stereotypes grew until by the time of [[Virgil]], animal epithets could be applied to anything from an abstract concept like love or fear, to a whole civilisation. An author could use an animal's name to emphasise a theme or to provide an overview of a complex epic tale. For example, [[Homer]] uses animal similes in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', where the lion symbolises qualities such as bravery. This leads up to the lion [[simile]] at the end of the ''Odyssey'', where in Book 22 [[Odysseus]] kills all Penelope's suitors. In the ''Iliad'', Homer compares the [[Troy|Trojans]] to [[stridulating]] [[grasshopper]]s, which the classicist Gordon Lindsay Campbell believes to imply that they make a lot of noise but are weaker and less determined than they think. In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book 4, Virgil compares the world of [[Dido]], queen of [[Carthage]], with a colony of [[ant]]s. Campbell argues that Dido's people are hardworking, strong, unfailingly loyal, organised, and self-regulating: just the sort of world that the hero Aeneas would like to create. But, Campbell argues, the simile also suggests that Carthage's civilisation is fragile and insignificant, and could readily be destroyed.&lt;ref name=Campbell2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Gordon Lindsay |title=The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_OWkBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147 |year=2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-103516-6 |pages=145–147, and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insults==

Animal epithets may be [[pejorative]], indeed in some cultures highly offensive.&lt;ref name="Herzfeld2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herzfeld |first=Michael|title=Cultural Intimacy: Social Poetics and the Real Life of States, Societies, and Institutions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-lSpCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-29755-0 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithets are sometimes used in political campaigns; in 1890, the trades unionist [[Chummy Fleming]] marched with a group of unemployed people through the streets of Melbourne, displaying a banner with the message "Feed on our flesh and blood you capitalist [[hyena]]s: it is your funeral feast".&lt;ref name="Scates1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scates |first=Bruce |title=A New Australia: Citizenship, Radicalism and the First Republic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkgeEmlRjEgC&amp;pg=PA32 |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57296-5 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the ideological divide, the Cuban government described the revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] as a "communist [[rat]]" in 1958.&lt;ref name="Reid-Henry2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid-Henry |first=Simon |title=Fidel and Che: A Revolutionary Friendship |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aorld6QRmYgC&amp;pg=PT141 |year=2009 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |isbn=978-1-84894-138-0 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epithets are not limited to mammals; for instance, comparing someone to a [[snail]] means they are (extremely) slow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pamatier, Robert Allen |title=Speaking of Animals: A Dictionary of Animal Metaphors |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSr4fO2zYrIC&amp;pg=PA351 |year=1995 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=978-0-313-29490-7 |page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; while calling them a [[slug]] implies they are lazy and loathsome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slug|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/slug|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=12 July 2017|quote=2. A slow, lazy person. "'Even though you're dying to bitchslap your clueless roommate, loser boyfriend or loathsome slug of a boss, play nice.'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frog is pejorative for French people in English, from the use of frogs' legs in French cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Why do the French call the British 'the roast beefs'? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2913151.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=3 April 2003 |accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taboos===
Edmund Leach argued in a classic 1964 paper that animal epithets are insulting when the animal in question is [[taboo]], making its name suitable for use as an obscenity. For example, Leach argues that calling a person "a son of a bitch" or "you swine" means that the "animal name itself is credited with potency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leach |first1=Edmund |editor=Lenneberg, E. H. |title=Anthropological Aspects of Language: Animal Categories and Verbal Abuse |work=New directions in the study of language |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, John Halverson argued that Leach's argument about taboos was "specious", and his "categorisation of animals in terms of 'social distance' and edibility is inconsistent in itself and corresponds neither to reality nor to the scheme of social distance and human sexuality it is claimed to parallel". Halverson disputed the association of animal epithets with potency, noting that calling a timid person a mouse, or a person who does not face reality an ostrich, or a silly person a goose, does not mean that these names are potent, taboo, or sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halverson |first1=John |title=Animal Categories and Terms of Abuse |journal=Man |date=December 1976 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=505–516 |jstor=2800435}} (Subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Jay argues, citing Leach, that the use of animal epithets as insults is partly down to taboos on eating pets or unfamiliar wild animals,&lt;!--this obviously doesn't explain use of farmyard animal names, then!--&gt; and partly down to our stereotypes of animals' habits, such as that pigs "are dirty, fat, and eat filth".  Jay further cites [[Sigmund Freud]]'s view that obscenities that name animals, such as cow, cock, dog, pig, and bitch, gain their power by reducing people to animals.&lt;ref name="Jay1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jay |first=Timothy |title=Why We Curse: A neuro-psycho-social theory of speech |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcJHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196 |year=1999 |publisher=John Benjamins |isbn=978-90-272-9848-5 |pages=196–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Bróna |title=Corpus and Sociolinguistics: Investigating age and gender in female talk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZV4zAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 |year=2010 |publisher=John Benjamins |isbn=978-90-272-8861-5 |pages=170–}}&lt;!--cites and relies on Jay--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphors and similes==

The use of metaphors from zoology, such as referring to politicians as rats or hyenas, is what the linguistic researcher Aida Sakalauskaite calls "zoometaphors"&lt;ref name=Sakalauskaite&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sakalauskaite |first1=Aida |title=Zoometaphors in English, German, and Lithuanian: A Corpus Study |date=2010 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley (PhD Thesis) |url=http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/etd/ucb/text/Sakalauskaite_berkeley_0028E_10322.pdf |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grzegorz A. Kleparski calls "zoosemy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kleparski, G.A. |date=1990 |title=Semantic Change in English: A Study of Evaluative Developments in the Domain of Humans |publisher=Wydawnictwo KUL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiełtyka, R. and G.A. Kleparski. 2005. "The scope of English zoosemy: the case of domesticated animals" [in:] Kleparski. G.A. (ed.). Studia Anglica Resoviensia 3, 76-87.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of [[metaphor]]s from [[zoology]]. In each of three different languages, English, German, and Lithuanian, the most common animal categories are farmyard animals (40% in English), [[Canidae]] (including dog and wolf, 6% in English), and birds (10% in English). Grammatically, metaphor, as in "sly fox", is not the only option: speakers may also use [[simile]], as in "deaf as an ass". In German, 92% of animal epithets are metaphors, 8% similes, whereas in English, 53% are similes, 47% metaphors.&lt;ref name=Sakalauskaite/&gt;

The Hungarian linguists Katalin Balogné Bérces and Zsuzsa Szamosfalvi found in a preliminary survey of Serbian usage that the most commonly used "animal vocatives" were, in order, 1. pig, 2. chick(en), 3. dog/puppy, 4. cow, 5. monkey, 6. hen, 7. rat, 8. turkey, 9. mouse, 10. snake, 11. cat/kitten, 12. fox, 13. lamb, 14. vixen, 15. worm. Of these, using the classification devised by Sabina Halupka-Resetar, and Biljana Radic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halupka-Resetar |first1=Sabina |last2=Radic |first2=Biljana |title=Animal names used in addressing people in Serbian |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2003 |volume=35 |pages=1891–1902 |doi=10.1016/s0378-2166(03)00052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; lamb was always used positively; cow and vixen referred to a person's appearance; pig indicated a person's eating habits; calling someone a fox or a turkey related to their intelligence, or lack of it; and names like cat, snake, worm, monkey, dog, mouse, chicken, lamb and rat were used to indicate a person's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bérces |first1=Katalin Balogné |last2=Szamosfalvi |first2=Zsuzsa |title=Animal Names Used in Addressing People (in English) |url=https://linguistlist.org/issues/20/20-295.html |accessdate=1 July 2016 |date=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surnames==
[[File:The Painter and His Pug by William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|upright|The painter [[William Hogarth]]'s name is a [[metonym]] for a swineherd. Self-portrait with his dog, 1745]]

Some English surnames from the [[Middle Ages]] name animals. These have different origins. Some, like Pigg (1066), Hogg (1079) and Hoggard, Hogarth (1279) are [[metonym]]s for a swineherd,&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 234, 351&lt;/ref&gt; while Oxer (1327) similarly denotes an [[ox]]herd&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 334&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shepherd]] (1279 onwards) means as it sounds a herder of sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 404–405&lt;/ref&gt;

Surnames that mention animals can also be [[toponym]]ic, the names Horscroft, Horsfall, Horsley and Horstead for example all denoting people who came from these villages associated with [[horse]]s. The surname Horseman (1226 onwards) on the other hand is a metonym for a rider, mounted warrior, or horse-dealer, while the surnames Horse and Horsnail could either be nicknames or metonyms for workers with horses and [[farrier|shoers of horses]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Some surnames, like Bird, dating from 1193 onwards, with variants like Byrd and Bride, are most likely [[nickname]]s for a [[bird]]like person, though they may also be metonyms for a birdcatcher; but Birdwood is toponymic, for a person who lived by a wood full of birds.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eagle]] from 1230 is a nickname from the bird,&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Weasel]], Wessel from 1193 and [[Stag]]g from 1198 are certainly nicknames from those animals.&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, pages 423, 480&lt;/ref&gt; It is not always easy to tell whether a nickname was friendly, humorous or negative, but the surname [[Stallion]], with variants Stallan, Stallen and Stallon, (1202 onwards) is certainly pejorative, meaning "a begetter, a man of lascivious life".&lt;ref&gt;Reaney, page 423&lt;/ref&gt;

Surnames behave in similar ways in other languages; for example in [[France]], surnames can be toponymic, metonymic, or may record nicknames ("sobriquets"). [[Poisson (disambiguation)|Poisson]] ([[Fish]]) is a metonym for a fishmonger or fisherman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patronyme Poisson : Nom de famille |url=http://www.genealogie.com/nom-de-famille/POISSON.html |publisher=Genealogie.com |accessdate=27 July 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loiseau (The bird) and Lechat (The cat) are nicknames, Lechat indicating either a flexible man or a hypocrite, Loiseau suggesting a lightly-built birdlike person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patronyme Lechat : Nom de famille |url=http://www.genealogie.com/nom-de-famille/Lechat.html |publisher=Genealogie.com |accessdate=27 July 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patronyme Loiseau : Nom de famille |url=http://www.genealogie.com/nom-de-famille/Loiseau.html |publisher=Genealogie.com |accessdate=27 July 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sweden]], the surname [[Falk (name)|Falk]] ([[Falcon]]) is common;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efternamn, topp 100 (2015) |url=http://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Amnesovergripande-statistik/Namnstatistik/30898/30905/Samtliga-folkbokforda--Efternamn-topplistor/31063/ |publisher=Statistiska centralbyrån (Statistics Sweden) |accessdate=26 July 2016 |language=Swedish |date=22 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729032257/http://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Befolkning/Amnesovergripande-statistik/Namnstatistik/30898/30905/Samtliga-folkbokforda--Efternamn-topplistor/31063/ |archivedate=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is found among Swedish nobility from 1399.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hildebrand, Bengt |title=Falck och Falk, släkter |url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=15008 |work=Svenskt biografiskt lexikon |publisher=Riksarkivet (Swedish national archive) |accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3066">'''Aramaic studies''' is the study of the [[Aramaic language]] and [[Syriac Christianity]]. A specialist in Aramaic studies is known as a '''Aramaicist'''. British, French, and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Syriac/Aramaic language and literature were commonly known by the designation Syriacist (a scholar of [[Syriac studies]], at a time when the Syriac language was little understood outside [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Syriac Christian]] and [[Maronite Christian]] communities. In Germany the field of study is distinguished between ''Aramaistik'' (Aramaic studies) and ''Neuaramaistik'' (Neo-Aramaic (Syriac) studies).

Aramaic studies is the term used at the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Leiden]], and [[University of Detroit Mercy]]. At some other universities, Aramaic studies are mostly incorporated into a more 'general' field of studies, such as [[Eastern Christianity]] at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London]], as [[Eastern Christianity]] at [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Crossroads: Essays on Medieval Christian Legacy - Page 391 Juan Pedro Monferrer Sala - 2007 "Not because this list would be very long, but since Syriac Studies are mostly incorporated into a more general field of studies, e.g. Aramaic studies (as is the case, e.g. at the Universities of Oxford or Leiden), or Eastern Christianity, as in Duke, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; or as [[Semitic studies]] at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. Most students learn the [[Aramaic language]] and [[Syriac language]] within a [[biblical studies]] program.

Aramaic academic journals include the annual ''Aramaic Studies'', a leading journal for Aramaic language and literature published by Brill Academic Publishers. The journal incorporates the previous ''Journal for the Aramaic Bible'' for a more inclusive scope, to include all aspects of Aramaic language and literature, even when not, or only indirectly, related to Biblical texts.

An '''artist's impression''' or '''artist's interpretation''' is the representation of an object or a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available. It could be an image, a sound, a video or a model. Artist's impressions are often created to represent concepts and objects that cannot be seen by the naked eye; that are very big, very small, in the past, in the future, fictional, or otherwise abstract in other ways. For example, in architecture, artists' impressions are used to showcase the design of planned buildings and associated landscape.&lt;ref name="BobMargaret2004"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Bob Giddings | author2=Margaret Horne | title=Artists' Impressions in Architectural Design | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekhXDjNF2bkC&amp;pg=PA1 | accessdate=24 May 2013 | date=9 March 2004 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn=978-0-203-36246-4 | pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists' impressions are particularly prominent in [[space art]].&lt;ref name="NASA's Space Art Program"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newatlas.com/how-are-planets-painted/42763/ |title=Artist's Impression: How to Paint a Planet |last=Powell |first=Dominic |date=2016-04-16 |website=New Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baby boomers''' (also known as '''boomers''') are the [[demography|demographic]] [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] following the [[Silent Generation]] and preceding [[Generation X]]. There are varying timelines defining the start and the end of this cohort; demographers and researchers typically use birth years starting from the early- to mid-1940s and ending anywhere from 1960 to 1964.

The term "baby boomer" is also used in a cultural context, so it is difficult to achieve broad consensus of a precise date definition. Different people, organizations, and scholars have varying opinions on who is a baby boomer, both chronologically and culturally. Some define "baby boomers" as those born between 1946 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018|others=Posard, Marek N., Kavanagh, Jennifer, Edwards, Kathryn, Efron, Sonni|title=What Do Millennials Think About Security Issues?|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2571.html|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Baby boomers are associated with a rejection or redefinition of traditional values. Many commentators, however, have disputed the extent of that rejection, noting the widespread continuity of values with older and younger generations. In [[Europe]] and [[North America]], boomers are widely associated with privilege, as many grew up in a time of widespread government subsidies in post-war housing and education, and increasing affluence.&lt;ref name=Owram1997&gt;{{Citation | last = Owram | first = Doug | year = 1997 | title = Born at the Right Time | isbn = 0-8020-8086-3 | publisher = Univ Of Toronto Press | location = Toronto | page = x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a group, baby boomers were the wealthiest, most active, and most physically fit generation up to the era in which they arrived, and were amongst the first to grow up genuinely expecting the world to improve with time.&lt;ref name="Jones1980"/&gt; They were also the generation that received peak levels of income; they could therefore reap the benefits of abundant levels of food, apparel, retirement programs, and sometimes even "midlife crisis" products. The increased consumerism for this generation has been regularly criticized as excessive.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinker |first=Steven |year=2011 |title=The Better Angels Of Our Nature |location=P.524 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-141-03464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One feature of the boomers was that they have tended to think of themselves as a special generation, very different from those that had come before or that has come afterward. In the 1960s, as the relatively large numbers of young people became teenagers and young adults, they, and those around them, created a very specific [[rhetoric]] around their [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]], and the changes they were bringing about.&lt;ref name=Owram1997a&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rhetoric had an important impact in the self perceptions of the boomers, as well as their tendency to define the world in terms of generations, which was a relatively new phenomenon. The baby boom has been described variously as a "shockwave"&lt;ref name="Owram1997"/&gt; and as "the pig in the python".&lt;ref name=Jones1980&gt;{{Citation| last = Jones | first = Landon| year = 1980| title = Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation| publisher = Coward, McCann and Geoghegan| location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Generation Jones]]" is sometimes used to describe those born roughly between 1954 and 1964. The term is typically used to refer to the later years of the Baby boomer cohort and the early years of [[Generation X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=FNP Interactive - http://www.fnpInteractive.com |url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/archives/display_detail.htm?StoryID=91159 |title=The Frederick News-Post Online – Frederick County Maryland Daily Newspaper |publisher=Fredericknewspost.com |date=December 19, 2008 |accessdate=2010-08-02 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206110817/http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/archives/display_detail.htm?StoryID=91159 |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP080111"&gt;Noveck, Jocelyn (2009-01-11), "In Obama, many see an end to the baby boomer era".[https://web.archive.org/web/20090125183857/http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1372376%2Cw-obama-baby-boomer-era-011109.article].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[File:US Birth Rates.svg|thumb|350px|right|United States birth rate (births per 1,000 population). The segment for the years 1946 to 1964 is highlighted in red, with birth rates peaking in 1949 and dropping steadily around 1958 reaching pre-war depression era levels in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] Bottom of this page https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsus.htm "Vital Statistics of the United States, 2003, Volume&amp;nbsp;I, Natality", Table 1-1 "Live births, birth rates, and fertility rates, by race: United States, 1909–2003."&lt;/ref&gt; The drop in 1970 was due to excluding births to nonresidents of the United States.]]

The term [[baby boom]] refers to a noticeable increase in the birth rate. The post-war population increase was described as a "boom" by various newspaper reporters, including Sylvia F. Porter in a column for the May 4, 1951, edition of the ''[[New York Post]]'', based on the increase in the population of the U.S. of 2,357,000 in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;''Reader's Digest'' August 1951 pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use of "baby boomer" is in a January 1963 ''[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]'' article describing a massive surge of college enrollments approaching as the oldest boomers were coming of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/542159/how-generations-named-baby-boomers-generation-x-millennials|title=How Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millennials Got Their Names|date=May 1, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various authors have delimited the baby boom period differently. [[Landon Jones]], in his book ''Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation'' (1980), defined the span of the baby-boom generation as extending from 1943 through 1960, when annual births increased over 4,000,000. Authors [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]], well known for [[Strauss-Howe generational theory|their generational theory]], define the social generation of Boomers as that cohort born from 1943 to 1960, who were too young to have any personal memory of World War II, but old enough to remember the postwar American High.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Neil |last1=Howe |first2=William |last2=Strauss |title=Generations: The History of Americas Future, 1584 to 2069 |year=1991 |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |pages=299–316 |isbn=0-688-11912-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pew Research Center]] defines baby boomers as being born between 1946 and 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defining generations: Where Millennials end and post-Millennials begin|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/01/defining-generations-where-millennials-end-and-post-millennials-begin|accessdate=May 8, 2018|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the generation can be segmented into two broadly defined cohorts: The Leading-Edge Baby Boomers are individuals born between 1946 and 1955, those who came of age during the Vietnam War era. This group represents slightly more than half of the generation, or roughly 38,002,000 people of all races. The other half of the generation was born between 1956 and 1964. Called Late Boomers, or Trailing-Edge Boomers, this second cohort includes about 37,818,000 individuals, according to ''Live Births by Age and Mother and Race, 1933–98'', published by the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Brent |last=Green |title=Marketing to Leading-Edge Baby Boomers: Perceptions, Principles, Practices, Predictions |year=2006 |publisher=Paramount Market Publishing |location=New York |pages=4–5 |isbn=0976697351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ongoing battle for "generational ownership" has motivated a handful of marketing mavens and cultural commentators to coin and/or promote their own terms for sub‑segments of the baby-boomer generation. These monikers include, but are not limited to, "golden boomers," "generation Jones," "alpha boomers," "[[hippies]]," "[[yippies]]," "[[yuppies]]," "zoomers," and "cuspers."

In [[Ontario]], Canada, one attempt to define the boom came from [[David Foot]], author of ''Boom, Bust and Echo: Profiting from the Demographic Shift in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century'' (1997). He defines a Canadian boomer as someone born from 1947 to 1966, the years that more than 400,000 babies were born. However, he acknowledges that is a demographic definition, and that culturally it may not be as clear-cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060623.dates24/BNStory/BabyBoomers/home |title=By definition: Boom, bust, X and why |work=The Globe and Mail |date=June 24, 2006 |accessdate=2010-08-27 |location=Toronto |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520180757/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060623.dates24/BNStory/BabyBoomers/home |archivedate=May 20, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doug Owram argues that the Canadian boom took place from 1942 to 1960, but that culturally boomers everywhere were born between the late war years and about 1955 or 1956. He notes that those born in the years before the actual boom were often the most influential people among boomers; for example, musicians such as [[The Beatles]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[The Rolling Stones]], as well as writers like [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], who were either slightly or vastly older than the boomer generation. Those born in the 1960s might feel disconnected from the cultural identifiers of the earlier boomers.&lt;ref name=Owram1997b&gt;{{Citation

==Characteristics==

===Size and economic impact===
76 million Americans were born between 1946 and 1964, representing a cohort that is significant in size alone. In 2004, the British baby boomers held 80% of the UK's wealth and bought 80% of all high-end cars, 80% of cruises and 50% of skincare products.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Duncan (Sept 16, 2004) "Live Fast, Die Old", [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3659996.stm BBC News site]. Retrieved 2007-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the size of the group, Steve Gillon has suggested that one thing that sets the baby boomers apart from other generational groups is the fact that "almost from the time they were conceived, Boomers were dissected, analyzed, and pitched to by modern [[Marketing|marketers]], who reinforced a sense of generational distinctiveness."&lt;ref name="Gillon"&gt;Gillon, Steve (2004) ''Boomer Nation: The Largest and Richest Generation Ever, and How It Changed America'', Free Press, "Introduction", {{ISBN|0-7432-2947-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the articles of the late 1940s identifying the increasing number of babies as an economic boom, such as a 1948 ''[[Newsweek]]'' article whose title proclaimed "Babies Mean Business",&lt;ref&gt;"Population: Babies Mean Business", [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9925897/site/newsweek/ ''Newsweek'', August 9, 1948]. Retrieved 2007-01-26. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128095707/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9925897/site/newsweek/ |date=January 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a 1948 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article called "Baby Boom."&lt;ref&gt;"Baby Boom", [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856041,00.html ''Time'', February 9, 1948]. Retrieved 2007-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ken Dychtwald#Age Wave|age wave]] theory suggests an [[economic slowdown]] when the boomers started retiring during 2007–2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/ousivMolt/idUSN3131412220080131 Economy faces bigger bust without Boomers], Reuters, Jan 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Projections for the [[aging U.S.&amp;nbsp;workforce]] suggest that by 2020, 25% of employees will be at least 55 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Chosewood, L.

The Baby Boomers came into being the largest voting demographic in the early 1980s, a period which ushered in a long running trend of rapidly increasing income inequality. From 1979-2007, those receiving the highest 1 percentile of incomes saw their already large incomes increase by 278% while those in the middle at the 40th-60th percentiles saw a 35% increase. Since 1980, after the vast majority of Baby Boomer college goers graduated, the cost of college has been increased by over 600% (inflation adjusted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130710193649/https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/06/29/how-the-baby-boomers-destroyed-americas-future.aspx | title =How the Baby Boomers Destroyed America's Future | last =Planes | first =Alex | date =June 29, 2013 | website =The Motley Fool | publisher =The Motley Fool | access-date =April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey found that nearly a third of baby boomer multimillionaires polled in the [[United States]] would prefer to pass on their [[inheritance]] to [[Charity (practice)|charities]] rather than pass it down to their children. Fifty-seven percent of  these boomers believed it was important for each generation to earn their own money; fifty four percent believed it was more important to invest in their children while they were growing up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/06/half-of-baby-boomers-to-leave-inheritance-to-kids|title=50% of Boomers Leave Estates to Kids|first=ABC|last=News|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural identity===
Boomers grew up at a time of dramatic social change. In the United States, that change marked the generation with a strong cultural cleavage, between the proponents of change and the more conservative individuals. Some analysts believe this cleavage played out politically since the time of the [[Vietnam War]] to the mid‑2000s, to some extent defining the political landscape and division in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200712/obama |title=Goodbye to all of that |publisher=Theatlantic.com |date=November 6, 2007 |accessdate=2010-08-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100103235533/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200712/obama| archivedate=January 3, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/weekinreview/21broder.html | work=The New York Times | title=Shushing the Baby Boomers | first=John M. | last=Broder | date=January 21, 2007 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1980s, the boomers became more conservative, many of them regretting the cultural changes they brought in their youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/12/opinion/la-oe-bowman-baby-boomers-more-conservative-20110912|work=Los Angeles Times|title=As the boomers turn|last=Bowman|first=Karlyn|date=2011-09-12|accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported on the religious affiliations of baby boomers. Citing Wade Clark Roof, a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of California]] at [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], the articles stated that about 42% of baby boomers were dropouts from formal religion, 33% had never strayed from church, and 25% of boomers were returning to religious practice. The boomers returning to religion were "usually less tied to tradition and less dependable as church members than the loyalists. They are also more liberal, which deepens rifts over issues like [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ostling|Ostling, Richard N.]], "The Church Search", April 5, 1993 [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978164,00.html ''Time'' article retrieved 2007-01-27]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early and mid-boomers were coming of age at the same time across the world, so that they experienced events like [[Beatlemania]] and [[Woodstock festival|Woodstock]], organizing against the Vietnam War, or fighting and dying in the same war. Boomers in [[Italy]] were dressing in mod clothes and "buying the world a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]." Boomers in [[India]] were seeking new philosophical discoveries.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some American boomers in Canada had found a new home after escaping [[military conscription|the draft]]. Canadian Boomers were organizing support for [[Pierre Trudeau]]. It is precisely because of these experiences that many believe those born in the second half of the birth boom belong to another generation, as events that defined their [[coming of age]] have little in common with leading or core boomers.{{original research inline|date=May 2013}}
Politically, early Boomers in the United States tend to be [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]s, while later boomers tend to be [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people-press.org/2015/09/03/the-whys-and-hows-of-generations-research/ "The Whys and Hows of Generations Research"]. Pew Center. September 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The baby boomers found that their music, most notably [[rock and roll]], was another expression of their generational identity. [[Transistor radio]]s were personal devices that allowed teenagers to listen to [[The Beatles]], the [[Motown|Motown Sound]], and other new musical directions and artists.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the west, baby boomers comprised the first generation to grow up with the [[television]]; some popular Boomer-era shows included ''[[Howdy Doody]]'', ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', ''[[Captain Video]]'', ''[[The Soupy Sales Show]]'', ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Happy Days]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the 1985 study of U.S.&amp;nbsp;generational cohorts by Schuman and Scott, a broad sample of adults was asked, "What world events over the past 50 years were especially important to them?"&lt;ref&gt;Schuman, H. and Scott, J. (1989), Generations and collective memories, ''American Sociological Review'', vol. 54 (3), 1989, pp. 359–81.&lt;/ref&gt; For the baby boomers the results were:
* Baby Boomer cohort number one (born 1946–55), the cohort who epitomized the cultural change of the sixties
** Memorable events: the [[Cold War]] (and associated [[Red Scare]]), the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]], Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr., political unrest, [[Apollo program|walk on the moon]], risk of the draft into the [[Vietnam War]] or actual military service during the Vietnam War, anti-war protests, social experimentation, [[sexual revolution|sexual freedom]], drug experimentation, the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[environmental movement]], [[Feminism|women's movement]], protests and riots, and [[Woodstock]].
** Key characteristics: experimental, individualism, free spirited, social cause oriented.
* Baby Boomer cohort number two (born 1956–64)
** Memorable events: the [[Cold War]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy]], Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr., for those born in the first couple of years of this generation, the [[Vietnam War]], [[Apollo program|walk on the moon]], [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] and [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s resignation, lowered drinking age to 18 in many states 1970–1976 (followed by raising back to 21 in the mid-1980s as a result of congressional lobbying by [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD)), the [[1973 oil crisis|oil embargo]], raging inflation, gasoline shortages, economic recession and lack of viable career opportunities upon graduation from high school or college, Jimmy Carter's reimposition of registration for the draft, the Iran hostage crisis, [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Live Aid]]

Some debate exists regarding the generational identity of those born from 1961 to 1964, as some demographers and researchers consider these individuals to be part of the younger demographic cohort, [[Generation X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Generation X: Once Xtreme, Now Exhausted|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2014/08/27/generation-x-once-xtreme-now-exhausted-part-5-of-7/#6a73decb5d2a|accessdate=6 August 2016|publisher=Forbes|date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Jon|title=The Generation X Report: Active, Balanced, and Happy|url=http://lsay.org/GenX_Rept_Iss1.pdf|publisher=Longitudinal Study of American Youth – University Of Michigan|accessdate=2013-05-29|page=1|date=Fall 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Geographic Channel's Six-Part Limited Series "Generation X," Narrated by Christian Slater, Premieres Sunday, Feb. 14, at 10/9c|url=http://www.multichannel.com/prfeed/national-geographic-channel-s-six-part-limited-series-generation-x-narrated-christian-slater-premieres-sunday-feb-14-109c/396948|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=Multichannel News|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Generation X Employees Struggle the Most Financially, Most Likely to Dip into Retirement Savings, According to PwC Study|url=http://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-releases/2013/2013-financial-wellness-survey-press-release.html|accessdate=18 June 2016|publisher=PrincewaterhouseCoopers|date=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Healthcare ==
The density of Baby Boomers can put a strain on [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. According to the [[American Medical Student Association]], the population of individuals over the age of 65 will increase by 73 percent between 2010 and 2030, meaning one in five Americans will be a senior citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carrington.edu/blog/medical/baby-boomers-will-affect-health-care-industry-u-s/|title=How baby boomers will affect the health care industry in the U.S. {{!}} Carrington.edu|website=carrington.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging and end-of-life issues==
{{See also|Aging in the American workforce}}

{{As of|1998}}, it was reported that, as a generation, boomers had tended to avoid discussions and long-term planning for their demise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://milwaukee.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/1998/12/21/focus3.html Baby boomers lag in preparing funerals, estates, etc. The ''Business Journal of Milwaukee'' – December 18, 1998 by Robert Mullins]. Retrieved 2007-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, beginning at least as early as that year, there has been a growing dialogue on how to manage aging and end-of-life issues as the generation ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvard.edu-ref.com/reporter-s-notebook-kicking-and-screaming-baby-boomers-begin-to-talk-about-aging Article in ''The New York Times'', March 30, 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709033425/http://www.harvard.edu-ref.com/reporter-s-notebook-kicking-and-screaming-baby-boomers-begin-to-talk-about-aging |date=July 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a number of commentators have argued that Baby Boomers are in a state of denial regarding their own aging and death and are leaving an undue economic burden on their children for their retirement and care. According to the 2011 Associated Press and LifeGoesStrong.com surveys:
* 60% lost value in investments because of the economic crisis
* 42% are delaying retirement
* 25% claim they will never retire (currently still working)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retirement?

In 2009, the earliest baby boomers (If someone uses Strauss and Howe's range of 1943-1960) reached a common [[retirement age]] in the United States: 66 years.

An indication of the importance put on the impact of the boomer was the selection by ''TIME'' magazine of the Baby Boom Generation as its 1966 "[[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]]." As Claire Raines points out in ''Beyond Generation&amp;nbsp;X'', "never before in history had youth been so idealized as they were at this moment." When [[Generation&amp;nbsp;X]] came along it had much to live up to according to Raines.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;{{cite book|last=Raines|first=Claire|title=Beyond Generation&amp;nbsp;X|year=1997|publisher=Crisp Publications|isbn=978-1560524496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boomers are often associated with the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], the [[civil rights movement]], and the [[second-wave feminism|"second-wave" feminist cause]] of the 1970s. Conversely, many trended in moderate to conservative directions opposite to the counterculture, especially those making professional careers in the military (officer and enlisted), law enforcement, business, blue collar trades, and Republican Party politics. They are also associated with the spending trends and [[narcissism]] of the [[Me generation|"Me" generation]].

People often take it for granted that each succeeding generation will be "better off" than the one before it. When [[Generation X]] came along just after the boomers, they would be the first generation to enjoy a lesser quality of life than the generation preceding it.&lt;ref name="Isabel Sawhill, Ph.D 2007"&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Mobility: Is the American Dream Alive and Well? |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/sawhill/200705.pdf |accessdate=22 March 2013 |author=Isabel Sawhill, Ph.D |author2=John E.

Baby boomers continue to have a significant effect on politics, as the [[United States presidential election, 2016]] came down to two controversial candidates in [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Donald Trump]], both boomers, with a majority of Trump's support coming from the Baby Boomer generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/136928/dont-blame-millennials-scarily-close-election-blame-baby-boomers|title=Don't Blame Millennials for This Scarily Close Election.

Bush]] and [[Donald Trump]].

Within the UK, numerous Baby Boomers have served as major party leaders, including four prime ministers ([[John Major]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Gordon Brown]], and [[Theresa May]]), and five leaders of the opposition ([[Neil Kinnock]], [[Margaret Beckett]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and [[Jeremy Corbyn]]).

[[File:Symonds Yat Rock View.JPG|thumb|200px|The Forest of Dean, the reported home of Beast of Dean]]
The '''Beast of Dean''' is an animal said to live, or to have once lived, in the [[Forest of Dean]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]].&lt;ref name = reed&gt;Reed, Matthew and Naylor, Rhiannon and Lewis, Nick (2014) Feral big cats in rural Gloucestershire - reflecting on the possible presence of exotic animals in the English landscape.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally thought to resemble a [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), but abnormally large in size. At that time of its first sightings, wild boar were extinct in Britain.&lt;ref name = goulding&gt; Goulding, M. 2001.Possible genetic sources of free‐living Wild Boar (Sus scrofa) in southern England. Mammal Review: 31 &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Farmers from the village of [[Parkend, Gloucestershire|Parkend]] undertook an expedition to capture and kill the creature, in 1802 but found nothing. The animal they were hunting was reported to be a boar large enough to fell trees and hedges.

Beginning in the early 1990's a number of [[Phantom cat]]s were sighted in the Forest of Dean. &lt;ref name = newton&gt; Newton, M. 2005. Encyclopedia of Cryptozoology: a Global Guide. McFarland and Company Incorporated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10401">'''Counter-flow''' (also referred as contra-flow) is the movement of [[culture]]s from one place to another brought by mobile subjects (migrants) that can have a positive or negative impact or effect on society. It is no longer from "the west to the rest", but a two-way movement. Counter-flows can be seen through the media such as [[telenovelas]] ([[soap operas]]) and through gangs such as the [[Mara Salvatrucha]] (MS-13) from El Salvador. Daya Kishan Thussu defines contra-flow as:

{{quote|the semantic and imaginative referents for the institutional, cultural and political matrix of a world framed by processes of global cultural power and local negotiation: a world experienced through the [[identity politics]] of nations, individuals and cultures and negotiated through contestations of locality, nationality and global citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, Daya Kishan. "Media on the Move: Global flow and contra-flow". Routledge, 2007, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
Unlike [[transculturation]], counter-flows (or contra-flow) is not the mixing or meshing of two cultures. Rather, contra-flow is about the movement of cultures, like a two-way traffic lane, where individuals are said to live "between cultures".&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, Daya Kishan. "Media on the Move: Global flow and contra-flow". Routledge, 2007, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The term contra-flow originated from the preceding peripheries of global media industries, designated "sub-altern flows".&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, Daya Kishan. "Media on the Move: Global flow and contra-flow". Routledge, 2007, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, contra-flows emerged because of the global mass media reversing the dominant Western, First World direction, in other words it is no longer from "the West to the rest",&lt;ref&gt;Thussu, Daya Kishan. "Media on the Move: Global flow and contra-flow". Routledge, 2007, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be said that counter-flows originated because of colonization and later on because of diaspora.

[[Colonization]] brought a new language and religious beliefs to the Americas. On the one hand, a new way of living was taken in by the indigenous people, but on the other, they retained part of their language that is still used today such as the words "[[maize]]" and "[[Avocado|aguacate]]", among others. Additionally, just like the indigenous people, colonizers acquired something from the colonized; they brought back with them goods from the Americans such as potatoes and corn. Through colonization, we can see counter-flows being born and take action because of the consumption, fluidity, and flexibility of culture in both directions, from the colonizer to the colonized and vice versa.

==Example of contra-flow media==

Contra or counter-flows, through media, have had a positive and negative impact on migrant communities. As mentioned before, counter-flows is the movement of culture, not only one way but a two-way movement. Furthermore, media is a major source of communication and information that reaches hundreds of homes across the country. The term counter-flows is especially applied and seen in the Latino communities located all throughout the United States.

A positive example of contra-flow media are telenovelas or soap operas. Telenovelas have become global because of the leading producers of telenovelas such as [[Televisa]] in Mexico, [[Venevision]] in Venezuela, and [[Globo TV]] in Brazil, reaching hundreds of homes all around the globe. Through these leading networks, migrant communities are able to obtain information and watch entertainment shows from their native land.

''[[Yo Soy Betty La Fea]]'', a telenovela originally from Colombia, has become a success not only in its native country but in more than seventy countries in three different continents.&lt;ref name="emilyhighet.com"&gt;Highet, Emily. "Yo Soy Betty La Fea is Beautiful in the United States." University of New South Wales, http://www.emilyhighet.com/uploads/5/8/4/2/5842260/yo_soy_betty_la_fea_is_beautiful_in_the_united_states.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, for example, the telenovela aired on the [[Telemundo]] network for Latino communities in the United States. After its grand success, other United States networks became interested in creating or remaking the telenovela by naming it ''Ugly Betty'', but for an English-speaking audience. However, the producers of ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' made sure to still maintain the plot and some of the main characteristics from the original ''Yo Betty La Fea'' telenovela to retain the Hispanic fans and audience.&lt;ref&gt;Highet, Emily. "Yo Soy Betty La Fea is Beautiful in the United States." University of New South Wales, http://www.emilyhighet.com/uploads/5/8/4/2/5842260/yo_soy_betty_la_fea_is_beautiful_in_the_united_states.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; By maintaining some of the characteristics, producers hope that the English-speaking Latino communities are able to relate with the main character, Betty, because of the fact that she is a Latino woman living in the United States with an immigrant father.

''Yo Soy Betty La Fea'' is a great example of contra-flow media because of the increasing exportation of telenovelas to the United States and other countries not familiar or culturally similar to Latin America. ''Ugly Betty'' also shows the reverse media imperialism which is "the term focused on the one-way flow of information from the United States to the rest of the world with complete disregard for the importance of counter-flows generated by television exporters in other parts of the world".&lt;ref name="emilyhighet.com"/&gt;

==La Mara Salvatrucha as counter-flows==
La [[Mara Salvatrucha]] is a negative example of counter-flow. This Latin gang originated from Los Angeles California after Salvadoran migrants left their country in the early 1980s due to the civil war. La Mara Salvatrucha (or MS-13) has a reputation of being the world's most dangerous gang. The flow of La Mara Salvatrucha gang members between the United States and El Salvador has created a transnational empire of power and control supported by violence. Members from MS-13 keep in constant contact with members in El Salvador. Among the criminal activities that they operate in both the US an El Salvador are robbery, muggings, extortion, drug trafficking, the distribution of weapons, human trafficking and murder. They are protective with their business empire while keeping in touch through technology. According to Tina Strickland the gang members stay in contact by "using disposable cell phones and the Internet, both of which are readily available at low cost".&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, S., Tina. “Mara Salvatrucha: A Threat to U.S. and Central American Security.” The World’s Most Threatening Terrorist Networks and Criminal Gangs, New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the members do not have technological skills, but there are programs that help them navigate.

===La Mara in the media===
Through technology, the media has exposed society to issues that are occurring around the world. The media does not hesitate to expose violence through the news, Internet and newspaper magazines. The printing industry and images are a navigation chain to reach out to the world, and La Mara has been on top of the negative exposure. La Mara's exposure to the world has created fear among society. The gang’s history has appeared in different airings, from [[Fox News Channel]], and ''[[Gangland (TV series)|Gangland]]'' on the History Channel.  According to Strickland, "Deportations have helped create an 'unending chain' of gang members moving between the U.S. and Central America. ... it's a merry-go-round".&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, S., Tina. "Mara Salvatrucha: A Threat to U.S. and Central American Security". ''The World’s Most Threatening Terrorist Networks and Criminal Gangs''. New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Till this day the Salvadoran gang MS-13 is still considered a transnational group through their back and forth movement.

=== Related to counter-flows (or contra-flow) ===
'''Subaltern flows''': This idea is mentioned by Daya Kishan Thussu in his 2012 article "Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow". He described the subaltern flows as "originators of transnational media flows have a strong regional presence but are also aimed at audiences outside their primary constituency."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Thussu, Daya. "Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow". ''The Globalization Reader'', edited by Frank Lechner and John Boli. Fourth Edition ed., 352-357. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell，2012，p.408&lt;/ref&gt; To better describe "subaltern flows", he mentioned the [[CCTV-9]] as an example. CCTV-9 is an English language network of China Central Television broadcasting since 2011 because the official language used there is English. The potential viewers of CCTV-9 are in two major groups, the foreigner in China and the overseas Chinese. As Daya Kishan Thussu argued in 2012: "the expansion of CCTV-9, reflects the recognition by the Beijing authorities of the importance of the English language as the key to success for global commerce and communication and their strategy to bring Chinese public diplomacy to a global audience."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Dominant flows''': Daya Kishan Thussu explained this idea in his article "Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow" as "the US-led Western media, both online and offline, and in various forms –information, infotainment and entertainment – are global in their reach and influence."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Thussu, Daya. "Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow." In ''The Globalization Reader'', edited by Frank Lechner and John Boli. Fourth Edition ed., 352-357. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell，2012，p.407&lt;/ref&gt; He also provides three examples of "dominant media flows" in his article which is media from the United States that "available across the global"; media from Britain which is a "major presence in global media, particularly in the field of news and current affairs"; and Japanese animation which is "the only non-Western genre".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These are all considered as major dominant media flows that have extended their influence in a global content.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31159">{{About|the sociological term|cities and locations|Capital of Culture (disambiguation){{!}}Capital of Culture}}

In sociology, '''cultural capital''' consists of the social assets of a person (education, intellect, style of speech and dress, etc.) that promote [[social mobility]] in a stratified society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Music studies|last=J.P.E Harper-Scott and Jim Samson|first=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=52–55|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural capital functions as a social-relation within an economy of practices (system of exchange), and comprises all of the material and symbolic goods, without [[Distinction (sociology)|distinction]], that society considers rare and worth seeking.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', 5th Ed., (2009), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; As a social relation within a system of exchange, cultural capital includes the accumulated cultural knowledge that confers [[social status]] and [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref&gt;Harker, 1990:13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0761973419&amp;id=ACA5u-F2PlMC&amp;pg=PA37 ''The Sage Dictionary of Cultural studies'' by Chris Barker]&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Cultural Reproduction and Social Reproduction" (1977), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Jean-Claude Passeron]] presented ''cultural capital'' to conceptually explain the differences among the levels of performance and academic achievement of children within the educational system of France in the 1960s; and further developed the concept in the essay "The Forms of Capital" (1985) and in the book ''The State Nobility: Élite Schools in the Field of Power'' (1996).

==Types of capital==
In the sociological essay, "The Forms of Capital" (1985), Pierre Bourdieu identifies three categories of capital:

# [[capital (economics)|Economic capital]]: command of economic resources (money, assets, property).
# [[Social capital]]: actual and potential resources linked to the possession of a durable network of institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. "The Forms of Capital" (1985), ''Handbook of Theory of Research for the Sociology of Education'' (1986) p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Cultural capital''': A person's education (knowledge and intellectual skills) that provides advantage in achieving a higher social-status in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. "The Forms of Capital" (1985), ''Handbook of Theory of Research for the Sociology of Education'' (1986) pp. 46–58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are three types of cultural capital: (i) Embodied capital; (ii)  Objectified capital; and (iii) Institutionalised capital:

#'''Embodied cultural capital''' comprises the knowledge that is consciously acquired and the passively inherited, by [[socialization]] to culture and tradition. Unlike property, cultural capital is not transmissible, but is acquired over time, as it is impressed upon the person's [[habitus (sociology)|habitus]] (character and way of thinking), which, in turn, becomes more receptive to similar cultural influences. '''Linguistic cultural capital''' is the mastery of language and its relations; the embodied cultural capital, which is a person's means of communication and self-presentation, acquired from the national culture.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, 1990:114.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Objectified cultural capital''' comprises the person's property (e.g. a work of art, scientific instruments, etc.) that can be transmitted for economic profit (buying-and-selling) and for symbolically conveying the possession of cultural capital facilitated by owning such things. Yet, whilst possessing a work of art (objectified cultural-capital) the person can consume the art (understand its cultural meaning) only with the proper conceptual and historical foundations of prior cultural-capital. As such, cultural capital is not transmitted in the sale of the work of art, except by coincidental and independent causation, when the seller explains the artwork's significance to the buyer.
#'''Institutionalized cultural capital''' comprises an institution's formal recognition of a person's cultural capital, usually academic credentials or professional qualifications. The greatest social role of institutionalized cultural-capital is in the labor market (a job), wherein it allows the expression of the person's array of cultural capital as qualitative and quantitative measurements (which are compared against the measures of cultural capital of other people). The institutional recognition facilitates the conversion of cultural capital into economic capital, by serving as a [[heuristic]] (practical solution) with which the seller can describe his or her cultural capital to the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, 1986:47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitus and field==
The cultural capital of a person is linked to his or her [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] (embodied disposition and tendencies) and [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]] (social positions), which are configured as a social-relation structure.&lt;ref&gt;King, 2005:223&lt;/ref&gt; The field is the place of social position that is constituted by the conflicts that occur when social groups endeavour to establish and define what is cultural capital, within a given social space; therefore, depending upon the social field, one type of cultural capital can simultaneously be legitimate and illegitimate. In that way, the legitimization (societal recognition) of a type of cultural capital can be arbitrary and derived from [[symbolic capital]].

The habitus of a person is composed of the [[intellectualism|intellectual]] dispositions inculcated to him or her by family and the familial environment, and are manifested according to the nature of the person.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, 1990, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 2002, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gorder, 1980, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the social formation of a person's habitus is influenced by family,&lt;ref&gt;Harker ''et al.'', 1990, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; by objective changes in [[social class]],&lt;ref&gt;King, 2005, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; and by social interactions with other people in daily life;&lt;ref&gt;Gorder, 1980, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, the habitus of a person also changes when he or she changes social positions within the field.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, 1990, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical research==
The concept of cultural capital has received widespread attention all around the world, from theorists and researchers alike. It is mostly employed in relation to the education system, but on the odd occasion has been used or developed in other discourses. Use of Bourdieu's cultural capital can be broken up into a number of basic categories. First, are those who explore the theory as a possible means of explanation or employ it as the framework for their research. Second, are those who build on or expand Bourdieu's theory. Finally, there are those who attempt to disprove Bourdieu's findings or to discount them in favour of an alternative theory. The majority of these works deal with Bourdieu's theory in relation to education, only a small number apply his theory to other instances of inequality in society.

===Traditional application===
Those researchers and theorists{{Who|date=October 2016}} who explore or employ Bourdieu's theory use it in a similar way as it was articulated by Bourdieu. They usually apply it uncritically,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, and depending on the measurable indicators of cultural capital and the fields within which they measure it, Bourdieu's theory either works to support their argument totally, or in a qualified way.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. These works to help portray the usefulness of Bourdieu's concept in analysing (mainly educational) inequality but they do not add anything to the theory.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

One work which does employ Bourdieu's work in an enlightening way is that of Emirbayer &amp; Williams (2005) who use Bourdieu's notion of fields and capital to examine the power relations in the field of social services, particularly homeless shelters. The authors talk of the two separate fields that operate in the same geographic location (the shelter) and the types of capital that are legitimate and valued in each. Specifically they show how homeless people can possess "staff-sanctioned capital" or "client-sanctioned capital" (2005:92) and show how in the shelter, they are both at the same time, desirable and undesirable, valued and disparaged, depending on which of the two fields they are operating in. Although the authors do not clearly define staff-sanctioned and client-sanctioned capital as cultural capital, and state that usually the resources that form these two capitals are gathered from a person's life as opposed to their family, it can be seen how Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital can be a valuable theory in analyzing inequality in any social setting.

===Expansion===
A number of works expand Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital in a beneficial manner, without deviating from Bourdieu's framework of the different forms of capital. In fact, these authors can be seen to explore unarticulated areas of Bourdieu's theory as opposed to constructing a new theory. For instance, Stanton-Salazar &amp; Dornbusch (1995:121) examine how those people with the desired types of cultural (and linguistic) capital in a school transform this capital into "instrumental relations" or social capital with institutional agents who can transmit valuable resources to the person, furthering their success in the school. They state that this is simply an elaboration of Bourdieu's theory. Similarly, Dumais (2002) introduces the variable of gender to determine the ability of cultural capital to increase educational achievement. The author shows how gender and social class interact to produce different benefits from cultural capital. In fact in Distinction (1984:107), Bourdieu states "sexual properties are as inseparable from class properties as the yellowness of lemons is inseparable from its acidity". He simply did not articulate the differences attributable to gender in his general theory of [[cultural reproduction|reproduction]] in the education system.

On the other hand, two authors have introduced new variables into Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital. Emmison &amp; Frow's (1998) work centers on an exploration of the ability of Information Technology to be considered a form of cultural capital. The authors state that "a familiarity with, and a positive disposition towards the use of bourgeoisie technologies of the information age can be seen as an additional form of cultural capital bestowing [[Digital divide|advantage on those families that possess them]]". Specifically computers are "machines" (Bourdieu, 1986:47) that form a type of objectified cultural capital, and the ability to use them is an embodied type of cultural capital. This work is useful because it shows the ways in which Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital can be expanded and updated to include cultural goods and practices which are progressively more important in determining achievement both in the school and without.

Hage uses Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital to explore multiculturalism and racism in Australia. His discussion around race is distinct from Bourdieu's treatment of migrants and their amount of linguistic capital and habitus. Hage actually conceives of "whiteness" (in Dolby, 2000:49) as being a form of cultural capital. 'White' is not a stable, biologically determined trait, but a "shifting set of social practices" (Dolby, 2000:49). He conceptualizes the nation as a circular field, with the hierarchy moving from the powerful center (composed of 'white' Australians) to the less powerful periphery (composed of the 'others'). The 'others' however are not simply dominated, but are forced to compete with each other for a place closer to the centre. This use of Bourdieu's notion of capital and fields is extremely illuminating to understand how people of non-Anglo ethnicities may try and exchange the cultural capital of their ethnic background with that of 'whiteness' to gain a higher position in the hierarchy. It is especially useful to see it in these terms as it exposes the arbitrary nature of what is "Australian", and how it is determined by those in the dominant position (mainly 'white' Australians). In a path-breaking study, Bauder (2006) uses the notions of habitus and cultural capital to explain the situation of migrants in the labor market and society.

In the article "Against School" (2003), the retired teacher John Taylor Gatto addresses education in modern schooling. The relation of cultural capital can be linked to ''Principles of Secondary Education'' (1918), by Alexander Inglis, which indicates how American schooling is what like Prussian schooling in the 1820s. The objective was to divide children into sections, by distributing them by subject, by age, and by test score. Inglis introduces six basic functions for modern schooling; functions three, four, and five are related to cultural capital, and describe the manner in which schooling enforces the cultural capital of each child, from a young age. Functions three, four, and five are: '''3. Diagnosis and direction''':
School is meant to determine the proper social role of each student, by logging mathematic and anecdotal evidence into cumulative records. '''4. Differentiation''': Once the social role of a student is determined, the children are sorted by role and trained only as merited for his or her social destination. '''5. Selection''': This refers to Darwin's theory of natural selection applied to "the favored races".

The idea is to help American society, by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock. Schools are meant to tag the socially unfit with poor grades, remedial-schooling  placement, and other notable social punishments that their peers will then view and accept them as intellectually inferior, and effectively bar them from the reproductive (sexual, economic, and cultural) sweepstakes of life. That was the purpose of petty humiliation in school: "It was the dirt down the drain." The three functions are directly related to cultural capital, because through schooling children are discriminated by [[social class]] and cognitively placed into the destination that will make them fit to sustain that social role. That is the path leading to their determined social class; and, during the fifth function, they will be socially undesirable to the privileged children, and so kept in a low social stratum.

Paul DiMaggio expands on Bourdieu's view on cultural capital and its influence on education saying: "Following Bourdieu, I measure high school students' cultural capital using self-reports of involvement in art, music, and literature." In his journal article titled Cultural Capital and School Success: The Impact of Status Culture Participation on the Grades of U.S. High School Students in the ''American Sociological Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2094962| title=Cultural Capital and School Success: The Impact of Status Culture Participation on the Grades of U.S. High School Students | journal=American Sociological Review | year=1982 | volume=47 | issue=2| doi = 10.2307/2094962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, Richard A. Peterson and A Simkus (1992) extended the cultural capital theory, exclusively on (secondary) analysis of survey  data on Americans, in 'How musical tastes mark occupational status groups', with the term "cultural omnivores" as a  particular higher status section in the US that has broader cultural engagements and tastes spanning an eclectic range from [[highbrow]] arts to [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Understanding cultural omnivorousness, or the myth of the cultural omnivore | author=Alan Warde|author2=David Wright|author3=Modesto Gayo-Cal|author4=Tony Bennett|author5=Elizabeth Silva|author6= Mike Savage |url=http://sifo.no/files/Alanmfl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was Peterson (1992) who coined the term 'cultural omnivore' to address an anomaly observed in the evidence revealed by his work with Simkus (Peterson and Simkus, 1992) which showed that people of higher social status, contrary to elite-mass models of cultural taste developed by French scholars with French data, were not averse to participation in activities associated with popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Omnivores Versus Snobs?

In the UK, Louise Archer and colleagues (2015) developed the concept of [[science capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer|first=Louise|last2=Dawson|first2=Emily|last3=DeWitt|first3=Jennifer|last4=Seakins|first4=Amy|last5=Wong|first5=Billy|date=2015|title="Science capital": A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts|url=|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|volume=52|pages=922–948|doi=10.1002/tea.21227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of science capital draws from the work of Bourdieu, in particular his studies focusing on the reproduction of social inequalities in society. Science capital is made up of science related cultural capital and [[social capital]] as well as [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]. It encapsulates the various influences that a young person's life experiences can have on their science identity and participation in science-related activities. The empirical work on science capital builds from a growing body of data into students' aspirations and attitudes to science, including [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-centres/departments/education-practice-and-society/aspires/ ASPIRES] and [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/Research-Centres/cppr/Research/currentpro/Enterprising-Science/index.aspx Enterprising Science]. The concept of science capital was developed as a way to understand why these science-related resources, attitudes and aspirations led some children to pursue science, while others did not. The concept provides policy makers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmsctech/162/162.pdf|title=Science communication and engagement Eleventh Report of Session 2016–17|last=House of Commons|first=|publisher=House of Commons Science and Technology Committee|year=2017|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and practitioners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/science-education-tracker-wellcome-feb16.pdf|title=Wellcome Trust: SET Development 2016|last=Wellcome Trust|first=|date=February 2016|website=Wellcome Trust|access-date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a useful framework to help understand what shapes young people's engagement with (and potential resistance to) science.

Bourdieu's theory has been expanded to reflect modern forms of cultural capital, such as internet memes. Studies conducted by Asaf Nissenbaum and Limor Shifman &lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1461444815609313&lt;/ref&gt; on the topic of internet memes; utilised the website [https://www.4chan.org/ 4chan] to analyse how these memes can be seen as forms of cultural capital. Discourse demonstrates the different forums and mediums that memes can be expressed through, such as different 'boards' on 4chan. 

==Criticism==
Criticisms of Bourdieu's concept have been made on many grounds, including a lack of conceptual clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sullivan, A.|year=2002|title=Bourdieu and Education: How Useful is Bourdieu's Theory for Researchers?|journal= Netherlands Journal of Social Sciences|volume=38|issue=2|pp=144–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps due to this lack of clarity, researchers have operationalised the concept in diverse ways, and have varied in their conclusions. While some researchers may be criticised for using measures of cultural capital which focus only on certain aspects of 'highbrow' culture, this is a criticism which could also be leveled at Bourdieu's own work. Several studies have attempted to refine the measurement of cultural capital, in order to examine which aspects of middle-class culture actually have value in the education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sullivan, A.|year=2001|title=Cultural Capital and Educational Attainment|journal=Sociology|volume=35|issue=4|pages=893–912|doi=10.1177/0038038501035004006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=DiMaggio, P.|year=1982|title=Cultural Capital and School Success|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=47|issue=2|pages=189–201|url=https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Stratification%20%28Gender%2C%20Race%2C%20and%20Class%29%20Copies%20of%20Articles%20from%202009/DiMaggio-ASR-1982.pdf|doi=10.2307/2094962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crook, C. J.|year=1997|title=Cultural Practices and Socioeconomic Attainment: The Australian Experience|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=De Graaf, N. D.|author2=De Graaf, P.|author3=Kraaykamp, G.|year=2000|title=Parental Cultural Capital and Educational Attainment in the Netherlands: A Refinement of the Cultural Capital Perspective|journal=Sociology of Education|volume=73|issue=2|pages=92–111|doi=10.2307/2673239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that Bourdieu's theory, and in particular his notion of habitus, is entirely deterministic, leaving no place for individual agency or even individual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=DiMaggio, P.|year=1979|title=Review Essay: On Pierre Bourdieu|type=Review|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=84|issue=6|pages=1460–74|doi=10.1086/226948}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, A.|year=2000|title=Thinking with Bourdieu Against Bourdieu: A 'Practical' Critique of the Habitus|journal= Sociological Theory|volume=18|issue=3|pages=417–433|doi=10.1111/0735-2751.00109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bourdieu claimed to have transcended the dichotomy of structure and agency, this is not necessarily convincing. For example, the Oxford academic John Goldthorpe has long argued that:

{{quote|Bourdieu's view of the transmission of cultural capital as a key process in social reproduction is simply wrong. And the more detailed findings of the research, as noted above, could then have been taken as helping to explain just why it is wrong. That is, because differing class conditions do not give rise to such distinctive and abiding forms of habitus as Bourdieu would suppose; because even within more disadvantaged classes, with little access to high culture, values favouring education may still prevail and perhaps some relevant cultural resources exist; and because, therefore, schools and other educational institutions can function as important agencies of re-socialisation – that is, can not only underwrite but also in various respects complement, compensate for or indeed counter family influences in the creation and transmission of "cultural capital", and not just in the case of Wunderkinder but in fact on a mass scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Bourdieu has also been criticised for his lack of consideration of gender. Kanter (in Robinson &amp; Garnier, 1986) point out the lack of interest in gender inequalities in the labour market in Bourdieu's work. 
However, Bourdieu addressed the topic of gender head-on in his 2001 book ''Masculine Domination''. Bourdieu stated on the first page of the prelude in this book that he considered masculine domination to be a prime example of [[symbolic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bourdieu, Pierre|year=2001|title=Masculine Domination|location=Stanford|publisher=Stanford University Press|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9634">'''Cultural history''' combines the approaches of [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to look at [[popular culture|popular cultural]] traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and [[narrative]] descriptions of past matter, encompassing the continuum of events (occurring in succession and leading from the past to the present and even into the future) pertaining to a [[culture]].

Cultural history records and interprets past events involving human beings through the [[social]], [[cultural]], and [[political]] [[Social environment|milieu]] of or relating to [[the arts]] and manners that a group favors. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) helped found cultural history as a discipline. Cultural history studies and interprets the record of [[human societies]] by denoting the various distinctive ways of living built up by a group of people under consideration. Cultural history involves the aggregate of past cultural activity, such as [[ceremony]], class in practices, and the interaction with locales.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Description==
Cultural history overlaps in its approaches with the French movements of ''[[histoire des mentalités]]'' (Philippe Poirrier, 2004) and the so-called new history, and in the U.S. it is closely associated with the field of [[American studies]]. As originally conceived and practiced by 19th Century Swiss historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] with regard to the [[Italian Renaissance]], cultural history was oriented to the study of a particular historical period in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the economic basis underpinning society, and the social institutions of its daily life as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (6th ed.), p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Echoes of Burkhardt's approach in the 20th century can be seen in [[Johan Huizinga]]'s ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919).&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Sean Farrell |last=Moran |title=Johan Huizinga, ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'', and the Writing of History |journal=Michigan Academician |volume=42 |year=2016 |pages=410–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most often the focus is on phenomena shared by non-elite groups in a society, such as: [[carnival]], [[festival]], and public [[ritual]]s; [[performance]] traditions of [[Narrative|tale]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and other verbal forms; cultural evolutions in human relations (ideas, sciences, arts, techniques); and cultural expressions of social movements such as [[nationalism]]. Also examines main historical concepts as [[power (sociology)|power]], [[ideology]], [[Social class|class]], [[culture]], [[cultural identity]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[perception]] and new historical methods as narration of body. Many studies consider adaptations of traditional culture to [[mass media]] (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, etc.), from [[Printing|print]] to [[film]] and, now, to the [[Internet]] (culture of [[capitalism]]). Its modern approaches come from [[art history]], [[Annales School|Annales]], [[Marxist]] school, [[microhistory]] and new cultural history.

Common theoretical [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]]s for recent cultural history have included: [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s formulation of the [[public sphere]] in ''The Structural Transformation of the Bourgeois Public Sphere''; [[Clifford Geertz]]'s notion of '[[thick description]]' (expounded in, for example, ''The Interpretation of Cultures''); and the idea of [[memory]] as a cultural-historical category, as discussed in [[Paul Connerton]]'s ''How Societies Remember''.

===Historiography and the French Revolution===
The area where new-style cultural history is often pointed to as being almost a [[paradigm]] is the '[[Historical revisionism|revisionist]]' history of the [[French Revolution]], dated somewhere since [[François Furet]]'s massively influential 1978 essay ''Interpreting the French Revolution''. The 'revisionist interpretation' is often characterised as replacing the allegedly dominant, allegedly [[Marxist]], 'social interpretation' which locate the causes of the Revolution in class dynamics. The revisionist approach has tended to put more emphasis on '[[political culture]]'. Reading ideas of political culture through Habermas' conception of the public sphere, historians of the Revolution in the past few decades have looked at the role and position of cultural themes such as [[gender]], [[ritual]], and [[ideology]] in the context of pre-revolutionary French political culture.

Historians who might be grouped under this umbrella are [[Roger Chartier]], [[Robert Darnton]], [[Patrice Higonnet]], [[Lynn Hunt]], Keith Baker, Joan Landes, Mona Ozouf and [[Sarah Maza]]. Of course, these scholars all pursue fairly diverse interests, and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the paradigmatic nature of the new history of the French Revolution. Colin Jones, for example, is no stranger to cultural history, [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], or Marxism, and has persistently argued that the Marxist interpretation is not dead, but can be revivified; after all, Habermas' logic was heavily indebted to a Marxist understanding. Meanwhile, Rebecca Spang has also recently argued that for all its emphasis on difference and newness, the 'revisionist' approach retains the idea of the French Revolution as a watershed in the history of (so-called) [[modernity]], and that the problematic notion of 'modernity' has itself attracted scant attention.

==Cultural studies==
''[[Cultural studies]]'' is an academic discipline popular among a diverse group of scholars.  It combines [[political economy]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[art history]]/[[art criticism|criticism]] to study [[culture|cultural]] phenomena in various societies.  Cultural studies researchers often concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].  The term was coined by [[Richard Hoggart]] in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]]. It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who succeeded Hoggart as Director.

'''Cultural retention''' is the act of retaining the [[culture]] of a specific [[ethnicity|ethnic]] group of people, especially when there is reason to believe that the culture, through inaction, may be lost. Many African-American, European and Asian organizations have cultural retention programs in place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3844">[[Grenada]]'s [[France|French]] colonists brought along their culture, as did the [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] slaves they brought across the [[Atlantic]] for agricultural work. The combination of these cultures is what you will find on this island. [[India]]ns have also influenced the island culture in more recent years.  

With the passing of the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] by the British Parliament and the subsequent Abolishing of Slavery, [[indentured labor from India]] was procured at a very large scale. 

The first ship, named ''Nickor Jeremiah'', departed from [[Calcutta]], India on January 27, 1857 and arrived a few months later on May 1. In all 3,206 East Indians arrived in Grenada by 1885. Only 380 of them returned to India. The Indians made many contributions to Grenada. [[Indian Arrival Day]] was celebrated in 2007 on the 150th anniversary, for the first time since the centenary celebration in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nomadicgourmet.com/2008/05/indian-arrival-day.html | title=I came, I saw, and I cooked it: Indian Arrival Day | work=The Nomadic Gourmet | date=May 1, 2008 | accessdate=November 2, 2016| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528094832/http://www.nomadicgourmet.com/2008/05/indian-arrival-day.html | archivedate=May 28, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians later on assimilated with the existing Africans, Europeans and other ethnicities intermarrying with each other. This very much influenced the culture and cuisine of Grenada.

== Cuisine ==
Special dishes reflect the cultural diversity of Grenada. The national dish, [[Oil Down]] is a combination of [[breadfruit]], [[coconut milk]], [[turmeric]] (misnamed [[saffron]]), dumplings, [[callaloo]] ([[taro]] leaves), and salted meat such as saltfish ([[cod]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nomadicgourmet.com/2008/04/saltfish-accra.html Saltfish accra- NomadicGourmet.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106090711/http://www.nomadicgourmet.com/2008/04/saltfish-accra.html |date=2010-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; smoked herring or salt beef. It's often cooked in a large pot commonly referred to by locals as a karhee, or curry pot. Popular street foods include aloo pie, doubles, and dal puri&lt;ref&gt;Roti

Sweets include kurma, [[guava cheese]], fudge or barfi, [[tamarind]] balls, [[rum]], raisin ice cream, currant rolls, and [http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Grenadian-Spice-Cake/Detail.aspx?nextItemId=17442&amp;position=0&amp;prop24=RD_RecipeArrow_Right Grenadian spice cake].

== Music &amp; Festivals ==
{{Main|Music of Grenada}}
Music plays a huge part in Grenadian culture, with the annual [[Carnival]] competition generating new [[Soca music|soca]] and [[Calypso music|calypso]] material in August. The rest of the time soca, calypso, and [[reggae]] are the mainstay on the minibuses competing for the loudest, and unfortunately, sometimes fastest bus service. [[Zouk]] music has also been imported to Grenada from other French [[Caribbean]] islands recently. Other local celebrations include the National Dance Festival and [[Independence Day (Grenada)|Independence Day]].

[[Togo]]'s culture reflects the influences of its 37 tribal ethnic groups, the largest and most influential of which are the [[Ewe (people)|Ewe]], [[Mina people|Mina]], and [[Kabye people|Kabye]].  French is the official language of Togo, but many native [[African languages]] are spoken there as well. Despite the influence of Western religion, more than half of the people of Togo follow native [[Animism|animistic]] practices and beliefs.

Ewe statuary is characterized by its famous statuettes which illustrate the worship of the twins, the ''ibéji''. Sculptures and hunting trophies were used rather than the more ubiquitous African masks. The wood-carvers of [[Kloto]] are famous for their "chains of marriage": two characters are connected by rings drawn from only one piece of wood.

The dyed fabric batiks of the artisanal center of Kloto represent stylized and colored scenes of ancient everyday life. The loincloths used in the ceremonies of the tisserands of Assahoun are famous. Works of the painter Sokey Edorh are inspired by the immense arid extents, swept by the harmattan, and where the laterite keeps the prints of the men and the animals. The plastics technician [[Paul Ahyi]] is internationally recognized today. He practises the "zota", a kind of pyroengraving, and his monumental achievements decorate [[Lomé]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44571">{{about|dialects of spoken and written languages|other uses|Dialect (disambiguation)}}

The term '''dialect''' (from Latin {{wikt-lang|la|dialectus}}, {{wikt-lang|la|dialectos}}, from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{wikt-lang|grc|διάλεκτος}}, {{grc-tr|διάλεκτος}}, "discourse", from {{wikt-lang|grc|διά}}, {{grc-tr|διά}}, "through" and {{wikt-lang|grc|λέγω}}, {{grc-tr|λέγω}}, "I speak") is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of [[linguistic]] phenomena:

* One usage refers to a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a [[language]] that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&amp;queryword=dialect&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&amp;hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, the dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], especially if close to one another on the [[dialect continuum]]. The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as [[social class]] or [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dialect Merriam-Webster Online dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt; A dialect that is associated with a particular [[social class]] can be termed a [[sociolect]], a dialect that is associated with a particular [[ethnic group]] can be termed as [[ethnolect]], and a regional dialect may be termed a regiolect.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt and Schilling, Natalie. 2016. ''American English: Dialects and Variation.'' West Sussex: John Wiley &amp; Sons, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, any variety of a given language constitutes "a dialect", including any [[standard language|standard varieties]]. In this case, the distinction between the "standard language" (i.e. the "standard" dialect of a particular language) and the "nonstandard" dialects of the same language is often [[arbitrary]] and based on social, political, cultural, or historical considerations.&lt;ref name="chao"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chao|first1=Yuen Ren|title=Language and Symbolic Systems|date=1968|publisher=CUP archive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Se87AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIOzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lyons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=John|title=Language and Linguistics|date=1981|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Wg57a3DdYYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=David|title=How Myths about Language Affect Education: What Every Teacher Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPsVxfVDXp0C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the definitions of the terms "language" and "dialect" may overlap and are often subject to debate, with the differentiation between the two classifications often grounded in arbitrary and/or sociopolitical motives.&lt;ref name="mcworther"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McWorther|first1=John|title=What's a Language, Anyway?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/difference-between-language-dialect/424704/|accessdate=19 July 2016|agency=The Atlantic|date=Jan 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The other usage of the term "dialect", often deployed in [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] settings, refers (often somewhat pejoratively) to a language that is [[Social stratification|socially subordinated]] to a regional or national [[standard language]], often historically [[cognate]] or [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]] to the standard language, but not actually derived ''from'' the standard language. In other words, it is not an actual [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the "standard language" or dominant language, but rather a separate, independently evolved but often distantly related language.&lt;ref name=maiden&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maiden|first1=Martin|last2=Parry|first2=Mair|title=The Dialects of Italy|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Dz_LyQF_eAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dialects+of+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAWoVChMI47KwhKr1yAIVjD8-Ch3bQQsQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a "dialect", as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of [[Prestige (linguistics)|linguistic prestige]], social or political status, [[official language|official status]], predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Meanwhile, under this usage, the "dialects" subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often loosely related) languages in and of themselves. Thus, these "dialects" are not dialects or varieties of a particular language in the same sense as in the first usage; though they may share roots in the same [[Language family|family]] or subfamily as the standard language and may even, to varying degrees, share some [[mutual intelligibility]] with the standard language, they often did not evolve closely with the standard language or within the same linguistic subgroup or [[speech community]] as the standard language and instead may better fit the criteria of a separate language.

For example, most of the various regional [[Romance language|Romance]] [[languages of Italy]], often colloquially referred to as Italian "dialects", are, in fact, not ''actually'' derived from modern [[standard Italian]], but rather evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]] separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now [[Italy]]. These various Latin-derived regional languages are, therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly "dialects" or varieties of the [[standard Italian|standard Italian language]], but are instead better defined as their own separate languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, regional versions or varieties of standard Italian have developed, generally as a mix of national standard Italian with a [[substratum]] of local regional languages and local accents. While [[dialect levelling|"dialect" levelling]] has increased the number of standard Italian speakers and decreased the number of speakers of other languages native to Italy, Italians in different regions have developed variations of standard Italian particular to their region. These variations on standard Italian, known as [[regional Italian]], would thus more appropriately be called "dialects" in accordance with the first linguistic definition of "dialect", as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Loporcaro | first= Michele | year= 2009 | title= Profilo linguistico dei dialetti italiani | location= Bari | publisher= Laterza | ref= harv | language=Italian }}; {{cite book | last= Marcato | first= Carla | year= 2007 | title= Dialetto, dialetti e italiano | location= Bologna | publisher= Il Mulino | ref= harv | language=Italian}}; {{cite book| last= Posner | first= Rebecca | year= 1996 | title= The Romance languages | location= Cambridge | publisher= Cambridge University Press | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maiden/&gt;&lt;ref name=repetti&gt;{{cite book|last1=Repetti|first1=Lori|title=Phonological Theory and the Dialects of Italy|date=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1f5fIrtw58C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dialects+of+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMI47KwhKr1yAIVjD8-Ch3bQQsQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dialects%20of%20italy&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation ([[phonology]], including [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]). Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation (including prosody, or just prosody itself), the term ''[[Accent (dialect)|accent]]'' may be preferred over ''dialect''. Other types of speech varieties include [[jargon]]s, which are characterized by differences in [[lexicon]] ([[vocabulary]]); [[slang]]; [[patois]]; [[pidgin]]s; and [[argot]]s. The particular speech patterns used by an individual are termed an [[idiolect]].

==Standard and non-standard dialect==
A ''standard dialect'' (also known as a '''standardized dialect''' or "[[standard language]]") is a dialect that is supported by institutions. Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation; presentation as being the "correct" form of a language in schools; published grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect (prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.). There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language. For example, Standard [[American English]], Standard [[British English]], Standard [[Canadian English]], Standard [[Indian English]], Standard [[Australian English]], and Standard [[Philippine English]] may all be said to be standard dialects of the [[English language]].

A [[nonstandard dialect]], like a standard dialect, has a complete vocabulary, grammar, and [[Syntax|syntax]], but is usually not the beneficiary of institutional support. Examples of a nonstandard English dialect are [[Southern American English]], [[Western Australian English]], [[New York English]], [[New England English]], [[Mid-Atlantic American English| Mid-Atlantic American]] or [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] / [[Baltimorese|Baltimore]] English, [[Scouse]], [[Brummie]], [[Cockney accent|Cockney]], and [[Yorkshire dialect|Tyke]]. The [[Dialect Test]] was designed by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] to compare different English dialects with each other.

== Dialect or language ==
{{see also|Abstand and ausbau languages|A language is a dialect with an army and navy}}
There is no universally accepted criterion for distinguishing two different languages from two dialects (i.e. varieties) of the same language.&lt;ref&gt;Cysouw, Michael; Good, Jeff. (2013). "Languoid, Doculect, and Glossonym: Formalizing the Notion 'Language'." ''Language Documentation and Conservation''. 7. 331–359. {{hdl|10125/4606}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading to contradictory results. The distinction is therefore subjective and depends upon the user's frame of reference. For example, there has been discussion about whether or not the [[Limón Creole English]] should be considered "a kind" of English or a different language. This creole is spoken in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica (Central America) by descendants of Jamaican people. The position that Costa Rican linguists support depends upon which University they represent.

The most common, and most purely linguistic, criterion is that of [[mutual intelligibility]]: two varieties are said to be dialects of the same language if being a speaker of one variety confers sufficient knowledge to understand and be understood by a speaker of the other; otherwise, they are said to be different languages. However, this definition becomes problematic in the case of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]], in which it may be the case that dialect B is mutually intelligible with both dialect A and dialect C but dialects A and C are not mutually intelligible with each other. In this case, the criterion of mutual intelligibility makes it impossible to decide whether A and C are dialects of the same language or not. The mutual intelligibility criterion also flounders in cases in which a speaker of dialect X can understand a speaker of dialect Y, but not vice versa.

=== Sociolinguistic definitions ===
[[File:West Germanic dialect diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Local varieties in the West Germanic dialect continuum are oriented towards either Standard Dutch or Standard German depending on which side of the border they are spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | surname1 = Chambers | given1 = J. K. | author-link1 = Jack Chambers (linguist)
  | last2 = Trudgill | first2 = Peter | author-link2 = Peter Trudgill

  | isbn = 978-0-521-59646-6
  | page = 10
  | ref = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another occasionally used criterion for discriminating dialects from languages is the [[sociolinguistic]] notion of [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|linguistic authority]]. According to this definition, two varieties are considered dialects of the same language if (under at least some circumstances) they would defer to the same authority regarding some questions about their language. For instance, to learn the name of a new invention, or an obscure foreign species of plant, speakers of [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] and [[East Franconian German]] might each consult a German dictionary or ask a German-speaking expert in the subject.
Thus these varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, [[Standard German]], which is said to be autonomous.
In contrast, speakers in the Netherlands of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] varieties similar to Westphalian would instead consult a dictionary of [[Standard Dutch]].
Similarly, although Yiddish is classified by linguists as a language in the [[Middle High German]] group of languages, a Yiddish speaker would consult a different dictionary in such a case.

Within this framework, [[William Alexander Stewart|W. A. Stewart]] defined a ''language'' as an autonomous variety together with all the varieties that are heteronomous with respect to it, noting that an essentially equivalent definition had been stated by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] and [[John J. Gumperz]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, a heteronomous variety may be considered a ''dialect'' of a language defined in this way.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;
In these terms, [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], though mutually intelligible to a large degree, are considered separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the framework of [[Heinz Kloss]], these are described as languages by ''[[abstand and ausbau languages|ausbau]]'' (development) rather than by ''abstand'' (separation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | surname = Kloss | given = Heinz |  author-link = Heinz Kloss

  | journal = Anthropological Linguistics | volume = 9 | number = 7
  | year = 1967 | pages = 29–41
  | jstor = 30029461
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dialect and language clusters ===

In other situations, a closely related group of varieties possess considerable (though incomplete) mutual intelligibility, but none dominates the others.
To describe this situation, the editors of the ''Handbook of African Languages'' introduced the term ''dialect cluster''.
Dialect clusters were treated as classificatory units at the same level as languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | title = A Handbook of African Languages
  | author = Handbook Sub-committee Committee of the International African Institute.
  | journal = Africa | volume = 16 | number = 3 | year = 1946 | pages = 156–159
  | jstor = 1156320
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar situation, but with a greater degree of mutual unintelligibility, has been termed a ''language cluster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | title = A provisional language map of Nigeria
  | given1 = Keir | surname1 = Hansford
  | given2 = John | surname2 = Bendor-Samuel
  | given3 = Ron | surname3 = Stanford
  | journal = Savanna | volume = 5 | number = 2 | year = 1976 | pages = 115–124
}} p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political factors ===

In many societies, however, a particular dialect, often the sociolect of the [[elite]] class, comes to be identified as the "standard" or "proper" version of a language by those seeking to make a social distinction and is contrasted with other varieties. As a result of this, in some contexts, the term "dialect" refers specifically to varieties with low [[social status]]. In this secondary sense of "dialect", language varieties are often called ''dialects'' rather than ''languages'':
* if they have no standard or [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] form,
* if they are rarely or never used in writing (outside reported speech),
* if the speakers of the given language do not have a [[State (polity)|state]] of their own,
* if they lack [[prestige dialect|prestige]] with respect to some other, often standardised, variety.

The status of "language" is not solely determined by linguistic criteria, but it is also the result of a historical and political development. [[Romansh language|Romansh]] came to be a written language, and therefore it is recognized as a language, even though it is very close to the Lombardic alpine dialects. An opposite example is the case of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], whose variations such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] are often called dialects and not languages in China, despite their mutual unintelligibility.

Modern [[nationalism]], as developed especially since the [[French Revolution]], has made the distinction between "language" and "dialect" an issue of great political importance. A group speaking a separate "language" is often seen as having a greater claim to being a separate "people", and thus to be more deserving of its own independent state, while a group speaking a "dialect" tends to be seen not as "a people" in its own right, but as a sub-group, part of a bigger people, which must content itself with regional autonomy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The distinction between language and dialect is thus inevitably made at least as much on a political basis as on a linguistic one, and can lead to great political controversy or even armed conflict.

The [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] linguist [[Max Weinreich]] published the expression, ''A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot'' ({{rtl-lang|yi|"אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמײ און פֿלאָט"}}: "[[A language is a dialect with an army and navy]]") in ''YIVO Bleter'' 25.1, 1945, p.&amp;nbsp;13. The significance of the political factors in any attempt at answering the question "what is a language?" is great enough to cast doubt on whether any strictly linguistic definition, without a socio-cultural approach, is possible. This is illustrated by the frequency with which the army-navy aphorism is cited.

==={{anchor|languoid}}Terminology ===

By the definition most commonly used by linguists, any linguistic variety can be considered a "dialect" of ''some'' language—"everybody speaks a dialect". According to that interpretation, the criteria above merely serve to distinguish whether two varieties are dialects of the ''same'' language or dialects of ''different'' languages.

The terms "language" and "dialect" are not necessarily mutually exclusive, although it is often perceived to be.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Thus there is nothing contradictory in the statement "the ''language'' of the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] is a dialect of [[German (language)|German]]".

There are various terms that linguists may use to avoid taking a position on whether the speech of a community is an independent language in its own right or a dialect of another language. Perhaps the most common is "[[variety (linguistics)|variety]]";&lt;ref name=finegan&gt;{{cite book |title=Language: Its Structure and Use|edition=5th |last=Finegan |first=Edward |year=2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-4130-3055-6 |page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[lect]]" is another.  A more general term is "languoid", which does not distinguish between dialects, languages, and groups of languages, whether genealogically related or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Languoid "Languoid"] at ''Glottopedia.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

{{see also|Mesoamerican languages#Language vs. dialect|l1=Mesoamerican languages § Language vs. dialect}}

=== German ===
When talking about the German language, the term [[German dialects]] is only used for the traditional regional varieties. That allows them to be distinguished from the regional varieties of modern standard German.

The German dialects show a wide spectrum of variation. Some of them are not mutually intelligible. [[German dialectology]] traditionally names the major dialect groups after [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] from which they were assumed to have descended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cutewriters.com/german-language-dialect-variations/|title=From dialect to variation space|last=Danvas|first=Kegesa|date=2016|website=Cutewriters|publisher=Cutewriters Inc.|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which the dialects are spoken varies according to a number of factors: In Northern Germany, dialects are less common than in the South. In cities, dialects are less common than in the countryside. In a public environment, dialects are less common than in a familiar environment.

The situation in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] is different from the rest of the German-speaking countries. The [[Swiss German]] dialects are the default everyday language in virtually every situation, whereas standard German is only spoken in education, partially in media, and with foreigners not possessing knowledge of Swiss German. Most Swiss German speakers perceive standard German to be a foreign language.

The [[Low German]] varieties spoken in Germany are often counted among the German dialects. This reflects the modern situation where they are [[Dachsprache|roofed]] by standard German. This is different from the situation in the [[Middle Ages]] when Low German had strong tendencies towards an [[ausbau language]].

The [[Frisian languages]] spoken in Germany are excluded from the German dialects.

===Italian===
{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}
Italy is home to a vast array of [[Languages of Italy|native regional minority languages]], most of which are [[Romance language|Romance]]-based and have their own local variants. These [[regional language]]s are often referred to colloquially or in non-linguistic circles as Italian "dialects", or ''dialetti'' (standard Italian for "dialects"). However, the majority of the regional languages in Italy are in fact not actually "dialects" of [[standard Italian]] in the strict linguistic sense, as they are not derived from modern [[standard Italian]] but instead evolved locally from [[Vulgar Latin]] independent of standard Italian, with little to no influence from what is now known as "standard Italian." They are therefore better classified as individual languages rather than "dialects."

In addition to having evolved, for the most part, separately from one another and with distinct individual histories, the [[Latin]]-based regional Romance languages of Italy are also better classified as separate languages rather than true "dialects" due to the often high degree in which they lack [[mutual intelligibility]]. Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutually unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the [[dialect continuum]] being more or less mutually intelligible. For instance, a speaker of purely [[Eastern Lombard dialect|Eastern Lombard]], a language in [[Northern Italy]]'s [[Lombardy|Lombardy region]] that includes the [[Bergamasque dialect]], would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely [[standard Italian]] speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure [[Sicilian language]] variant. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a [[Gallo-Italic]] language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], or [[French language|French]] speaker than with a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian language speaker would have a greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related [[Neapolitan language]], but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicilian Gallo-Italic]], a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the [[Sicily|same island]] as the Sicilian language.

Modern standard Italian itself is heavily based on the Latin-derived [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]] [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan language]]. The Tuscan-based language that would eventually become modern standard Italian had been used in poetry and literature since at least the [[12th century]], and it first spread throughout Italy among the educated upper class through the works of authors such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Petrarch]]. Dante's Florentine-Tuscan literary Italian thus slowly became the language of the [[literate]] and [[upper class]] in Italy, and it spread throughout the peninsula as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among the Italian [[educated]] class as well as Italian traveling merchants. The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of [[Tuscany]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful, though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people.

During the [[Risorgimento]], proponents of Italian republicanism and Italian nationalism, such as [[Alessandro Manzoni]], stressed the importance of establishing a uniform [[national language]] in order to better create an Italian [[national identity]]. With the [[unification of Italy]] in the 1860s, standard Italian became the official national language of the new Italian state, while the various unofficial regional languages of Italy gradually became regarded as subordinate "dialects" to Italian, increasingly associated negatively with lack of education or provincialism. However, at the time of the Italian Unification, standard Italian still existed mainly as a literary language, and only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak standard Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita |title=Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the vast [[conscription]] of Italian men from all throughout Italy during [[World War I]] is credited with facilitating the diffusion of standard Italian among less educated Italian men, as these men from various regions with various regional languages were forced to communicate with each other in a common tongue while serving in the Italian military. With the eventual spread of the radio and television throughout Italy and the establishment of [[public education]], Italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to standard Italian, while literacy rates among all social classes improved. Today, the majority of Italians are able to speak standard Italian, though many Italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language, especially at home with family or when communicating with Italians from the same town or region. However, to some Italians, speaking a regional language, especially in a formal setting or outside of one's region, may carry a stigma or negative connotations associated with being lower class, uneducated, boorish, or overly informal.

Italians in different regions today may also speak regional varieties of standard Italian, or [[regional Italian|regional Italian dialects]], which, unlike the majority of [[languages of Italy]], are actually dialects of standard Italian rather than separate languages. A regional Italian dialect is generally standard Italian that has been heavily influenced or mixed with local or regional native languages and accents.

The languages of Italy are primarily [[Latin]]-based [[Romance languages]], with the most widely spoken languages falling within the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian language]] family. This wide category includes:
*Standard Italian and [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]; 
*the various related [[Central Italian]] dialects, such as [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] in [[Rome]];
*the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] group (also known as "Southern Italian"), which encompasses not only [[Naples]]' and [[Campania]]'s speech but also a variety of related neighboring varieties like the [[Irpinian dialect]], [[Abruzzo|Abruzzese]] and Southern [[Marche]]giano, [[Molisan]], [[Calabrian language#Northern Calabrian (Cosentino)|Northern Calabrian or Cosentino]], and the [[Bari dialect]]. The [[Cilentan dialect]] of [[Salerno]], in [[Campania]], is considered significantly influenced by the Neapolitan and the below-mentioned language groups;
*the [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] group, including [[Salentino dialect|Salentino]] and [[Calabrian languages|Calabrian]].

Aside from the more common [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Romance language]]s in Italy, other native languages in Italy include: 
*a variety of [[Gallo-Italic languages]], [[Gallo-Rhaetian languages]], [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]], and [[Ibero-Romance languages]] (such as [[Emilian-Romagnol language|Emilian-Romagnol]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Friulian]], the [[Lombard language]]s, [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicilian Gallo-Italic]], [[Algherese dialect|Algherese]], the [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], etc.); 
*[[Germanic language|Germanic]] languages, such as the [[Cimbrian language]]s, [[Southern Bavarian]], [[Walser German]] and the [[Mòcheno language]];
*the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] [[Arbëresh language]]; 
*the [[Hellenic language|Hellenic]] [[Griko language]] and [[Calabrian Greek]];
*the [[Serbo-Croatian]] [[Slavomolisano dialect]];
*various [[Slovene language]]s, including the [[Gail Valley dialect]] and [[Istrian dialect]].

The [[Sardinian language]] is considered to be its own Romance language family, separate not only from Italian and the wider Italo-Dalmatian family but from all the other Neo-Latin families; it is often subdivided into the [[Campidanese Sardinian|Campidanese]] and [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese]] dialects. The [[Corsican language|Corsican]]-related [[Gallurese dialect|Gallurese]] and [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] which are also spoken in [[Sardinia]], on the other hand, are often considered closely related to or derived from [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] and are therefore fully part of the Italo-Dalmatian languages. Furthermore, the [[Gallo-Romance]] language of [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] and the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[Algherese dialect]] are also spoken in Sardinia, respectively in [[Carloforte]]/[[Calasetta]] and [[Alghero]].

=== The Balkans ===
The classification of speech varieties as dialects or languages and their relationship to other varieties of speech can be controversial and the verdicts inconsistent. English and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] illustrate the point. English and Serbo-Croatian each have two major variants ([[British English|British]] and [[American English]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], respectively), along with numerous other varieties. For political reasons, analyzing these varieties as "languages" or "dialects" yields inconsistent results: British and American English, spoken by close political and military allies, are almost universally regarded as varieties of a single language, whereas the national standards of [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]], which are closer to each other than some local vernacular dialects of [[Serbo-Croatian]] are to themselves, differing to a similar extent as the formal varieties of English, are treated by some linguists from the region as distinct languages, largely because the two countries oscillate from being brotherly to being bitter enemies. (The [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian language article]] deals with this topic much more fully.)

Similar examples abound. [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], although largely mutually intelligible with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], certain dialects of Serbo-Croatian and to a lesser extent the rest of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[dialect continuum]], is considered by Bulgarian linguists to be a Bulgarian dialect, in contrast with the contemporary international view and the view in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], which regards it as a language in its own right. Nevertheless, before the establishment of a literary standard of Macedonian in 1944, in most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's Republic of Macedonia were referred to as Bulgarian dialects.

===Lebanon===
In [[Lebanon]], a part of the Christian population considers "[[Lebanese language|Lebanese]]" to be in some sense a distinct language from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and not merely a dialect. During the civil war Christians often used Lebanese Arabic officially, and sporadically used the [[Latin script]] to write Lebanese, thus further distinguishing it from Arabic. All Lebanese laws are written in the standard literary form of Arabic, though parliamentary debate may be conducted in Lebanese Arabic.

===North Africa===
In Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, the [[Darija]]s (spoken North African languages) are sometimes considered more different from other Arabic dialects. Officially, North African countries prefer to give preference to the [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] and conduct much of their political and religious life in it (adherence to [[Islam]]), and refrain from declaring each country's specific variety to be a separate language, because Literary Arabic is the [[liturgical language]] of Islam and the language of the Islamic sacred book, the [[Qur'an]]. Although, especially since the 1960s, the Darijas are occupying an increasing use and influence in the cultural life of these countries. Examples of cultural elements where Darijas' use became dominant include: theatre, film, music, television, advertisement, social media, folk-tale books and companies' names.

===Ukraine===
The [[Modern Ukrainian language]] has been in common use since the late 17th century, associated with the establishment of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. In the 19th century, the [[Tsar]]ist Government of the [[Russian Empire]] claimed that [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was merely a dialect of [[Russian language|Russian]] and not a language on its own. According to these claims, the differences were few and caused by the conquest of western Ukraine by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, in reality the dialects in Ukraine were developing independently from the dialects in the modern Russia for several centuries, and as a result they differed substantially.

Following the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine–Central Powers)|Brest-Litovsk Treaty]], the [[German Empire]] briefly [[Ukraine during World War I|gained control over Ukraine]] during [[World War I]], but was eventually defeated by the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], with major involvement by the Ukrainian Bolsheviks. After Bolsheviks managed to conquer the rest of Ukraine from the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[White movement|Whites]], Ukraine became part of the USSR, whence a process of Ukrainization was begun, with encouragement from Moscow. However, in the late 1920s - early 1930s, the process started to reverse. Witnessing the Ukrainian cultural revival spurred by the ukrainization in the early 1290s, and fearing that it might lead to an independence movement, Moscow started to remove from power and in some cases [[Executed Renaissance|physically eliminate the public proponents]] of ukrainization. The appointment of [[Pavel Postyshev]] as the secretary of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] marked the end of ukrainization, and the opposite process of russification started. After World War II, citing [[Ukrainian collaboration with Nazi Germany]] in an attempt to gain independence as the reason, Moscow changed its policy towards repression of the Ukrainian language.

Today the boundaries of the Ukrainian language to the Russian language are still not drawn clearly, with an intermediate dialect between them, called [[Surzhyk]], developing in Ukraine.

===Moldova===
There have been cases of a variety of speech being deliberately reclassified to serve political purposes. One example is [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]. In 1996, the Moldovan parliament, citing fears of "Romanian expansionism", rejected a proposal from [[President of Moldova|President]] [[Mircea Snegur]] to change the name of the language to Romanian, and in 2003 a [[Moldovan–Romanian dictionary]] was published, purporting to show that the two countries speak different languages. Linguists of the [[Romanian Academy]] reacted by declaring that all the Moldovan words were also Romanian words; while in Moldova, the head of the [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]], Ion Bărbuţă, described the dictionary as a politically motivated "absurdity".

===Greater China===
{{Main|Varieties of Chinese#Classification}}
Unlike languages that use alphabets to indicate their pronunciation, [[Chinese characters]] have developed from [[logograms]] that do not always give hints to their pronunciation. Although the written characters have remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions have developed to an extent that the [[Varieties of Chinese|varieties of the spoken language]] are often mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] often show traces of [[Old Chinese]] or [[Middle Chinese]]. From the [[Ming dynasty]] onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], [[Standard Mandarin]] was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as ''fangyan'' (regional speech). [[Cantonese]] is still the most commonly-used language in [[Guangzhou]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]] has been accepted in [[Taiwan]] as an important local language alongside [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]].

{{Main|Interlingua}}

One language, [[Interlingua]], was [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|developed]] so that the languages of Western civilization would act as its dialects.&lt;ref name="coljld"&gt;[[Alice Vanderbilt Morris|Morris, Alice Vanderbilt]], [http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#manyrepresented General report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814204450/http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm |date=2006-08-14 }}. New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from such concepts as the [[international scientific vocabulary]] and [[Standard Average European]], linguists{{who|date=July 2013}} developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Researchers at the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary.&lt;ref name = "jawmqc"&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects.&lt;ref name = "coljld"/&gt; This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Gopsill, F. P., ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that the vocabulary of Interlingua extends beyond the Western language families.&lt;ref name = "jawmqc"/&gt;

== Introduction of feminization ==
Defining the term "feminization" can be complicated due to its meaning being unstable, as it can be portrayed as either a social process or as a critique of a process. Feminization has two basic meanings. The first concerns a person who was not initially feminine but becomes feminine later in their life through the perceptions of both the individual and those around them. According to gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], a person's gender is not solely an act of will or self-description, as it is also shaped by the people who describe, categorize, and treat the person according to their own perceptions of their gender. The second meaning of the term feminization describes when a person who originally had feminine qualities begins to incorporate more feminine attributes into their personality in some way, shape, or form. The term has often been used to describe females, however over time it shifted to where the term can be used to describe the process of someone or something becoming more feminine by adopting feminine qualities.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Imhoff | first = Sarah | title = The myth of American Jewish feminization | journal = Jewish Social Studies | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 126&amp;ndash;152 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | doi = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | jstor = 10.2979/jewisocistud.21.3.05 | date = Spring–Summer 2016 | url = https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/21871/The%20Myth%20of%20American%20Jewish%20Feminization.pdf?sequence=1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminization of poverty ==
Women are more likely than men to live below the poverty line, a phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty. The 2015 poverty rates for men and women in the U.S. were 10% and 15% respectively. Women are less likely to pursue advanced degrees  and tend to have low paying jobs. It has been argued that even with the same level of education and occupational role, women earn much less than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/session/presskit/fs1.htm|title=Beijing +5 – Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century Twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, 5-9 June 2000|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources have disputed the idea of a wage gap in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/harvard-prof.-takes-down-gender-wage-gap-myth/article/2580405|title=Harvard prof. takes down gender wage gap myth|last=Schow|first=Ashe|website=The Washington Examiner|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists of the modern day living wage movement began in Baltimore, Maryland in the early 1990's right in the very heart and depths of the struggling urban poor. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Around this same time, Baltimore churches became involved in providing the poor with needed social services. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even though national prosperity and rising stock markets seemed to be showing growth, more and more full-time workers were relying on soup kitchens, low-income housing assistance, and thrift store purchases for clothing. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their jobs did not pay enough to keep families above the poverty line. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whole communities became known as the "working poverty."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Four Noble Truths''' refer to and express the basic orientation of [[Buddhism]]{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=59}} in a short expression:{{sfn|Norman|2003}}{{refn|group=note|name="Moksha"}} we [[Taṇhā|crave]] and [[Upādāna|cling]] to [[Saṅkhāra#Conditioned things|impermanent states and things]],{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}} which are ''[[dukkha]]'',{{sfn|Khantipalo|2003|p=41}} "incapable of satisfying"&lt;ref group=web name="Sumedho-first"/&gt; and painful.&lt;ref group=web name="Sumedho-first" /&gt;{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}}{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=74-75}}{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=147}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-DL Four Truths" /&gt; This craving keeps us caught in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]'',{{refn|group=note|name="Samudaya"}} the endless cycle of repeated ''[[bhava]]'' ("becoming") and ''[[Jāti (Buddhism)|jāti]]'' (literally: "birth", interpreted as [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]), and the continued ''dukkha'' that comes with it.{{refn|group=note|name="Samsara"}} There is, however, a way to [[Moksha|end this cycle]],{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=45-46}}{{refn|group=note|name="Pleasure"}} namely by attaining ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]'', cessation of craving, whereafter birth and the accompanying ''dukkha'' will no longer arise again.{{refn|group=note|name="Nirodha"}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=304}} This can be accomplished by following the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold path]],{{refn|group=note|name="Moksha"}} restraining oneself, cultivating discipline and wholesome states, and practicing [[mindfulness]] and ''[[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]]''.{{sfn|Raju|1985|p=147–151}}{{sfn|Eliot|2014|p=39–41}}

In short form, the four truths are ''dukkha'', ''samudaya'' ("arising," "coming together"), ''nirodha'' ("cessation," "confinement"), and ''marga'', the path leading to cessation.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219, 222}} As the "Four Noble Truths" ([[Sanskrit]]: ''catvāri āryasatyāni''; [[Pali]]: ''cattāri ariyasaccāni''), they are "the truths of the [[Arhat|Noble Ones]],"{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} the truths or realities which are understood by the "worthy ones"&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Arhat"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34073/arhat Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Arhat (Buddhism)'']&lt;/ref&gt; who have attained nirvana.{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=67}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Arhat" /&gt;

In the ''[[Buddhist texts|sutras]]'', Buddhist religious texts, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=223-231}} They represent the awakening and liberation of the Buddha, but also the possibility of liberation for all sentient beings, describing how release from craving is to be reached.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=56}} In the [[Pali canon]] scriptures, the four truths appear in a "network of teachings,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} as part of "the entire ''[[Dharma#Buddhism|dhamma]]'' matrix,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}} which have to be taken together.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} They provide a conceptual framework for introducing and explaining Buddhist thought, which has to be personally understood or "experienced".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} {{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=27-28}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-DL Four Truths"/&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"}}

The function of the four truths, and their importance, developed over time, when ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'', or "liberating insight," came to be regarded as liberating in itself,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} instead of or in addition to the practice of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'', meditation.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}} This "liberating insight" gained a prominent place in the sutras, and the four truths came to represent this liberating insight, as part of the enlightenment story of the Buddha.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}}

The four truths became of central importance in the [[Theravada]] tradition of Buddhism,{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55-56}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}} which holds to the idea that insight into the four truths is liberating in itself.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} They are less prominent in the [[Mahayana]] tradition, which sees the higher aims of insight into ''[[sunyata]]'', emptiness, and following the [[Bodhisattva path]] as central elements in their teachings and practice.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179-3180}} The Mahayana tradition reinterpreted the four truths to explain how a liberated being can still be "pervasively operative in this world."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346-347}} Beginning with the exploration of Buddhism by [[Colonial India|western colonialists]] in the 19th century and the development of [[Buddhist modernism]], they came to be often presented in the west as the central teaching of Buddhism.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=72-73}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}}

==The four truths==

===Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta===
The four truths are best known from their presentation in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' text,{{refn|group=note|name="best-known"}} which contains two sets of the four truths,{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=295}}{{sfn|Norman|2003}} while various other sets can be found in the [[Pali Canon]], a collection of scriptures in the [[Theravadan]] Buddhist tradition.{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} According to the Buddhist tradition, the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', "Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion,"&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion - Majjhima Nikaya 56.11'']&lt;/ref&gt; contains the first teachings that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] gave after attaining [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|full awakening]], and liberation from rebirth. According to [[L. S. Cousins]], many scholars are of the view that "this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date,"{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}} and according to professor of religion Carol S. Anderson{{refn|group=note|Professor of religion, Kalamazoo College; Co-Editor of the Journal of Buddhist-Christian Studies.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://www.society-buddhist-christian-studies.org/partners/ ''Governing Board of the Society for Buddhist-Christian studies'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://www.society-buddhist-christian-studies.org/carol-anderson ''Carol Anderson'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} the four truths may originally not have been part of this sutta, but were later added in some versions.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=68}} Within this discourse, the four noble truths are given as follows ("bhikkus" is normally translated as "Buddhist monks"):
{{quote| Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the [[Skandha|five aggregates]] subject to clinging are suffering.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving [''[[taṇhā]]'', "thirst"] which [[Twelve Nidānas|leads to re-becoming]], accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for becoming, craving for disbecoming.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this noble eightfold path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.&lt;ref group=web name="BB"&gt;[http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebsut001.htm Bikkhu Bodhi (translator), ''Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta. Samyutta Nikaya LVI, 11. "Setting in Motion the Wheel of the Dhamma."'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to this sutra, with the complete comprehension of these four truths release from ''samsara'', the cycle of rebirth, was attained:
{{quote|Knowledge &amp; vision arose in me: 'Unprovoked is my release. This is the last birth. There is now no further becoming.&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/&gt;}}

The comprehension of these four truths by his audience leads to the opening of the ''Dhamma Eye'', that is, the attainment of right vision:
{{quote|Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation.&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/&gt;}}

===Mnemonic set===
According to [[K. R. Norman]], the Pali canon contains various shortened forms of the four truths, the "mnemonic set," which were "intended to remind the hearer of the full form of the NTs."{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=213}} The earliest form of the mnemonic set was "dukkham samudayo nirodho magga," without the reference to the [[Pali]] terms ''sacca''{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219}} or ''arya'',{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} which were later added to the formula.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} The four mnemonic terms can be translated as follows:
# ''[[Dukkha]]'' - "incapable of satisfying,"&lt;ref group=web name="Sumedho-first"&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble4.htm Ajahn Sumedho, ''The First Noble Truth'']&lt;/ref&gt; "the unsatisfactory nature and the general insecurity of all [[Saṅkhāra#Conditioned things|conditioned phenomena]]"; "painful."{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}}{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}} ''Dukkha'' is most commonly translated as "suffering". According to Khantipalo, this is an incorrect translation, since it refers to the ultimately unsatisfactory nature of temporary states and things, including pleasant but temporary experiences.{{sfn|Khantipalo|2003|p=46}} According to Emmanuel, ''Dukkha'' is the opposite of ''sukha'', "pleasure," and it is better translated as "pain."{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}}
# ''[[Samudaya]]'' - "origin", "source", "arising", "coming to existence";&lt;ref group=web name=DigitalLibrary&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120611220213/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/DBLM/olcourse/sanskrit/heart/heart16.htm Digital Library &amp; Museum of Buddhist Studies, College of liberal Arts, Taiwan University: Samudaya]&lt;/ref&gt; "aggregate of the constituent elements or factors of any being or existence", "cluster", "coming together", "combination", "producing cause", "combination", "rising."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+samudaya&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for spoken Sanskrit, ''samudaya'']&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Nirodha'' - cessation; release; to confine;{{sfn|Brazier|2001}} "prevention, suppression, enclosing, restraint"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+nirodha&amp;trans=Translate spokensanskrit.de, ''nirodha'']&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Noble Eightfold Path|Marga]]'' - "path."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#m Access to Insight Glossary - m]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Full set===
This full set, which is most commonly used in modern expositions,{{refn|group=note|name="best-known"|For example:&lt;br&gt;
* Ven. Dr. Rewata Dhamma: The Four Noble Truths [...] are: 1. The Noble Truth of Suffering (''dukkha''); 2. The Noble Truth of the origin of suffering (''samudaya''); 3. The Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering (''nirodha''); 4. The Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering (''magga'').{{sfn|Dhamma|1997|p=55}}
* Bhikkhu Bodhi: "The Four Noble Truths are as follows: 1. The truth of Dukkha; 2. The truth of the origin of Dukkha; 3. The truth of the cessation of Dukkha; 4. The truth of the path, the way to liberation from Dukkha".&lt;ref group=web name=bodhi1/&gt;
* Geshe Tashi Tsering: "The four noble truths are: 1. The noble truth of suffering; 2. The noble truth of the origin of suffering; 3. The noble truth of the cessation of suffering and the origin of suffering; 4. The noble truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering and the origin of suffering."{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 246-250}}
* Joseph Goldstein: "The four noble truths are the truth of suffering, its cause, its end, and the path to that end.{{sfn|Goldstein|2002|p=24}}}} contains grammatical errors, pointing to multiple sources for this set and translation problems within the ancient Buddhist community. Nevertheless, they were considered correct by the Pali tradition, which didn't correct them.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} According to K.R. Norman, the basic set is as follows:{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219, 222}}
* idam dukkham, "this is pain"
* ayam dukkha-samudayo, "this is the origin of pain"
* ayam dukkha-nirodha, "this is the cessation of pain"
* ayam dukkha-nirodha-gamini patipada, "this is the path leading to the cessation of pain."  The key terms in the longer version of this expression, ''dukkha-nirodha-gamini Patipada'', can be translated as follows:
:* ''Gamini'': leading to, making for&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=pali&amp;query=g%C4%81min%C4%AB&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 Pali Text Society Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ''Patipada'': road, path, way; the means of reaching a goal or destination&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#pq Access to Insight Glossary - pq]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative formulations===
According to L.S. Cousins, the four truths are not restricted to the well-known form where ''dukkha'' is the subject. Other forms take "the world, the arising of the world" or "the [[Asava|āsavas]], the arising of the āsavas" as their subject. According to Cousins, "the well-known form is simply shorthand for all of the forms."{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=36}} "The world" refers to the [[saṅkhāra]]s, that is, all compounded things,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/7.2-Rohitassa-S-s2.26-piya.pdf The Dharmafarers, ''Rhitassa Sutra'' (Samyutta Nikaya 2.26)]&lt;/ref&gt; or to the [[Ayatana|six sense spheres]].{{sfn|Choong|2000|p=84}}

The various terms all point to the same basic idea of Buddhism, as described in [[Skandha|five skandhas]] and [[Twelve Nidānas|twelve nidānas]]: sense-contact with objects leads to sensation, perception, [[Saṅkhāra]] ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.), and consciousness. The ''Twelve Nidānas'' describe how this also leads to rebirth: from sensation comes craving, from craving comes karma, from karma comes rebirth. The aim of the Buddhist path is to reverse this causal chain: when there is no (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=840}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=55-59}}

===Truths for the noble ones===
The Pali terms ''ariya sacca'' (Sanskrit: ''arya satya'') are commonly translated as "noble truths". This translation is a convention started by the earliest translators of Buddhist texts into English. According to K.R. Norman, this is just one of several possible translations.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]],{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}
{{quote|[T]here is no particular reason why the Pali expression ariyasaccani should be translated as 'noble truths'. It could equally be translated as 'the nobles' truths', or 'the truths for nobles', or 'the nobilising truths', or 'the truths of, possessed by, the noble ones' [...] In fact the Pali expression (and its Sanskrit equivalent) can mean all of these, although the Pali commentators place 'the noble truths' as the least important in their understanding.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}}

The term "arya" was later added to the four truths.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}}{{sfn|Analayo|2013|p=15}} The term ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|ariya]]'' (Sanskrit: ''arya'') can be translated as "noble", "not ordinary", "valuable", "precious".{{refn|group=note|Ajahn Sucitto states: "So the four truths (ariya sacca) are generally called “noble” truths, although one might also translate ariya as “precious.” "{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=Kindle Location 122}} }} "pure",{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Paul Williams:
{{quote|The Aryas are the noble ones, the saints, those who have attained 'the fruits of the path', 'that middle path the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbana'.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}}}}

The term ''[[satya|sacca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''[[satya]]'') is a central term in Indian thought and religion. It is typically translated as "truth"; but it also means "that which is in accord with reality", or "reality". According to [[Rupert Gethin]], the four truths are "four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}} They function as "a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"|Gethin: "The word satya (Pali sacca) can certainly mean truth, but it might equally be rendered as 'real' or 'actual thing'. That is, we are not dealing here with propositional truths with which we must either agree or disagree, but with four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening. [...] This is not to say that the Buddha's discourses do not contain theoretical statements of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation, but these descriptions function not so much as dogmas of the Buddhist faith as a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}}} According to K.R. Norman, probably the best translation is "the truth[s] of the noble one (the Buddha)."{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} It is a statement of how things are seen by a Buddha, how things really are when seen correctly. It is the truthful way of seeing,{{refn|group=note|'"Truth", ''satya'' (Sanskrit), ''sacca'' (Pali), derived from ''sat'', being, how it is.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}} Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}{{refn|group=note|Contemporary Buddhist teacher [[Mingyur Rinpoche]] describes the four ''arya satya'' as "Four Pure Insights into the Way Things Are".{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Contemporary scholar Peter Harvey translates ''arya satya'' as "True Realities for the Spiritually Ennobled".{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=52}}}}

===Symbolic and propositional function===
[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Dharmacakra]], often used to represent the Noble Eightfold Path]]

According to Anderson, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function:
{{quote|... the four noble truths are truly set apart within the body of the Buddha's teachings, not because they are by definition sacred, but because they are both a symbol and a doctrine and transformative within the sphere of right view. As one doctrine among others, the four noble truths make explicit the structure within which one should seek enlightenment; as a symbol, the four noble truths evoke the possibility of enlightenment. As both, they occupy not only a central but a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}}}}

As a symbol, they refer to the possibility of awakening, as represented by the Buddha, and are of utmost importance:
{{quote|[W]hen the four noble truths are regarded in the canon as the first teaching of the Buddha, they function as a view or doctrine that assumes a symbolic function. Where the four noble truths appear in the guise of a religious symbol in the ''Sutta-pitaka'' and the ''Vinaya-pitaka'' of the Pali canon, they represent the enlightenment experience of the Buddha and the possibility of enlightenment for all Buddhists within the cosmos.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55}}}}

As a proposition, they are part of the matrix or "network of teachings," in which they are "not particularly central,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} but have an equal place next to other teachings,{{sfn|Anderson|2011|p=127-128}} describing how release from craving is to be reached.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}} A long recognized feature of the Theravada canon is that it lacks an "overarching and comprehensive structure of the path to ''nibbana''."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=131}} The sutras form a network or matrix, and the four truths appear within this "network of teachings," which have to be taken together.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"}} Within this network, "the four noble truths are one doctrine among others and are not particularly central,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} but are a part of "the entire ''dhamma'' matrix."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}} The four noble truths are be set and learnt in that network, learning "how the various teachings intersect with each other,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86-87}} and refer to the various Buddhist techniques, which are all explicitly and implicitly part of the passages which refer to the four truths.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132}} According to Anderson,
{{quote|There is no single way of understanding the teachings: one teaching may be used to explain another in one passage; the relationship may be reversed or altered in other talks.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}}}}

===''Dukkha'' and its ending===
As a proposition, the four truths defy an exact definition, but refer to and express the basic orientation of [[Buddhism]]:{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=59}} [[Upādāna|clinging and craving]] to temporary states and things is ultimately unsatisfactory and painful, ''dukkha'',{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=45-46}} and sustains ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]'', the repeated cycle of ''[[bhava]]'' (becoming, habitual tendencies) and ''[[Jāti (Buddhism)|jāti]]'' ("birth," interpreted as either [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], the coming to be of a new existence; or as the arising of the sense of self as a mental phenomenon).
&lt;!--** START OF NOTE ("SAMSARA") **--&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Samsara"|On samsara, rebirth and redeath:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Mahasatipatthana-sutta: "And what, ''bhkkhus'', is the noble truth that is the arising of pain? This is craving that leads to rebirth."{{sfn|Anderson|2013|p=91}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* accesstoisight.org: "Because of our ignorance (avijja) of these Noble Truths, because of our inexperience in framing the world in their terms, we remain bound to samsara, the wearisome cycle of birth, aging, illness, death, and rebirth."&lt;ref group=web&gt;accestoinsight.org, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/theravada.html ''What is Theravada Buddhism?'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Paul Williams: "All rebirth is due to karma and is impermanent. Short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma.

The truth of ''[[Buddhist paths to liberation|magga]]'', refers to the path to the cessation of, or liberation from ''dukkha''. By following the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], to ''[[moksha]]'', liberation,{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=136}} restraining oneself, cultivating discipline, and practicing [[mindfulness]] and meditation, one starts to disengage from craving and clinging to impermanent states and things, and rebirth and dissatisfaction will be ended.{{sfn|Raju|1985|p=147–151}}{{sfn|Eliot|2014|p=39–41}} The term "path" is usually taken to mean the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], but [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|other versions]] of "the path" can also be found in the Nikayas.{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}} The Theravada tradition regards insight into the four truths as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}}

The well-known eightfold path consists of the understanding that this world is fleeting and unsatisfying, and how craving keeps us tied to this fleeting world; a friendly and compassionate attitude to others; a correct way of behaving; mind-control, which means not feeding on negative thoughts, and nurturing positive thoughts; constant awareness of the feelings and responses which arise; and the practice of ''dhyana'', meditation.{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}} The tenfold path adds the right (liberating) insight, and liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}}{{refn|group=note|Another variant, which may be condensed to the eightfold or tenfold path, starts with a Tathagatha entering this world.

The four truths describe ''dukkha'' and its ending as a means to reach peace of mind in this life, but also as a means to end rebirth.

According to Geoffrey Samuel, "the Four Noble Truths [...] describe the knowledge needed to set out on the path to liberation from rebirth."{{sfn|Samuel|2008|p=136}} By understanding the four truths, one can stop this clinging and craving, attain a pacified mind, and be freed from this cycle of rebirth and redeath.&lt;ref group=web name="EB-DL Four Truths"&gt;Donald Lopez, [http://www.britannica.com/topic/Four-Noble-Truths ''Four Noble Truths''], Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=74-75}}{{refn|group=note|name="Moksha"}} Patrick Olivelle explains that [[moksha]] is a central concept in Indian religions, and "literally means freedom from samsara."&lt;ref group=web name="Brittanica" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Patrick Olivelle: "[[Moksha]], also spelled mokṣa, also called mukti, in Indian philosophy and religion, liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth (samsara).

{{quote|Once birth has arisen, ‘ageing and death’, and various other dukkha states follow. While saying that birth is the cause of death may sound rather simplistic, in Buddhism it is a very significant statement; for there is an alternative to being born. This is to attain Nirvāna, so bringing an end to the process of rebirth and redeath. Nirvāna is not subject to time and change, and so is known as the [[Anutpada|‘unborn’]]; as it is not born it cannot die, and so it is also known as the ‘deathless’. To attain this state, all phenomena subject to birth – the [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|khandhas]] and [[Nidana|nidānas]] – must be transcended by means of [[Nekkhamma|non-attachment]].{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=71-72}}}}

The last sermon, the ''[[Maha-parinibbana Sutta]]'' (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16)", states it as follows:
{{quote|[...] it is through not realizing, through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you [...] But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming [rebirth], and there is no fresh becoming.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html ''Maha-parinibbana Sutta: Last Days of the Buddha'', translated by Sister Vajira &amp; Francis Story]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other interpretations===
According to Bhikkhu [[Buddhadasa]], "birth" does refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the "emergence of the ego". According to Buddhadhasa,
{{quote|...dependent arising is a phenomenon that lasts an instant; it is impermanent. Therefore, Birth and Death must be explained as phenomena within the process of dependent arising in everyday life of ordinary people. Right Mindfulness is lost during contacts of the Roots and surroundings. Thereafter, when vexation due to greed, anger, and ignorance is experienced, the ego has already been born. It is considered as one 'birth'".&lt;ref&gt;Buddhadhasa, Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Bhikkhu_Buddhadasa_Paticcasamuppada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some contemporary teachers tend to explain the four truths psychologically, by taking ''dukkha'' to mean mental anguish in addition to the physical pain of life,{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=94}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2016|p=10}} and interpreting the four truths as a means to attain happiness in this life.{{sfn|Kingsland|2016|p=280}} In the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]] that emerged out of the Theravada Buddhism, freedom and the "pursuit of happiness" have become the main goals, not the end of rebirth, which is hardly mentioned in their teachings.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|pp=164-166}}{{refn|group=note|The Vipassana-movement originated in colonial Burma, in response to the British colonial regime. While traditional Theravada saw little room for meditation practice, a subordinate role for lay Buddhists, and the attainment of ''nirvana'' as impossible in our times, reformists advocated the practice of meditation by lay Buddhists, as a means to preserve the pre-colonial order, which centered around Buddhism. ''Nirvana'' was suddenly deemed attainable, also for lay Buddhists. The Burmese reformists had a profound influence in the Theravada world, and also in the USA since the 1970s, shaping the popular understanding of Buddhism.&lt;ref group=web name="Braun2014"&gt;Eric Braun (2014), [http://www.spiritrock.org/document.doc?id=5335 ''How colonialism sparked the global Vipassana movement'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also David Chapman (2011), [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Theravada reinvents meditation''].}}

Yet, though freedom and happiness is a part of the Buddhist teachings, these words refer to something different in traditional Asian Buddhism. According to Fronsdal, "when Asian teachers do talk about freedom, it is primarily in reference to what one is free from—that is, from greed, hate, delusion, grasping, attachment, wrong view, self, and most significantly, rebirth".{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=172}} ''Nibbana'' is the final freedom, and it has no purpose beyond itself. In contrast, freedom in the creative modern interpretation of Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path means living happily and wisely, "without drastic changes in lifestyle".{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=172}} Such freedom and happiness is not the goal of Four Noble Truths and related doctrines within traditional Buddhism, but the vipassana teachings in the West make no reference to traditional Theravada doctrines, instead they present only the pragmatic and experiential goals in the form of therapy for the audience's current lives.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|pp=172-174}} The creative interpretations are driven in part because the foundational premises of Buddhism do not make sense to audiences outside of Asia.{{refn|group=note|Stephen Batchelor states, "Such craving is at the root of greed, hatred, and bewilderment that prompt one to commit acts that cause one to be reborn after death in more or less favourable conditions in samsara. Although I have presented this formulation of the existential dilemma and its resolution in Buddhist terms, the same soteriological framework is shared by Hindus and Jains. (...) So embedded is this Indian soteriological framework in Buddhism that Buddhists might find it unintelligible that one would even consider questioning it. For to dispense with such key doctrines as rebirth, the law of kamma, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death would surely undermine the entire edifice of Buddhism itself. Yet for those who have grown up outside of Indian culture, who feel at home in a modernity informed by the natural sciences, to then be told that one cannot “really” practise the dharma unless one adheres to the tenets of ancient Indian soteriology makes little sense. The reason people can no longer accept these beliefs need not be because they reject them as false, but because such views are too much at variance with everything else they know and believe about the nature of themselves and the world. They simply do not work anymore, and the intellectual gymnastics one needs to perform to make them work seem casuistic and, for many, unpersuasive. They are metaphysical beliefs, in that (like belief in God) they can neither be convincingly demonstrated nor refuted."{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=89-90}}}}{{refn|group=note|name="Wallace"|B. Alan Wallace states, "The Theravada Buddhist worldview is originally based on the Pali Buddhist canon, as interpreted by the great fifth-century commentator Buddhaghosa and later Buddhist scholars and contemplatives. For the immigrant Theravada Buddhist laity, the central feature of this worldview is the affirmation of the reality of reincarnation and karma. The possibility of achieving nirvana is primarily a concern for Buddhist monastics, while the laity are more concerned with avoiding karma that would propel them to a miserable rebirth, and with accumulating meritorious karma that will lead to a favorable rebirth and, in the long run, to ultimate liberation. (...) As a direct result of their belief in the efficacy of karma, Theravada lay Buddhists commonly make offerings of food, goods, and money to the ordained Sangha. Such meritorious conduct is thought to lead to a better rebirth either for themselves or for their deceased loved ones, depending on how the merit is dedicated by the person who performs this service."{{sfn|Wallace|2002|p=36–37}}}} According to Spiro, "the Buddhist message is not simply a psychological message," but an eschatological message.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=42}}

Warder, in his 1970 publication "Indian Buddhism", from the oldest extant texts a common kernel can be drawn out,{{sfn|Warder|1999|loc=inside flap}} namely the [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā]]. According to Warder, c.q. his publisher: "This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period before the great schisms of the fourth and third centuries BC. It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself, although this cannot be proved: at any rate it is a Buddhism presupposed by the schools as existing about a hundred years after the parinirvana of the Buddha, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was formulated by anyone else than the Buddha and his immediate followers."{{sfn|Warder|1999|loc=inside flap}}&lt;br&gt;* [[Richard Gombrich]]: "I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that the main edifice is not the work of a single genius.

===Development===

====Growing importance====
According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may already have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, but did not have the central place they acquired in later buddhism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} According to Anderson, only by the time of the commentaries, in the fifth century CE, did the four truths come to be identified in the Theravada tradition as the central teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55-56}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson: "However, the four noble truths do not always appear in stories of the Buddha's enlightenment where we might expect to find them. This feature may indicate that the four noble truths emerged into the canonical tradition at a particular point and slowly became recognized as the first teaching of the Buddha. Speculations about early and late teachings must be made relative to other passages in the Pali canon because of a lack of supporting extratextual evidence. Nonetheless, it is still possible to suggest a certain historical development of the four noble truths within the Pali canon. What we will find is a doctrine that came to be identified as the central teaching of the Buddha by the time of the commentaries in the fifth century C.E."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55-56}}}} According to Anderson,
{{quote|... the four noble truths were probably not part of the earliest strata of what came to be recognized as Buddhism, but that they emerged as a central teaching in a slightly later period that still preceded the final redactions of the various Buddhist canons.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=21}}}}

According to Feer and Anderson, the four truths probably entered the Sutta Pitaka from the Vinaya, the rules for monastic order.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=74, 77}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson refers to Léon Feer, who already in 1870 "suggested the possibility that the four noble truths emerged into Buddhist literature through ''vinaya'' collections."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=183}} She also refers to Bareau, who noticed the consistency between the two versions in the ''Mahavagga'', part of the ''Vinaya'', and the ''Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta'' of the Buddha's enlightenment: "As Bareau noted, the consistency between these two versions of the Buddha's enlightenment is an indication that the redactors of the Theravada canon probably brought the two accounts into agreement with each other at a relatively late point in the formation of the canon.&lt;br /&gt;Leon Feer had already suggested in 1870 that the versions of the four noble truths found in the sutras and suttas were derived from the vinaya rescensions in the larger body of Buddhist literature; Bareau's conclusion builds on this claim."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=74}}}} They were first added to enlightenment-stories which contain the Four Jhanas, replacing terms for "liberating insight".{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=148}}{{refn|group=note|According to Schmithausen, in his often-cited article ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism'', the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}}} From there they were added to the biographical stories of the Buddha.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=17}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson refers to research by K.R.

====Substituting "liberating insight"====
Scholars have noted inconsistencies in the presentations of the Buddha's enlightenment, and the Buddhist path to liberation, in the oldest sutras. They offer that these inconsistencies show that the Buddhist teachings evolved, either during the lifetime of the Buddha, or thereafter.&lt;!--**START OF NOTE**--&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="development of teachings"|See:

Instead, they are a rather late theory on the content of the Buddha's enlightenment.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1990|p=28}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of ''dhyana'',{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} leading to a calm of mind and [[Sati (Buddhism)|awareness]] (mindfulness){{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXV}} which according to Vetter ''is'' the liberation which is being sought.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{refn|group=note|Note that ''dhyana'' is not the same as ''samatha'', the calming of the mind by one-pointedly concentration. While ''dhyana'' also leads to a calm of mind, it aids in developing mindfulness, which is necessary to be aware of the arising of disturbing, selfish, thoughts and emotions, and to counter them. Wynne: "...the Buddha taught a ‘middle way’ between pure meditation and cognitive practices. The states of absorption induced by meditation were considered useful and necessary, but in distinction from the meditative mainstream their ultimate aim was insight. For the Buddha it was vitally important that the meditative adept should apply his concentrative state to the practice of mindfulness (Sn 1070: ''satima''; Sn 1111: ''ajjhattañ ca bahiddha ca nabhinandato''; Sn 1113: ''ajjhattañ ca bahiddha ca natthi ti passato''), and work towards the attainment of insight. According to this view meditation alone, the goal of the meditative mainstream would have been harshly criticized in the earliest Buddhism."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=105}}}} Later on, "liberating insight" came to be regarded as equally liberating.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} This "liberating insight" came to be exemplified by ''prajna'', or the insight in the "four truths,"{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} but also by other elements of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this growing importance of "liberating insight" was a response to other religious groups in India, which held that a liberating insight was indispensable for ''[[moksha]]'', liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxii, xxxiii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}{{refn|group=note|Tillmann Vetter: "Very likely the cause was the growing influence of a non-Buddhist spiritual environment·which claimed that one can be released only by some truth or higher knowledge. In addition the alternative (and perhaps sometimes competing) method of discriminating insight (fully established after the introduction of the four noble truths) seemed to conform so well to this claim."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiii}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Bronkhorst, this happened under influence of the "mainstream of meditation," that is, Vedic-Brahmanical oriented groups, which believed that the cessation of action could not be liberating, since action can never be fully stopped. Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight "varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}}} This change is reflected in the canon, where, according to Bronkhorst,
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

According to Vetter and Bonkhorst, the ideas on what exactly constituted this "liberating insight" was not fixed but developed over time.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Bronkhorst, in [[Presectarian Buddhism|earliest Buddhism]] the four truths did not serve as a description of "liberating insight".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Initially the term ''prajna'' served to denote this "liberating insight." Later on, ''prajna'' was replaced in the suttas by the "four truths."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} This happened in those texts where practicing the four jhanas preceded the attainment of "liberating insight," and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in "liberating insight."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} This "liberating insight" came to be defined as "insight into the four truths," which is presented as the "liberating insight" which constituted the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], or "enlightenment" of the Buddha. When he understood these truths he was "enlightened" and liberated,{{refn|group=note|"Enlightenment" is a typical western term, which bears its own, specific western connotations, meanings and interpretations.{{sfn|Cohen|2006}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}}} as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26:42: "his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=268}}

Bronkhorst points to an inconsistency, noting that the four truths refer here to the eightfold path as the means to gain liberation, while the attainment of insight into the four truths is portrayed as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} According to Bronkhorst, this is an inconsistency which reveals a change which took place over time in the composition of the sutras.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42-43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102-103}}

According to Schmithausen, the four truths were superseded by ''[[pratityasamutpada]]'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the [[Anatta|non-existence of a substantial self or person]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}}. Schmithausen further states that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon:
{{quote|"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140-142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

In contrast, Thanissaro Bikkhu presents the view that the four truths, [[pratityasamutpada]] and anatta are inextricably intertwined &lt;ref&gt;Wings to Awakening Part 3, https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part3.html#part3-h-1&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Acquiring the ''dhamma-eye'' and destroying the ''āsavās''===
In their symbolic function, the sutras present the insight into the four truths as the culmination of the Buddh's path to awakening. In the ''Vinayapitaka'' and the ''Sutta-pitaka'' they have the same symbolic function, in a reenactment by his listeners of the Buddha's awakening by attaining the ''dhamma-eye''. In contrast, here this insight serves as the starting point to path-entry for his audience.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=126, 132, 143}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2000|p=79, 80}} These sutras present a repeated sequence of events:{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132-134}}
# ''Annupubbikathā'' ("graduated talk"), in which the Buddha explains the four truths; this talk frees the listener from the hindrances;
# This talk opens the ''dhammacakkhu'' ("dhamma eye"), and knowledge arises: "all that has the nature of arising has the nature of ending";{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132}}{{refn|group=note|In effect to the exposition of the four truths, as presented in the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', the "dustless, stainless Dhamma eye" arose to Kondañña, stating: "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/&gt;}}
# The request to become a member of the Buddhist order;
# A second talk by the Buddha, which destroys the ''āsavās'', impurities;
# The statement that "there are now ''x arahats'' in the world."

Yet, in other sutras, where the four truths have a propositional function, the comprehension of the four truths destroys the corruptions.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=146}} They do so in combination with the practice of the ''jhanas'' and the attainment of the divine eye, with which past lives and the working of rebirth are being seen.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=146-147}}

According to Anderson, following Schmithausen and Bronkhorst, these two presentations give two different models of the path to liberation, reflecting their function as a symbol and as a proposition.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=149}} Most likely, the four truths were first associated with the culmination of the path in the destruction of the ''āsavās'', where they substituted the unspecified "liberating insight"; as the canon developed, they became more logically associated with the beginning of the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=149}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2000|p=79, 80}}

===Popularisation in the west===
According to Anderson there is a strong tendency within scholarship to present the four truths as the most essential teaching of Buddhism.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}} According to Anderson, the four truths have been simplified and popularized in western writings, due to "the colonial project of gaining control over Buddhism."{{sfn|Crosby|2013}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=197}} According to Crosby, the Buddhist teachings are reduced to a "simple, single rationalized account," which has parallels in the reinterpretation of the Buddha in western literature.{{sfn|Crosby|2013}}

The presentation of the four truths as one of the most important teachings of the Buddha "has been [done] to reduce the four noble truths to a teaching that is accessible, pliable, and therefore readily appropriated by non-Buddhists."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=197}} There is a great variety of teachings in the Buddhist literature, which may be bewildering for those who are unaware of this variety.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}} The four truths are easily accessible in this regard, and are "readily [understood] by those outside the Buddhist traditions."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196-197}} For example Walpola Rahula's ''What the Buddha Taught'', a widely used introductory text for non-Buddhists, uses the four truths as a framework to present an overview of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=197}}

According to Harris, the British in the 19th century crafted new representations of Buddhism and the Buddha.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}} 19th century missionaries studied Buddhism, to be more effective in their missionary efforts.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=120}} The Buddha was de-mystified, and reduced from a "superhuman" to a "compassionate, heroic human," serving "western historical method and the missionary agenda of situating the Buddha firmly below the divine."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}} The four truths were discovered by the British by reading the Buddhist texts, and were not immediately granted the central position they later received.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}}

The writings of British missionaries show a growing emphasis on the four truths as being central to Buddhism, with somewhat different presentations of them.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=72-73}}{{refn|group=note| Whereas Gogerly wrote in 1861 "That sorrow is connected with existence in all its forms [and] [t]hat its continuance results from a continued desire of existence," Spencer Hardy wrote in 1866 that "there is sorrow connected with every mode of existence; that the cause of sorrow is desire."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=72-73}} Childers, drawing on Gogerly and Hardy, writes that "existence is suffering; human passion (''tanhã'' - desire) is the cause of continued existence."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=120}}}} This colonial project had a strong influence on some strands of Buddhism, culminating in socalled [[Protestant Buddhism]], which incorporated several essentially Protestant attitudes regarding religion, such as the emphasis on written texts.{{sfn|Gombrich|Obeyesekere|1988}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|See David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/06/24/protestant-buddhism/ ''Protestant Buddhism''], [https://vividness.live/2011/06/28/a-new-world-religion/ ''A new World Religion''] and [https://vividness.live/2011/06/24/problems-with-scripture/ ''Problems with scripture''].}} According to Gimello, Rahula's book is an example of this Protestant Budhism, and "was created in an accommodating response to western expectations, and in nearly diametrical opposition to Buddhism as it had actually been practised in traditional Theravada."{{refn|group=note|Gimello (2004), as quoted in Taylor (2007).{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=361}}}}

[[Hendrik Kern]] proposed in 1882 that the model of the four truths may be an analogy with classical Indian medicine, in which the four truths function as a medical diagnosis, and the Buddha is presented as a physician.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}{{refn|group=note|Kern's model:{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 909-911}}{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=52}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=42}}
# ''The truth of dukkha:'' identifying the illness and the nature of the illness (the [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]])
# ''The truth of origin:''  identifying the [[Cause (medicine)|causes of the illness]]
# ''The truth of cessation:'' identifying a cure for the illness (the [[prognosis]])
# ''The truth of the path:'' recommending a treatment for the illness that can bring about a cure (the [[Medical prescription|prescription]])}} Kern's analogy became rather popular,{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}{{refn|group=note|See,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 909-911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lopez|2001|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} but "there is not sufficient historical evidence to conclude that the Buddha deliberately drew upon a clearly defined medical model for his fourfold analysis of human pain."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}

According to Anderson, those scholars who did not place the four truths at the center of Buddhism, either "located the four truths in a fuller reading of the Theravada canon and the larger context of South Asian literature," or "located the teaching within an experience of Buddhism as practiced in a contemporary setting."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=198}} According to Anderson, "these autors suggest a more complex reading of the four noble truths than those who locate the teaching as the key to or as a crucial element within the grand scheme of Buddhism."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=198}}

==Appearance within the discourses==
The developing Buddhist tradition inserted the four truths, using various formulations, at various sutras.{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} They are being used both as a symbol of all dhammas and the Buddha's awakening, and as a set of propositions which function within a matrix of teachings.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=86}} According to Anderson, there is no single way to understand the teachings; one teaching may be used to explain another teaching, and vice versa. The teachings form a network, which should be apprehended as such to understand how the various teachings intersect with each other.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=86-87}}

===Symbolic function===

====''Mahasaccaka Sutta''====
The ''Mahasaccaka Sutta'' ("The Greater Discourse to Saccaka", Majjhima Nikaya 36) gives one of several versions of the Buddha's way to liberation.{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26, "The Noble Search," also gives an account, which is markedly different, omitting the ascetic practices and the four truths.}} He attains the three knowledges, namely knowledge of his former lifes, knowledge of death and rebirth, and knowledge of the destruction of the taints,{{refn|group=note|Which keep one trapped in ''samsara''.}} the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995}} After going through the four dhyanas, and gaining the first two knowledges, the story proceeds:
{{quote|I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants [suffering ... origin ... cessation ... path] [intoxicants (''asava'') ... origin ... cessation ... path] My mind was liberated [...] the knowledge arose that it was liberated.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102-103}}}}

Bronkhorst dismisses the first two knowledges as later additions, and proceeds to notice that the recognition of the intoxicants is modelled on the four truths. According to Bronkhorst, those are added the bridge the original sequence of "I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants. My mind was liberated", which was interrupted by the addition of the four truths. Bronkhorst points out that those do not fit here, since the four truths culminate in the knowledge of the path to be followed, while the Buddha himself is already liberated at that point.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=103-104}}

====''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta''====
[[File:Gandharan - Expounding the Law - Walters 2551.jpg|right|thumb|A relief depicting the first discourse of the Buddha, from the 2nd century (Kushan).&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21971 Expounding the Law], [[The Walters Art Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum. The Buddha's hand can be seen at right.]]

According to the Buddhist tradition, the first talk of [[Gautama Buddha]] after he attained [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] is recorded in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' ("Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma", Samyutta Nikaya 56.11). The ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' provides details on three stages in the understanding of each truth, for a total of twelve insights. The three stages for understanding each truth are:{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle loc. 3935-3939}}{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|pp=99-100}}{{sfn|Ajahn Sumedho|2002|loc=p. 9}}{{sfn|Moffitt|2002|loc=Kindle loc. 225-226}}{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 303-306}}
# ''sacca-ñāṇa'' - knowing the nature of the truth (e.g., acknowledgement, view, reflection)
# ''kicca-ñāṇa'' - knowing what needs to be done in connection with that truth (e.g., practice; motivation; directly experiencing)
# ''kata-ñāṇa'' - accomplishing what needs to be done (e.g., result, full understanding, knowing)

These three stages of understanding are emphasized particularly in the Theravada tradition, but they are also recognized by some contemporary Mahayana teachers.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 303-306}}{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hahn|1999|pp=28-46}}

According to Cousins, many scholars are of the view that "this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date."{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}} According to Stephen Batchelor, the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' contains incongruities, and states that
{{quote|The First Discourse cannot be treated as a verbatim transcript of what the Buddha taught in the Deer Park, but as a document that has evolved over an unspecified period of time until it reached the form in which it is found today in the canons of the different Buddhist schools.{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=91}}}}

According to Bronkhorst this "first sermon" is recorded in several sutras, with important variations.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}} In the Vinaya texts, and in the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' which was influenced by the Vinaya texts, the four truths are included, and Kondañña is enlightened{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=69}} when the "vision of Dhamma"{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=1846}} arises in him: "whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."{{refn|group=note|Translation Bhikkhu Bodhi (2000), ''Samyutta Nikaya'', SN 56.11, p.1846. See also Anderson (2001), ''Pain and its Ending'', p.69.}} Yet, in the ''Ariyapariyesanā Sutta'' ("The Noble Search", Majjhima Nikaya 26) the four truths are not included,{{refn|group=note|MN 26.17 merely says "[']This will serve for the striving of a clansman intent on striving.' And I sat down there thinking: 'This will serve for striving.'{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=259}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi Majjhima Nikaya 36 then continuous with the extreme ascetic practices, which are omitted in MN 26.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=1216, note 403}} In verse 18, the Buddha has attained Nirvana, being secured from bondage by birth, ageing, sickness and death, referring to the truths of dependent origination and "the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=259-260}}}} and the Buddha gives the five ascetics personal instructions in turn, two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food. The versions of the "first sermon" which include the four truths, such as the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', omit this instruction, showing that
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the subsequent destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, this indicates that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which originally was thought to be sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}} Anderson, following Norman, also thinks that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=68}}{{refn|group=note|According to Cousins, Anderson misunderstands Norman in this respect, but does "not think that this misunderstanding of Norman's position critically affects Anderson's thesis. Even if these arguments do not prove that the four truths are definitely a later insertion in the Dhammacakkapavattana-sutta, it is certainly possible to take the position that the sutta itself is relatively late."{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, the "twelve insights" are probably also a later addition, born out of unease with the substitution of the general term "prajna" for the more specific "four truths".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=106}}

====''Maha-parinibbana Sutta''====
According to the Buddhist tradition, the ''[[Maha-parinibbana Sutta]]'' (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16) was given near the end of the Buddha's life. This sutta "gives a good general idea of the Buddha's Teaching:"&lt;ref group=web name="ati_Maha-parinibbana_Sutta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html ''Maha-parinibbana Sutta: Last Days of the Buddha'', translated by Sister Vajira &amp; Francis Story]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Bhikkhus, it is through not realizing, through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you. What are these four? They are the noble truth of suffering; the noble truth of the origin of suffering; the noble truth of the cessation of suffering; and the noble truth of the way to the cessation of suffering. But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming, and there is no fresh becoming."

Thus it was said by the Blessed One. And the Happy One, the Master, further said:
:Through not seeing the Four Noble Truths,
:Long was the weary path from birth to birth.
:When these are known, removed is rebirth's cause,
:The root of sorrow plucked; then ends rebirth.}}

===Propositional function===

====''Maha-salayatanika Sutta''====
The ''Maha-salayatanika Sutta'', Majjhima Nikaya 149:3 plus 149:9, give an alternative presentation of the four truths:
{{quote|When one abides inflamed by lust, fettered, infatuated, contemplating gratification, [...] [o]ne's bodily and mental troubles increase, one's bodily and mental torments increase, one's bodily and mental fevers increase, and one experiences bodily and mental suffering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...when one does not know and see as it actually is [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition, then one is inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms, for eye-consciousness, for eye-contact, for [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition [repeated for the nose, tongue, body, mind].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one abides uninflamed by lust, unfettered, uninfatuated, contemplating danger [...] one's craving [...] is abandoned.

==Emphasis within different traditions==

===Early Indian Buddhism===
The [[Ekavyāvahārika]] sect emphasized the transcendence of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], asserting that he was eternally enlightened and essentially non-physical. According to the Ekavyāvahārika, the words of the Buddha were spoken with one transcendent meaning, and the Four Noble Truths are to be understood simultaneously in one moment of insight.{{sfn|Rockhill |1884|pp=187-188}} According to the [[Mahīśāsaka]] sect, the Four Noble Truths should be meditated upon simultaneously.{{sfn|Potter|2004|p=106}}

===Theravada===
{{See also|Vipassana movement}}

According to Carol Anderson, the four truths have "a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}} The Theravada tradition regards insight in the four truths as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} As Walpola Rahula states, "when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the continuity of [[samsara]] in [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|illusion]] become calm and incapable of producing any more [[Karma in Buddhism|karma-formations]] [...] he is free from [...] the 'thirst' for becoming."&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Walpola Rahula:
* "When wisdom is developed and cultivated according to the Fourth Noble Truth (the next to be taken up), it sees the secret of life, the reality of things as they are. When the secret is discovered, when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the continuity of saṃsāra in illusion become calm and incapable of producing any more karma-formations, because there is no more illusion, no more ‘thirst’ for continuity."&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt; 
* "The remaining two factors, namely Right Thought and Right Understanding go to constitute Wisdom."&lt;ref group=web name="WP_ch5"&gt;Walpola Rahula, [https://sites.google.com/site/rahulawhatthebuddha/the-fourth-noble-truth Chapert 5. ''Magga'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Right Understanding is the understanding of things as they are, and it is the Four Noble Truths that explain things as they really are. Right Understanding therefore is ultimately reduced to the understanding of the Four Noble Truths. This understanding is the highest wisdom which sees the Ultimate Reality."&lt;ref group=web name="WP_ch5"/&gt;}} This liberation can be attained in one single moment, when the four truths are understood together.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} Within the [[Theravada]] tradition, great emphasis is placed upon reading and contemplating ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|The Discourse That Sets Turning the Wheel of Truth]]'', and other suttas, as a means to study the four noble truths and put them into practice.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 275-280}} For example, Ajahn Sumedho states: 
{{quote|The ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', the Buddha's teaching on the Four Noble Truths, has been the main reference that I have used for my practice over the years. It is the teaching we used in our monastery in Thailand. The Theravada school of Buddhism regards this sutta as the quintessence of the teachings of the Buddha. This one sutta contains all that is necessary for understanding the Dhamma and for enlightenment."{{sfn|Ajahn Sumedho| 2002|p=5}}}}

Within the Theravada-tradition, three different stances on ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]'' and the question what happens with the ''Arhat'' after death can be found.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}{{sfn|Hick|1994|p=436}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|[96-97}}{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} ''Nirvana'' refers to the cessation of the defilements and the resulting peace of mind and happiness (''khlesa-nirvana''); to the final dissolution of the five skandhas at the time of death (''skandha-nirvana'' or ''[[parinirvana]]''); and to a transcendental reality which is "known at the moment of awakening."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}{{refn|group=note|Gethin: "(I) it is the extinguishing of the defilements of greed, hatred, and delusion; (2) it is the final condition of the Buddha and arhats after death consequent upon the extinction of the defilements; (3) it is the unconditioned realm known at the moment of awakening.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}}} According to Gethin, "modern Buddhist usage tends to restrict 'nirvāṇa' to the awakening experience and reserve 'parinirvāṇa' for the death experience.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=76}} According to Geisler and Amano, in the "minimal Theravada interpretation", ''nirvana'' is a psychological state, which ends with the dissolution of the body and the total extinction of existence.{{sfn|Hick|1994|p=436}}{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} According to Geisler and Amano, the "orthodox Theravada interpretation" is that nirvana is a transcendent reality with which the self unites.{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} According to Bronkhorst, while "Buddhism preached liberation in this life, i.e. before death,"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|p=96}} there was also a tendency in Buddhism to think of liberation happening after death. According to Bronkhorst, this 
{{quote|...becomes visible in those canonical passages which distinguish between Nirvana - qualified in Sanskrit and pali as 'without a remainder of upadhi/upadi (anupadhisesa/anupadisesa) - and the 'highest and complete enlightenment'(anuttara samyaksambodhi/sammasambodhi). The former occurs at death, the latter in life.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=97}}}}

According to [[Walpola Rahula]], the cessation of ''dukkha'' is ''nirvana'', the ''summum bonum'' of Buddhism, and is attained in this life, not when one dies.&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt; ''Nirvana'' is "perfect freedom, peace, tranquility and happiness,"&lt;ref group=web&gt;Walpola Rahula, [https://sites.google.com/site/rahulawhatthebuddha/the-first-noble-truth ''What the Buddha Taught. Chapter 2. Dukkha'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt; and "Absolute Truth," which simply ''is''.&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'', [https://sites.google.com/site/rahulawhatthebuddha/the-third-noble-truth chapter four: Nirodha]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- **START OF NOTE** --&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Rahula, in ''[[What the Buddha Taught]]'',
{{quote|... if Nirvāṇa is to be expressed and explained in positive terms, we are likely immediately to grasp an idea associated with those terms, which may be quite the contrary. Therefore it is generally expressed in negative terms."&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;{{refn|group=subnote|According to Gombrich this distinction between [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] and cataphatic approaches can be found in all religions.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=150-152}}}}}} Rahula gives an overview of negative statements of ''nirvana,'' whereafter he states:
{{quote|Because Nirvana is thus expressed in negative terms, there are many who have got a wrong notion that it is negative, and expresses self-annihilation. Nirvāṇa is definitely no annihilation of self, because there is no self to annihilate. If at all, it is the annihilation of the illusion of the false idea of self.&lt;br&gt;
It is incorrect to say that Nirvāṇa is negative or positive. The ideas of ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ are relative, and are within the realm of duality. These terms cannot be applied to Nirvāṇa, Absolute Truth, which is beyond duality and relativity [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nirvāṇa is neither cause nor effect. It is beyond cause and effect. Truth is not a result nor an effect. It is not produced like a mystic, spiritual, mental state, such as dhyāna or samādhi. TRUTH IS. NIRVĀṆA IS.&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;}}

Rahula refers to the ''Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta'' (the Majjhima-nikāya 140) for his interpretation of "Nirvāṇa as Absolute Truth," which, according to Rahula, says: 
{{quote|O bhikkhu, that which is unreality (mosadhamma) is false; that which is reality (amosadhamma), Nibbāna, is Truth (Sacca). Therefore, O bhikkhu, a person so endowed is endowed with this Absolute Truth. For, the Absolute Noble Truth (paramaṃ ariyasaccaṃ) is Nibbāna, which is Reality.’&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;}}

While Jayatilleke translates ''amosadhamma'' as "ineffable,"{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2009|p=306}} Thanissaro Bhikkhu gives a somewhat different translation:
{{quote|His release, being founded on truth, does not fluctuate, for whatever is deceptive is false; Unbinding — the undeceptive — is true. Thus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for truth, for this — Unbinding, the undeceptive — is the highest noble truth.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.140.than.html ''Dhatu-vibhanga Sutta: An Analysis of the Properties'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to Rahula, [[Richard Gombrich]] states that:
{{quote|In proclaiming (in block capitals) that 'Truth is', Rahula has for a moment fallen into Upanisadic mode. Since truth can only be a property of propositions, which have subjects and predicates, and nirvana is not a proposition, it makes no sense in English to say that nirvana is truth. The confusion arises, perhaps, because the Sanskrit word satyam and the corresponding Pali word saccam can indeed mean either 'truth' or 'reality'. But in our language this will not work.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=156-157}}}}

Richard Gombrich also states that Rahula's book would more aptly be titled ''What [[Buddhagosa]] Taught''.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=156-157}}  According to David Kalupahana, Buddhagosa was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and introduced "the substantialist as well as essentialist standpoints of the Sarvastavadins and Sautrantikas."{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=208, 210}}}}&lt;!-- **END OF NOTE** --&gt; Jayatilleke also speaks of "the attainment of an ultimate reality."{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2009|p=306}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the "elimination of craving culminates not only in the extinction of sorrow, anguish and distress, but in the unconditioned freedom of nibbana, which is won with the ending of reapeated rebirth."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2011|p=10}}

According to Spiro, most (lay) Theravada Buddhists do not aspire for ''nirvana'' and total extinction, but for a pleasurable rebirth in heaven.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=76-77}} According to Spiro, this presents a "serious conflict" since the Buddhist texts and teaching "describe life as suffering and hold up nirvana as the ''summum bonum.''"{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}} In response to this deviation, "monks and others emphasize that the hope for nirvana is the only legitimate action for Buddhist action."{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}} Nevertheless, according to Spiro most Burmese lay Buddhists do not aspire for the extinction of existence which is ''nirvana''.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}}{{refn|group=note|name="Wallace"}}

According to [[B.R. Ambedkar]], the Indian Buddhist [[Dalit]] leader, the four truths were not part of the original teachings of the Buddha, but a later aggregation, due to Hindu influences.{{sfn|Karunyakara|2002|p=67}} According to Ambedkar, total cessation of suffering is an illusion; yet, the Buddhist Middle Path aims at the reduction of suffering and the maximizing of happiness, balancing both sorrow and happiness.{{sfn|Karunyakara|2002|p=67-68}}

===Mahayana===
The four truths are less prominent in the Mahayana traditions, which emphasize insight into [[Śūnyatā]] and the [[bodhisattva|Bodhisattva path]] as a central elements in their teachings.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179-3180}} If the sutras in general are studied at all, it is through various Mahayana commentaries.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=103}}

According to Makransky the Mahayana Bodhisattva ideal created tensions in the explanation of the four truths.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=345}} In the Mahayana view, a fully enlightened Buddha does not leave ''samsara'', but remains in the world out of compassion for all sentient beings.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} The four truths, which aim at ending ''samsara'', do not provide a doctrinal basis for this view, and had to be reinterpreted.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} In the old view, ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesas]]'' and ''karma'' are the cause of prolonged existence. According to Makransky, "[t]o remove those causes was, at physical death, to extinguish one's conditioned existence, hence to end forever one's participation in the world (Third Truth)."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} According to Makransky, the question of how a liberated being can still be "pervasively operative in this world" has been "a seminal source of ongoing doctrinal tension over Buddhahood throughout the history of the Mahayana in India and Tibet."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346-347}}

====Tibetan Buddhism====
[[Atisha]], in his ''[[Bodhipathapradīpa]]'' ("A Lamp for the Path to Awakening"), which forms the basis for the [[Lamrim]] tradition, discerns three levels of motivation for Buddhist practitioners.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} At the beginning level of motivation, one strives toward a better life in ''samsara''.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} At the intermediate level, one strives to a liberation from existence in samsara and the end of all suffering.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17, 66-67}} At the highest level of motivation, one strives after the liberation  of all living beings.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} In his commentary on the text, Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche explains that the four truths are to be meditated upon as a means of practice for the intermediate level.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=66-67}}

According to [[Tashi Tsering (Jamyang Buddhist Centre)|Geshe Tashi Tsering]], within [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the four noble truths are studied as part of the Bodhisattva path. They are explained in Mahayana commentaries such as the ''[[Abhisamayalamkara]]'', a summary of and commentary on the [[Prajna Paramitra]] sutras, where they form part of the lower [[Hinayana]] teachings. The truth of the path (the fourth truth) is traditionally presented according to a progressive formula of [[Five Paths|five paths]], rather than as the eightfold path presented in Theravada.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 2187-2190}} According to Tsering, the study of the four truths is combined with the study of the [[sixteen characteristics]] of the four noble truths.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 741-743}}

Some contemporary Tibetan Buddhist teachers have provided commentary on the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' and the noble eightfold path when presenting the dharma to Western students.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 241}}{{sfn|Ringu Tulku|2005|pp=36-54}}{{sfn|Lama Surya Das|1997}}

====Nichiren Buddhism====
[[Nichiren Buddhism]] is based on the teaching of the Japanese priest and teacher [[Nichiren]], who believed that the [[Lotus Sūtra]] contained the essence of all of Gautama Buddha's teachings.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nichiren-shu.org.uk/septoctnewsletter.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031180446/http://www.nichiren-shu.org.uk/septoctnewsletter.html |archive-date=31 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third chapter of the Lotus Sutra states that the Four Noble Truths was the early teaching of the Buddha, while the Dharma of the Lotus is the "most wonderful, unsurpassed great Dharma."&lt;ref group=web &gt;[http://www.sokahumanism.com/nichiren-buddhism/Four_Noble_Truths_and_the_Lotus_Sutra.html Quote from Watson (1993), The Lotus Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings on the four noble truths are a provisional teaching, which Shakyamuni Buddha taught according to the people’s capacity, while the Lotus Sutra is a direct statement of Shakyamuni’s own enlightenment.&lt;ref group=web name=nletter2&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=1039&amp;m=3&amp;q=four%20noble%20truths%20for%20voice-hearers Four Noble truths for Voice Hearers], see "Background" section&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Buddhism===
For many western Buddhists, the rebirth doctrine in the Four Noble Truths teaching is a problematic notion.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}{{sfn|Hayes|2013|p=172}}{{sfn|Lamb|2001|p=258}}&lt;ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_46.html ''Does Rebirth Make Sense?'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also:&lt;br&gt;* [[James Ishmael Ford|James Ford]], [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2015/08/the-karma-and-rebirth-debate-within-contemporary-western-buddhism-some-links-to-follow.html ''The Karma and Rebirth Debate Within Contemporary Western Buddhism: Some Links to Follow'']&lt;br&gt;* Manon Welles, [http://aristocratsofthesoul.com/secular-buddhism-vs-traditional-buddhism-six-key-differences/ ''Secular Buddhism vs. Traditional Buddhism: 6 Key Differences'']&lt;br&gt;* Alan Peta, [http://www.alanpeto.com/buddhism/understanding-reincarnation-rebirth/ ''Reincarnation and Buddhism: Here We Go Again'']&lt;br&gt;* David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/06/16/the-making-of-buddhist-modernism/ ''The Making of Buddhist Modernism'']}} According to Lamb, "Certain forms of modern western Buddhism [...] see it as purely mythical and thus a dispensable notion."{{sfn|Lamb|2001|p=258}} According to Coleman, the focus of most vipassana students in the west "is mainly on meditation practice and a kind of down-to-earth psychological wisdom."{{sfn|Coleman|2002|p=110}}{{refn|group=note|According to Coleman, the goal in Theravada Buddhism "is to uproot the desires and defilements in order to attain nibbana (nirvana in Sanskrit) and win liberation from the otherwise endless round of death and rebirth. But few Western Vipassana teachers pay much attention to the more metaphysical aspects of such concepts as rebirth and nibbana, and of course very few of their students are celibate monks. Their focus is mainly on meditation practice and a kind of down-to-earth psychological wisdom. "As a result," one respected Vipassana teacher writes, "many more Americans of European descent refer to themselves as Vipassana students rather than as students of Theravada Buddhism."{{sfn|Coleman|2002|p=110}}}} According to [[Damien Keown]], westerners find "the ideas of [[karma]] and rebirth puzzling."{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}} According to Gowans, many Western followers and people interested in exploring Buddhism are skeptical and object to the belief in karma and rebirth foundational to the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}}{{refn|group=note|Gowans groups the objections into three categories. The first objection can be called "consistency objection", which asks if "there is no self (atman, soul), then what is reborn and how does karma work?".

The third objection can be called "morality objection", which asks "why presume that an infant born with an illness, is because of karma in previous life" as seems implied by ''Majjhima Nikāya'' section 3.204 for example. Gowans provides a summary of prevaling answers, clarifications and explanations proffered by practicing Buddhists.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}}}} According to Konik,
{{quote|Since the fundamental problems underlying early Indian Buddhism and contemporary western Buddhism are not the same, the validity of applying the set of solutions developed by the first to the situation of the second becomes a question of great importance. Simply putting an end to rebirth would not necessarily strike the western Buddhist as the ultimate answer, as it certainly was for early Indian Buddhists.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}

According to Keown, it is possible to reinterpret the Buddhist doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths, since the final goal and the answer to the problem of suffering is [[nirvana]], and not rebirth.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}} Some Western interpreters have proposed what is sometimes referred to as "naturalized Buddhism". It is devoid of rebirth, karma, nirvana, realms of existence, and other concepts of Buddhism, with doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths reformulated and restated in modernistic terms.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 91–94}}{{sfn|Prothero|1996|p=128}}{{refn|group=note|Prothereo describes how Theosophist [[Henry Steel Olcott]] (1832-1907) reinterpreted Buddhism: "In addition to a restatement of the Four Noble Truths and the Five Precepts for lay Buddhists, the fourteen propositions included: an affirmation of religious tolerance and of the evolution of the universe, a rejection of supernaturalism, heaven or hell, and superstition, and an emphasis on education and the use of reason."{{sfn|Prothero|1996|p=128}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Owen Flanagan, the proportion of people in North America that believe in heaven is about the same as the proportion of East and Southeast Asia who believe in rebirth.

Lopez, Buddhist movements in the West have reconstructed a "Scientific Buddha" and a "modern Buddhism" unknown in Asia, "one that may never have existed there before the late  19th-century".{{sfn|Lopez|2012|p=39-43, 57–60, 74-76, 122-124}}}} This "deflated secular Buddhism" stresses compassion, impermanence, causality, selfless persons, no Boddhisattvas, no nirvana, no rebirth, and a naturalists approach to well-being of oneself and others.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=39–42}}

According to Melford Spiro, this approach undermines the Four Noble Truths, for it does not address the existential question for the Buddhist as to "why live? why not commit suicide, hasten the end of ''dukkha'' in current life by ending life". In traditional Buddhism, rebirth continues the ''dukkha'' and the path to cessation of ''dukkha'' isn't suicide, but the fourth reality of the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=39–42}} The "naturalized Buddhism", according to Gowans, is a radical revision to traditional Buddhist thought and practice, and it attacks the structure behind the hopes, needs and rationalization of the realities of human life to traditional Buddhists in East, Southeast and South Asia.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 91–94}} According to Keown, it may not be necessary to believe in some of the core Buddhist doctrines to be a Buddhist, but the rebirth, karma, [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|realms of existence]] and cyclic universe doctrines underpin the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}}

Traditional Buddhist scholars disagree with these modernist Western interpretations. Bhikkhu Bodhi, for example, states that rebirth is an integral part of the Buddhist teachings as found in the sutras, despite the problems that "modernist interpreters of Buddhism" seem to have with it.&lt;ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: "Newcomers to Buddhism are usually impressed by the clarity, directness, and earthy practicality of the Dhamma as embodied in such basic teachings as the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the threefold training. These teachings, as clear as day-light, are accessible to any serious seeker looking for a way beyond suffering. When, however, these seekers encounter the doctrine of rebirth, they often balk, convinced it just doesn't make sense. At this point, they suspect that the teaching has swerved off course, tumbling from the grand highway of reason into wistfulness and speculation. Even modernist interpreters of Buddhism seem to have trouble taking the rebirth teaching seriously. Some dismiss it as just a piece of cultural baggage, "ancient Indian metaphysics," that the Buddha retained in deference to the world view of his age. Others interpret it as a metaphor for the change of mental states, with the realms of rebirth seen as symbols for psychological archetypes. A few critics even question the authenticity of the texts on rebirth, arguing that they must be interpolations.&lt;br&gt;A quick glance at the Pali suttas would show that none of these claims has much substance. The teaching of rebirth crops up almost everywhere in the Canon, and is so closely bound to a host of other doctrines that to remove it would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters. Moreover, when the suttas speak about rebirth into the five realms — the hells, the animal world, the spirit realm, the human world, and the heavens — they never hint that these terms are meant symbolically. To the contrary, they even say that rebirth occurs "with the breakup of the body, after death," which clearly implies they intend the idea of rebirth to be taken quite literally."&lt;ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"/&gt;}} [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], as another example, rejects the "modern argument" that "one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth." He states, "rebirth has always been a central teaching in the Buddhist tradition."&lt;ref group=web name="TB_Rebirth"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/truth_of_rebirth.html ''The Truth of Rebirth. And Why it Matters for Buddhist Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Thanissaro Bhikkhu: "A second modern argument against accepting the canonical accounts of what's known in awakening — and in particular, the knowledge of rebirth achieved in awakening — is that one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth. After all, all the factors leading to suffering are all immediately present to awareness, so there should be no need, when trying to abandon them, to accept any premises about where they may or may not lead in the future.&lt;br&gt;This objection, however, ignores the role of appropriate attention on the path. As we noted above, one of its roles is to examine and abandon the assumptions that underlie one's views on the metaphysics of personal identity. Unless you're willing to step back from your own views — such as those concerning what a person is, and why that makes rebirth impossible — and subject them to this sort of examination, there's something lacking in your path. You'll remain entangled in the questions of inappropriate attention, which will prevent you from actually identifying and abandoning the causes of suffering and achieving the full results of the practice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, the terms of appropriate attention — the four noble truths — are not concerned simply with events arising and passing away in the present moment. They also focus on the causal connections among those events, connections that occur both in the immediate present and over time. If you limit your focus solely to connections in the present while ignoring those over time, you can't fully comprehend the ways in which craving causes suffering: not only by latching on to the four kinds of nutriment, but also giving rise to the four kinds of nutriment as well.&lt;ref group=web name="TB_Rebirth"/&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|According to Konik: {{quote|No doubt, according to the early Indian Buddhist tradition, the Buddha's great discovery, as condensed in his experience of nirvana, involved the remembrance of his many former existences, presupposing as fact the reality of a never-ending process of rebirth as a source of deep anxiety, and an acceptance of the Buddha's overcoming of that fate as ultimate liberation.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}}}

According to Owen Flanagan, the Dalai Lama states that "Buddhists believe in rebirth" and that this belief has been common among his followers. However, the Dalai Lama's belief, adds Flanagan, is more sophisticated than ordinary Buddhists, because it is not the same as [[reincarnation]]--rebirth in Buddhism is envisioned as happening without the assumption of an "atman, self, soul", but rather through a "consciousness conceived along the [[anatta|anatman]] lines".{{sfn|Flanagan|2014|pp=233-234 with note 1}}{{refn|group=note|The Dalai Lama himself is regarded to be an incarnation of the thirteen previous Dalai Lamas, who are all manifestations of [[Avalokitasvara]].{{sfn|Chitkara|1998|p=39}}}} The doctrine of rebirth is considered mandatory in Tibetan Buddhism, and across many Buddhist sects.{{sfn|Flanagan|2014|pp=234-235 with note 5}}

According to Christopher Gowans, for "most ordinary Buddhists, today as well as in the past, their basic moral orientation is governed by belief in karma and rebirth".{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}} Buddhist morality hinges on the hope of well being in this lifetime or in future rebirths, with nirvana (enlightenment) a project for a future lifetime. A denial of karma and rebirth undermines their history, moral orientation and religious foundations.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}} According to Keown, most Buddhists in Asia do accept these traditional teachings, and seek better rebirth.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}}{{refn|group=note|The vast majority of Buddhist lay people, states Kevin Trainor, have historically pursued Buddhist rituals and practices motivated with rebirth into Deva realm.{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} Fowler and others concur with Trainor, stating that better rebirth, not nirvana, has been the primary focus of a vast majority of lay Buddhists. This they attempt through merit accumulation and good ''kamma''.{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=65}}{{refn|group=note|Merv Foweler: "For a vast majority of Buddhists in Theravadin countries, however, the order of monks is seen by lay Buddhists as a means of gaining the most merit in the hope of accumulating good karma for a better rebirth."{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=65}}}}{{sfn|Gowans|2004|p=169}}}}

===Navayana Buddhism===
The [[Navayana]], a modernistic interpretation of Buddhism by the Indian leader [[B. R. Ambedkar]],&lt;ref name=blackburn1&gt;Anne M. Blackburn (1993), [http://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/8805/2712 Religion, Kinship and Buddhism: Ambedkar's Vision of a Moral Community], The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 16 (1), page 11&lt;/ref&gt; rejected much of traditional Buddhism, including the Four Noble Truths, karma and rebirth, thus turning his new religion into a Marxist-oriented vehicle for [[class struggle]] and social action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Zelliot|editor=Knut A.

Gone, for instance, were the doctrines of karma and rebirth, the traditional emphasis on renunciation of the world, the practice of meditation, and the experience of enlightenment. Gone too were any teachings that implied the existence of a trans-empirical realm (...). Most jarring, perhaps, especially among more traditional Buddhists, was the absence of the Four Noble Truths, which Ambedkar regarded as the invention of wrong-headed monks".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Four Treasures of the Study''', '''Four Jewels of the Study''' or '''Four Friends of the Study''' is an expression used to denote the [[ink brush|brush]], [[inkstick|ink]], [[Xuan paper|paper]] and [[ink stone]] used in [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] and other [[East Asia]]n calligraphic traditions.  The name appears to originate in the time of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420–589 AD).&lt;ref name="ctoday"&gt;Chinesetoday.com. "[http://www.chinesetoday.com/news/show/id/9689 Chinesetoday.com]." ''趣談「文房四寶」.'' Retrieved on 2010-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four Treasures==
Chinese culture is very fond of [[Chengyu|four word couplets]], and the '''Four Treasures''' is another example: "文房四寶: 筆、墨、紙、硯," (Pinyin: ''wén fáng sì bǎo: bǐ, mò, zhǐ, yàn'') "''The four jewels of the study: Brush, Ink, Paper, Inkstone.''"&lt;ref name="ctoday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="big5x"&gt;Big5.xinhuanet.com. "[http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/www.godpp.gov.cn/yxzp_/2007-10/23/content_11468094.htm Big5.xinhuanet.com]." ''走近文房四寶.'' Retrieved on 2010-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the couplet mentioned, each of the '''Treasures''' is referred to by a single [[epithet]]; however, each of these are usually known by a compound name (''i.e.'' The Brush: 毛筆, literally "''hair brush/pen''). The individual treasures have a "treasured" form, each being produced in certain areas of China as a speciality for those scholars who would use them.These are called the 4 SPECIAL Treasures of the Study.

===Brush===
{{Main|Ink brush}}

[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - calligraphy brush with dragon design.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A highly decorative badger hair brush dating to the [[Ming Dynasty]].]] The brush ({{zh|t=毛筆|s=毛笔|p=máo bǐ}}) is the oldest '''Four Treasures''' member, with archaeological evidence dating to [[Zhou dynasty]] (1045 BC–256 BC) illustrations on ancient bones. The oldest brush so far dates to [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC–220 AD). Brushes are generally made from animal hair, or —in certain situations—the first hair taken from a baby's head (said to bring good luck in the [[Imperial examinations]]). Brush handles are commonly constructed from [[bamboo]], but special brushes may have handles of [[sandalwood]], [[jade]], carved bone/ivory, or other precious materials.

Modern brushes are primarily white goat hair (羊毫), black rabbit hair (紫毫), yellow weasel hair (黄鼠毫/狼毫), or a combination mix. Ancient brushes, and some of the more valuable ones available on the market may be made with the hair of any number of different types of animals. Each type of hair has a specific ink capacity, giving distinct brush strokes. Different brushes are used for different styles of calligraphy and writing.

Brushes are classed as soft (軟毫), mixed (兼毫) or hard (硬毫).  Hair is laboriously sorted by softness, hardness, thickness, &amp; length, then bundled for specific uses. The most famous and highly prized brushes are a mix of yellow weasel, goat and rabbit hair, known as Húbǐ (湖筆); highly prized since the [[Ming dynasty]] (late 14th century) they are currently made in [[Shanlian]] (善琏), a town in the [[Nanxun District]], [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Huzhou]], of [[Zhejiang province]] (浙江).

===Ink===
{{Main|Inkstick}}

[[File:Inkstick.jpg|upright|thumb|An inkstick made in the form of lotus leaves and flowers.]]The Inkstick (Chinese: 墨 pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-mò.ogg|mò|help=no}}'') is an artificial ink developed during the [[Han dynasty]]. These first writing inks were based on naturally occurring minerals like [[graphite]] and [[vermilion]]; earliest inks were probably liquids and not preserved. Modern inksticks are generally made of soots from one of three different sources, including [[lacquer]] [[soot]], [[pine]] soot, and [[oil]] soot. Soots are collected, then mixed with glue. Higher quality inksticks also use powdered spices and herbs, adding to aroma and providing some protection to the ink itself.  The glue, soot, and spice mixture is then pressed into shape and allowed to dry. This process can take 6 weeks, depending on an inkstick's dimensions.

The best ink sticks are fine grained and have a light, slightly ringing sound when tapped. They are often decorated with poems, calligraphy, or [[bas relief]], and painted. These particular articles are highly collectable, and often acquired like stamps. The inksticks in highest regard, known as Huīmò (徽墨), contain [[musk]], [[borneol]] and other precious [[aromatics]] of [[Chinese medicine]]. They are still produced today in [[She County, Anhui|Shexian]] (歙县) in [[Anhui province]] (安徽).

===Paper===
{{Main|Xuan Paper}}

[[File:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright|A detail from ''The Treatise on Calligraphy'' by [[Sun Guoting]] (646–691). Ink on Paper.]]Paper (Chinese: ''traditional'' 紙, ''simplified'' 纸; Pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-zhǐ.ogg|zhǐ|help=no}}'') was first developed in China in the first decade of 100 AD. Previous to its invention, bamboo slips and silks were used for writing material. Several methods of paper production developed over the centuries in China. However, the paper which was considered of highest value was that of the Jingxian (泾县) in Anhui province.

This particular form of paper, known as Xuānzhǐ (宣紙), is soft, fine-textured, moth resistant, has a high tensile strength, and remarkable longevity for such a product – so much so that it has a reputation for lasting "1,000 years". The quality of the paper depends on the processing methods used to produce it. Paper may be unprocessed, half processed or processed. The processing determines how well ink or paint is absorbed into the fibre of the paper, as well as the stiffness of the paper itself. Unprocessed papers are very absorbent and quite malleable, whereas processed papers are far more resistant to absorption and are stiffer.

===Inkstone===
{{Main|Inkstone}}

[[File:Duan Inkstone.JPG|left|thumb|A Duan Inkstone in the shape of a pond.]]The inkstone (Chinese: ''traditional'' 硯 or 硯臺; ''simplified'' 砚 or 砚台; Pinyin: ''{{audio|Zh-yàn.ogg|yàn|help=no}}'' or ''yàn tái'') is used to grind the ink stick into powder. This powder is then mixed with water in a well in the inkstone in order to produce usable ink for calligraphy. The most ideal water for use in ink is slightly salty. Ink was first prepared using a mortar and pestle, but with the advent of inksticks this method slowly vanished. The stone used is generally of a relatively fine whetstone type.

The earliest known inkstones date back to the [[Han dynasty]]. The production of inkstones reached its zenith in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]] with inkstones becoming extremely intricate works of art. The most highly sought-after inkstones originated in four different locations in China. Duanshi stones (端石硯) from Duanxi in [[Guangdong]], She stones (歙硯) from [[She County, Anhui|Shexian]] in [[Anhui]], Taohe stones (洮河硯) from the [[Tao River]] in South [[Gansu]] and Chengni ceramic stones (澄泥硯) which are manufactured by a process which is said to have been developed in [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]].

==Tools of the Scholar==
Classical scholars had more than just the '''Four treasures''' in their studies. The other "Treasures" include the [[brush-holder]] (笔架), brush-hanger (笔挂), paperweights (镇纸), the brush-rinsing pot (笔洗), and the [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] (圖章) and seal-ink (印泥).

For painting, [[Chinese pigment]]s are also used.

'''French maid''' is a strongly modified style of [[domestic worker|servant's]] dress that evolved from typical [[maid|housemaid's]] black-and-white afternoon uniforms of [[France in the long nineteenth century|19th-century France]] (and their later use by stereotypical [[soubrette]] characters in [[burlesque]] dramas and [[bedroom farce]]s). Some styles are conservative while others are revealing. The French maid costume is often used in [[cosplay]], [[sexual roleplay]]ing, and [[Uniform fetishism#French maid uniform|uniform fetishism]]. Depending on design details, some forms can be classified as [[lingerie]].

==Costume details==
Though not strict to historically accurate uniforms, the French maid outfit has an easily recognizable pattern and black-and white theme that remains the template for other forms of the costume.

The typical French maid costume includes:
* A black dress with white trim, with a full skirt at or above knee length.
* White half-apron, usually with ruffle or lace
* A ruffled or lace headpiece
* Long stockings or tights. These can be white or black and vary from design to design.
* High heels 
* [[Feather duster]]
* White or black lace [[garter (stockings)|garter]]

Optional accessories depend on design and context:
* [[Choker]] necklace
* Pearls
* Other cleaning equipment

==Culture==
The outfits are frequently worn to [[costume parties]] (fancy dress), and also used in drama/theater.

{{Generations Sidebar}}

The '''G.I. Generation''' (also known as the '''WWII Generation''' or '''[[The Greatest Generation]]''' in the United States or the '''Federation Generation''' in [[Australia]]) is the demographic cohort following the [[Lost Generation]]. There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1900s as starting birth years and ending birth years in the mid-1920s.

==Definition==

Demographers [[Strauss–Howe generational theory|William Stauss and Neil Howe]] coined the term "G.I. Generation" in their 1991 book ''Generations: The History of America's Future''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FTGY-uoCCCoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=generations#v=onepage&amp;q=generations&amp;f=false |title=Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 |first=William|last=Strauss|first2=Neil|last2=Howe|publisher=Harper Perennial |year=1991|isbn=9780688119126 }} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; and use 1901–1924 as birth years.&lt;ref name = "Howe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=The G.I.

(military)|"G.I."]] of "G.I. Generation" is military terminology referring to "Government Issue" or "General Issue".

McCrindle Research expanded on Howe's work and uses the term ''Federation Generation'' to describe [[Australians|Australian]] members of this cohort, born between 1901–1924, "a time of peace when Australia finally secured nationhood" who came of age during The [[Great Depression]] and WWII and experienced post-war prosperity in midlife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf Generations Defined].

[[Pew Research Center]] defines this cohort as being born from 1901 to 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2016/12/15/americans-name-the-10-most-significant-historic-events-of-their-lifetimes/|title=Americans Name the 10 Most Significant Historic Events of Their Lifetimes|date=15 December 2016|publisher=People Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[The Greatest Generation]]'', which is a term sometimes used to refer to the US members of this cohort, comes from the title of 1998 book by American journalist [[Tom Brokaw]]. In the book, Brokaw profiled American members of this generation who came of age during the Great Depression and went on to fight in [[World War II]], as well as those who contributed to the war effort on the home front. Brokaw wrote that these men and women fought not for fame or recognition, but because it was the "right thing to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rQagD17IFS4C&amp;q=the+greatest+generation&amp;dq=the+greatest+generation&amp;cd=1 |title=The greatest generation - Tom Brokaw - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-16|isbn=9780375502026 |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">The term '''hermit kingdom''' can be used to refer to any country, organization or society which willfully walls itself off, either metaphorically or physically, from the rest of the world - The country of [[North Korea]] is a prime example of a hermit kingdom.

Korea in the age of [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]] was the subject of the first use of the term, in [[William Elliot Griffis]]' 1882 book ''Corea: The Hermit Nation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David H.|title=Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Myoung Chung|title=Korean Government Publications: An Introductory Guide. Lantham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2000.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Korea was frequently described as a hermit kingdom until 1905 when it became a protectorate of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/07/28/104992374.pdf The Obliteration of the Kingdom of Korea] by [[Stephen Bonsal]], ''The New York Times'', July 28, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; The term is still commonplace throughout Korea and it is often used by [[Koreans]] themselves to describe pre-modern Korea. Today, the term is often applied to North Korea in news and social media, and in 2009 it was used by United States former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=World&amp;ArticleID=news/capfeed/world/w022017A.xml{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''history by period''' summarizes significant eras in the [[history of the world]], from the ancient world to the present day.

== Ancient history (60,000 BC – 650 AD) ==
{{main article|Ancient history}}
Ancient history refers to the time period in which scientists have found the earliest remains of human activity, approximately 60,000 BC. It ends with the fall of several significant empires, such as the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the Mediterranean, the [[Han Dynasty]] in China, and the [[Gupta Empire]] in India, collectively around 650 AD.

The [[Bronze Age]] is the time period in which humans around the world began to use [[bronze]] as a major metal in tools. It is generally accepted as starting around 3600 BC and ending with the advent of iron in 1000 BC.

The [[Iron Age]] is often called Antiquity or the Classical Era, but these periods more commonly refer to only one region. It begins around 1000 BC with the widespread use of [[iron]] in tools. It is often accepted to end at approximately 650 AD, with the fall of the aforementioned major civilizations.

Note that BC and BCE refer to the same time period. BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era, and BC for Before Christ. AD is Anno Domini, and CE is Common Era. This is done in order to standardize time periods across the world ([[ISO 8601]]).
*[[Stone Age]] Ended between 6,000 and 2,000 BC (depending on the area; until 1600s European contact in Australia)
*[[History of Mesopotamia]] 6000 BC - 1100 BC
*[[Indus Valley Civilization]] 3300 BC - 1300 BC
*[[Old Kingdom]] ([[Egypt]], 3000 BC - 2000 BC)
*[[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (Egypt, 2000 BC - 1300 BC)
*[[Vedic period]] [[History of India|India]], (1750 - 500 BC)
*[[New Kingdom]] (Egypt, 1300 BC - 700 BC)
*[[Shang Dynasty]] (China 1800 BC - 1200 BC)
*[[Classical antiquity|Mediterranean Antiquity]]
*[[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] Dynasty (China, 1200 BC–500 BC)
*[[Ancient Greece]], (circa 1000 BC–323 BC) (see [[Timeline of Ancient Greece]])
*[[Mahajanapadas]], (India 600 - 300 BC)
*[[Timeline of Roman history|Ancient Rome]] 753 BC - 476 AD)
*[[Classical India]] (230 BC - 500 AD)
*[[Six Dynasties]] (China, 220 AD–581 AD)
**[[Three Kingdoms]] (China, 220–280)
*[[Late Antiquity]] (Europe, circa 300 AD - circa 476 AD)

== Postclassical Era (500 – 1500) ==
{{main article|Postclassical Era}}
The Postclassical Era, also referred to as the Medieval period or, for [[Europe]], the [[Middle Ages]], begins around 500 CE after the fall of major civilizations, covering the advent of [[Islam]]. The period ends around 1450–1500, with events like the rise of [[printing press|moveable-type printing]] in Europe, the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]], and the Ottoman Empire's [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]].

*[[Middle Ages]] (Europe, 5th century - 15th century)
**[[Early Middle Ages]] (Europe, 5th century - 11th century)
**[[High Middle Ages]] (Europe, 11th century - 14th century)
**[[Late Middle Ages]] (Europe, 14th century  - 15th century)
*[[Islamic Golden Age]] (Middle East, 750 – 1300)
*[[Viking Age]] ([[Scandinavia]], Europe, 793 - 1066)
*[[Nara period]] (Japan, 709 - 795)
*[[Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] (China, 907 - 960)
*[[Sengoku period]] (Japan, 1478–1605)
*[[Middle kingdoms of India]], (500 - 1206)

== Modern history (1500 – present) ==
{{main article|Modern history}}
{{see also|Great Divergence}}
The Modern Period covers human history from the creation of a more global network (i.e. the discovery of the Americas by Europeans) to present day.

=== Early Modern Period (1500 – 1750) ===
{{main article|Early modern period}}
The Early Modern Period is the first third of the Modern Period and is often used with the parent categorization. It starts with the invention of the printing press, covering the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 and, more generally, the establishment of a more global network. It ends in 1750 with the beginning of British industrialization.

*The [[Renaissance]] (Europe, 14th century - 17th century)
*[[Age of Discovery]] (or Exploration) (Europe, 16th century - 18th century)
*[[Age of Sail]] - referring to commercial and military impact of sailing technology, usually dated as 1571—1862.
*[[Elizabethan period]] (England, 1558–1603)
*The [[Protestant Reformation]] (Europe, 16th century)
*[[The Age of Enlightenment]] (Europe, 18th century)
=== Mid Modern Period (1750 – 1945) ===
{{main article|Long nineteenth century|Age of Revolution|Industrial Revolution}}
The Age of Revolution is a less commonly used period, but appropriately covers the time between the early modern and contemporary. It begins around 1750 with European industrialization and is marked by several political revolutions. It ends around 1945, with the relative advancement of industrialization in Europe, the United States, Japan, and Russia, and the beginning of [[World War II]].

*[[Industrial Revolution]] (Europe, United States, elsewhere 18th and 19th centuries)
*[[Napoleonic Era]], 1799–1815
*[[Victorian era]] (United Kingdom, 1837–1901)
*[[Gilded Age]] (United States, 1870-1900)
*[[Machine Age]] (Europe, United States, elsewhere 19th and 20th centuries)
*[[Edwardian period]] (United Kingdom, 1901–1910)
*[[Meiji era]] (Japan, 1868–1912)

=== Contemporary Period (1945 – present) ===
{{main article|Contemporary history}}
The Contemporary Period generally covers history still in living memory, approximately 100 years behind the current year. However, for all intents and purposes, the period will be used here as spanning from the second world war in 1945 to present day, as it is considered separate from the past eras and the newest stage of world history.

[[File:Green insect on hand.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The "Spanish Fly", ''[[Lytta vesicatoria]]'' has been considered to have medicinal, [[aphrodisiac]], and other properties&lt;!--, though it contains an irritant chemical, [[cantharidin]], which is certainly toxic--&gt;.]]
'''Human interactions with insects''' include both a wide variety of uses, whether practical such as for food, textiles, and dyestuffs, or symbolic, as in art, music, and literature, and negative interactions including serious damage to crops and extensive efforts to eliminate insect pests. 

Academically, the interaction of insects and society has been treated in part as '''cultural entomology''', dealing mostly with "advanced" societies, and in part as '''ethnoentomology''', dealing mostly with "primitive" societies, though the distinction is weak and not based on theory. Both academic disciplines explore the parallels, connections and influence of [[insects]] on human populations, and vice versa. They are rooted in [[anthropology]] and [[natural history]], as well as [[entomology]], the study of insects. Other [[culture|cultural]] uses of insects, such as [[biomimicry]], do not necessarily lie within these academic disciplines.

More generally, people make a wide range of uses of insects, both practical and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts are made to kill them. The widespread use of [[insecticide]]s has failed to exterminate any [[insect pest]], but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.

Practical uses include [[entomophagy|as food]], [[Insects in medicine|in medicine]], for the valuable [[textile]] [[silk]], for [[dyestuff]]s such as [[carmine]], in science, where the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] is an important [[model organism]] in [[genetics]], and [[Entomological warfare|in warfare]], where insects were successfully used in the [[Second World War]] to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the [[honey bee]], provides [[honey]], [[pollen]], [[royal jelly]], [[propolis]] and an anti-inflammatory peptide, [[melittin]]; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include [[maggot therapy]] for wound [[debridement]]. Over a thousand protein families have been identified in the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, [[vasodilation|vasodilators]], [[antihistamine]]s and [[anaesthetic]]s.

Symbolic uses include roles [[Insects in art|in art]], [[Insects in music|in music]] (with [[List of insect-inspired songs|many songs featuring insects]]), [[Arthropods in film|in film]], [[Insects in literature|in literature]], [[Insects in religion|in religion]], and in mythology. Insect [[costume]]s are used in theatrical productions and worn for parties and carnivals.

==Context==

===Culture===

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by insects in human culture so defined.

===Cultural entomology and ethnoentomology===

[[File:Malay Archipelago Beetles.jpg|thumb|left|"[[The Malay Archipelago|Remarkable Beetles Found at Simunjon, Borneo]]": [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] was a pioneer of ethnoentomology.]]

Ethnoentomology developed from the 19th century with early works by authors such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1852) and [[Henry Walter Bates]] (1862). [[Hans Zinsser]]'s "classic" ''[[Rats, Lice and History]]'' (1935) showed that insects were an important force in human history. Writers like [[William Morton Wheeler]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Jean Henri Fabre]] described insect life and  communicated their meaning to people "with imagination and brilliance". Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy, and showed a positive aspect of insects. [[Food]] is the most studied topic in ethnoentomology, followed by [[medicine]] and [[beekeeping]].&lt;ref name=Posey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Posey |first1=Darrell Addison |title=Topics And Issues In Ethnoentomology With Some Suggestions For The  Development Of Hypothesis-Generation And Testing In Ethnobiology |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology |date=1986 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=99–120 |url=https://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/6-1/Posey1986.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801192909/http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/6-1/Posey1986.pdf |archivedate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crop Duster.jpg|thumb|upright|Fighting insects: an [[agricultural aircraft]] applies low-[[insecticide]] bait to kill [[western corn rootworm]]s.]]

In 1968, {{Interlanguage link multi|Erwin Schimitschek|de}} claimed cultural entomology as a branch of insect studies, in a review of the roles insects played in [[folklore]] and culture including [[religion]], food, medicine and the arts.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schimitschek |first=E. |title=Handbuch der Zoologie |year=1968 |publisher=Berliner Akademie Verlag|editor=Helmcke J.G. |editor2=Stark D. |editor3=Wermuth H. |chapter=Insekten als Nahrung, Brauchtum, Kult und Kultur |volume= 4 | pages=1–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[Charles Hogue]] covered the field in English and from 1994 to 1997, Hogue's ''The Cultural Entomology Digest'' served as a forum on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogue|first=Charles|title=Cultural Entomology|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who? What? Why?|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/who_what_why.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogue argued that "Humans spend their intellectual energies in three basic areas of activity: surviving, using practical learning (the application of technology); seeking pure knowledge through inductive mental processes (science); and pursuing enlightenment to taste a pleasure by aesthetic exercises that may be referred to as the "humanities." [[Entomology]] has long been concerned with survival ([[economic entomology]]) and scientific study (academic entomology), but the branch of investigation that addresses the influence of insects (and other terrestrial Arthropoda, including [[arachnids]] and [[myriapods]]) in literature, language, music, the arts, interpretive history, religion, and recreation has only become recognized as a distinct field through Schimitschek's work.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1961"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schimitschek | first=E. | title=Die Bedeutung der Insekten für Kultur und Wirtschaft des Menschen in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart | journal=Istanbul Universitesi | date= 1961 |volume= 908: | pages=1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogue 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |date=January 1987|volume= 32 |pages=181–199 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.en.32.010187.001145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hogue set out the boundaries of the field by saying: "The narrative history of the science of entomology is not part of cultural entomology, while the influence of insects on general [[history]] would be considered cultural entomology."&lt;ref name="Hogue"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "Because the term "cultural" is narrowly defined, some aspects normally included in studies of human societies are excluded."&lt;ref name="Hogue"/&gt;

Darrell Addison Posey, noting that the boundary between cultural entomology and ethnoentomology is difficult to draw, cites Hogue as limiting cultural entomology to the influence of insects on "the essence of humanity as expressed in the arts and humanities". Posey notes further that cultural anthropology is usually restricted to the study of "advanced", industrialised, and literate societies, whereas ethnoentomology studies "the entomological concerns of 'primitive' or 'noncivilized' societies". Posey states at once that the division is artificial, complete with an unjustified us/them bias.&lt;ref name=Posey/&gt; Brian Morris similarly criticises the way that anthropologists treat non-Western attitudes to nature as monadic and spiritualist, and contrast this "in [[gnostic]] fashion" with a simplistic treatment of Western, often 17th century, mechanistic attitude. Morris considers this "quite unhelpful, if not misleading", and offers instead his own research into the multiple ways that the people of [[Malawi]] relate to insects and other animals: "pragmatic, intellectual, realist, practical, aesthetic, symbolic and sacramental."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MEA) report 2005 defines [[ecosystem services]] as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet is that a few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, [[ant]]s, [[mosquito]]es, and [[spider]]s).  However, insects offer [[ecological goods and services]].&lt;ref name=MEA&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|title=Ecosystems and human well-being : synthesis|date=2005|publisher=Island Press|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-59726-040-1|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xerces Society]] calculates the economic impact of four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. "the importance of bugs to [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and wildlife observation, including [[bird-watching]]"), dung burial, and [[biological pest control|pest control]].

==Practical uses==

===As food===
{{main article|Entomophagy}}
[[File:Witchetty grub.jpg|thumb|left|[[Witchetty grub]]s were prized as food by [[Australian aborigine]]s.]]

[[Entomophagy]] is the eating of insects. Many insects are considered a culinary [[delicacy]] in some societies around the world, and Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy,  but the practice is uncommon and even taboo in other societies. Sometimes insects are considered suitable only for the poor in the third world, but in 1975 Victor Meyer-Rochow suggested that insects could help ease global future food shortages and advocated a change in western attitudes towards cultures in which insects were appreciated as a food item.&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow | first=Victor Benno | title=Can insects help to ease the problem of world food shortage? | journal= ANZAAS Journal: "Search"| date= 1975|volume= 6 |issue= 7 | pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  P.J. Gullan and P.S. Cranston felt that the remedy for this may be marketing of insect dishes as suitably exotic and costly to make them acceptable. They also note that some societies in sub-Saharan Africa prefer [[caterpillar]]s to beef, while Chakravorty et al. (2011) &lt;ref name="Nyishi"&gt;Chakravorty, J., Ghosh, S., and V.B. Meyer-Rochow. (2011). Practices of entomophagy and entomotherapy by members of the Nyishi and Galo tribes, two ethnic groups of the state of Arunachal Pradesh (North-East India). ''Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 7(5)''&lt;/ref&gt; point out that food insects (highly appreciated in North-East India) are more expensive than meat. The economics, i.e., the costs involved collecting food insects and the money earned through the sale of such insects, have been studied in a Laotian setting by Meyer-Rochow et al. (2008).&lt;ref name="Laos"&gt;Meyer-Rochow V.B., Nonaka K., Boulidam S (2008) More feared than revered: Insects and their impacts on human societies (with specific data on the importance of entomophagy in a Laotian setting. ''Entomologie Heute 20: 3–25''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, ant larvae and Corixid water boatman eggs are sought out as a form of [[caviar]] by gastronomes. In Guangdong, water beetles fetch a high enough price for these insects to be farmed. Especially high prices are fetched in Thailand for the giant water bug ''[[Lethocerus indicus]]''.&lt;ref name=GullanCranston2009/&gt;

{{main article|Insects in medicine}}

Insects have been used medicinally in cultures around the world, often according to the [[Doctrine of Signatures]]. Thus, the femurs of grasshoppers, which were said to resemble the human liver, were used to treat liver ailments by the indigenous peoples of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Mexico"&gt;Ramos-Elorduy de Concini, J. and J.M. Pino Moreno. (1988). The utilization of insects in the empirical medicine of ancient Mexicans. ''Journal of Ethnobiology, 8(2), 195–202.''&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine was applied in both [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] (TCM) and in [[Ayurveda]]. TCM uses arthropods for various purposes; for example, [[centipede]] is used to treat tetanus, seizures, and convulsions,&lt;ref name="centipede"&gt;http://tcm.health-info.org/Herbology.Materia.Medica/wugong-properties.htm&lt;/ref&gt; while the Chinese Black Mountain Ant, ''[[Polyrhachis]] vicina'', is used as a cure all, especially by the elderly, and extracts have been examined as a possible anti-cancer agent.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1809450.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Ayurveda uses insects such as [[Termite]] for conditions such as ulcers, rheumatic diseases, anaemia, and pain. The [[Jatropha]] leaf miner's larvae are used boiled to induce lactation, reduce fever, and soothe the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name="Nyishi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting"&gt;Srivastava, S.K., Babu, N., and H. Pandey. (2009). Traditional insect bioprospecting—As human food and medicine. ''Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge, 8(4):'' 485–494.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the traditional insect medicine of Africa is local and unformalised.&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting" /&gt; The indigenous peoples of Central America used a wide variety of insects medicinally. Mayans used [[Army ant]] soldiers as living [[Surgical suture|suture]]s.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; The venom of the [[Red harvester ant]] was used to cure [[rheumatism]], [[arthritis]], and [[poliomyelitis]] via the immune reaction produced by its sting.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; Boiled ''[[Bombyx mori|silkworm]]'' pupae were taken to treat [[apoplexy]], aphasy, [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], convulsions, [[haemorrhage]]s, and frequent urination.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt;

[[Honey bee]] products are used medicinally in [[apitherapy]] across Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, despite the fact that the honey bee was not introduced to the Americas until the colonization by Spain and Portugal.  They are by far the most common medical insect product both historically and currently, and the most frequently referenced of these is [[honey]].&lt;ref name="Bioprospecting" /&gt; It can be applied to skin to treat excessive scar tissue, rashes, and burns,&lt;ref name="China"&gt;Feng, Y., Zhao, M., He, Z., Chen, Z., and L.

''Entomological Research, 39:''  313–316.&lt;/ref&gt; and as an eye poultice to treat infection.&lt;ref name="Nyishi" /&gt; Honey is taken for digestive problems and as a general health restorative. It is taken hot to treat [[common cold|colds]], [[cough]], throat infections, [[laryngitis]], [[tuberculosis]], and lung diseases.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; [[Apitoxin]] (honey bee venom) is applied via direct stings to relieve arthritis, rheumatism, [[polyneuritis]], and [[asthma]].&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt;  [[Propolis]], a resinous, waxy mixture collected by honeybees and used as a hive insulator and sealant, is often consumed by [[menopausal]] women because of its high [[hormone]] content, and it is said to have antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; [[Royal jelly]] is used to treat [[anaemia]], [[gastrointestinal ulcer]]s, arteriosclerosis, [[hypotension|hypo]]- and [[hypertension]], and inhibition of sexual [[libido]].&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt;  Finally [[Bee bread]], or bee pollen, is eaten as a generally health restorative, and is said to help treat both internal and external infections.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; One of the major [[peptide]]s in bee venom, [[Melittin]], has the potential to treat [[inflammation]] in sufferers of [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[Multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="N.A.

Insects play an important role in biological research.

Insects feature in folklore around the world. In China, farmers traditionally regulated their crop planting according to the [[Jingzhe|Awakening of the Insects]], when temperature shifts and monsoon rains bring insects out of hibernation.

In the Brazilian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], members of the [[Tupí–Guaraní]] language family have been observed using ''Pachycondyla commutata'' ants during female rite-of-passage ceremonies, and prescribing the sting of ''Pseudomyrmex'' spp. for fevers and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Balée]] (2000), "Antiquity of Traditional Ethnobiological Knowledge in Amazonia: a Tupí–Guaraní Family and Time" ''Ethnohistory'' 47(2):399–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

The red harvester ant ''[[Pogonomyrmex californicus]]'' has been widely used by natives of Southern California and Northern Mexico for hundreds of years in ceremonies conducted to help tribe members acquire spirit helpers through hallucination.  During the ritual, young men are sent away from the tribe and consume large quantities of live, unmasticated ants under the supervision of an elderly member of the tribe.  Ingestion of ants should lead to a prolonged state of unconsciousness, where dream helpers appear and serve as allies to the dreamer for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Groark.

{{main article|Insects in art}}

Both the symbolic form and the actual body of insects have been used to adorn humans in ancient and modern times. A recurrent theme for ancient cultures in Europe and the Near East regarded the sacred image of a bee or human with insect features.  Often referred to as the bee "goddess",  these images were found in gems and stones. An onyx gem from [[Knossos]] (ancient Crete) dating to approximately 1500 BC illustrates a Bee goddess with bull horns above her head.  In this instance, the figure is surrounded by dogs with wings, most likely representing [[Hecate]] and [[Artemis]] – gods of the underworld, similar to the Egyptian gods Akeu and Anubis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gough |first=Andrew |title=The Bee Part 2 Beewildered |url=http://andrewgough.co.uk/bee2_1.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beetlewing]] art is an ancient craft technique using iridescent beetle wings practiced traditionally in [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Beetlewing pieces are used as an adornment to paintings, textiles and jewelry. Different species of metallic wood-boring beetle wings were used depending on the region, but traditionally the most valued were those from beetles belonging to the genus [[Sternocera]].  The practice comes from across Asia and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, Myanmar, Japan, India and China.  In Thailand beetlewings were preferred to decorate clothing (shawls and Sabai cloth) and jewellery in former court circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Beetle-Wing Tea-Cosy |url=https://hampshireculturaltrust.org.uk/content/beetle-wing-tea-cosy |publisher=Hampshire Cultural Trust |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian entomologist [[C.H. Curran]]'s 1945 book, ''Insects of the Pacific World'', noted women from India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles of the species ''[[Chrysochroa ocellata]]'' as pets. These living jewels were worn on festive occasions, probably with a small chain attached to one leg anchored to the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jewelled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rivers |first=Victoria |title=Beetles in Textiles |url=http://www.insects.org/ced2/beetles_tex.html |work=[[Cultural Entomology Digest]] February |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Butterflies]] have long inspired humans with their life cycle, color, and ornate patterns. The novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] was also a renowned butterfly expert. He published and illustrated many butterfly species, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I discovered in nature the nonutilitarian delights that I sought in art. Both were a form of magic, both were games of intricate enchantment and deception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Speak, Memory |year=1989 |publisher=Vintage International |location=New York |page=129 |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the aesthetic complexity of insects that led Nabokov to reject [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahuja |first=Nitin |title=Nabokov's Case Against Natural Selection |journal=Tract |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Strong Opinions |year=1990 |publisher=Vintage International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalist Ian MacRae writes of butterflies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the animal is at once awkward, flimsy, strange, bouncy in flight, yet beautiful and immensely sympathetic; it is painfully transient, albeit capable of extreme migrations and transformations. Images and phrases such as "kaleidoscopic instabilities," "oxymoron of similarities," "rebellious rainbows," "visible darkness" and "souls of stone" have much in common. They bring together the two terms of a conceptual contradiction, thereby facilitating the mixing of what should be discrete and mutually exclusive categories&amp;nbsp;... In positing such questions, butterfly science, an inexhaustible, complex, and finely nuanced field, becomes not unlike the human imagination, or the field of literature itself. In the natural history of the animal, we begin to sense its literary and artistic possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacRae |first=Ian |title=Butterfly Chronicles: Imagination and Desire in Natural &amp; Literary Histories |journal=Canadian Journal of Environ Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]'' was written by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], in 1899–1900, as part of his opera, ''The Tale of Tsar of Saltan''.  The piece is one of the most recognizable pieces in classical composition.  The [[bumblebee]] in the story is a prince who has been transformed into an insect so that he can fly off to visit his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rimsky-Korsakov – The Flight of the Bumblebee (Homeschool Music Appreciation) |url=http://creatingwithwisdom.blogspot.com/2012/05/rimsky-korsakov-flight-of-bumblebee.html |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Eric Speed, Violinist, Flight of the Bumblebee, Nikon S9100, Montreal, 22 July 2011".|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR0UCNOdWxI |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Green Hornet|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv2-Tz4wPCI|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play upon which the opera was based – written by [[Alexandr Pushkin]] – originally had two more insect themes: the Flight of the Mosquito and the Flight of the Fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neff,|first=Lyle |title=The Tale of Tsar Saltan: A Centenary Appreciation of Rimski-Korsakov's Second Puškin Opera |journal=The Pushkin Review | volume=2 |year=1999 |pages=89–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NGC 6302 Hubble 2009.full.jpg|thumb|upright|The Butterfly Nebula, [[NGC 6302]]]]

"The Bug Nebula", also called "The Butterfly Nebula", is a more recent discovery. Known as [[NGC 6302]] is one of the brightest and most popular stars in the universe – popular in that its features draw the attention of a lot of researchers.  It happens to be located in the [[Scorpius]] constellation.  It is perfectly bipolar, and until recently, the central star was unobservable, clouded by gas, but estimated to be one of the hottest in the galaxy – 200,000 degrees Fahrenheit, perhaps 35 times hotter than our Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matsuura, M. |author2=Zijlstra, A.

The honey bee played a central role in the cosmology of the [[Mayan people]]. The stucco figure at the temples of Tulum known as "Ah Mucen Kab" – the Diving Bee God – bears resemblance to the insect in the Codex Tro-Cortesianus identified as a bee.  Such reliefs might have indicated towns and villages that produce honey. Modern Mayan authorities say the figure also have a connection to modern cosmology. Mayan mythology expert Migel Angel Vergara relates that the Mayans held a belief that bees came from Venus, the "Second Sun." The relief might be indicative of another "insect deity", that of Xux Ex, the Mayan "wasp star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter |first=C.

[[Ovo (Cirque du Soleil)|Ovo]] is an insect-themed production by the world renowned Canadian entertainment company [[Cirque du Soleil]]. The show looks at the world of insects and its biodiversity where they go about their daily lives until a mysterious egg appears in their midst, as the insects become awestruck about this iconic object that represents the enigma and cycles of their lives. The costuming was a fusion of arthropod body types blended with superhero armour. Liz Vandal, the lead costume designer, has a special affinity for the world of the insect:&lt;ref name=Cirque/&gt;

{{quote|When I was just a kid I put rocks down around the yard near the fruit trees and I lifted them regularly to watch the insects who had taken up residence underneath them. I petted caterpillars and let butterflies into the house. So when I learned that OVO was inspired by insects, I immediately knew that I was in a perfect position to pay tribute to this majestic world with my costumes. All insects are beautiful and perfect; it is what they evoke for each of us that changes our perception of them."&lt;ref name=Cirque&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Show |url=http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/shows/ovo/show/about.aspx |publisher=[[Cirque du Soleil]] |accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Webby award-winning video series ''Green Porno'' was created to showcase the reproductive habits of insects.  Jody Shapiro and Rick Gilbert were responsible for translating the research and concepts that [[Isabella Rossellini]] envisioned into the paper and paste costumes which directly contribute to the series' unique visual style. The film series was driven by the creation of costumes to translate scientific research into "something visual and how to make it comical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kung |first=Michelle |title="Green Porno" Creator Isabella Rossellini on Animal Sex, Crazed Fans and Web Entertainment |journal=[[Wall Street Journal]] |series=Retrieved 2009-11-06 |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, informal, [[spoken language]], "everyday language" is less precise than any more [[formal language|formal]]  or academic languages.

Language might be said to be imprecise because it exhibits one or more of the following features:
* [[ambiguity]] – when a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs.
* [[vagueness]] – when borderline cases interfere with an interpretation
* [[equivocation]] – the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning or sense (by glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time)
* [[accent (fallacy)|accent]] – when the use of bold or italics causes confusion over the meaning of a statement
* [[Syntactic ambiguity|amphiboly]] – when a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due to ambiguous sentence structure.

While '''imprecise language''' is not desirable in various scientific fields, it may be helpful, illustrative or discussion-stimulative in other contexts. Imprecision in a discourse may or may not be the intention of the author(s) or speaker(s). The role of imprecision may depend on audience, end goal, extended context and subject matter. Relevant players and real stakes will also bear on [[truth-grounds]] of statements.

'''Ivy Day''' is an annual ceremony in which an '''ivy stone''' is placed on either a residential, academic or administrative building or ground to commemorate academic excellence. The ceremony is most known for being practiced among older colleges in the [[Northeastern United States]]. It is most associated with the [[Ivy League]] and a group of small liberal arts college known as the [[Little Ivies]]. Some institutions announce members of [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] and specialized honor designations for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/events/commencement.php|title=Smith College: Events|website=www.smith.edu|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some classes donate to the college, in the form gates, facades, and door outlines,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://innocents.unl.edu/ivy-day-0|title=Ivy Day {{!}} Innocents Society {{!}} University of Nebraska–Lincoln|last=Network|first=University of Nebraska-Lincoln {{!}} Web Developer|website=innocents.unl.edu|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; by inscribing or creating their own version of symbolic icons of the college's seal or other prominent insignia. The ivy stones are usually decorated with the graduation date and a symbol that represents the college as a whole or the class as a whole. The most common ivy stone is one-by-two feet and is usually made out of workable stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/pennhistory/ivystones/ivystones.ica.html|title=Penn History-ICA Ivy Stone Brochure|website=www.library.upenn.edu|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On occasion students have featured prominent alumni on their class ivy stones or have selected to feature an engraving of a member of their graduating class. Since 1873 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and since 1879 at [[Bates College]], students have unveiled class ivy stones at the annual ivy day preceding [[Commencement Day|commencement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/pennhistory/ivystones/ivystones.ica.html Penn website] (accessed February 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bates.edu/x61823.xml Bates College website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414113219/http://www.bates.edu/x61823.xml |date=2009-04-14 }} (accessed February 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Students may also have a selective procession prior to the official commencement walk to honor each stone being placed on the buildings. On some occasions students plant [[Hedera|ivy]] in front or on the side of their ivy stones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bates.edu/x61823.xml Bates College website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414113219/http://www.bates.edu/x61823.xml |date=2009-04-14 }} (accessed February 27, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princeton University]] also places class ivy stones on the walls of its buildings, a few days prior to their commencement.

'''Language''' is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of [[communication]], particularly the [[human]] ability to do so&lt;!--Do not remove the qualifier "human" without first reading the article or consulting the discussions about this issue.--&gt;; and '''a language''' is any specific example of such a system.

The scientific study of language is called [[linguistics]]. Questions concerning the [[philosophy of language]], such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] have argued that language originated from [[emotion]]s while others like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].

Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and [[dialect]]s. [[Natural language]]s are [[speech|spoken]] or [[sign language|signed]], but any language can be [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoded]] into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]&amp;nbsp;– for example, in [[Whistled language|whistling]], [[sign language|signed]], or [[braille]]. This is because human language is [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]-independent. Depending on [[philosophy of language|philosophical perspectives]] regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the [[cognitive]] ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of [[semiosis]] to relate [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] to particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. [[Oral language|Oral]], [[sign language|manual]] and tactile languages contain a [[phonology|phonological]] system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or [[morpheme]]s, and a [[syntax|syntactic]] system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.

Human language has the properties of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of [[animal communication]]. Language is thought to have originated when early [[hominin]]s started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a [[Theory of mind|theory of other minds]] and a shared [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Chomsky|Fitch|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the [[human brain]], but especially in [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Humans [[language acquisition|acquire]] language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human [[culture]]. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[social stratification]], as well as [[social grooming]] and [[entertainment]].

Languages [[language change|evolve]] and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] by [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparing]] modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a [[language family]]. The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hindi]]; the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]] includes [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]] and the other [[Chinese language]]s, and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]; the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic family]] includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the [[Bantu languages]] include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout [[Africa]]; and the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] include [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the [[Pacific]]. The languages of the [[Dravidian language|Dravidian family]], spoken mostly in Southern India, include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become [[Language death|extinct]] by the year 2100.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Philosophy of language}}
The English word ''language'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s}}'' "tongue, speech, language" through [[Latin]] ''lingua'', "language; tongue", and [[Old French]] ''[[wikt:language#Old French|language]]''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=language |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=3rd|year=1992|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to refer to [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, and other kinds of [[constructed language|artificially constructed communication systems]] such as formally defined computer languages used for [[programming language|computer programming]]. Unlike conventional human languages, a [[formal language]] in this sense is a [[system]] of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] for [[encoding]] and decoding [[information]]. This article specifically concerns the properties of [[Natural language|natural human language]] as it is studied in the discipline of [[linguistics]].

As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "[[French language|French]]". The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word ''langage'' for language as a concept, ''[[langue and parole|langue]]'' as a specific instance of a language system, and ''parole'' for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Lyons2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="LyonsIntro"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="TraskLanguage"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.{{sfn|Bett|2010}}

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world&amp;nbsp;– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the [[linguistic turn]] and philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.{{sfn|Devitt|Sterelny|1999}}

===Mental faculty, organ or instinct===
One definition sees language primarily as the [[mind|mental faculty]] that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the [[human brain]]. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, [[creole languages]] and spontaneously developed sign languages such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely [[innatism|innate]], for example, in [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]], or American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]'s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a [[cognitive science]] framework and in [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Fitch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal symbolic system===
Another definition sees language as a [[formal system]] of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed [[structural linguistics|structural systems]] consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=93}} This [[structuralism|structuralist]] view of language was first introduced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name="Saussure"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Saussure|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is [[Noam Chomsky]], the originator of the [[generative linguistics|generative theory of grammar]], who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=130}} Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in [[formal logic]], in [[formal grammar|formal]] [[theoretical linguistics|theories of grammar]], and in applied [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=93, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|1998|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other [[formal logic]]ians.

===Tool for communication===
[[File:ASL family.jpg|right|thumb|A conversation in [[American Sign Language]]]]
Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. [[Functional theories of grammar]] explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Valin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of language is associated with the study of language in [[pragmatics|pragmatic]], [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]], and interactive frameworks, as well as in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of [[linguistic typology]], or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of [[grammaticalization]] tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as [[J.L. Austin]], [[Paul Grice]], [[John Searle]], and [[Willard van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]].{{sfn|Nerlich|2010|p=192}}

===Unique status of human language===
{{main|Animal language|Great ape language}}

A number of features, many of which were described by [[Charles Hockett]] and called [[Hockett's design features|design features]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |title=The Problem of Universals in Language |last=Hockett |first=Charles F. |date=1966 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110023354/http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2013-05-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; set human language apart from other known systems of communication, such as those used by non-human [[Animal language|animals]].

Communication systems used by other animals such as [[Bee learning and communication|bees]] or [[great ape language|apes]] are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hockett|1960}}; {{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human language is open-ended and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).&lt;ref name="Trask5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]], is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Crane |first2=Jodie S.|last3=Savage |first3=James L.|last4=Russel |first4=Andrew F. |last5=Townsend |first5=Simon W. |date=29 June 2015 |title=Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=13|issue=6|pages=e1002171|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171|pmid=26121619 |pmc=4488142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Ridley |first2=Amanda R.|last3=Townsend |first3=Simon W. |date=20 July 2017 |title=Element repetition rates encode functionally distinct information in pied babbler 'clucks' and 'purrs' |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=953–60|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1114-6|pmid=28730513|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/89798/7/WRAP-element-repetition-rates-encode-functionally-Townsend-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a [[bonobo]] named [[Kanzi]] learned to express itself using a set of symbolic [[lexigram]]s. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] reportedly uses as many as 1000 words in [[American Sign Language]], and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]; {{harvcoltxt|Candland|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ [[grammatical categories|grammatical and semantic categories]], such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"/&gt; Human language is also unique in having the property of [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursivity]]: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]&lt;/nowiki&gt;") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I see [the dog is running]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;").&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as ''modality independent''. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas [[sign language]]s and writing use the visual modality, and [[braille]] writing uses the tactile modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=165–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called ''[[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]'', and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of [[bee]]s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.&lt;ref name="Trask5"/&gt;

The [[Christian mythology|Biblical myth]] of the [[Tower of Babel]] is one such account; other cultures have different stories of how language arose.&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;
}}
Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on the generative view of language pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]] see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ulbaek|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky is one prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"/&gt; He suggests that for scholars interested in the nature of language, "talk about the evolution of the language capacity is beside the point."{{sfn|Chomsky|1972|p=86}} Chomsky proposes that perhaps "some random mutation took place [...] and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}} Though cautioning against taking this story literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}}

Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], hold the precedents to be [[animal cognition]],&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt; whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], see it as having developed from [[animal communication]] in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 2008"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from [[music]], a view already espoused by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]].{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=466–507}} [[Stephen R. Anderson|Stephen Anderson]] states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered&amp;nbsp;... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because language emerged in the early [[prehistory]] of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a [[larynx]] capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=250–92}}

It was mostly undisputed that pre-human [[australopithecine]]s did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in [[great ape]]s in general. However, a 2017 study on [[Origin of language#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]] challenges this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus  and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101–21 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with [[Anatomically modern humans|Anatomically Modern ''Homo sapiens'']] with the [[behavioral modernity|Upper Paleolithic revolution]] less than 100,000 years ago.{{sfn|Foley|1997|pp=70–74}}{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=292–93}}

{{main|Linguistics|History of linguistics}}
The study of language, [[linguistics]], has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in [[India]] more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdisciplines===
The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, [[descriptive linguistics]] examines the grammar of single languages, [[theoretical linguistics]] develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, [[sociolinguistics]] studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, [[neurolinguistics]] studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, [[computational linguistics]] builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and [[historical linguistics]] relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
The formal study of language is often considered to have started in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. However, [[Sumer]]ian scribes already studied the differences between [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century AD, the French [[Port-Royal Grammar]]ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by British [[philologist]] and expert on ancient India [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1914|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.&lt;ref name="Saussure"/&gt;

By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|Langue-parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue''), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clarke|1990|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary linguistics===
In the 1960s, [[Noam Chomsky]] formulated the [[Generative linguistics|generative theory of language]]. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]]; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, [[Functional theories of grammar|functional theories of language]] propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. [[Formal grammar|Formal theories of grammar]] seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation"; {{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of [[cognitive linguistics]] interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|Cruse|2004|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech==
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=11–14, 105–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[genetics|genetic]] bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is [[FOXP2]], which may cause a kind of [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|congenital language disorder]] if affected by [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fisher|Lai|Monaco|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
{{main|Neurolinguistics|Language processing in the brain}}
[[File:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green, and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]] The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref name="Lesser205"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lesser|1989|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is [[Wernicke's area]], which is in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop [[receptive aphasia]], a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax|sentence structure]]. The second area is [[Broca's area]], in the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop [[expressive aphasia]], meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, [[word repetition]], and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|p=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[electrophysiology]] to study language processing in individuals without impairments.&lt;ref name="Lesser205"/&gt;

Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce [[sound]], which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the [[ear drum]]. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box ([[larynx]]), and the upper vocal tract&amp;nbsp;– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental and suprasegmental]] elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[phonation]] type, voice [[timbre]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], all of which may have effects across multiple segments.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consonant]]s and [[vowel]] segments combine to form [[syllable]]s, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. [[Acoustics|Acoustically]], these different segments are characterized by different [[formant]] structures, that are visible in a [[spectrogram]] of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; Vowels are called ''[[Close vowel|close]]'' when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel {{ipa|[i]}} (English "ee"), or ''[[open vowel|open]]'' when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel {{ipa|[a]}} (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as {{ipa|[u]}} (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are [[Roundedness|rounded]] as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between {{ipa|[i]}} (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and {{ipa|[y]}} ([[rounded front vowel]] such as German "ü").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, [[alveolar ridge]], [[palate]], [[Soft palate|velum]], [[uvula]], or [[glottis]]. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by [[manner of articulation]], or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called ''[[occlusive]]'' or ''[[stop consonant|stop]]'', or different degrees of aperture creating ''[[fricative]]s'' and ''[[approximant consonant|approximants]]''. Consonants can also be either ''[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced or unvoiced]]'', depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English {{ipa|[s]}} in ''bus'' ([[sibilant|unvoiced sibilant]]) from {{ipa|[z]}} in ''buzz'' ([[Voiced alveolar sibilant#Voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced sibilant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called ''[[Nasal consonant|nasals]]'' or ''[[Nasalization|nasalized]]'' sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called ''[[Lateral consonant|laterals]]'', because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called ''[[rhotics]]'') that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
When described as a system of [[symbolic communication]], language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]], and a [[code (semiotics)|code]] connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of [[semiosis]], how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [[semiotics]]. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at [[Thanjavur]]]]
Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"/&gt;

The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called [[syntax]] or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=218–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
{{main|Semantics|Semiotics|Meaning (linguistics)}}
Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

Thus, languages must have a [[vocabulary]] of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species ''[[Canis familiaris]]''. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the [[lexicon]], and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a [[lexeme]]. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages contain the semantic structure of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]]: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign [[truth value]]s to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"/&gt;

Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Goldsmith|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"/&gt;

Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called [[minimal pair]]. In English, for example, the words ''bat'' {{ipa|[bæt]}} and ''pat'' {{ipa|[pʰæt]}} form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated and non-aspirated]] pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Hindi]] do: the unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''spin'' {{ipa|[spɪn]}} and the aspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''pin'' {{ipa|[pʰɪn]}} are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called [[allophones]]), whereas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words {{ipa|[pʰá]}} 'crouch' and {{ipa|[pá]}} 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).&lt;ref name="Trask214"/&gt;

All [[oral language|spoken languages]] have phonemes of at least two different categories, [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], that can be combined to form [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[Vowel length|duration]], and [[tonal language|tone]] to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called [[suprasegmental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Pirahã language]] with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like [[Taa language#Phonology|Taa]] may have as many as 141 phonemes.&lt;ref name="Trask214"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s, [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|the equivalent to phonemes]] (formerly called [[chereme]]s) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C. (1960). ''Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf,'' Studies in linguistics: Occasional papers (No. 8). Buffalo: Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University of Buffalo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg (1965). ''A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles.'' Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|pp=539–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writing system]]s represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The [[Latin alphabet]] (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the [[Inuktitut]] syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In [[logographic]] scripts, each sign represents an entire word,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.

Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the [[Arabic script]]), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coulmas|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
{{main|Grammar}}
Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called ''[[morpheme]]s'' within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be ''free'' or ''bound''. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called ''[[word]]s'', and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called [[affix]]es. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called ''syntax''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grammatical categories====
{{main|Grammatical category}}
Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Allerton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically [[morphosyntactic alignment|distinguishing between their relations]] to a predicate, the encoding of [[Grammatical tense|temporal]] and [[Preposition and postposition|spatial]] relations on predicates, and a system of [[grammatical person]] governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Word classes====
Languages organize their [[parts of speech]] into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called [[noun]]s. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called [[verb]]s. Another common category is the [[adjective]]: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], while nouns are used as [[argument]]s of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called [[transitivity (grammar)|''intransitive'']], while a predicate that can take two arguments is called [[transitive verb|''transitive'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] like "and" that serve to join two sentences, [[article (grammar)|articles]] that introduce a noun, [[interjections]] such as "wow!", or [[ideophones]] like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the general noun classifier for humans is ''nin'' (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Senft|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''san-nin no gakusei'' (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student"&amp;nbsp;— three students
For trees, it would be:
:''san-bon no ki'' (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree"&amp;nbsp;— three trees

====Morphology====
In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several [[morpheme]]s. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aronoff|Fudeman|2011|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or [[affix]]es can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: ''[[prefix]]es'' precede the root, [[suffix]]es follow the root, and [[infix]]es are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ''[[ablaut]]''. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of [[inflection]], which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bauer|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Haspelmath|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called [[Isolating language|isolating]], or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word ''bonus'', or "good", consists of the root ''bon-'', meaning "good", and the suffix -''us'', which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and [[nominative]] case. These languages are called ''[[fusional languages]]'', because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are [[agglutinative languages]] which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], where for example, the word ''evlerinizden'', or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ''ev-ler-iniz-den'' with the meanings ''house-plural-your-from''. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called [[polysynthetic languages]]. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in [[Persian language|Persian]] the single word ''nafahmidamesh'' means ''I didn't understand it'' consisting of morphemes ''na-fahm-id-am-esh'' with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq'', which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]''. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective ''bonus'', or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''ikusi nauzu'', or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb ''n-au-zu'' (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the ''n''- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the – ''zu'' suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntax====
{{main|Syntax}}
[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the phrase, "on the mat" is a [[locative (case)|locative]] phrase, and "sat" is the core of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].]]

Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The prefixed asterisk * conventionally indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical, i.e. syntactically incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baker|2001|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in [[Latin language|Latin]], both ''Dominus servos vituperabat'' and ''Servos vituperabat dominus'' mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because ''servos'', or "slaves", is in the [[accusative case]], showing that they are the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] of the sentence, and ''dominus'', or "master", is in the [[nominative case]], showing that he is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of [[Wh-movement|inverse word order in questions]], which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing [[focus (linguistics)|special emphasis]] on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called [[phrase]]s, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.{{sfn|Baker|2001|pp=269–70}} To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=218–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"/&gt; There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;

===Typology and universals===
{{Main|Linguistic typology|Linguistic universal}}

Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1992}};{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic [[word order]], the relative order of the [[verb]], and its constituents in a normal indicative [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In English, the basic order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] would be ''d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy'' (snake man bit), [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name="CroftErg"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of [[prepositions]] or [[postpositions]]. Such correlations are called [[Linguistic universals|implicational universals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]] type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009|p=45}}; {{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the [[Nominative–absolutive language|nominative-accusative]] word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun ''I''. Some languages, called [[Ergativity|ergative]], Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.&lt;ref name="CroftErg"/&gt; In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the [[Tripartite language|tripartite type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;

==Social contexts of use and transmission==
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|The [[Wall of Love]] in [[Paris]], where the phrase "I love you" is featured in 250 languages of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.travelfranceonline.com/wall-of-love-mur-des-je-taime-montmartre/|title=Wall of Love&amp;nbsp;– Mur des Je t'aime&amp;nbsp;– Montmartre|publisher=Travel France Online|accessdate = 30 November 2014|date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on [[speech community|communities of speakers]] in which children [[language acquisition|learn language]] from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to [[communicate]] and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.&lt;ref name="Myths"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Evans|Levinson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to [[language contact]]. The process is similar to the process of [[evolution]], where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of [[diffusion]], as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their [[first language]] or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming [[endangered language|endangered]] as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage and meaning===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called [[deixis]], which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=54–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called [[speech act]]s, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=226–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called [[conversational implicature]]s. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring [[communicative competence]] in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=100–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
{{main|Language acquisition|Second-language acquisition|Second language|Language education}}
All healthy, [[Human development (biology)|normally developing]] human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring [[sign language|sign]] or [[oral language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bonvillian |first1=John D. |author2=Michael D. Orlansky |author3=Leslie Lazin Novack |title=Developmental milestones: Sign language acquisition and motor development |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=December 1983 |pages=1435–45 |doi=10.2307/1129806|pmid=6661942 |jstor=1129806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt;

First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. Around six months of age, a child will begin [[babbling]], producing the speech sounds or [[handshape]]s of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average [[vocabulary]] of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 [[word]]s. A child's first [[utterance]]s are [[Holophrasis|holophrases]] (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce [[telegraphic speech]], or short sentences that are less [[Grammar|grammatically]] complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.&lt;ref name="OGrady-Cho"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Grady |first1=William |last2=Cho |first2=Sook Whan |chapter=First language acquisition |title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=fourth |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennison"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kennison|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn [[fetus]]es are capable of language acquisition to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;"First Impressions: We start to pick up words, food preferences and hand-eye coordination long before being born", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 1 (July 2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Skwarecki, "Babies Learn to Recognize Words in the Womb", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 26 August 2013 [http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/08/babies-learn-recognize-words-womb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Macaro|editor-first1=Ernesto| year=2010 | title=Continuum companion to second language acquisition|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9922-5|pages=137–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
{{see also|Culture#Language_and_culture|l1=Culture|Speech community}}
[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (c. 1935)]]
Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]], and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists use the term "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Agha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between [[social class]]es, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dixon|1972|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social [[deixis]]", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=311–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt;

===Writing, literacy and technology===
{{main|Writing|Literacy}}
[[File:Winnipeg Forks - Plains Cree Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An inscription of [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], an [[abugida]] developed by Christian missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages]]
Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called [[writing systems]].

The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and [[formal education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Olson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]]. A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"/&gt;

===Change===
{{main|Language change|Grammaticalization}}
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first page of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', written in [[Old English]] in the early medieval period (800–1100 AD). Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.]]
All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire [[Phonological change|phonological system]]. [[Sound change]] can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''conditioned'' in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be ''sporadic'', affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a [[chain shift]] in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the [[Germanic languages]] when the sound change known as [[Grimm's law]] affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *{{PIE|bʰ}} became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *{{PIE|b}} in turn became /p/, and the previous *{{PIE|p}} became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why [[Italic languages]] such as Latin have ''p'' in words like '''''p'''ater'' and '''''p'''isces'', whereas Germanic languages, like English, have '''''f'''ather'' and '''''f'''ish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clackson|2007|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin ''mea domina'' to eventually become the [[French language|French]] ''madame'' and American English ''ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as [[idiom]]s or particular constructions become [[grammaticalized]]. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]] the final /s/ has eroded away. Since [[Standard Spanish]] uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the [[grammatical person|second person]] subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun ''tú''. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ''¿como te llamas?'' {{ipa|[ˈkomo te ˈjamas]}} in Standard Spanish, but {{ipa|[ˈkomo ˈtu te ˈjama]}} in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zentella|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. ''I'm gonna'').

Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] towards more common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with [[Language ideology|ideologies]], and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact===
{{main|language contact}}
One important source of language change is contact and resulting [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] interact on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] is likely to have been the norm throughout [[human history]] and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the [[Nation state|ethno-national state]], monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Romaine|2001|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of [[Sprachbund|language areas]] in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the [[Balkan language area]], the [[Mesoamerican language area]], and the [[Ethiopian language area]]. Also, larger areas such as [[South Asia]], Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including [[language convergence]], [[loanword|borrowing]], and [[relexification]] (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new [[mixed language]]s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called [[pidgins]] occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a [[creole language]]. An example of such mixed languages is [[Tok Pisin]], the official language of [[Papua New-Guinea]], which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and [[Austronesian languages]]; others are [[Haitian Creole|Kreyòl ayisyen]], the French-based creole language spoken in [[Haiti]], and [[Michif language|Michif]], a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Matras|Bakker|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[SIL Ethnologue]]'' defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and [[dialects]]. As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' cataloged 7,097 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ethnologue'' establishes linguistic groups based on studies of [[mutual intelligibility]], and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the [[Danish language]] that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]]) by the ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

According to the ''Ethnologue'', 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the ''Ethnologue'' (2009 figures).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages and dialects===
{{main|Dialect#Dialect or language}}
[[File:Novi Sad mayor office.jpg|thumb|[[Multilingualism|Multi-lingual]] sign outside the [[mayor]]'s office in [[Novi Sad]], written in the four official languages of the city: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]]]
There is no [[Language or dialect|clear distinction]] between a language and a [[dialect]], notwithstanding a famous [[aphorism]] attributed to linguist [[Max Weinreich]] that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]".&lt;ref name="5 minute linguist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickerson |first=E.M. |title=What's the difference between dialect and language? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |work=The Five Minute Linguist |publisher=College of Charleston |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219070627/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Before the [[Yugoslav civil war]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was considered a single language with two dialects, but now [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive [[writing system]]s, or degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language families of the world===
{{Main|Language family|Dialectology|Historical linguistics|List of language families}}
[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see ''[[:Template:Distribution of languages in the world|Distribution of languages in the world]]''.]]
The world's languages can be grouped into [[Language family|language families]] consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of [[language isolate]]s: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are [[Basque language|Basque]], spoken in Europe, [[Zuni language|Zuni]] of [[New Mexico]], [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] of Mexico, [[Ainu language|Ainu]] of Japan, [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] of [[Pakistan]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Katzner"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Katzner|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the [[Indo-European languages]], spoken by 46% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}, "[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]"&lt;/ref&gt; This family includes major world languages like [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the [[Eurasia]]n [[Migration Period]] (c. 400–800 AD),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and subsequently through the [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]], which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the [[Americas]] and much of [[Africa]]. The [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] are spoken by 20%&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], and hundreds of smaller languages.&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Brown|Ogilvie|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language family]], which includes such languages as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; A similar number of people speak the [[Afroasiatic languages]], which include the populous [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language]], and the languages of the [[Sahara]] region, such as the [[Berber languages]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]].&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from [[Madagascar]] to [[maritime Southeast Asia]] all the way to [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; It includes such languages as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Maori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and many of the indigenous languages of [[Indonesia]] and [[Formosan languages|Taiwan]]. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[South Asia]] (among them [[Kannada language|Kannada]] [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (among them [[Khmer language|Khmer]]), and [[Tai–Kadai languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]] (including [[Thai language|Thai]]).&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[West Africa]], and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the [[Quechumaran languages|Quechumaran]], [[Arawak languages|Arawak]], and [[Tupi-Guarani languages|Tupi-Guarani]] families of South America, the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], and [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] of [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language families of [[North America]]. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan family]], whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name="Katzner"/&gt;

===Language endangerment===
{{main|Endangered language|Language loss|Language shift|Language death|}}
[[File:Linguistic diversity.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Together, the eight countries in red contain more than 50% of the world's languages. The areas in blue are the most linguistically diverse in the world, and the locations of most of the world's endangered languages.]]
[[endangered language|Language endangerment]] occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or [[language shift|shift]] to speaking another language. [[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a ''[[dead language]]''. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an ''[[extinct language]]''. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of [[globalization]] and [[neo-colonialism]], where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Moseley|2010}}: "[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php Statistics]"&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|top 20 languages]], those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often [[Speaker types|semi-speakers]]). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common ''[[lingua franca]]'', such as English or [[Esperanto]], there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the [[tower of Babel]] in the [[Old Testament]], that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Haugen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav]] and [[American Civil War]], or the genocide of [[Rwanda]], whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted [[Language policy|specific legislation]] to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]]. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |Variants (general)}}

'''Lipstick feminism''' is a variety of [[third-wave feminism]] that seeks to embrace traditional concepts of femininity, including the [[Sexual attraction|sexual power]] of women, alongside feminist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Lankford, ''Women Singer-Songwriters in Rock'' (2010) p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike early feminist campaigns that focused on the basic fundamental [[rights of women]], starting with the [[Women's Suffrage]] Movement, lipstick feminism seeks to ascertain that women could still be feminist without ignoring or negating their femininity, particularly in terms of sexuality. During the [[second wave of feminism]], feminists had focused solely on legal and social equality of women and refused to 'embrace' their sexuality; some even abhorred the idea of men and would often take on physical characteristics and persona that was far from what the average woman looked like, thus creating stereotypes of what feminism and feminists looked like. Lipstick feminism, on the other hand, embraces the concepts of womanhood and the female sexuality emitted from a woman's body and the need to embrace sex. Lipstick feminism also seeks to reclaim certain derogatory words and turn them into powerful tools for their cause such as the word 'slut' as seen in the [[SlutWalk]] movement. It developed in part as a response to the [[Ideology|ideological]] backlash against radical varieties of [[second-wave feminism]], with the negative stereotypes it generated of the “ugly feminist” or the “anti-sex feminist”; in part the result of the belief that the successes of second-wave feminism had made it possible to reclaim aspects of femininity that had earlier been seen as disempowering, like make-up or stilettos.&lt;ref&gt;Natasha Walters, ''Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism'' (2010) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==

Linguistically, lipstick feminism proposed to [[semantics|semantically]] reclaim, for feminist usage, double-standard insult words, such as “slut”,&lt;ref name=wisegeek&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-lipstick-feminism.htm What is Lipstick Feminism]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to eliminate the [[social stigma]] applied to a woman whose sexual behaviour was "[[Patriarchy|patriarchically]]" interpreted to denote “immoral woman” and [[libertine]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Hollows/R. Mosely eds., ''Feminism in Popular Culture'' (2006) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Philosophically, lipstick feminism proposes that a woman can be [[Power (philosophy)|empowered]] — psychologically, socially, politically – by the wearing of [[make up|cosmetic make up]], sensually-appealing clothes, and the embrace of sexual allure for her own self-image as a confidently sexual being. The rhetoric of choice and empowerment is used to validate such overt sexual practices,&lt;ref&gt;Walters, p. 28 and p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; because they no longer represent coerced acquiescence to societally established [[gender role]]s, such as “the good girl”, “the decent woman”, “the abnegated mother”, “the virtuous sister”, ''et aliæ''.

Other feminists object that the so-called empowerment of lipstick feminism is a philosophic contradiction wherein a woman chooses to sexually objectify herself, and so ceases to be her own woman, in control neither of her self nor of her person.&lt;ref name=wisegeek/&gt; In an ongoing debate, lipstick feminism counter-proposes that the practice of sexual allure is a form of social [[Power (sociology)|power]] in the [[interpersonal relations]] between a man and a woman, which may occur in the realms of cultural, social, and gender equality.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Stiletto feminism===
Stiletto feminism, a more ideologically radical variety of lipstick feminism, sees the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] use of [[fetish fashion]] as empowering;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruthpadel.com/uncategorized/helmut-newton-and-stiletto-feminism/ Helmut Newton and Stiletto Feminism]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and extends the argument from the acceptance of makeup, to the validity of women practicing occupations specifically predicated upon female [[Beauty|physical beauty]], such as working as a [[Striptease|striptease dancer]] or as a [[pole dancing|pole dancer]], as well as [[Exhibitionism|flashing]] or lesbian (girl-on-girl) exhibitionism.

== In popular culture ==
* In the U.S. television series, ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', the 57th episode, “[[Night Five]]”, features a scene wherein the characters debate the merits of lipstick feminism. The female protagonist decides it is empowering, while determining that sex-negativism distracts from important issues like pay equity and "honest-to-God sexual harassment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The West Wing Continuity Guide|title=#313 (57) "Night Five"

[[File:Lurish-Sorna.jpg|320px|thumb|right|A Lur musician performing [[Sorna]] at a wedding ceremony]]

== Types of Music ==
Based on the songs, the Lurish music is divided into seven sections; 
* Music of lyrics and romantic songs: Including music regarding lyrics that is about the expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. These musics like Heylaw, Binâ-binâ, [[Khosrow and Shirin|Shirin &amp; Khosrow]] lyrics, Sârixâni and Miruna (Mirbaygi) are performed in different Lurish music [[mugham]]s.
* Music of Epic-Combat songs: These hymns represent the epic and combat values of the warriors among the tribes. The most famous examples of this section are Jange Loru and Dâya-Dâya.
* Music and songs of mourning: This music has more to do with the rituals and has been used extensively in mourning ceremonies from the ancient times. Čamari (also Čamariuna), Sahari, Šivani and Pâkotali are from the most famous of these moghams.
* Music and songs of seasons: music and special songs of different seasons like Barza-kuhi, Kuč-bâru and Mâla-jiri
* Music and songs related to work activities: To ease and speed up the work of nomadic men and women, these songs (e.g Barziari, Hawla)are sung individually or collectively.
* Comic music and songs: These are usually originated from impromptu satires about  people, places or objects and are sometimes accompanied by humorous dramatic movements of someone or people.
* Religious hymn-music: These are generally based on the words of [[Yarsanism|Yaresan]] (from the hymns of Ahle-haq), and their mystical and religious aspects are very deep.

== Music instruments ==
The most popular Lurish musical instruments include [[Sorna]], [[Dohol]], Tâl (Lurish [[kamancheh]]),&lt;ref&gt;Oloumo, M.(2015).Kamanche, the Bowed String Instrument of the Orient.International Journal of Arts and Commerce.Vol4, No 1,  92-101, available online at:[http://www.ijac.org.uk/January2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tonbak]] (Tomak), and the common Iranian traditional instruments. Meanwhile, the Lurish kamancheh is the only one    that is fundamentally different from other ethnic music instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/talllorestan/docs/_________________ تحقیق در مورد تال (کمانچه لرستان)]، سید رسول صدریه.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Lurs select the [[Dastgāh-e Māhur|Mâhur]]
as their basic musical step  to showcase the magnificence, grandeur and independence of their people.&lt;ref&gt;Majedi, H and S. Shamlukia, (2008): Investigating the impact of nature and the environment on the Iranian music.(In Persian) Environmental sciences and technology: volume13, Number2, Pages 95-103&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After 1979 revolution of Iran ===
After [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution of Iran]] due to intense encounters with musical performances, especially ethnic music, the amount of music participation in different parts of the life of the [[Lurs]] was reduced however in the past, cheerful music and lyrics were accompanied with collective dance.

The '''Mondialogo Engineering Award''' was established by [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] and [[UNESCO]] to encourage cooperation and dialogue between engineering people from different countries and cultures, working together across continents on a joint project activity. The award invites student engineers from universities around the world to apply for Award. It was supported by the World Federation of Engineering Organisations ([[WFEO]]), who promoted it to its national members and took part in the judging panel.
The scheme has closed with Daimler and UNESCO ending their partnership in 2010. It is not clear if an alternative sponsor or scheme will be created.

==Previous Rounds==

The first round of the competition 2005 ended with a symposium in Berlin while the second round in 2007 ended in Mumbai. In its first round, the Mondialogo Engineering Award brought over 1,700 young engineers from 79 countries together to work on engineering solutions tackling [[poverty]] and promoting [[sustainable development]] in all regions of the world. While in the second round 3200 students from 89 countries participated.

==Goals==

The Mondialogo Engineering Award invited engineering students in developing and developed countries to form international teams to create project proposals that address the [[Millennium Development Goals|United Nations Millennium Development]] to 1) eradicate [[extreme poverty]] and [[hunger]]; 2) achieve [[universal primary education]]; 3) promote [[gender equality]] and [[Empowerment|empower]] women; 4) reduce [[child mortality]]; 5) improve [[maternal health]]; 6) combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and other diseases; 7) ensure environmental [[sustainability]]; and 8) develop global partnerships for development. Mondialogo encourages proposals that will improve the [[quality of life]] in the developing world, particularly [[Poverty reduction|poverty eradication]] and the promotion of sustainable development.

==Procedure==

International [[Project team|Project Teams]] eligible to apply for the Mondialogo Engineering Award consisted of two student groups from two higher education establishments, with one group from a developing country and the other from a developed country. The Mondialogo Internet Portal www.mondialogo.org acts as a contact centre for groups to meet each other, aiming to function as a virtual office for inter-group communications. Teams had until April 2009 to develop and design their project proposals. An international jury then assessed the entries and decide on the awarding, which formed part of a festive ceremony in latter 2009. Key factors in the assessment are sustainability, technical quality, feasibility of the project proposals and the quality of the intercultural cooperation between the teams.

==Criteria==

The following criteria were taken into consideration when assessing the final project proposals:
Quality of project – quality of analysis and understanding of a relevant problem, quality and innovativeness of project idea and design, and quality of presentation of the project proposal 
Degree to which the project addresses the Millennium Development Goals, especially poverty eradication and sustainable social development 
Relevance of project proposal in mitigating negative impacts of [[climate change]] 
Feasibility of the proposed project – demonstration of the practicality of implementing the proposed project, and benefit to local community; 
Quality of Dialogue – level of communication within project teams and student groups, balanced involvement of both student groups

==Awards==

Ten Mondialogo Engineering Awards of €20,000 went to teams with the top project proposals, with an Honourable Mention and €5,000 earmarked for twenty more teams. Representatives of the 30 finalist project teams (consisting of one member of each student group two members of each International Project Team) were invited to the Mondialogo Engineering Award Symposium. At the Symposium, each team made a presentation of their project proposal, followed by an Award Ceremony where the Mondialogo Engineering Awards and Honourable Mentions were announced. All participating teams that submit project proposals received an official certificate in recognition of their achievements and their commitment to the worldwide exchange of knowledge and intercultural dialogue. Additionally, Daimler and UNESCO publicized the 30 winning projects.

==Eligibility to participate==

Students from all fields of engineering were eligible to register for the Mondialogo Engineering Award. All members of the two (or more) student groups must have been officially registered as students at universities, technical colleges or similar institutions through to May 2009. Employees of commercial institutions and companies or students above 35 years of age were not eligible to participate.

'''Narratology''' is the study of [[narrative]] and [[narrative structure]] and the ways that these affect our perception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/narratology/modules/introduction.html General Introduction to Narratology], College of Liberal Arts, [[Purdue University]]&lt;/ref&gt; While in principle the word may refer to any systematic study of narrative, in practice its usage is rather more restricted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It is an anglicisation of French ''narratologie'', coined by [[Tzvetan Todorov]] (''Grammaire du Décaméron'', 1969).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Prince]], "Narratology," ''Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', ed. Michael Groden and Martin Kreiswirth (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994) 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Narratology is applied retrospectively as well to work predating its coinage. Its theoretical lineage is traceable to [[Aristotle]] (''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'') but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the [[Russian Formalists]], particularly [[Vladimir Propp]] (''Morphology of the Folktale'', 1928), and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s theories of [[heteroglossia]], [[dialogism]], and the [[chronotope]] first presented in ''The Dialogic Imagination'' (1975).

==History==
The origins of narratology lend to it a strong association with the [[Structuralism | structuralist]] quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content, by analogy with the [[Formal grammar|grammars]] used as a basis for [[parsing]] [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in some forms of [[linguistics]]. This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today; [[Percy Lubbock]]'s work in [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]] (''The Craft of Fiction'', 1921) offers a case in point.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1966 a special issue of the journal ''Communications'' proved highly influential, becoming considered a program for research into the field and even a [[manifesto]].&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"/&gt; It included articles by [[Barthes]], Claude Brémond, [[Genette]], [[Greimas]], [[Tzvetan Todorov|Todorov]] and others, which in turn often referred to the works of [[Vladimir Propp]]&lt;ref name="Herman2005p574"&gt;Herman, David and Jahn, Manfred and Ryan, Marie-Laure (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA574 ''Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory''], pp.574–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bamberg1998p40"&gt;Bamberg, Michael G. W. (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HozLdEhiN-8C&amp;pg=PA40 ''Oral Versions of Personal Experience: Three Decades of Narrative Analysis. A Special Issue of the Journal of Narrative and Life History''], p.40{{Dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1895–1970).

[[Jonathan Culler]] (2001) describes narratology as comprising many strands 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
implicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between "story," a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of their manifestation in discourse, and "discourse," the discursive presentation or narration of events.'&lt;ref&gt;
Jonathan Culler, ''The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction'', Routledge Classics ed. (London: Routledge, 2001) 189.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Russian Formalists]] first proposed such a distinction, employing the couplet [[fabula and sujet]]. A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse, e.g. ''histoire''/''discours'', ''histoire''/''récit'', ''story''/''plot''. The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to two quite different traditions: thematic (Propp, Bremond, Greimas, Dundes, et al.) and modal (Genette, Prince, et al.) narratology.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Ronen, "Paradigm Shift in Plot Models: An Outline of the History of Narratology", ''Poetics Today'', 11(4):817–842 (Winter 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The former is mainly limited to a semiotic formalization of the sequences of the actions told, while the latter examines the manner of their telling, stressing voice, point of view, transformation of the chronological order, rhythm and frequency. Many authors (Sternberg, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg]], ''Expositional Modes and Temporal Ordering in Fiction'', (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1993.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]], 1984, and [[Raphaël Baroni|Baroni]], 2007)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphaël Baroni]], ''La Tension narrative. Suspense, curiosité et surprise'', (Paris: Seuil, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; have insisted that thematic and modal narratology should not be looked at separately, especially when dealing with the function and interest of narrative sequence and plot.

[[James Phelan (literary scholar) | James Phelan]], editor of ''Narrative'' (the journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative), has written numerous books and articles on narrative theory (see reference list). With [[Frederick Luis Aldama]], [[Brian McHale]] and [[Robyn Warhol]], Phelan directs [[Project Narrative]] at [[The Ohio State University]]:)

==Applications==
Designating work as narratological is to some extent dependent more on the academic discipline in which it takes place than any theoretical position advanced. The approach is applicable to any narrative, and in its classic studies, vis-a-vis Propp, non-literary narratives were commonly taken up. Still the term "narratology" is most typically applied to [[literary theory]] and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[film theory]] and (to a lesser extent) [[film criticism]]. Atypical applications of narratological methodologies would include [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] studies of oral storytelling ([[William Labov]]) and in [[conversation analysis]] or [[discourse analysis]] that deal with narratives arising in the course of spontaneous verbal interaction. It also includes the study of videogames, [[graphic novels]], the [[infinite canvas]], and narrative sculptures linked to [[topology]] and [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt; Félix Lambert, 2015, "[https://www.academia.edu/11744670/Narrative_sculptures_graph_theory_topology_and_new_perspectives_in_narratology Narrative sculptures: graph theory, topology and new perspectives in narratology]." &lt;/ref&gt;
However, constituent analysis of a type where [[narreme]]s are considered to be the basic units of narrative structure could fall within the areas of [[linguistics]], [[semiotics]], or [[literary theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann, "[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1975a-theonarreme.pdf Théorie des narrèmes et algorithmes narratifs]," ''Poetics'' 4.1 (1975): 19–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nazareth College''' is a [[coeducational]], [[Private colleges|private]], religiously independent college in [[Pittsford, New York|Pittsford]], a suburb of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Founded by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] in 1924, the college offers more than 60 undergraduate majors &lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/academics]&lt;/ref&gt;and 24 graduate programs. Alumni and locals commonly refer to the school as "Naz" for short. 

==History==
[[File:Nazareth College.JPG|thumbnail|right|Golisano Academic Center, Nazareth College]]

===Founding===
At the request of [[Thomas Francis Hickey (bishop)|Bishop Thomas Francis Hickey]] of Rochester, five [http://www.ssjrochester.org/ Sisters of St. Joseph] founded Nazareth College of Rochester in 1924. The first class was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in [[Rochester, New York]]. The original mansion that housed the college was known as "the Glass House." At that time, the college offered Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, each with a [[liberal arts]] core. In response to increasing enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility in 1928 at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/nazareth_college/12190480324/ 402 Augustine Street].

===Move to East Avenue===
In January 1942, the college moved to its present campus on East Avenue in the suburb of [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]]. In the 1950s, the college responded to the need for graduate study by adding majors and by the 1970s offered programs in teacher education and social work.  Study abroad programs and intercollegiate sports were also added in the 1970s. During this time, the college became co-educational and independent of the Roman Catholic Church. 

Nazareth competed in men’s intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 1977. The official nickname of the sports teams became the Golden Flyers — golden for the Nazareth color, and flyers for the bird-like symbol that is part of the old Nazareth logo. Today, Nazareth supports 25 varsity teams. The most recent sport, added in 2018, is women's ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/news/2017/June/331/chris-baudo-named-women-s-hockey-coach-at-nazareth-college].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
In the early 2000s, the college purchased adjacent land from the Sisters of St. Joseph, including the former Motherhouse and Infirmary. This acquisition doubled the campus size to its current 150 acres.  As a result of support from college benefactors (including Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex), the Motherhouse became the Golisano Academic Center. The Infirmary became George Hall, a residence hall that also houses a coffeehouse and late night study area. The decade of the 2000s also saw the construction of additional student housing, including Portka Hall, Clock Tower Commons, and the Lyons and Breen apartment buildings.

In 2003, 30 years after becoming religiously independent, Nazareth College was removed from ''The Official Catholic Directory,'' having been declared no longer a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] institution by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester|Rochester Bishop]] Matthew H. Clark. It was the second time since [[Pope John Paul II]] issued [[Ex Corde Ecclesiae]], the apostolic constitution on Catholic universities in 1990, a bishop declared a historically Catholic college or university to be not Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=4674
|title = New York Archdiocese Says Marist College 'No Longer Catholic'|accessdate = 2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Nazareth added Peckham Hall, the Integrated Center for Math and Science. Named after lead donors Nancy and Larry Peckham, the $30 million facility supports majors in math and science fields, as well as education programs. It also provides important learning facilities for students in health and human services programs.

In 2015, the York Wellness and Rehabilitation Institute opened after an extensive renovation/expansion of Carroll Hall consolidated and doubled the size of the clinics associated with the college's School of Health and Human Services and added collaboration space.

==Causes==

New World Syndrome is linked to a change from a [[traditional diet]]  and [[physical exercise|exercise]] to a [[Western diet]] and a sedentary lifestyle. Along with the lack of money. Traditional occupations of indigenous people—such as fishing, farming, and hunting—tended to involve constant activity, whereas modern office jobs do not. The introduction of modern transportation such as automobiles also decreased physical exertion.&lt;ref name="Atlantic2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shell|first=Ellen Ruppel|year=2001|title=New World Syndrome - Spam and turkey tails have turned Micronesians into Macronesians.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Obsessive–compulsive disorder''' ('''OCD''') is a [[mental disorder]] where people feel the need to check things repeatedly, perform [[compulsive behavior|certain routines repeatedly]] (called "rituals"), or have [[intrusive thoughts|certain thoughts repeatedly]] (called "obsessions").&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Common activities include [[hand washing]], counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Some may have difficulty throwing things out.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected.&lt;ref name=NIH2015&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|website=U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)|author=The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)|date=January 2016|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723194024/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|archivedate=23 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes up more than an hour a day.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|pages=237–242|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; The condition is associated with [[tic disorders|tics]], [[anxiety disorder]], and an increased risk of [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ang2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): A systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=25 March 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with both [[identical twins]] more often affected than both non-identical twins.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Some cases have been documented to occur following [[infection]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and requires ruling out other drug related or medical causes.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Rating scales such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS) can be used to assess the severity.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenske JN, Schwenk TL | title = Obsessive compulsive disorder: diagnosis and management | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–45 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19621834 | doi =  | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0801/p239.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140512222223/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0801/p239.html | archivedate = 12 May 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other disorders with similar symptoms include anxiety disorder, [[major depressive disorder]], [[eating disorders]], [[tic disorders]], and [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
Treatment involves [[psychotherapy|counseling]], such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and sometimes [[antidepressants]] such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) or [[clomipramine]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ve2014 /&gt; CBT for OCD involves increasing exposure to what causes the problems while not allowing the repetitive behavior to occur.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grant JE | title = Clinical practice: Obsessive-compulsive disorder. | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 371 | issue = 7 | pages = 646–53 | date = 14 August 2014 | pmid = 25119610 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp1402176}}&lt;/ref&gt; While clomipramine appears to work as well as SSRIs, it has greater side effects so is typically reserved as a second line treatment.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt; [[Atypical antipsychotic]]s may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant cases but are also associated with an increased risk of side effects.&lt;ref name=Ve2014&gt;{{cite journal |last=Veale |first= D|last2= Miles|first2=S |last3=Smallcombe |first3= N|last4=Ghezai |first4=H |last5=Goldacre |first5=B|last6=Hodsoll |first6=J |date=29 November 2014 |title=Atypical antipsychotic augmentation in SSRI treatment refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume= 14|issue= |pages=317 |doi=10.1186/s12888-014-0317-5 |pmid=25432131 |pmc=4262998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dec2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Decloedt EH, Stein DJ | title = Current trends in drug treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 6 | issue = |pages = 233–42 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20520787 | pmc = 2877605 | doi = 10.2147/NDT.S3149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without treatment, the condition often lasts decades.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
OCD can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Certain groups of symptoms usually occur together. These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process. The standard assessment tool for OCD, the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS), has 13 predefined categories of symptoms. These symptoms fit into three to five groupings.&lt;ref name="Leckman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leckman|first1=JF|last2=Bloch|first2=MH|last3=King|first3=RA|title=Symptom dimensions and subtypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a developmental perspective.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=21–33|pmid=19432385|pmc=3181902}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta analysis|meta analytic]] review of symptom structures found a four factor structure (grouping) to be most reliable.  The observed groups included a "symmetry factor", a "forbidden thoughts factor", a "cleaning factor", and a "hoarding factor".  The "symmetry factor" correlated highly with obsessions related to ordering, counting, and symmetry, as well as repeating compulsions.  The "forbidden thoughts factor" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The "cleaning factor" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The "hoarding factor" only involved hoarding related obsessions and compulsions, and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=MH|last2=Landeros-Weisenberger|first2=A|last3=Rosario|first3=MC|last4=Pittenger|first4=C|last5=Leckman|first5=JF|title=Meta-analysis of the symptom structure of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=December 2008|volume=165|issue=12|pages=1532–42|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08020320|pmid=18923068|pmc=3972003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While OCD has been considered a homogenous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective, many of the putative neuropsychological deficits may be due to comorbid disorders.  Furthermore, some subtypes have been associated with improvement in performance on certain tasks such as pattern recognition (washing subtype) and spatial working memory (obsessive thought subtype). Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response.  Neuroimaging studies on this have been too few, and the subtypes examined have differed too much to draw any conclusions.  On the other hand, subtype dependent treatment response has been studied, and the hoarding subtype has consistently responded least to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=D|last2=Abramowitz|first2=JS|last3=Calamari|first3=JE|last4=Kyrios|first4=M|last5=Radomsky|first5=A|last6=Sookman|first6=D|last7=Taylor|first7=S|last8=Wilhelm|first8=S|title=A critical evaluation of obsessive-compulsive disorder subtypes: symptoms versus mechanisms.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|date=July 2004|volume=24|issue=3|pages=283–313|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.04.003|pmid=15245833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsessions are thoughts that recur and persist, despite efforts to ignore or confront them.&lt;ref name=Review10&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Y|last1=Markarian|first2=MJ|last2=Larson|first3=MA|last3=Aldea|first4=SA|last4=Baldwin|first5=D|last5=Good|first6=A|last6=Berkeljon|first7=TK|last7=Murphy|first8=EA|last8=Storch|first9=D|last9=McKay| title = Multiple pathways to functional impairment in obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = [[Clinical Psychology Review]] |volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 78–88 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19853982 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or [[Compulsive behavior|compulsions]], to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, vary in their clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying{{sfn|Baer|2001|pp=33, 78}}{{sfn|Baer|2001|p=xiv}} or intrusions related to "[[Relationship obsessive–compulsive disorder|relationship rightness]]".&lt;ref name = Doron2013&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G|last1=Doron|first2=O|last2=Szepsenwol|first3=E|last3=Karp|first4=N|last4=Gal| title = Obsessing About Intimate-Relationships: Testing the Double Relationship-Vulnerability Hypothesis | journal = [[Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry]] |volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 433–440 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23792752 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbtep.2013.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself—such as God, the Devil, or disease—will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about. Other individuals with OCD may experience the sensation of invisible protrusions emanating from their bodies, or have the feeling that inanimate objects are ensouled.&lt;ref name=Mash&gt;{{cite book|first1=Eric J.|last1=Mash|first2=David A.|last2=Wolfe|title=Abnormal child psychology|edition=3|date=2005|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson Wadsworth]]|location=[[Belmont, California]]|page=197|isbn= 978-1305105423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people with OCD experience [[sexual obsessions]] that may involve intrusive thoughts or images of "kissing, touching, fondling, [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], intercourse, [[incest]], and [[rape]]" with "strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals, and religious figures", and can include "[[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]] content" with persons of any age.&lt;ref name="Osgood"&gt;{{cite web|first=Deborah|last=Osgood-Hynes|url=http://www.raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf|title=Thinking Bad Thoughts|publisher=MGH/McLean OCD Institute|location=Belmont, Massachusetts|accessdate=December 30, 2006|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115230001/http://raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, some disquieting sexual thoughts at times are normal, but people with OCD may attach extraordinary significance to the thoughts. For example, obsessive fears about [[sexual orientation]] can appear to the person with OCD, and even to those around them, as a crisis of [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref name="ItMoved"&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Phillipson|url=http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php|title=I Think It Moved|website=OCDOnline.com|publisher=Center for Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy|location=New York City|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218215734/http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php |archive-date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sexfears"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark-Ameen|last=Johnson|url=http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php|title=I'm Gay and You're Not : Understanding Homosexuality Fears|website=brainphysics.com|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505042912/http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php |archive-date=5 May 2009|accessdate=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the troubling thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or self-loathing.&lt;ref name="Osgood" /&gt;

Most people with OCD understand that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, they feel that they must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in [[compulsive hoarding]] might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate as to whether or not hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=DL|last2=Timpano|first2=KR|last3=Wheaton|first3=MG|last4=Greenberg|first4=BD|last5=Miguel|first5=EC|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder and its related disorders: a reappraisal of obsessive-compulsive spectrum concepts.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=12|issue=2|pages=131–48|pmid=20623919|pmc=3181955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD sometimes manifests without overt compulsions, referred to as Primarily Obsessional OCD. OCD without overt compulsions could, by one estimate, characterize as many as 50 percent to 60 percent of OCD cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Myrna M.|last1=Weisman|title = The cross national epidemiology of obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = New Developments in Obsessive-Compulsive and Spectrum Disorders|  volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 6–9 |date = May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compulsions ===
{{Main|Compulsive behavior}}

[[File:Derma me.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Dermatillomania|Skin-picking disorder]]]]

Some people with OCD perform compulsive rituals because they inexplicably feel they have to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so [[idiosyncratic]] or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive [[excoriation disorder|skin picking]], [[trichotillomania|hair-pulling]], [[nail biting]], and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled to follow through with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5|url=http://www.dsm5.org/documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|page=7|year=2013|accessdate=12 Apr 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common compulsions include hand washing, cleaning, checking things (e.g., locks on doors), repeating actions (e.g., turning on and off switches), ordering items in a certain way, and requesting reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Boyd MA |title=Psychiatric Nursing |journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=13–26 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3UUuXw7ISM0C&amp;pg=PA418|isbn=978-0-397-55178-1|pmid=8119793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsions are different from [[tics]] (such as touching, tapping, rubbing, or blinking)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Storch|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder in youth with and without a chronic tic disorder|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/17345600|journal=Depression and Anxiety|year=2008|volume=25|issue=9|pages=761–767|doi=10.1002/da.20304|pmid=17345600|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[stereotypic movement disorder|stereotyped movements]] (such as head banging, body rocking, or self-biting), which usually aren't as complex and aren't precipitated by obsessions.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between compulsions and complex tics.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; About 10% to 40% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Conelea|year=2014|title=Tic-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): phenomenology and treatment outcome in the Pediatric OCD Treatment Study II|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=53|issue=12|pages=1308–16|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2014.09.014|pmid=25457929|display-authors=etal|pmc=4254546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People rely on compulsions as an escape from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the intrusive thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfil their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean? Subtopic: "Skin Barrier Properties and Effect of Hand Hygiene Practices", Paragraph 5. |accessdate=26 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421205614/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |archivedate=21 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with OCD can use rationalizations to explain their behavior; however, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.

=== Insight ===
The DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD.  Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true.  Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-complsive beliefs are probably true.  Absence of insight make obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.&lt;ref name="Sadock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=LWW|location=95218|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overvalued ideas ===
Some people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially. There are severe cases in which the person has an unshakeable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to differentiate from [[psychosis|psychotic disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Dwyer, Anne-Marie Carter, Obsessive–compulsive disorder and delusions revisited, The British Journal of Psychiatry (2000) 176: 281–284&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive performance ===
A 2013 meta-analysis reported that people with OCD to have mild but wide-ranging cognitive deficits; significantly regarding [[spatial memory]], to a lesser extent with [[verbal memory]], [[Verbal fluency test|fluency]], executive function, and processing speed, while auditory attention was not significantly affected.&lt;ref name=shin&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shin NY, Lee TY, Kim E, Kwon JS | title = Cognitive functioning in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Medicine | pages = 1–10 | date = 19 July 2013 | pmid = 23866289 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291713001803 | volume=44| issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People with OCD show impairment in formulating an organizational strategy for coding information, set-shifting, and motor and cognitive inhibition.&lt;ref name="Aydin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Çetinay Aydın P, Güleç Öyekçin D | title = Cognitive functions in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Turk Psikiyatri Dergisi (Turkish Journal of Psychiatry) | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 266–74 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24310094 | doi=10.5080/u7172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 1–2% of children are affected by OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Anna M.|last2=Nadai|first2=Alessandro S.

== Causes ==
{{Main|Cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder}}
The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Both environmental and genetic factors are believed to play a role. Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

=== Genetics ===
There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with [[identical twins]] more often affected than non-identical twins.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Further, individuals with OCD are more likely to have first-degree family members exhibiting the same disorders than do matched controls. In cases where OCD develops during childhood, there is a much stronger familial link in the disorder than cases in which OCD develops later in adulthood. In general, genetic factors account for 45–65% of the variability in OCD symptoms in children diagnosed with the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid19665647"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abramowitz JS, Taylor S, McKay D | title = Obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9688 | pages = 491–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19665647 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60240-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study found evidence supporting the possibility of a heritable risk for OCD.&lt;ref name="Menzies et al, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Menzies L, Achard S, Chamberlain SR, Fineberg N, Chen CH, del Campo N, Sahakian BJ, Robbins TW, Bullmore E | title = Neurocognitive endophenotypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Brain | volume = 130 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 3223–36 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17855376 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awm205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been postulated by [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] that moderate versions of compulsive behavior may have had evolutionary advantages. Examples would be moderate constant checking of hygiene, the hearth or the environment for enemies. Similarly, [[hoarding]] may have had evolutionary advantages.

Functional neuroimaging during symptom provocation has observed abnormal activity in the [[orbitofrontal cortex]], left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], right [[premotor cortex]], left superior [[Superior temporal gyrus|temporal gyrus]], [[globus pallidus externus]], [[hippocampus]] and right [[uncus]]. Weaker foci of abnormal activity were found in the left [[caudate nucleus|caudate]], [[posterior cingulate cortex]] and [[superior parietal lobule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rotge|first1=Jean-Yves|last2=Guehl|first2=Dominique|last3=Dilharreguy|first3=Bixente|last4=Cuny|first4=Emmanuel|last5=Tignol|first5=Jean|last6=Bioulac|first6=Bernard|last7=Allard|first7=Michele|last8=Burbaud|first8=Pierre|last9=Aouizerate|first9=Bruno|title=Provocation of obsessive–compulsive symptoms: a quantitative voxel-based meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies|journal=Journal of Psychiatry &amp; Neuroscience : JPN|date=3 March 2017|volume=33|issue=5|pages=405–412|pmc=2527721|issn=1180-4882|pmid=18787662}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an older meta analysis of functional neuroimaging in OCD reported the only consistent functional neuroimaging findings have been increased activity in the orbital gyrus and head of the caudate nucleus, while ACC activation abnormalities were too inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteside|first1=Stephen P.|last2=Port|first2=John D.|last3=Abramowitz|first3=Jonathan S.|title=A meta–analysis of functional neuroimaging in obsessive–compulsive disorder|journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging|volume=132|issue=1|pages=69–79|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2004.07.001|pmid=15546704|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta analysis comparing affective and non affective tasks observed differences with controls in regions implicated in salience, habit, goal ditected behavior, self-referential thinking and cognitive control.

People with OCD evince increased [[grey matter]] volumes in bilateral [[lenticular nucleus|lenticular nuclei]], extending to the caudate nuclei, with decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal [[medial frontal gyrus|medial frontal]]/[[anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] gyri.&lt;ref name="Radua and Mataix-Cols, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Radua J, Mataix-Cols D | title = Voxel-wise meta-analysis of grey matter changes in obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 195 | issue = 5 | pages = 393–402 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19880927 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.055046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=radua2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Radua J, van den Heuvel OA, Surguladze S, Mataix-Cols D | title = Meta-analytical comparison of voxel-based morphometry studies in obsessive-compulsive disorder vs other anxiety disorders | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 7 | pages = 701–711 | date = 5 July 2010 | pmid = 20603451 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings contrast with those in people with other anxiety disorders, who evince decreased (rather than increased) [[grey matter]] volumes in bilateral [[lenticular nucleus|lenticular]] / caudate nuclei, as well as decreased grey matter volumes in bilateral dorsal [[medial frontal gyrus|medial frontal]]/[[anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] gyri.&lt;ref name=radua2010 /&gt; Increased white matter volume and decreased fractional anisotropy in anterior midline tracts has been observed in OCD, possibly indicating increased fiber crossings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radua|first1=J|last2=Grau|first2=M|last3=van den Heuvel|first3=OA|last4=Thiebaut de Schotten|first4=M|last5=Stein|first5=DJ|last6=Canales-Rodríguez|first6=EJ|last7=Catani|first7=M|last8=Mataix-Cols|first8=D|title=Multimodal voxel-based meta-analysis of white matter abnormalities in obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=June 2014|volume=39|issue=7|pages=1547–57|doi=10.1038/npp.2014.5|pmid=24407265|pmc=4023155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive models ===

Generally two categories of models for OCD have been postulated, the first involving deficits in executive function, and the second involving deficits in modulatory control.  The first category of executive dysfunction is based on the observed structural and functional abnormalities in the dlPFC, striatum, and thalamus.  The second category involving dysfunctional modulatory control primarily relies on observed functional and structural differences in the ACC, mPFC and OFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedlander|first1=L|last2=Desrocher|first2=M|title=Neuroimaging studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults and children.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=January 2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=32–49|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2005.06.010|pmid=16242823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=ER|last2=Taylor|first2=SF|title=Cognitive neuroscience of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America|date=September 2014|volume=37|issue=3|pages=337–52|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.05.004|pmid=25150566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One proposed model suggests that dysfunction in the [[orbitofrontal cortex|OFC]] leads to improper valuation of behaviors and decreased behavioral control, while the observed alterations in amygdala activations leads to exaggerated fears and representations of negative stimuli.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=J|last2=Ahmari|first2=SE|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors.|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=2015|volume=9|pages=171|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmid=26733823|pmc=4681810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the heterogeneity of OCD symptoms, studies differentiating between symptoms have been performed. Symptom specific neuroimaging abnormalities include the hyperactivity of caudate and ACC in checking rituals, while finding increased activity of cortical and cerebellar regions in contamination related symptoms. Neuroimaging differentiating between content of intrusive thoughts have found differences between aggressive as opposed to taboo thoughts, finding increased connectivity of the amygdala, ventral striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in aggressive symptoms, while observing increased connectivity between the ventral striatum and insula in sexual/religious intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakao|first1=Tomohiro|last2=Okada|first2=Kayo|last3=Kanba|first3=Shigenobu|title=Neurobiological model of obsessive-compulsive disorder: Evidence from recent neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=August 2014|volume=68|issue=8|pages=587–605|doi=10.1111/pcn.12195|pmid=24762196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model proposes that affective dysregulation links excessive reliance on habit based action selection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barahona-Corrêa|first1=JB|last2=Camacho|first2=M|last3=Castro-Rodrigues|first3=P|last4=Costa|first4=R|last5=Oliveira-Maia|first5=AJ|title=From Thought to Action: How the Interplay Between Neuroscience and Phenomenology Changed Our Understanding of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2015|volume=6|pages=1798|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01798|pmid=26635696|pmc=4655583}}&lt;/ref&gt; with compulsions.  This is supported by the observation that those with OCD demonstrate decreased activation of the [[ventral striatum]] when anticipating monetary  reward, as well as increase functional connectivity between the VS and the OFC.  Furthermore, those with OCD demonstrate reduced performance in pavlovian fear extinction tasks, hyper responsiveness in the amygdala to fearful stimuli, and hypo-resonsiveness in the amygdala when exposed to positively valanced stimuli.  Stimulation of the [[nucleus accumbens]] has also been observed to effectively alleviate both obsessions and compulsions, supporting the role of affective dysregulation in generating both.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

=== Neurobiological ===

From the observation of the efficacy of antidepressants in OCD, a serotonin hypothesis of OCD has been formulated. Studies of peripheral markers of serotonin, as well as challenges with proserotonergic compounds have yielded inconsistent results, including evidence pointing towards basal hyperactivity of serotonergic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Kenneth L|title=Neuropsychopharmacology : the fifth generation of progress : an official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-7817-2837-9|pages=1609–1610|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serotonin receptor and transporter binding studies have yielded conflicting results, including higher and lower serotonin receptor [[5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin transporter]] binding potentials that were normalized by treatment with SSRIs. Despite inconsistencies in the types of abnormalities found, evidence points towards dysfunction of serotonergic systems in OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muller |first1=Christian P |last2=Jacobs |first2=Barry L |author3=A Dijk|author4=A Klompmakers|author5=D Denys|title=Handbook of the behavioral neurobiology of serotonin|date=2009|publisher=Academic|location=London|isbn=978-0-12-374634-4|pages=547–558|edition=1st|chapter=4.4 The Serotonergic System in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbitofrontal cortex]] overactivity is attenuated in people who have successfully responded to [[SSRI]] medication, a result believed to be caused by increased stimulation of [[serotonin]] receptors [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin receptor|5-HT2C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim KW, Lee DY | title = Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Associated With a Left Orbitofrontal Infarct | journal = Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 88–89 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11884667 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14.1.88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex relationship between dopamine and OCD has been observed. Although antipsychotics, which act by antagonizing dopamine receptors may improve some cases of OCD, they frequently exacerbate others.  Antipsychotics, in the low doses used to treat OCD, may actually increased the release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, through inhibiting autoreceptors. Further complicating things is the efficacy of amphetamines, decreased [[dopamine transporter]] activity observed in OCD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Jesse|last2=Ahmari|first2=Susanne E.|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=17 December 2015|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmc=4681810|issn=1662-5137|pmid=26733823}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low levels of D2 binding in the striatum.&lt;ref name="glutamate" /&gt;  Furthermore, increased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens after deep brain stimulation correlates with improvement in symptoms, pointing to reduced dopamine release in the striatum playing a role in generating symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graat|first1=I|last2=Figee|first2=M|last3=Denys|first3=D|editor1-last=Pittinger|editor1-first=C|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Phenomenology, Pathophysiology and Treatment|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=Neurotransmitter Dysregulation in OCD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abnormalities in glutaminergic neurotransmission have implicated in OCD. Findings such as increased cerebrospinal glutamate, less consistent abnormalities observed in neuroimaging studies, and the efficacy of some glutaminergic drugs such as [[riluzole]] have implicated glutamate in OCD.&lt;ref name="glutamate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittenger|first1=Christopher|last2=Bloch|first2=Michael H.|last3=Williams|first3=Kyle|title=GLUTAMATE ABNORMALITIES IN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER: NEUROBIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND TREATMENT|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|date=3 March 2017|volume=132|issue=3|pages=314–332|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.09.006|pmc=3205262|issn=0163-7258|pmid=21963369}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OCD has been associated with reduced [[N-Acetylaspartic acid]] in the mPFC, which is thought to reflect neuron density or functionality, although the exact interpretation has not been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aoki|first1=Y|last2=Aoki|first2=A|last3=Suwa|first3=H|title=Reduction of N-acetylaspartate in the medial prefrontal cortex correlated with symptom severity in obsessive-compulsive disorder: meta-analyses of (1)H-MRS studies.|journal=Translational Psychiatry|date=14 August 2012|volume=2|issue=8|pages=e153|doi=10.1038/tp.2012.78|pmid=22892718|pmc=3432192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Formal diagnosis may be performed by a psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or other licensed mental health professional. To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.&lt;ref name="Quick"&gt;''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.

Compulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.

Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.&lt;ref name="Quick" /&gt; It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the peron's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the people’s condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009" /&gt;

OCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55–60|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===
OCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD). OCD is [[egodystonic]], meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's [[self-concept]].&lt;ref name="Aardema, F. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aardema&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aardema F., O'Connor |year = 2003 | title = Seeing white bears that are not there: Inference processes in obsessions | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 23–37 | doi=10.1891/jcop.17.1.23.58270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because ego dystonic disorders go against a person's self-concept, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is [[egosyntonic]]—marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their [[self-image]], or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.

As a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;Carter, K. "Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder." PSYC 210 lecture: Oxford College of Emory University. Oxford, GA. 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast people with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise, and they tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

== Management ==
A form of psychotherapy called "[[cognitive behavioral therapy]]" (CBT) and [[psychotropic medication]]s are first-line treatments for OCD.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NICE2005 /&gt; Other forms of psychotherapy, such as [[psychodynamic]] and [[psychoanalysis]] may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but in 2007 the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) noted a lack of [[Scientific control|controlled studies]] showing their effectiveness "in dealing with the core symptoms of OCD".&lt;ref name="APAguidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koran LM, Hanna GL, Hollander E, Nestadt G, Simpson HB | title = Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 5–53 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17849776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with OCD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Therapy ===

[[File:Pennsylvania Capitol front door keyhole.jpg|thumb|One exposure and ritual prevention activity would be to check the lock only once, and then leave]]

The specific technique used in CBT is called [[exposure and response prevention]] (ERP) which involves teaching the person to deliberately come into contact with the situations that trigger the obsessive thoughts and fears ("exposure"), without carrying out the usual compulsive acts associated with the obsession ("response prevention"), thus gradually learning to tolerate the discomfort and anxiety associated with not performing the ritualistic behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly "contaminated" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a "contaminated" location, such as a school.) That is the "exposure". The "ritual prevention" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly [[habituation|habituates]] to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more "contaminated" or not checking the lock at all—again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;Huppert &amp; Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (1),'' 66 – 70 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323025324/http://baojournal.com/ |date=23 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP has a strong evidence base, and it is considered the most effective treatment for OCD.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com" /&gt; However, this claim was doubted by some researchers in 2000 who criticized the quality of many studies.&lt;ref name="pmid10910778"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klein DF | title = Flawed meta-analyses comparing psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 8 | pages = 1204–11 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10910778 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.8.1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has generally been accepted that psychotherapy, in combination with psychiatric medication, is more effective than either option alone.

=== Medication ===

[[File:Anafranil Japan.jpg|thumb|A blister pack of [[clomipramine]] under the brand name ''Anafranil'']]

The medications most frequently used are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs).&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt; [[Clomipramine]], a medication belonging to the class of [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, appears to work as well as SSRIs but has a higher rate of side effects.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt;

SSRIs are a second line treatment of adult obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.&lt;ref name=NICE2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Core interventions in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)|series=Information about NICE Clinical Guideline 31|publisher=UK National Health Service (NHS)|date=November 2005|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112001813/https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|archivedate=12 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; people treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Arroll B, Elley CR, Fishman T, Goodyear-Smith FA, Kenealy T, Blashki G, Kerse N, Macgillivray S | title = Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = |issue = 3 | pages = CD007954 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19588448 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007954 | url = https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/85b92403-d474-4e5a-b606-65f7e0f86575|editor1-last = Arroll | editor1-first = Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825+ |title=Review Finds SSRIs Modestly Effective in Short-Term Treatment of OCD|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413110435/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825 |archivedate=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term (6–24&amp;nbsp;weeks) treatment trials and in discontinuation trials with durations of 28–52&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fineberg NA, Brown A, Reghunandanan S, Pampaloni I | title = Evidence-based pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1173–91 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22226028 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145711001829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070,020990s032lbl.pdf |title=Sertraline prescribing information |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616011817/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070%2C020990s032lbl.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |title=Paroxetine prescribing information |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219055046/https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the National Institute of Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommended [[antipsychotic]]s for OCD that does not improve with SSRI treatment.&lt;ref name="Ve2014" /&gt; For OCD there is tentative evidence for [[risperidone]] and insufficient evidence for [[olanzapine]].  [[Quetiapine]] is no better than placebo with regard to primary outcomes, but small effects were found in terms of YBOCS score.  The efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine are limited by the insufficient number of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Komossa|first=K|author2=Depping, AM|author3= Meyer, M|author4= Kissling, W|author5= Leucht, S|title=Second-generation antipsychotics for obsessive compulsive disorder.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 Dec 2010|issue=12|pages=CD008141|pmid=21154394|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008141.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review article found two studies that indicated that [[aripiprazole]] was "effective in the short-term" and found that "[t]here was a small effect-size for risperidone or anti-psychotics in general in the short-term"; however, the study authors found "no evidence for the effectiveness of quetiapine or olanzapine in comparison to placebo."&lt;ref name="Ve2014" /&gt; While quetiapine may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant OCD, these drugs are often poorly tolerated, and have metabolic side effects that limit their use.

A guideline by the APA suggested that [[dextroamphetamine]] may be considered by itself after more well supported treatments have been tried.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koran|first1=Lorrin|last2=Hanna|first2=Gregory|last3=Hollander|first3=Eric|last4=Nestadt|first4=Gerald|last5=Helen|first5=Simpson|title=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/ocd.pdf|website=American Psychiatric Association|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedures ===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) has been found to have effectiveness in some severe and refractory cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cybulska Eva M | year = 2006 | title = Obsessive Compulsive disorder, the brain and electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = British Journal of Hospital Medicine | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 77–82 | doi=10.12968/hmed.2006.67.2.20466| pmid = 16498907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[psychosurgery|Surgery]] may be used as a last resort in people who do not improve with other treatments. In this procedure, a surgical [[lesion]] is made in an area of the brain (the [[cingulate cortex]]). In one study, 30% of participants benefitted significantly from this procedure.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;Barlow, D. H. and V. M. Durand. ''Essentials of Abnormal Psychology''. California: Thomson Wadsworth, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep-brain stimulation]] and [[vagus nerve stimulation]] are possible surgical options that do not require destruction of [[brain tissue]]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved deep-brain stimulation for the treatment of OCD under a humanitarian device exemption requiring that the procedure be performed only in a hospital with specialist qualifications to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barlas S |title=FDA Approves Pioneering Treatment for Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=8 April 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710101738/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |archivedate=10 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the person has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive [[cognitive–behavioral therapy]] with exposure and ritual/response prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainphysics.com/surgery.php Surgical Procedures for Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725094926/http://brainphysics.com/surgery.php |date=25 July 2008 }}, by M. Jahn and M. Williams, Ph.D,. BrainPhysics OCD Resource, Accessed 6 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the United Kingdom, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive–behavioral therapist has been carried out.

=== Children ===
Therapeutic treatment may be effective in reducing ritual behaviors of OCD for children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Donohue William |author2=Ferguson Kyle E | year = 2006 | title = Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and Behavior Analysis | url = | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 335–347 | doi=10.1037/h0100155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the treatment of adults with OCD, CBT stands as an effective and validated first line of treatment of OCD in children.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=J|last2=Garcia|first2=A|last3=Frank|first3=H|last4=Benito|first4=K|last5=Conelea|first5=C|last6=Walther|first6=M|last7=Edmunds|first7=J|title=Evidence base update for psychosocial treatments for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder|journal=Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=7–26|pmid=23746138|doi=10.1080/15374416.2013.804386|pmc=3815743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family involvement, in the form of behavioral observations and reports, is a key component to the success of such treatments.&lt;ref name="Rapoport, J. E. 1989"&gt;Rapoport, J. E. (1989). Obsessive-compulsive Disorder In Children &amp; Adolescents. Washington: American Psychiatric Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Parental interventions also provide positive reinforcement for a child who exhibits appropriate behaviors as alternatives to compulsive responses. In a recent meta-analysis of evidenced-based treatment of OCD in children, family-focused individual CBT was labeled as "probably efficacious", establishing it as one of the leading psychosocial treatments for youth with OCD.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014 /&gt; After one or two years of therapy, in which a child learns the nature of his or her obsession and acquires strategies for coping, that child may acquire a larger circle of friends, exhibit less shyness, and become less self-critical.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, P. L. (1973). Obsessive Children: A Sociopsychiatric Study. Philadelphia: Brunner / Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the causes of OCD in younger age groups range from brain abnormalities to psychological preoccupations, life stress such as bullying and traumatic familial deaths may also contribute to childhood cases of OCD, and acknowledging these stressors can play a role in treating the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid19378573"&gt;{{cite journal | author = D'Alessandro TM | title = Factors influencing the onset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Pediatr Nurs | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19378573 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsessive–compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Good2014 /&gt; Rates during a given year are about 1.2% and it occurs worldwide.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of thirty five and half of people develop problems before twenty.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Males and females are affected about equally.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;

=== Associated conditions ===
People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, as well as or instead of OCD, such as the aforementioned obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen YW, Dilsaver SC | title = Comorbidity for obsessive-compulsive disorder in bipolar and unipolar disorders | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 59 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 57–64 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8771221 | doi = 10.1016/0165-1781(95)02752-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[bulimia nervosa]], [[Tourette syndrome]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[dermatillomania]] (compulsive skin picking), [[body dysmorphic disorder]] and [[trichotillomania]] (hair pulling). More than 50 percent of people experience suicidal tendencies, and 15 percent have attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009" /&gt; Depression, anxiety and prior suicide attempts increase the risk of future suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=July 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with OCD have also been found to be affected by [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]] at a substantially higher rate than the general public.&lt;ref name='Turner 2007'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner J, Drummond LM, Mukhopadhyay S, Ghodse H, White S, Pillay A, Fineberg NA | title = A prospective study of delayed sleep phase syndrome in patients with severe resistant obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = World Psychiatry | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–111 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 18235868 | pmc = 2219909 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, severe OCD symptoms are consistently associated with greater sleep disturbance. Reduced total sleep time and sleep efficiency have been observed in people with OCD, with delayed sleep onset and offset and an increased prevalence of delayed sleep phase disorder.&lt;ref name="Paterson2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paterson JL, Reynolds AC, Ferguson SA, Dawson D | title = Sleep and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) | journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 465–74 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23499210 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2012.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorally, there is some research demonstrating a link between [[drug addiction]] and the disorder as well. For example, there is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with the heightened levels of [[anxiety]]), but drug addiction among people with OCD may serve as a type of [[compulsive behavior]] and not just as a coping mechanism. [[Clinical depression|Depression]] is also extremely prevalent among people with OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other [[anxiety disorder]]) may feel depressed because of an "out of control" type of feeling.&lt;ref name="comorbidity"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mineka S, Watson D, Clark LA | title = Comorbidity of anxiety and unipolar mood disorders | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = |pages = 377–412 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9496627 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone exhibiting OCD signs does not necessarily have OCD. Behaviors that present as (or seem to be) obsessive or compulsive can also be found in a number of other conditions as well, including [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder|obsessive–compulsive ''personality'' disorder]] (OCPD), [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders#Obsessive-compulsive disorder|autism spectrum disorder]], disorders where [[perseveration]] is a possible feature ([[ADHD]], [[PTSD]], bodily disorders or habit problems)&lt;ref name="differential"&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917123925/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential |date=17 September 2012 }} – 2012&lt;/ref&gt; or sub-clinically.

Some with OCD present with features typically associated with Tourette's syndrome, such as compulsions that may appear to resemble motor tics; this has been termed "tic-related OCD" or "Tourettic OCD".&lt;ref name="10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.1.59"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mansueto CS, Keuler DJ | title = Tic or compulsion?: it's Tourettic OCD. | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 784–99 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16046664 | doi = 10.1177/0145445505279261 | journal=Behavior Modification}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD and T"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |title=OCD and Tourette Syndrome: Re-examining the Relationship |publisher=International OCD Foundation |accessdate=30 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101085624/http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A myth propagated by Sigmund Freud regarding above-average intelligence in OCD was recently refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11065-017-9358-0 | pmid=28864868 | title=Meta-Analysis of Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder | year=2017 | journal=Neuropsychology Review | volume=28 | issue=1 | pages=111–120 | author=Abramovitch Amitai, Anholt Gideon, Raveh-Gottfried Sagi, Hamo Naama, Abramowitz Jonathan S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD frequently co-occurs with both [[bipolar disorder]] and [[major depressive disorder]].  Between 60–80% of those with OCD experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. Comorbidity rates have been reported at between 19–90% due to methodological differences.  Between 9–35% of those with bipolar disorder also have OCD, compared to the 1–2% in the general population. Around 50% of those with OCD experience cyclothymic traits or hypomanic episodes.  OCD is also associated with anxiety disorders.  Lifetime comorbidity for OCD has been reported at 22% for [[specific phobia]], 18% for [[social anxiety disorder]], 12% for panic disorder, and 30% for [[generalized anxiety disorder]].  The comorbidity rate for OCD and ADHD has been reported as high as 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pallanti|first1=S|last2=Grassi|first2=G|last3=Sarrecchia|first3=ED|last4=Cantisani|first4=A|last5=Pellegrini|first5=M|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbidity: clinical assessment and therapeutic implications.|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=2011|volume=2|pages=70|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00070|pmid=22203806|pmc=3243905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Quality of life is reduced across all domains in OCD. While psychological or pharmacological treatment can lead to a reduction of OCD symptoms and an increase in QoL, symptoms may persist at moderate levels even following adequate treatment courses, and completely symptom-free periods are uncommon.&lt;ref name="pmid15533282"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eddy KT, Dutra L, Bradley R, Westen D | title = A multidimensional meta-analysis of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1011–30 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15533282 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2004.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Subramaniam|first1=M|last2=Soh|first2=P|last3=Vaingankar|first3=JA|last4=Picco|first4=L|last5=Chong|first5=SA|title=Quality of life in obsessive-compulsive disorder: impact of the disorder and of treatment.|journal=CNS Drugs|date=May 2013|volume=27|issue=5|pages=367–83|doi=10.1007/s40263-013-0056-z|pmid=23580175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In pediatric OCD, around 40% still have the disorder in adulthood, and around 40% qualify for remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boileau|first1=B|title=A review of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2011|volume=13|issue=4|pages=401–11|pmid=22275846|pmc=3263388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventh century AD, [[John Climacus]] records an instance of a young monk plagued by constant and overwhelming "temptations to blasphemy" consulting an older monk,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Ian|date=1998|title=Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WVgTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=Obsessive+Compulsive+Disorder+in+antiquity#v=onepage&amp;q=Obsessive%20Compulsive%20Disorder%20in%20antiquity&amp;f=false|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Dell Publishing|isbn=978-0-440-50847-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|212}} who told him, "My son, I take upon myself all the sins which these temptations have led you, or may lead you, to commit. All I require of you is that for the future you pay no attention to them whatosever."&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|212}} ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'', a Christian mystical text from the late fourteenth century, recommends dealing with recurring obsessions by first attempting to ignore them,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} and, if that fails, "cower under them like a poor wretch and a coward overcome in battle, and reckon it to be a waste of your time for you to strive any longer against them",&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} a technique now known as "[[emotional flooding]]".&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}}

From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual or other obsessive thoughts were [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by the [[Satan|Devil]].&lt;ref name="Aardema, F. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aardema F., O'Connor |year = 2007 | title = The menace within: obsessions and the self | url = | journal = International Journal of Cognitive Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 182–197 | doi=10.1891/088983907781494573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the "evil" from the "possessed" person through [[exorcism]].&lt;ref name="Jenike"&gt;M.

The English term obsessive-compulsive comes from the translated term used to describe the first conceptions of OCD by [[Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal|Carl Westphal]], "zwangsvorstellung".  Westphal's description went on to influence [[Pierre Janet]] who further documented features of OCD.&lt;ref name="Sadock" /&gt;  In the early 1910s, [[Sigmund Freud]] attributed obsessive–compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts that manifest as symptoms.&lt;ref name="Jenike" /&gt; Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of "touching phobia" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an "external prohibition" against this type of touching.

=== Notable cases ===
[[John Bunyan]] (1628–1688), the author of ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', displayed symptoms of OCD (which had not yet been named).&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} During the most severe period of his condition, he would mutter the same phrase over and over again to himself while rocking back and forth.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} He later described his obsessions in his autobiography ''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'',&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} stating, "These things may seem ridiculous to others, even as ridiculous as they were in themselves, but to me they were the most tormenting cogitations."&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|54}} He wrote two pamphlets advising those suffering from similar anxieties.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} In one of them, he warns against indulging in compulsions:&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} "Have care of putting off your trouble of spirit in the wrong way: by promising to reform yourself and lead a new life, by your performances or duties".&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|218}}

British poet, essayist and lexicographer [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784) also suffered from OCD.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|54–55}} He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, and repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com/Johnson.html |title=SAMUEL JOHNSON (1709–1784): A Patron Saint of OCD? by Fred Penzel, Ph.D. from the Scientific Advisory Board of the International OCD Foundation |website=Westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com |accessdate=29 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615085035/http://westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com/Johnson.html |archivedate=15 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} He would touch every post on the street as he walked past,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} only step in the middles of paving stones,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} and repeatedly perform tasks as though they had not been done properly the first time.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} The American aviator and filmmaker [[Howard Hughes]] is known to have had OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.aspx |title=Hughes's germ phobia revealed in psychological autopsy |last1=Dittmann |first1=M |date=July–August 2005 |website=American Psychological Association |accessdate=9 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105071029/http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.aspx |archivedate=5 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends of Hughes have also mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.html | journal=APA Online: Monitor on Psychology | volume=36 | issue=7 | date=July–August 2005 | author1=M.

On the term "paraliterature", [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] commented that "it exists. What I'm saying is that I don't want to ''perpetuate'' this division. So I would always put it in quotes, or do something to show that I'm rejecting a word that I have to use".{{sfn|Le Guin|2008|p=110}}

'''Peripeteia''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɛr|ə|p|ᵻ|ˈ|t|aɪ|.|ə}} ({{lang-el|περιπέτεια}}) is a reversal of circumstances, or turning point. The term is primarily used with reference to works of literature. The Anglicized form of ''peripeteia'' is '''peripety'''.

==Aristotle's view==
[[Aristotle]], in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]], defines peripeteia as "a change by which the action veers round to its opposite, subject always to our rule of probability or necessity." According to [[Aristotle]], peripeteia, along with discovery, is the most effective when it comes to [[drama]], particularly in a [[tragedy]]. He wrote that "The finest form of Discovery is one attended by Peripeteia, like that which goes with the Discovery in [[Oedipus]]...".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Poetics]], 1452a&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle says that peripeteia is the most powerful part of a plot in a tragedy along with discovery. A peripety is the change of the kind described from one state of things within the play to its opposite, and that too in the way we are saying, in the probable or necessary sequence of events. There is often no element like Peripeteia; it can bring forth or result in terror, mercy, or in comedies it can bring a smile or it can bring forth tears (Rizo). This is the best way to spark and maintain attention throughout the various form and genres of drama "Tragedy imitates good actions and, thereby, measures and depicts the well-being of its protagonist. But in his formal definition, as well as throughout the Poetics, Aristotle emphasizes that" ... Tragedy is an imitation not only of a complete action, but also of events inspiring fear or pity" (1452a 1); in fact, at one point [[Aristotle]] isolates the imitation of "actions that excite pity and fear" as "the distinctive mark of tragic imitation" (1452b 30). Pity and fear are effected through reversal and recognition; and these "most powerful elements of emotional interest in Tragedy-Peripeteia or Reversal of the Situation, and recognition scenes-are parts of the plot (1450a 32). has the shift of the tragic protagonist's fortune from good to bad, which is essential to the plot of a tragedy. It is often an ironic twist. Good uses of Peripeteia are those that especially are parts of a complex plot, so that they are defined by their changes of fortune being accompanied by reversal, recognition, or both" (Smithson).

Peripeteia includes [[character arc|changes of character]], but also more external changes.  A character who becomes rich and famous from poverty and obscurity has undergone peripeteia, even if his character remains the same.

When a character learns something he had been previously ignorant of, this is normally distinguished from peripeteia as [[anagnorisis]] or discovery, a distinction derived from Aristotle's work.

Aristotle considered anagnorisis, leading to peripeteia, the mark of a superior tragedy.  Two such plays are ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', where the oracle's information that Oedipus had killed [[Laius|his father]] and married [[Jocasta|his mother]] brought about his mother's death and his own blindness and exile, and ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'', where Iphigenia realizes that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, resulting in all three of them escaping Tauris. These plots he considered complex and superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when Medea resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so. Aristotle identified ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' as the principal work demonstrating peripety.  (See Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.)

==Examples==

===''Oedipus Rex''===
In Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the peripeteia occurs towards the end of the play when the Messenger brings Oedipus news of his parentage.  In the play, Oedipus is fated to murder his father and marry his mother.  His parents, Laius and Jocasta, try to forestall the oracle by sending their son away to be killed, but he is actually raised by Polybus and his wife, Merope, the rulers of another kingdom.  The irony of the Messenger’s information is that it was supposed to comfort Oedipus and assure him that he was the son of Polybus. Unfortunately for Oedipus, the Messenger says, "Polybus was nothing to you, [Oedipus] that’s why, not in blood" (Sophocles 1113).  The Messenger received Oedipus from one of Laius’ servants and then gave him to Polybus.  The plot comes together when Oedipus realizes that he is the son and murderer of Laius as well as the son and husband of Jocasta.  Martin M. Winkler says that here, peripeteia and [[Anagnorisis|anagnôrisis]] occur at the same time "for the greatest possible impact" because Oedipus has been "struck a blow from above, as if by fate or the gods. He is changing from the mighty and somewhat arrogant king of Thebes to a figure of woe" (Winkler 57).

The instantaneous conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus is a classic example of ''peripeteia'', which [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] presented in his ''Life of Constantine'' as a pattern for the equally revelatory conversion of [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Modern biographers of Constantine see his conversion less as a momentary phenomenon than as a step in a lifelong process.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'' 2010: the ''trope'' of peripaty is discussed in "Constantine's Conversion", pp168f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Three Apples===
In "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', after the murderer reveals himself near the middle of the story, he explains his reasons behind the murder in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], which begins with him going on a journey to find three rare apples for his wife, but after returning finds out she cannot eat them due to her lingering illness. Later at work, he sees a slave passing by with one of those apples claiming that he received it from his girlfriend, a married woman with three such apples her husband gave her. He returns home and demands his wife to show him all three apples, but she only shows him two. This convinces him of her [[infidelity]] and he murders her as a result. After he disposes of her body, he returns home where his son confesses that he had stolen one of the apples and that a slave, to whom he had told about his father's journey, had fled with it. The murderer thus realizes his guilt and regrets what he has just done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second use of peripety occurs near the end. After finding out about the culprit behind the murder, the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the [[tricky slave]] within three days, or else he will have Ja'far executed instead. After the deadline has passed, Ja'far prepares to be executed for his failure and bids his family farewell. As he hugs his youngest daughter, he feels a round object in her pocket, which is revealed to be the same apple that the culprit was holding. In the story's twist ending, the daughter reveals that she obtained it from their slave, Rayhan. Ja'far thus realizes that his own slave was the culprit all along. He then finds Rayhan and solves the case, preventing his own execution. That was a [[plot twist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6412">The '''quadrivium''' (plural: quadrivia&lt;ref name="JE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14950-wisdom |title=Wisdom |last=Kohler |first=Kaufmann |work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2015-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the four subjects, or arts, taught after teaching the [[trivium (education)|trivium]]. The word is [[Latin]], meaning ''four ways'', and its use for the four subjects has been attributed to [[Boethius]] or [[Cassiodorus]] in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Part I: The Age of Augustine". ND.edu. 2010. [http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/hwp205.htm ND205].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quadrivium (education)". ''[[Britannica Online]]''. 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485943/quadrivium EB].
&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the [[trivium]] and the quadrivium comprised the seven [[liberal arts]] (based on thinking skills),&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Quadrivium|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; as distinguished from the practical arts (such as [[medicine]] and [[architecture]]).

The quadrivium consisted of [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[astronomy]]. These followed the preparatory work of the trivium, consisting of [[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]]. In turn, the quadrivium was considered preparatory work for the study of [[philosophy]] (sometimes called the "liberal art ''par excellence''")&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Coit Gilman|Gilman, Daniel Coit]], et al. (1905). ''[[New International Encyclopedia]]''. Lemma "Arts, Liberal".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[theology]].

==Origins==
These four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by [[Plato]] in [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']] and are described in the seventh book of that work (in the order Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music). &lt;ref name="nie"/&gt;
The quadrivium is implicit in early [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] writings and in the ''De nuptiis'' of [[Martianus Capella]], although the term ''quadrivium'' was not used until [[Boethius]], early in the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;Marrou, Henri-Irénée (1969). "Les Arts Libéraux dans l'Antiquité Classique". pp. 6–27 in ''Arts Libéraux et Philosophie au Moyen Âge''. Paris: Vrin; Montréal: Institut d'Études Médiévales. pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Proclus]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Pythagoreans considered all mathematical science to be divided into four parts: one half they marked off as concerned with quantity, the other half with magnitude; and each of these they posited as twofold.  A quantity can be considered in regard to its character by itself or in its relation to another quantity, magnitudes as either stationary or in motion.  Arithmetic, then, studies quantities as such, music the relations between quantities, geometry magnitude at rest, spherics [astronomy] magnitude inherently moving.&lt;ref&gt;Proclus. ''A Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements'', xii. trans. Glenn Raymond Morrow. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992. pp. 29–30. {{ISBN|0-691-02090-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Medieval usage==
At many medieval universities, this would have been the course leading to the degree of [[Master of Arts]] (after the [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]). After the MA, the student could enter for bachelor's degrees of the higher faculties (Theology, Medicine or Law). To this day, some of the postgraduate degree courses lead to the degree of Bachelor (the [[Bachelor of Philosophy|B.Phil]] and [[British degree abbreviations|B.Litt.]] degrees are examples in the field of philosophy).

The study was eclectic, approaching the philosophical objectives sought by considering it from each aspect of the quadrivium within the general structure demonstrated by [[Proclus]] (AD 412–485), namely arithmetic and music on the one hand&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Craig (2001). ''The Maze and the Warrior: Symbols in Architecture, Theology, and Music''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and geometry and cosmology on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Smoller, Laura Ackerman (1994). ''History, Prophecy and the Stars: Christian Astrology of Pierre D'Ailly, 1350–1420. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of music within the quadrivium was originally the classical subject of [[harmonic]]s, in particular the study of the proportions between the musical intervals created by the division of a [[monochord]]. A relationship to music as actually practised was not part of this study, but the framework of classical harmonics would substantially influence the content and structure of music theory as practised in both European and Islamic cultures.

==Modern usage==
In modern applications of the liberal arts as curriculum in colleges or universities, the quadrivium may be considered to be the study of [[number]] and its relationship to space or time: arithmetic was pure number, geometry was number in [[space]], music was number in [[time]], and astronomy was number in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Morris Kline]] classified the four elements of the quadrivium as pure (arithmetic), stationary (geometry), moving (astronomy), and applied (music) number.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Morris (1953). "The Sine of G Major". In ''Mathematics in Western Culture''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This schema is sometimes referred to as "classical education", but it is more accurately a [[Renaissance of the 12th century|development of the 12th- and 13th-century Renaissance]] with recovered classical elements, rather than an organic growth from the educational systems of antiquity. The term continues to be used by the [[Classical education movement]] and at the independent [[Oundle School]], in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boarding.org.uk/media/news/article/2352/Oundle-School-Improving-Intellectual-Challenge |title=Oundle School – Improving Intellectual Challenge |date=27 October 2014 |website=The Boarding Schools' Association}}&lt;br /&gt;Each of these iterations was discussed in a conference at [[King's College London]] on "[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/liberal/conference.aspx The Future of Liberal Arts]" at schools and universities.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malaysian/Indonesian origin ==
Amok originated from the Malaysian/Indonesian word ''meng-âmuk'', which when roughly defined means "to make a furious and desperate charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hempel A. A., Levine R. D., Meloy J. D., Westermeyer J. D. | year = 2000 | title = Cross-cultural review of sudden mass assault by a single individual in the oriental and occidental cultures | url = | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 582–588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Malaysian and Indonesian cultures, amok was rooted in a deep spiritual belief.&lt;ref&gt;Van Loon, F. H. G. (1927). "Amok and Latah". Retrieved March 30, 2013 from PsychINFO. [http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=a71ca420-96ff-40e4-be67-3ac88801c158%40sessionmgr12&amp;hid=3&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2006-01643-010]&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that amok was caused by the ''hantu belian'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu: hantu belian|url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=hantu+belian|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka|accessdate=6 November 2011|location=Malaysia|language=Malay, English|quote=hantu belian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an evil tiger spirit that entered one’s body and caused the heinous act. As a result of the belief, those in Indonesian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after-effects with no ill will towards the assailant.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Saint Martin | first = Michael | year = 1999 | title = Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | issn = 0160-6689| pmc = 181064 | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pmid = 15014687 | pages = 66–70 | doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic [[culture-bound syndrome]] in the cultures of [[Culture of Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Culture of Brunei|Brunei]]. In a typical case of ''running amok'', an individual (often male), having shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence, will acquire a weapon (traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently any of a variety of weapons) and in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters and himself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=181064|year=1999|author1=Saint Martin|first1=M. L.|title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome|journal=Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=66–70|pmid=15014687|doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. Amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing [[suicide]], eliciting theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23464 |title=Definition of Amok |publisher=Medterms.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do not commit suicide and are not killed typically lose consciousness, and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.

An early Western description of the practice appears in the journals of [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]], a British explorer, who encountered amok firsthand in 1770 during a voyage around the world. Cook writes of individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and "indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack."&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, Y. (Ed.).(2006). Encyclopedia of multicultural psychology. University of Kansas: Sage Publications)&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely accepted explanation links amok with male [[honor]] (amok by women and children is virtually unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexanra Ringe|first=Carrie McLaren|title=Curious Mental Illnesses Around the World|url=http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html|publisher=stayfreemagazone.org|accessdate=March 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218053501/http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html#|archive-date=2012-12-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed or committed suicide) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.

== Contemporary syndrome ==
"Running amok" is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An episode of amok may be triggered by a period of depression or highly aggressive behavior. The slang terms ''[[going postal]]'' or ''going ballistic'' are similar in scope.
Police describe such an event as a [[spree killer|killing spree]]. If the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often "[[suicide by cop]]".

Amok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome,&lt;ref name="pmid15014687"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saint Martin ML |title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=66–70 |date=June 1999 |pmid=15014687 |pmc=181064 |doi= 10.4088/pcc.v01n0302|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1427677"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gaw AC, Bernstein RL |title=Classification of amok in DSM-IV |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=789–93 |date=August 1992 |pmid=1427677 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1427677 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors. Other reported culture-bound syndromes are [[latah]] and [[Penis panic|koro]]. Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of [[dissociative disorders]] (cross-cultural variant).

== Officially classified as a psychiatric condition ==
In 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; The modern [[DSM-IV]] method of [[classification of mental disorders]] contains two official types of amok disorder; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

== Historical and cross-cultural comparisons ==
Early travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.

An example would be during the [[Battle of Bukit Chandu]] in Singapore during WWII when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment, led by [[Adnan Saidi]], charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading Japanese Army. They continued the fight armed with just knives and bayonets for three days before they were finally defeated.

This form of amok appears to resemble the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ''[[Berserker]]'', the ''cafard'' or ''cathard'' (Polynesia), ''mal de pelea'' (Puerto Rico), and ''iich'aa'' (Navaho).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/ant100/pdf/MedicalAnthropology.pdf |title=Medical Anthropology: Culture-bound syndromes |accessdate=2009-04-29 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[Indonesia]], the term ''amok'' (''amuk'') generally refers not to individual violence, but to frenzied violence by mobs. Indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok. [[Laurens van der Post]] experienced the phenomenon in the East Indies and wrote in 1955:

{{quote|'Gelap mata', the Dark Eye, is an expression used in Sumatra and Java to describe a curious and disturbing social phenomenon. Socially speaking, the Malays, Sumatrans and Javanese are the best behaved people I have ever encountered. On the surface they are an extremely gentle, refined, submissive people. In fact the word 'Malay' comes from 'malu', 'gentle', and gentleness is a quality prized above all others among the Malays and their neighbours. In their family life, in their submission to traditional and parental authority, in their communal duties, they are among the most obedient people on earth. But every now and then something very disturbing happens. A man who has behaved in this obliging manner all his life and who has always done his duty by the outside world to perfection, suddenly finds it impossible to keep doing so. Overnight he revolts against goodness and dutifulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurens van der Post|van der Post, Laurens]], ''The Dark Eye in Africa'' (London, 1955), p.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Philippines]], ''amok'' also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. In 1876, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines [[José Malcampo]] coined the term ''[[juramentado]]'' for the behavior (from ''juramentar'' - "to take an oath"), surviving into modern [[Philippine languages]] as ''huramentado''.&lt;ref name=Hurley14&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Vic |title=Swish of the Kris; The Story of the Moros |url=http://www.nikhef.nl/~tonvr/keris/keris2/swish/index.html |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= |issue= |date= |year=1936 |month= |origyear= |publisher=E.P.

Norse [[Berserker]]s and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy.

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], some notable cases have occurred among the [[Rajputs]]. In 1634, the eldest son of the [[raja]] of [[Jodhpur]] ran amok at the court of [[Shah Jahan]], failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. During the 18th century, again, at [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] (Sind), two envoys, sent by the Jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amuck, Running|volume=1|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seven Wonders of the World''' or the '''Seven Wonders of the Ancient World''' is a list of remarkable constructions of [[classical antiquity]] given by various authors in guidebooks or poems popular among ancient [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] tourists. Although the list, in its current form, did not stabilise until the [[Renaissance]], the first such lists of seven wonders date from the 1st-2nd century BC. The original list inspired [[Wonders of the World|innumerable versions]] through the ages, often listing seven entries. Of the original Seven Wonders, only one—the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (also called the Pyramid of [[Khufu]], after the pharaoh who built it), the oldest of the ancient wonders—remains relatively intact. The [[Colossus of Rhodes]], the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]], the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], the [[Temple of Artemis]] and the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Statue of Zeus]] were all destroyed. The location and ultimate fate of the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|Hanging Gardens]] are unknown, and there is speculation that they may not have existed at all.

==Background==
The Greek conquest of much of the known western world in the 4th century BC gave Hellenistic travellers access to the [[civilization]]s of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[History of Iran|Persians]], and [[Babylonia]]ns.&lt;ref name=seven_wonders /&gt; Impressed and captivated by the landmarks and marvels of the various lands, these travellers began to list what they saw to remember them.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web | title = History of the Past: World History | url = http://worldhistory.byethost8.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seven&gt;{{cite web | title = The Seven Wonders | author = Paul Lunde | date = May–June 1980 | publisher = Saudi Aramco World | url = http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198003/the.seven.wonders.htm | accessdate = 2009-09-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091013125703/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198003/the.seven.wonders.htm | archive-date = 2009-10-13 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of "wonders", the ancient Greeks spoke of "''theamata''" (θεάματα), which means "sights", in other words "things to be seen" (Τὰ ἑπτὰ θεάματα τῆς οἰκουμένης [γῆς] ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Tà heptà theámata tēs oikoumenēs [gēs]}}''). Later, the word for "wonder" ("''thaumata''" θαύματα, "wonders") was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clayton | first = Peter | authorlink = |author2=Martin J. Price  | title = The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World | publisher = Routledge | year =1990 | location = | page =4 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=n9QOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=theamata+seven+wonders | doi = | isbn = 978-0-415-05036-4 | author = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the list was meant to be the Ancient World's counterpart of a travel guidebook.&lt;ref name=seven_wonders /&gt;

The first reference to a list of seven such monuments was given by [[Diodorus Siculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diodorus Siculus|title=Bibliotheca Historica, Books I-V|publisher=Perseus Project, Tufts University|location=2.11.5|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+2.11.5&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Peter A.|last2=Price|first2=Martin|title=The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136748097|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Df-AAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158|accessdate=25 November 2016|language=en|date=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epigrammist [[Antipater of Sidon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek Anthology, Volume III|publisher=Perseus Project, Tufts University|location=Book 9, chapter 58|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0474%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D58}}&lt;/ref&gt; who lived around or before 100 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Dictionary Volume III|publisher=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9w1FAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=25 November 2016|language=en|year=1843}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a list of seven such monuments, including six of the present list (substituting the walls of Babylon for the lighthouse):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Peter A.|last2=Price|first2=Martin|title=The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136748103|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQSBAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=25 November 2016|language=en|date=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I have gazed on the walls of impregnable Babylon along which chariots may race, and on the Zeus by the banks of the Alpheus, I have seen the hanging gardens, and the Colossus of the Helios, the great man-made mountains of the lofty pyramids, and the gigantic tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the sacred house of Artemis that towers to the clouds, the others were placed in the shade, for the sun himself has never looked upon its equal outside Olympus. – ''Greek Anthology'' IX.58}}

[[File:Pyramide Kheops.JPG|thumb|The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing]]

Another 2nd century BC observer, who claimed to be the mathematician [[Philo of Byzantium]],&lt;ref name=brittanica&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica Micropædia Volume 10 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year =1995 | location =USA | page =666 | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-85229-605-3 | author = }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a short account entitled ''The Seven Sights of the World''. However, the incomplete surviving manuscript only covered six of the supposedly seven places, which agreed with Antipater's list.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt;

Earlier and later lists by the historian [[Herodotus]] (484 BC–ca. 425 BC) and the architect [[Callimachus]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (ca. 305–240 BC), housed at the Museum of [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], survived only as references.

The [[Colossus of Rhodes]] was the last of the seven to be completed, after 280 BC, and the first to be destroyed, by an earthquake in 226/225 BC. Hence, all seven existed at the same time for a period of less than 60 years.

==Scope==
The list covered only the sculptural and architectural monuments of the Mediterranean and [[Middle East]]ern regions,&lt;ref name=brittanica /&gt; which then comprised the known world for the Greeks. Hence, extant sites beyond this realm were not considered as part of contemporary accounts.&lt;ref name=seven_wonders&gt;{{cite web | title = The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World | url = http://www.amazeingart.com/seven-wonders/7-wonders.html|accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary accounts, coming from Hellenistic writers, also heavily influenced the places included in the wonders list. Five of the seven entries are a celebration of Greek accomplishments in the arts and architecture (the exceptions being the Pyramids of Giza and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon).

The seven wonders on Antipater's list won praises for their notable features, ranging from superlatives of the highest or largest of their types, to the artistry with which they were executed. Their architectural and artistic features were imitated throughout the Hellenistic world and beyond.

The Greek influence in Roman culture, and the revival of Greco-Roman artistic styles during the Renaissance caught the imagination of European artists and travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Wonders of Europe | url = http://www.7wonders.org/wonders/europe/|accessdate=2009-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings and sculptures alluding to Antipater's list were made, while adventurers flocked to the actual sites to personally witness the wonders. Legends circulated to further complement the superlatives of the wonders.

===Modern lists===
Of Antipater's wonders, the only one that has survived to the present day is the Great Pyramid of Giza. Its brilliant white stone facing had survived intact until around 1300 AD, when local communities removed most of the stonework for building materials. The existence of the Hanging Gardens has not been proven, although theories abound.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley]] (2013), ''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive World wonder traced.'' OUP {{ISBN|978-0-19-966226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records and archaeology confirm the existence of the other five wonders. The Temple of Artemis and the Statue of Zeus were destroyed by fire, while the Lighthouse of Alexandria, Colossus, and tomb of Mausolus were destroyed by earthquakes. Among the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to have survived are sculptures from the tomb of Mausolus and the Temple of Artemis in the [[British Museum]] in London.

Still, the listing of seven of the most marvellous architectural and artistic human achievements continued beyond the Ancient Greek times to the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and to the modern age. The Roman poet [[Martial]] and the Christian bishop [[Gregory of Tours]] had their versions.&lt;ref name=seven_wonders /&gt; Reflecting the rise of Christianity and the factor of time, nature and the hand of man overcoming Antipater's seven wonders, Roman and Christian sites began to figure on the list, including the [[Colosseum]], [[Noah's Ark]] and [[Solomon's Temple]].&lt;ref name=seven_wonders /&gt;&lt;ref name=seven /&gt; In the 6th century, a list of seven wonders was compiled by St. [[Gregory of Tours]]: the list&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Peter and Price, Martin: The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (Routledge, 1988), pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt; included the Temple of Solomon, the [[Pharos of Alexandria]] and Noah's Ark.

Modern historians, working on the premise that the original Seven Ancient Wonders List was limited in its geographic scope, also had their versions to encompass sites beyond the Hellenistic realm—from the Seven Wonders of the ''Ancient World'' to the Seven Wonders of the ''World''. Indeed, the "seven wonders" label has spawned innumerable versions among international organizations, publications and individuals based on different themes—works of nature, engineering masterpieces, constructions of the Middle Ages, etc. Its purpose has also changed from just a simple travel guidebook or a compendium of curious places, to lists of sites to defend or to preserve.

[[Image:Souvenir Spoon from Fords Theatre, Washington DC.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Souvenir Spoon from [[Ford's Theatre]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
A '''souvenir spoon''' is a decorative [[spoon]] used to signify or hold a memory of a place or event, or to display as a 'trophy' of having been there. The spoons may be made from a number of different materials such as [[sterling silver]], nickel, steel, and in some cases wood. They are often hung on a spoon rack and are typically ornamental, depicting sights, coat of arms, associated characters, etc. The year the spoon was made may be inscribed in the bowl, or on the back. The entire spoon, including the bowl, handle, and [[finial]] may be used to convey the theme.  The first souvenir spoons in the [[United States]] were made in 1890 by Galt &amp; Bros., Inc. of Washington D.C., featuring the profile of [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="SOUVENIR"/&gt;  One year later, a souvenir [[Salem witch trials|Salem Witch]] spoon was made, and sold seven thousand copies. It was created by Daniel Low, a jeweler in Salem, Massachusetts, after he saw souvenir spoons on vacation in Germany. The Witch Spoon is given credit for starting the souvenir spoon hobby in the U.S.&lt;ref name="SOUVENIR"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091022132150/http://geocities.com/rodeodrive/6232/beginning.html The Beginning of Souvenir Spoons] Accessed May 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stateless society''' is a [[society]] that is not [[government|governed]] by a [[state (polity)|state]], or, especially in common [[American English]], has no government.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt; In stateless societies, there is little [[centralization|concentration]] of [[authority]]; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in [[political power|power]] and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Stephen |title= The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of an African Civil War |publisher= NYU Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 978-0-8147-2219-0 |page= 198 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fLAWMGqKMb4C&amp;pg=PA198 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Béteille |first= André |authorlink= André Béteille |chapter= Inequality and Equality |editor-last= Ingold |editor-first= Tim |title= Companion Encyclopedia of Anthropology |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-415-28604-6 |pages= 1042–1043 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hKzSc02tbaMC&amp;pg=PA1042 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a [[sovereign state]]. In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield [[failed state|little or no actual power]]. Over the course of history most stateless peoples have been [[cultural assimilation|integrated into the state-based societies around them]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Faulks |first= Keith |title= Political Sociology: A Critical Introduction |publisher= NYU Press |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-8147-2709-6 |page= 23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_fjCczhvWj0C&amp;pg=PA23 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some political philosophies, particularly [[anarchism]], consider the state an unwelcome institution and stateless societies the ideal.

==Prehistoric peoples==
In [[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]] and [[history]], a stateless society denotes a less complex human [[community]] without a state, such as a [[tribe]], a [[clan]], a [[band society]] or a [[chiefdom]]. The main criterion of "complexity" used is the extent to which a [[division of labor]] has occurred such that many people are permanently ''specialized'' in particular forms of production or other activity, and depend on others for goods and services through trade or sophisticated reciprocal obligations governed by [[Convention (norm)|custom]] and [[laws]]. An additional criterion is [[population size]]. The bigger the population, the more relationships have to be reckoned with.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Evidence of the earliest known city-states has been found in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] around 3700 BC, suggesting that the history of the state is less than 6,000 years old; thus, for most of human [[prehistory]] the state did not exist.

{{Quotation|For 99.8 percent of human history people lived exclusively in autonomous bands and villages. At the beginning of the Paleolithic [i.e. the stone age], the number of these autonomous political units must have been small, but by 1000 BC it had increased to some 600,000. Then supra-village aggregation began in earnest, and in barely three millennia the autonomous political units of the world dropped from 600,000 to 157.|Robert L. Carneiro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Robert L. |last= Carneiro |chapter= Political Expansion as an Expression of the Principle of Competitive Exclusion |page= 219 |editor1-first= Ronald |editor1-last= Cohen |editor2-first= Elman R. |editor2-last= Service |title= Origins of the State: The Anthropology of Political Evolution |location= Philadelphia |publisher= Institute for the Study of Human Issues |year= 1978 |lastauthoramp= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Generally speaking, the archaeological evidence suggests that the state emerged from stateless communities only when a fairly large population (at least tens of thousands of people) was more or less settled together in a particular territory, and practiced [[agriculture]]. Indeed, one of the typical functions of the state is the defense of territory. Nevertheless, there are exceptions: [[Lawrence Krader]] for example describes the case of the Tatar state, a political authority arising among confederations of clans of nomadic or semi-nomadic herdsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Krader |title= Formation of the State |location= Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher= Prentice-Hallm |year= 1968 |at= ch. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristically the state functionaries (royal dynasties, soldiers, scribes, servants, administrators, lawyers, tax collectors, religious authorities etc.) are mainly not self-supporting, but rather materially supported and financed by taxes and tributes contributed by the rest of the working population. This assumes a sufficient level of labor-productivity [[per capita]] which at least makes possible a ''permanent'' [[surplus product]] (principally foodstuffs) appropriated by the state authority to sustain the activities of state functionaries. Such permanent surpluses were generally not produced on a significant scale in smaller tribal or clan societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Henri J.M. |editor1-last= Claessen |editor2-first= Peter |editor2-last= Skalnik |lastauthoramp= yes |url= https://books.google.com/?id=sMoLhNQ9KRoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Henri+J.M.+Claessen#v=onepage&amp;q=Henri%20J.M.%20Claessen&amp;f=false |title= The Early State |location= The Hague |publisher= Mouton |year= 1978 |via= Google Books|isbn= 9789027979049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist [[Gregory Possehl]] has argued that there is no evidence that the relatively sophisticated, urbanized [[Harappan civilization]], which flourished from about 2,500 to 1,900 BC in the [[Indus]] region, featured anything like a centralized state apparatus. No evidence has yet been excavated locally of palaces, temples, a ruling sovereign or royal graves, a centralized administrative bureaucracy keeping records, or a state religion—all of which are elsewhere usually associated with the existence of a state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Gregory L. |last= Possehl |chapter= Sociocultural Complexity Without the State: The Indus civilization |editor1-first= Gary M. |editor1-last= Feinman |editor2-first= Joyce |editor2-last= Marcus |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Archaic States |location= Santa Fe |publisher= School of American Research Press |year= 1998 |pages= 261–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the earliest large-scale human settlements of the [[stone age]] which have been discovered, such as [[Çatal Höyük]] and [[Jericho]], no evidence was found of the existence of a state authority. The Çatal Höyük settlement of a farming community (7,300 BC to circa 6,200 BC) spanned circa 13 hectares (32 acres) and probably had about 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Chris |editor-last= Scarre |title= The Human Past |edition= 2nd |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson |year= 2009 |page= 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern state-based societies regularly pushed out stateless indigenous populations as their settlements expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Richards |first=  John F. |title= The Unending Frontier: An Environmental History of the Early Modern World |publisher= University of California Press |year= 2004 |isbn= 978-0-520-24678-2 |pages= 4–5 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=i85noYD9C0EC&amp;pg=PA4 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uncontacted peoples]] may be considered remnants of prehistoric stateless societies. To varying extents they may be unaware of and unaffected by the states that have nominal authority over their territory.

==As a political ideal==
Some political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved.

A central tenet of [[anarchism]] is the advocacy of society without states.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Anarchism |title= The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year= 2005 |page= 14 |quote= Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sheehan |first= Sean |title= Anarchism |location= London |publisher= Reaktion Books |year= 2004 |page= 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of society sought for varies significantly between [[anarchist schools of thought]], ranging from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=slevin&gt;{{cite book |last= Slevin |first= Carl |chapter= Anarchism |title= The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics |editor1-first= Iain |editor1-last= McLean |editor2-first= Alistair |editor2-last= McMillan |lastauthoramp= yes |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marxism]], [[Marx's theory of the state]] considers that in a [[post-capitalist]] society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and [[Withering away of the state|wither away]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm |first= Frederick |last= Engels |title= Socialism: Utopian and Scientific |year= 1880 |chapter= Part III: Historical Materialism |quote= State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The State is not "abolished". It dies out...Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible. The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism. In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes, the political authority of the State dies out. Man, at last the master of his own form of social organization, becomes at the same time the lord over Nature, his own master—free. |via= Marx/Engels Internet Archive (marxists.org)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is that of [[stateless communism]], a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx's anticipated post-capitalist society.

==Social and economic organization==
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] have found that [[social stratification]] is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy writes, "Assumptions about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal, that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gowdy |first= John |year= 2006 |chapter= Hunter-Gatherers and the Mythology of the Market |editor1-link= Richard Borshay Lee |editor1-first= Richard B. |editor1-last= Lee |editor2-first= Richard H. |editor2-last= Daly |lastauthoramp= yes |title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers |page= 391 |location= New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-60919-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economies of stateless agricultural societies tend to focus and organize [[subsistence agriculture]] at the community level, and tend to diversify their production rather than specializing in a particular crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Chase |first1= Diane Z. |last2= Chase |first2= Arlen F. |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Mesoamerican Elites: An Archaeological Assessment |publisher= University of Oklahoma Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-0-8061-3542-7 |page= 23 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kwxl5jjQ-dUC&amp;pg=PA23 |via= Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many stateless societies, conflicts between families or individuals are resolved by appealing to the community. Each of the sides of the dispute will voice their concerns, and the community, often voicing its will through village elders, will reach a judgment on the situation. Even when there is no legal or coercive authority to enforce these community decisions, people tend to adhere to them, due to a desire to be held in esteem by the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fleming, Thomas|title=The Politics of Human Nature|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1993|isbn=978-1-56000-693-0|pages=165–166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=saK1sFtSXuEC&amp;pg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mutualism (biology)|Symbiosis (mutualism)]] appears in fiction, especially [[science fiction]], as a plot device. It is distinguished from [[parasitism in fiction]], a similar theme, by the mutual benefit to the organisms involved, whereas the [[parasite]] inflicts harm on its host.&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |title=Parasitism and Symbiosis |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/parasitism_and_symbiosis |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=25 July 2018 |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
{{further|Parasitism in fiction|Human possession in science fiction}}

Relationships between species in early [[science fiction]] were often [[parasitism in fiction|imaginatively parasitic]], with the [[parasite]]s draining the [[Élan vital|vital energy]] of their human hosts and taking over their minds, as in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1895 ''[[The Parasite]]''.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], science fiction moved towards more mutualistic relationships, as in [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]]'s 1970 ''By Furies Possessed''; [[Brian Stableford]] argues that White was consciously opposing the [[xenophobia]] of [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1951 ''[[The Puppet Masters]]'' which involved a parasitic relationship close to [[demonic possession]], with a more positive attitude towards aliens.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Stableford notes, however, that [[Octavia Butler]]'s 1984 ''[[Clay's Ark]]'' and other of her works such as ''[[Fledgling (novel)|Fledgling]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez-Taylor |first1=Joy |title=Fledgling, Symbiosis, and the Nature/Culture Divide |journal=Science Fiction Studies |date=November 2017 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=486-505 |doi=10.5621/sciefictstud.44.3.0486}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dan Simmons]]'s 1989 ''Hyperion'' take an ambivalent position, in which the aliens may confer powers such as ''Hyperion'''s ability to regenerate continually—but at a price, in its case an incremental loss of intelligence at each regeneration.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

[[The Force]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe is described by the fictional seer [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] as "an energy field created by all living things". In ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'', [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] says microscopic lifeforms called midi-chlorians, inside all living cells, allow characters with enough of these symbionts in their cells to feel and use the Force.&lt;ref name="BrooksEpisodeI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace |last=Brooks |first=Terry |authorlink=Terry Brooks |date=1999 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Douglas Adams]]'s humorous 1978 ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Babel fish (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Babel fish]] lives in its human host's ear, feeding on the energy of its host's brain waves, in return translating any language to the host's benefit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: Fit the First'' BBC Radio 4 program, broadcast 8 March 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The American Monomyth''''' is a 1977 book by [[Robert Jewett]] and [[John Shelton Lawrence]] arguing for the existence and cultural importance of an 'American Monomyth', a variation on the classical [[monomyth]] as proposed by [[Joseph Campbell]].

Campbell's monomyth describes a hero's journey: a hero ventures from the normal world into a supernatural one, winning a decisive victory there and returning with a 'boon'. In contrast, Jewett and Lawrence define the American monomyth as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"A community in a harmonious paradise is threatened by evil; normal institutions fail to contend with this threat; a selfless superhero emerges to renounce temptations and carry out the redemptive task; aided by fate, his decisive victory restores the community to its paradisiacal condition; the superhero then recedes into obscurity."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their 2002 book ''The Myth of the American Superhero'' (with Lawrence as first author) and their 2003 book ''Captain America And The Crusade Against Evil: The Dilemma Of Zealous Nationalism'' (with Jewett as first author), the authors extend the thesis by using examples from both American popular culture and the American religious tradition.

''The American Monomyth'' posits a level of cultural belief in American society that helps to explain the desire in American government to [[American exceptionalism|"save" the world]].

Dr. Richard Kreipe states that the distinction between anorexia and wannarexia is that anorexics aren't satisfied by their [[weight loss]], while wannarexics are more likely to derive pleasure from weight loss.&lt;ref name=Newsday&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--wannabe-eating-di0804aug04,0,532415.story?page=2 |title='Wannarexic' girls aspire to be anorexic, eating disordered |accessdate=2007-08-06 | work=Newsday|date=2007-08-04|author=Bauman, Valerie|quote=Most commonly found among teenage girls, wannarexia is a label describing those who claim to have anorexia, or wish they did.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-08-04-wannarexic_N.htm | work=USA Today | title='Wannarexic' girls yearn for eating disorders | date=2007-08-03 | accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who actually suffer from the eating disorder anorexia are angry, offended, or frustrated about wannarexia.&lt;ref name=Newsday /&gt;

Wannarexics may be inspired or motivated by the pro-anorexia, or [[pro-ana]], community that promotes or supports anorexia as a [[Alternative lifestyle|lifestyle choice]] rather than an [[eating disorder]].&lt;ref name=Lyons2006&gt;{{cite journal
