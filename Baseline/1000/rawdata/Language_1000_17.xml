      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23470">The '''Anglophone Problem''', as it is commonly referred to in [[Cameroon]], is a socio-political issue rooted in Cameroon's colonial legacies from the [[Scramble for Africa|Germans]], [[British colonization of Africa|British]], and the [[Scramble for Africa|French]].

The issue classically and principally opposes many Cameroonians from the Northwest and Southwest regions, many of whom consider themselves anglophones, to the Cameroon government. This is based on the fact that these two regions (formally [[Southern Cameroons|British Southern Cameroons]]) were controlled by Britain as a [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] and [[United Nations trust territories|trust territory]] of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] respectively." 

== Background ==
While many Northwesterners and Southwesterners believe there is an anglophone problem, some do not. In fact, the term "anglophone" today creates a lot of controversy, as many former [[French language|French-speaking]] Cameroonians who are either bilingual or speak only English (most of whom have gone through the English sub-system of education) consider themselves as anglophones. The root of the Anglophone problem in Cameroon can be traced back to the Foumban Conference of 1961 that united the two territories, with different colonial legacies, into one state.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Anglophone Problem is increasingly dominating the political agenda of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konings|first=Piet|year=1997|title=The Anglophone Problem in Cameroon|url=|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem has led to arguments and actions (protests, strikes, etc.) that argue for [[federalism]] or separation from the union by the Anglophones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Failure to address the Anglophone Problem threatens Cameroon's ability to create national unity between the two groups of people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Origins ==

=== The European colonizers ===
The roots of the Anglophone problem can be traced back to [[World War I]], when Cameroon was known as [[Kamerun|German Kamerun]]. The [[German Empire]] first gained influence in Cameroon in 1845 when Alfred Saker of the [[Baptist Missionary Society]] introduced a mission station.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|last=Olson|first=James|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1996|isbn=0-313-27917-9|location=|pages=169|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860, German merchants established a factory: the Woermann Company.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On July 5, 1884, local tribes provided the Woermann Company with rights to control the Kamerun River, consequently setting the foundation for the later [[German colonization of Africa|German colonization]] of Kamerun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1916, during World War I, [[French colonial empire|France]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] joined forces to [[Kamerun Campaign|attack and seize]] German Kamerun.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] would award France and Britain mandates over Cameroon as punishment of the Germans who lost the war. Most of German Kamerun was given to the French, over 167,000 square miles of territory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The British were given [[British Cameroons|Northern Cameroons]], about 17,500 square miles of territory and [[Southern Cameroons]], 16,580 square miles. Each colonizer would later influence the colonies with their [[European languages]] and cultures, thus rendering them as Anglophones and Francophones. The large difference in awarded territory has resulted in present-day Cameroon having a huge majority Francophone population and a very small minority Anglophone population.

=== Gaining independence ===
Following [[World War II]], a wave of independence flowed rapidly throughout Africa. The [[United Nations]] obliged that Britain and France relinquish their colonies and guide them towards independence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cameroon-info.net/article/cameroon-bamenda-provincial-episcopal-conference-memorandum-to-president-paul-biya-on-the-current-situation-in-278001.html|title=Bamenda Provincial Episcopal Conference [BAPEC]|last=Anglophone Archbishops|first=|date=December 22, 2016|work=newspaper|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were three political options for British Southern Cameroons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They could become independent by uniting with [[Nigeria]] or with [[French Cameroons|French Cameroun]]. No option of self-determination by becoming independent was given.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The most desired option was independence with the least popular being unification with French Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, during the [[British Cameroons referendum, 1961|British Plebiscite of 1961]], the British argued that Southern Cameroons was not economically viable enough to sustain itself as an independent nation and could only survive by joining with Nigeria or La République du Cameroun (the Republic of Cameroon).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though documents on the United Nations' "Non-Self-Governing Territories" state, "integration should be the result of the freely expressed wishes of the territory's peoples",&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International organisation and integration: a collection of the texts of documents relating to the United Nations, its related agencies and regional international organisations|last=Van Panhuys|first=H.F|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media Dordrecht|year=1968|isbn=978-1-4899-6229-4|location=|pages=288|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations would later reject Southern Cameroons' appeal to have independence as a sovereign nation placed on the ballot.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The plebiscite questions were:   
# ''Do you wish to achieve independence by joining the independent Federation of Nigeria?'' 
#  ''Do you wish to achieve independence by joining the independent Republic of Cameroun?''
The United Nations documents defined the basis of integration as: "Integration with an independent State should be on the basis of complete equality between the peoples of the erstwhile Non-Self-Governing Territory and those of the independent country with which it is integrated. The peoples of both territories should have equal status and rights of citizenship... at all levels in the executive, legislative and judicial organs of government."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With this promise in mind, on [[February 1961]], British Northern Cameroons voted to join Nigeria, while British Southern Cameroons voted to join La République du Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southern West Cameroon Revisited (1950-1972): Unveiling Inescapable Traps|last=Ndi|first=Anthony|publisher=Langaa RPCIG|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Foumban Conference of July 17–21, 1961 ===
The purpose of the [[Foumban Constitutional Conference]] was to create a [[Constitution of Cameroon|constitution]] for the new Federal state of British Southern Cameroon and La République du Cameroun. The conference brought together representatives from La République du Cameroun, including [[Ahmadou Ahidjo|Amadou Ahidjo]], their president, with representatives from Southern Cameroons.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating an Anglophone Identity: A study of the politics of recognition and representation in Cameroon|last=Konings|first=Piet|publisher=Koninklijke Brill|year=2003|isbn=9004132953|location=Netherlands|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks before the Foumban Conference, there were reports that more than one hundred people were killed by terrorists in Loum, [[Bafang]], Ndom, and [[Douala]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africafederation.net/SouthernCameroon.htm|title=The Legal Argument for Southern Cameroon Independence|last=Dounge|first=Germanus|date=January 18, 2017|website=www.africafederation.net|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports worried unification advocates who wanted British Cameroon to unify with French Cameroun.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; For the conference, the location of Foumban had been carefully chosen to make Ahidjo, appear as if he had everything under control. Mr. Mbile, a Southern Cameroonian representative at the conference noted, "Free from all the unrest that had scared Southern Cameroonians, the Francophone authorities had picked the place deliberately for the occasion. The entire town had been exquisitely cleaned up and houses splashed with whitewash. Food was good and receptions lavish. The climate in Foumban real or artificial went far to convince us that despite the stories of 'murder and fire,' there could be at least this island of peace, east of the Mungo."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Before the Foumban Conference, all the parties in Southern Cameroons, the Native Authority Councils and the traditional leaders attended the [[Bamenda Conference]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This conference decided on a common proposal to present when negotiations with La République du Cameroun arrived. Among many things, the Bamenda Conference agreed on a non-centralized federation to ensure there was a distinction between the powers of the states and the powers of the federation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Most of the proposals from the Bamenda Conference were ignored by Ahidjo.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anglophone Cameroon Predicament|last=Atanga|first=Mufor|publisher=Langaa Research &amp; Publishing CIG|year=2011|isbn=9956717118|location=Bamenda|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these proposals included having a [[bicameral]] legislature and decentralizing power, but instead a [[unicameral]] system was established with a centralized system of power.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

At the Foumban conference, Ahidjo presented delegates with a draft constitution. By the end of the conference, instead of creating an entirely new constitution, the contributions of the Southern Cameroons delegates were reflected in suggestions made to the draft initially presented to them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[John Ngu Foncha]] and Ahidjo intended for the Foumban Constitutional Conference to be brief, however delegates left the three day conference with the impression that there would be sequential conferences to continue the drafting of the constitution.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Mbile later noted, "We may have done more if we had spent five months instead of five days in writing our constitution at Foumban."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Constitution for the new Federal Republic was agreed in Yaoundé in August 1961, between Ahidjo and Foncha, pending approval by the House of Assembly of the two states.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the end, the West Cameroon House of Assembly never ratified the Constitution.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, on October 1, 1961, the Federal Republic of Cameroon nevertheless came to fruition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On May 6, 1972, Ahidjo announces his decision to convert the [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] into a [[unitary state]], on the provision that the idea was supported via referendum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This suggestion violated the articles in the Foumban document that read: 'any proposal for the revision of the present constitution, which impairs the unity and integrity of the Federation shall be inadmissible,' and 'proposals for revision shall be adopted by simple majority vote of the members of the Federal Assembly, provided that such majority includes a majority of the representatives ... of each of the Federated States,'... not through referendum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such violations easily allowed for the passing of the referendum that turned the Federal Republic into the United Republic of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Taking into account these actions, the evidence shows that the Francophone's intentions may have not been to form a federal state, but rather to annex Southern Cameroons and not treat them as equals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1984, Ahidjo's successor, [[Paul Biya]], replaced the name "United Republic of Cameroon" with "La République du Cameroun," the same name the francophone Cameroon had before federation talks.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Achankeng|first=Fonkem|year=2014|title=The Foumban "Constitutional" Talks and Prior Intentions of Negotiating: A Historico-Theoretical Analysis of a False Negotiation and the Ramications for Political Developments in Cameroon|url=|journal=Journal of Global Initiatives: Policy, Pedagogy, Perspective|volume=9|pages=149|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With changes in the Constitution of 1996, reference to the existence of a territory called the British Southern Cameroons that had a "functioning self-government and recognized international boundaries" was essentially erased.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== The Anglophone problem ==
Despite the non-acknowledgement/denial of the Anglophone problem from Francophone government leaders,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; there exists a discontent by Anglophones, both young and old, as to how Anglophones are treated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This discontent presents itself in calls for federation or separation with movements that are garnering strength.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the core of Anglophone grievances is the loss of the former West Cameroons as a "distinct community defined by differences in official language and inherited colonial traditions of education, law, and public administration."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eyoh|first=Dickson|year=1998|title=Conflicting Narratives of Anglophone Protest and the Politics of Identity in Cameroon|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary African Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2016, in a letter to [[Paul Biya]], the Anglophone Archbishops of Southern Cameroons define the Anglophone problem as follows:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The failure of successive governments of Cameroon, since 1961, to respect and implement the articles of the Constitution that uphold and safeguard what British Southern Cameroons brought along to the Union in 1961.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The flagrant disregard for the Constitution, demonstrated by the dissolution of political parties and the formation of one political party in 1966, the sacking of Jua and the appointment of [[Salomon Tandeng Muna|Muna]] in 1968 as the Prime Minister of West Cameroon, and other such acts judged by West Cameroonians to be unconstitutional and undemocratic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
# The cavalier management of the 1972 Referendum which took out the foundational element (Federalism) of the 1961 Constitution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The 1984 Law amending the Constitution, which gave the country the original East Cameroon name (The Republic of Cameroon) and thereby erased the identity of the West Cameroonians from the original union. West Cameroon, which had entered the union as an equal partner, effectively ceased to exist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# The deliberate and systematic erosion of the West Cameroon cultural identity which the 1961 Constitution sought to preserve and protect by providing for a bi-cultural federation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Separation ===
Movements which advocate the separation of English-speaking Cameroon from French-speaking Cameroun exist, led by the [[Cameroon Action Group]], the [[Southern Cameroons Youth League]], the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]], the [[Southern Cameroon Peoples Organization]] and the [[Ambazonia Movement]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Federation ===
Advocates of Federation want a return to the constitution agreed upon in the 1961 Foumban Conference that acknowledges the history and culture of the two regions while giving equal power to the two.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This federation had been dismantled on 20 May 1972 by the larger French-speaking Cameroon and extended the latter's executive power throughout West Cameroon.  Federation advocates include the instrumental Consortium of the leaders of three Cameroon-based trade unions: Lawyers, Teachers, and Transporters. It also includes some Cameroonians in the diaspora led by a well organized US-based Anglophone Action Group, Inc. (AAG).  AAG was one of the first groups in the diaspora to endorse the Cameroon-based Consortium as a peaceful alternative to achieving a return to the pre-1972 federated system. Opponents of federation include the ruling [[Cameroon Peoples Democratic Movement]].

=== Unitary ===
Unitarianism do not want Federation or Separation, but rather a decentralized unitary government; whereas, now the government is highly centralized in power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This violates the tenets of the 1996 Constitution as decentralization has yet to be implemented.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Struggle for political representation ==
In March 1990, the [[Social Democratic Front (Cameroon)|Social Democratic Front]] (SDF) led by [[John Fru Ndi]], was founded on the perception of widespread Anglophone alienation. The SDF was the first major opposition party to the People's Democratic Movement, led by Paul Biya.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Symptoms of Anglophone discontent ==
Below are various reasons that Anglophones feel marginalized, systemically, by the government. 
* The National Entrance Examinations into Schools that develop the human resources of Cameroon are set by the French Subsystem of Education. This makes it difficult for Anglophones and Francophones to compete on an equal playing field. The Examination Board members are all Francophone, which places some bias against Anglophone candidates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* There are five Ministries that concern education and none of them are Anglophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Of the 36 Ministers who defended the budgets for the Ministries last month, only one was Anglophone.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* In the 1961 Constitution, the Vice President was the second most important person in state protocol. Today, the Prime Minister (appointed Anglophone) is the fourth most important person in State Protocol, after the President of the Senate and the President of the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Prioritization of French over English ===

* State institutions put documents and public notices in French, with no English translations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
* National Entrance Examinations into some professional schools are set in French only, sometimes even in English-speaking regions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Most of the heads of government offices only speak French, even in the English-speaking regions. Visitors and clients to government offices are then expected to speak in French.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Most Senior Administrators and members of the Forces of Law and Order in the Northwest and Southwest Regions are French-speaking and there is a lack of effort for them to demonstrate an understanding of anglophone culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Spiraling ==
{{As of|2017}}, the Anglophone problem is still on-going. It has spiraled into violence with police officers and gendarmes shooting dead several civilians. Official sources have put the number at 17 dead, but local individuals and groups have talked of 50 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/10/02/cameroon-s-anglophone-crisis-resulted-in-17-deaths-amnesty//|title=Cameroon's Anglophone crisis resulted in 17 deaths - Amnesty {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical members of some secessionist groups have killed several police officers and gendarmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/11/29/four-soldiers-killed-in-cameroon-s-anglophone-region//|title=Four soldiers killed in Cameroon's Anglophone region {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15,000 refugees have fled Southern Cameroons into neighboring Nigeria, with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]] expecting that number to grow to 40,000 if the situation continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/1179202/cameroons-anglophone-crisis-is-threatening-to-spin-out-of-control/|title=Cameroon’s Anglophone crisis is threatening to spin out of control|last=Dahir|first=Abdi Latif|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcomes ==
Without clearly acknowledging the existence of the Anglophone problem, the President of Cameroon has attempted to appease tensions by making a number of announcements:
* President Biya ordered the creation of a Common Law department at the Supreme Court and the School of Administration and Magistracy, ENAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cameroonpostline.com/biya-orders-creation-of-common-law-depts-at-supreme-court-enam/|title=Biya Orders Creation Of Common Law Depts At Supreme Court, ENAM {{!}} CameroonPostline|website=www.cameroonpostline.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his 2017 traditional end-of-year address, he announced there will be an effective decentralization scheme implemented by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prc.cm/en/news/speeches-of-the-president/16-president-paul-biya-to-the-nationzzz|title=President Paul BIYA to the Nation|website=www.prc.cm|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of decentralization is one of the major tenets of [[Constitution of Cameroon#Constitution of the Republic of Cameroon of 1996|Cameroon's 1996 constitution]] which was spearheaded by the Anglophone opposition groups in parliament.
[[List of active separatist movements in Africa|Several separatist or secessionist groups]] have emerged or become more prominent as a result of the harsh response by the government to the Anglophone problem. These groups desire to see Southern Cameroons completely separate from ''[[Cameroon|La République du Cameroun]]'' and form its own state, sometimes referred to as ''[[Ambazonia]]''. Some groups such as the ''Southern Cameroon Ambazonia United Front'' (SCACUF) are using diplomatic means in an attempt to gain independence for the Anglophone regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ambagov.org/|title=Click To Learn More About The Interim Government of Ambazonia - AmbaGov|website=ambagov.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other groups have begun to employ armed confrontation with artisan weapons against the deployed gendarmes and soldiers in those regions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6858">An '''authors' conference''' or '''writers' conference''' is a type of [[:wikt:conference|conference]] where [[writers]] gather to review their [[writing|written works]] and suggest improvements. This process helps an author improve his or her work and learn to be a better writer for future works, both by receiving [[critique]]s of their own work and by [[mentoring]] the work of the other authors. Writers may also benefit from meeting and hearing from professionals in related fields, such as agents, editors, illustrators, publishers, and providers of other relevant services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/literary-agents-explain-why-they-attend-conferences-and-its-not-what-you-think|work=Writers Digest|author=Hoffman, Scott Hoffman | title=Literary Agents Explain Why They Attend Conferences (And It's Not What You Think)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most other conference styles, an authors' conference is very [[participatory]]. Most conferences are divided into [[presentation]]s, each of which has a clear separation of roles among a one or more [[Public speaker|presenter]]s and an audience. While authors' conferences may include some such presentations, writers' conferences also include numerous sessions wherein an author does not present his or her work but rather listens while the other participants discuss the work. In this way, the author gains an understanding of what readers learn by reading the work.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

An authors' conference consists of two phases, shepherding and writers' workshops. Shepherding usually (but not always&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/thewritingcenter-ce/conference |website=Hunter.CUNY.edu |title=Writers' Conference and Intensives: Hunter College's 4th Annual Writers' Conference |date=June 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220817/http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/thewritingcenter-ce/conference |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }} Intensive writing workshops precede the conference.&lt;/ref&gt;) occurs before the conference meeting, and the meeting itself is organized as a writers' workshop.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

One popular series of authors' conferences is the [[Pattern Languages of Programming]] conferences, held to encourage and assist authors of [[software design pattern]]s and [[pattern language]]s.

==Shepherding==
The shepherding process occurs before the conference meeting. Authors submit papers for the conference, then each paper is assigned to a shepherd, an experienced author who works with the submitter to improve his or her paper. The process often consists of three iterations in as many weeks where the shepherd makes suggestions for improvement and the submitter incorporates the suggestions. This one-on-one mentoring using the submitter's unfinished work as an example is very effective for teaching the submitter how to be a better writer, although its effectiveness is ultimately determined by the participants' dedication and their working relationship. At the end of the shepherding process, the shepherd recommends whether to accept the submission for review at the conference. An accepted submission should meet minimal quality standards for effective evaluation in the writers' workshop, and should have been improved significantly by the submitter during the shepherding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Writers' workshop==
The writers' workshop process occurs during the conference meeting. The workshop consists of 6–10 sessions, one per submission to be reviewed. The workshop participants are the authors of those submissions and any other reviewers the authors choose to accept. In a session, the authors of the submission listen quietly while the other participants discuss what they liked about the submission and suggest improvements. This gives the authors of the submission insight into what information readers are learning from the work and ideas for improving the work. Reviewers discussing a work are careful to make productive comments, both because the author is listening and because in other sessions that author will become the reviewer and make comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Basic writing''', or '''developmental writing''', is a discipline of [[composition studies]] which focuses on the writing of students sometimes otherwise called "remedial" or "underprepared", usually [[freshman]] college students.

==Defining basic writing==
Sometimes called “remedial” or “developmental” writing, basic writing (BW) was developed in the 1970s, generally under the constraints of [[open admissions]] policies. Basic writing courses are meant to help students come to a basic understanding and familiarity with formal written English. BW students can be categorized two ways: 1) students coming straight from high school, who did not develop a basic competency in formal written English before graduation and who placed below average on a college writing placement test, and 2) [[non-traditional student]]s who are older than average college freshman and who are coming to college for the first time in order to further their education in the hopes of gaining the skills necessary for better employment and earning more money. These are generally students that may have full-time jobs, come to classes at night, and may have children, and perhaps be a single parent. In some cases non-native and [[English language learning and teaching|ESL]] students are also considered basic writers, because of their unfamiliarity with the English language, let alone formal written English (sometimes identified as [[standard English]]).

BW students are usually characterized by a lack of understanding of the rules of formal written English which may manifest itself in non-traditional syntax, grammar, spelling, punctuation, usage, mechanics, organization, and clarity. [[Mina Shaughnessy]], a pioneer in the field of basic writing, characterized basic writers as “those that had been left so far behind the others in their formal education that they appeared to have little chance of catching up, students whose difficulty with the written language seemed of a different order from those of the other groups, as if they had come, you might say, from a different country, or at least through different schools, where even modest standards of high-school literacy had not been met."&lt;ref&gt;Shaughnessy, Mina. ''Errors and Expectations''. New York: Oxford UP, 1977, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; However, BW is also a relative term. What might be considered freshman-level writing at one university might be characterized as basic writing at another, or even advanced writing at another, depending on the ability of the general student population and university standards.

Basic Writing is also a field of study. The research in the field probes into the concerns of teachers and students on the academic margins. Deborah Mutnick explains about Basic Writing:

“It signifies struggles for inclusion, diversity and equal opportunity; debates over standards and linguistic hegemony; the exploitation of faculty and staff on the academic margins; and the policies that opened and not threatened to close higher education’s doors to masses of people. It has played a key role not only in providing opportunities for research on adult literacy but also in illuminating the politics of writing in terms of race, class, ethnicity, and other social structures that would have remained invisible in the mostly white, middle-class classrooms that have traditionally constituted the “mainstream.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to Composition Pedagogies|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Deborah Mutnick|authorlink=On the Academic Margins: Basic Writing Pedagogy|editor1=Gary Tate |editor2=Amy Rupiper |editor3=Kurt Schick |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of basic writing==
The creation of basic writing courses in colleges across the United States is largely the result of the creation of open-admissions policies that no longer required academic standards be set for entrance into college. The first to start such a program was the City University of New York ([[City University of New York|CUNY]]). Before opening their campus to all those who wanted higher education, regardless of previous academic performance, CUNY had instituted the SEEK program (Search for [[Education]], [[Elevation]], and [[Knowledge]]) which was designed as a pre-collegiate program that was meant to prepare students, who were not yet ready to enter the university, for full admission. However, with the advent of open admissions in 1970 there was no longer a need for pre-collegiate classes, so the program transformed into a course taken by those admitted to the university who did not place well on admissions placement tests. The writing program that stemmed from this transformation became known as a basic writing course because it dealt not with preparing highly literate students for upper-level course work, but with the teaching the very basics of written communication.

Since the late seventies, many colleges and universities have created open admissions policies, and have in turn created BW programs across the country. However, from the very beginning there has been large opposition to open admissions policies. Open admissions detractors have prevailed at some colleges and universities, overturning open admissions policies. As a result, BW course have either been eliminated entirely from the curriculum or have been relegated to community colleges.

==Major theorists==

===Mina P. Shaughnessy===
[[Mina P. Shaughnessy]] (pronounced MY-NA SHAWN-ES-EE), involved with the SEEK program at CUNY, was a proponent of open admissions for City College (part of the CUNY system) and became director of the BW program once City College opened its doors to all. Shaughnessy worked hard not only to design a curriculum for students that seemed alien to the professors that literally did not know what to do with students who seemed not to be able to put two words together, in some cases, but to understand and categorize the characteristics of basic writers in order to understand them better, and be able to teach them more effectively. For this purpose, Shaughnessy compiled four-thousand placement essays written by students as part of the entrance process into City College and classified the errors that she found, trying to understand the logic behind spelling, syntax, grammar, etc., that seemed, at best, scattered and, at worst, completely arbitrary. She published her results in the book [[Errors and Expectations]] (1977). Her main conclusion is that these writers are not scattered or arbitrary, but that they have created systems of [[Standard written English|written English]] based on misunderstood rules, half-understood lessons on punctuation, their own local or familial dialects, among others, and have logically created their own systems of written English. It is not that these students do not understand communication, but they simply have not been taught or have misunderstood the rules of written formal English. Shaughnessy’s work was considered groundbreaking and Errors and Expectations is still considered the seminal book in the field of BW. And although she died in 1978, and other scholars have made contributions to the field, Shaughnessy remains its leading figure today.

[[Mina P. Shaughnessy]] is arguably the most prominent name in the field of BW. She helped create the atmosphere of academic respectability BW needed to become recognized as a legitimate scholarly field. Her 1977 book, [[Errors and Expectations]], set the tone for much (if not all) of the BW scholarship that followed. BW scholars, whether they agree with Shaughnessy or not, are still responding to her.

The ‘‘‘Bedford Bibliography for Teachers of Basic Writing’’’ includes this annotation for [[Errors and Expectations]]:

:“Shaughnessy takes teachers through writing problems such as poor handwriting and punctuation, syntax, common errors, spelling and vocabulary errors, and lack of idea development. While her focus is primarily on error, it is underscored by a sensitive understanding of the reasons behind the rhetorical and linguistic difficulties discussed and a strong belief in the inherent intelligence of learners described as ‘basic writers.’ Shaughnessy's claims about the difficulties faced by basic writers are supported by examples from thousands of student papers. Examples of many kinds of errors are provided. Each chapter also includes suggestions for the teacher on how to reduce the particular kind of error discussed in that specific chapter. Shaughnessy also explains why these errors occur by examining the rules that are manifested in students' writing. The book also contains an appendix that includes suggestions for placement essay topics and also contains suggested readings for the teacher of basic writing.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_res.html#113]

All in all, Shaughnessy saw disadvantaged students as being intelligent (though scholastically under-prepared). She resolutely held that such students could be taught how to effectively write. It is teachers of BW and not BW students that need to radically alter their views toward the teaching and learning of writing. In her 1976 speech, "Diving In: An Introduction to Basic Writing", she asserted that “teachers (need to) realize and accept the need to remediate themselves regarding the needs and learning styles of basic writers.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_bwwwt.html#69]

====Shaughnessy controversy====

From the ‘‘‘Bedford Bibliography for Teachers of Basic Writing’’’:
:“Min-Zhan Lu's 1992 article ‘Conflict and Struggle: The Enemies or Preconditions of Basic Writing?’ [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/cd_tdp.html#216] inspired a flurry of feminist, Marxist, and poststructuralist reexaminations of Mina Shaughnessy's work. These critiqued Shaughnessy on three counts: for forwarding an ‘essentialist’ conception of language that separates thought from expression and views discourse as a transparent vessel for meaning; for promoting basic writers' accommodation to mainstream linguistic standards and thereby minimizing the political dimensions of language use; and for overlooking materialist considerations such as the economic, social, and institutional issues surrounding basic writers and the teaching of basic writing.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_bwwwt.html#50]

To be fair, we should note that Lu’s critique applied to other big names in the field of BW including Mike Rose (see below).

Other notable scholars of BW, however, like Laura Gray-Rosendale have claimed that such critiques of Shaughnessy do not hold much critical weight. “Shaughnessy’s works,” themselves, she claims, “render ambiguous if not outright defy many such negative characterizations.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_bwwwt.html#50]. Also, David Bartholomae (see below) has defended Shaughnessy’s emphasis on error in BW students’ writing (though he still advocates refocusing BW to help students learn various academic dialects). Adjusting the focus a bit, “Bartholomae extends Mina Shaughnessy's hope that teachers, especially basic writing teachers, will examine how they view errors in student writing. For example, he suggests that teachers who cannot understand student prose do not read the prose as complex texts and thus do not find the logic at work in many errors.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_bwwwt.html#43]

===David Bartholomae===

[[David Bartholomae]] is Professor of English and Chair of the English Department at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Bartholomae’s most-referenced publication about BW is the book chapter “Inventing the University.” The following is a selection from that chapter:

:“Every time a student sits down to write for us, he has to invent the university for the occasion--invent the university, that is, or a branch of it, like history or anthropology or economics or English. The student has to learn to speak our language, to speak as we do, to try on the peculiar ways of knowing, selecting, evaluating, reporting, concluding, and arguing that define the discourse of our community. Or perhaps I should say the various discourses of our community, since it is in the nature of a liberal arts education that a student, after the first year or two, must learn to try on a variety of voices and interpretive schemes--to write, for example, as a literary critic one day and as an experimental psychologist the next; to work within fields where the rules governing the presentation of examples or the development of an argument are both distinct and, even to the professional, mysterious. The student has to appropriate (or be appropriated by) a specialized discourse, and he has to do this as though he were easily and comfortably one with his audience, as though he were a member of the academy or an historian or an anthropologist or an economist; he has to invent the university by assembling and mimicking its language while finding some compromise between idiosyncrasy, a personal history, on the one hand, and the requirements of convention, the history of a discipline, on the other hand. He must learn to speak our language. Or he must dare to speak it or to carry off the bluff, since speaking and writing will most certainly be required long before the skill is ‘learned.’ And this, understandably, causes problems.” [http://www.wiu.edu/users/mfbhl/elgin/bartholome.htm]

Bartholomae asserts that (though important) error should not determine the efforts of or relationship between BW teachers and their students. Rather, BW teachers should recognize that the language they demand from their BW students (typically short, direct, non-abstruse sentences) is not the language that they (the teachers) typically write and publish in. Students experience such disconnect between what they learn from their writing classes and what their discipline specific course require of them that they are often left to their own devices to figure out how to write acceptably in any given discipline. To resolve this, Bartholomae believes that BW teachers should immerse their students with academic writing (peer reviewed journal articles, book chapters, etc.). BW students thus get healthy exposure to sufficient sums of “academic” language in a teacher-assisted environment. This, Bartholomae claims, should help BW students make the transition more quickly to start writing “academically.” The idea that academics might personally strive to exhibit a clear, cogent, and elegant style in their articles and chapters, and thus model good writing for their students to emulate, is not entertained.

===Mike Rose===

[[Mike Rose (educator)|Mike Rose]] is Professor of Social Research Methodology at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. He is best known in the BW community for his part autobiographical/part pedagogically philosophical book, ‘‘Lives on the Boundary.’’

The ''Bedford Bibliography for Teachers of Basic Writing'' offers this annotation:

: “This examination of the idea of ‘underpreparedness’ in a range of educational schools and systems also explores Rose's own experiences as a student who was erroneously placed in the vocational education track. He suggests that lower-track classes create a self-fulfilling prophesy for most students who might, if challenged to succeed, do well in advanced classes. Among the issues Rose discusses are the problems encountered by students whose improvised backgrounds provide little context for the ideas and language they encounter in the academy. By explaining his personal challenges and his experiences with various mentors, Rose illustrates how he worked to master academic language and ideas. Rose uses his experiences as a student and a teacher as evidence for a critique of conceptions of literacy used in contemporary education. He suggests that students labeled "underprepared" are inexperienced with the expectations of the academy, that literacy crises running through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were manufactured and deflect other concerns, and that schools must work with students differently.” [http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/basicbib/content/ht_res.html#111]

Rose’s main interests in the study of thinking and learning include the, “study of the factors – cognitive, linguistic, socio-historical, and cultural – that enhance or limit people's engagement with written language.” As well as, “The development of pedagogies and materials to enhance critical reading and writing, particularly at the secondary and post-secondary level, and particularly with ‘underprepared’ or ‘at risk’ populations.” [https://web.archive.org/web/20070208184325/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/members/mrose]

Additionally, Rose has argued for the term basic writing as opposed to the terms "developmental" or "remedial" which have the connotations of medical terminology:

"This atomistic, medical model of language is simply not supported by more recent research in language and cognition. But because the teaching of writing – particularly teaching designated remedial has been conceptually, and [...] administratively segmented from the rich theoretical investigation that characterizes other humanistic study, these assumptions have rarely been subjected to rigorous and comprehensive scrutiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Mike|title=Lives on the Boundary|year=1989|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0140124039|pages=210–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I undid a revision which added AAVE to the see also, insinuating it is "broken English".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2779">{{other uses|Bad English (disambiguation)|Broken English (disambiguation)}}

'''Broken English''' is a poorly spoken or ill-written version of the English language, sometimes considered a [[pidgin]]. Under the strictest definition of the term, broken English consists of English vocabulary grafted onto the syntax of a non-English speaker's native language, including word order, other aspects of sentence structure, and the presence or absence of [[Article (grammar)|articles]] in the speaker's native language. Typically, the non-English speaker also strips English phrases of linguistic markings that are [[definite article]]s or certain [[verb tense]]s.

In some communities, young people may intentionally adopt versions of the English language that older people consider to be broken English. This has been documented, for example, among the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]], where the younger generation was more proficient in English than the previous generation, but intentionally made modifications to the language to assert their own sense of cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Hickey, ''Standards of English: Codified Varieties Around the World'' (2012), p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

In literature, broken English is often used to depict the foreignness of a character, or that character's lack of [[intelligence]] or [[education]]. However, [[Poetry|poets]] have also intentionally used broken [[English language|English]] to create a desired artistic impression, or as a creative experiment writing somewhere between standard English and a local language or dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Peter France, ''The Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translation'' (2001), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', [[William Shakespeare]] used broken English to convey the national pride of Scottish and Irish allies in the King's invasion of Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Blank, ''Broken English: Dialects and the Politics of Language in Renaissance Writings'' (2002), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; When Henry himself last implores the French Princess Katherine to marry him, knowing that her command of the English language is limited, he says to her: "Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break thy mind to me in broken English."&lt;ref&gt;Paula Blank, ''Broken English: Dialects and the Politics of Language in Renaissance Writings'' (2002), p. 167, quoting ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', Act V, scene ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political background==
[[File:Zeynelabidin Daver.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Abidin Daver]] advocated for the Turkish language, history, and geography to be taught in all non-Muslim schools]]
[[File:Hamdullah Suphi Bey Tanrıöver.jpg|thumb|155px|right|[[Hamdullah Suphi Tanrıöver]] believed that minorities could not be accepted as citizens of Turkey if they did not speak Turkish or accepted Turkish culture]]
During the Ottoman Empire in 1911, the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] decided to employ the Turkish language in all the schools of the Empire, with the aim to denationalize all the non-Turkish communities and instil patriotism among Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Gocek, Fatma Muge. 2002. ‘The decline of the Ottoman empire and the emergence of Greek Armenian, Turkish, and Arab nationalisms’ in F. M. Gocek (ed.), Social Constructions of Nationalism: in the Middle East. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 15–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The reformation of the state schooling system and of language by the compulsory use of demotic Turkish aimed for the linguistic homogenization of society.&lt;ref&gt;Göl, A. (2005). Imagining the Turkish nation through 'othering' Armenians. Nations and Nationalism. 11(1), pp.121-139&lt;/ref&gt; The standardization of the Turkish language aimed to sever the link with the Ottoman language and past in order to create a new sense of Turkish nationhood.

When the Turkish Republic was founded, nationalism and secularism were two of the founding principals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Findley|first=Carter Vaughn|title=Turkey, Islam, nationalism, and modernity : a history, 1789-2007|year=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300152609}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the leader of the early years of the Republic, aimed to create a [[nation state]] ({{lang-tr|ulus}}) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. [[Kemalism|Kemalist]] ideology defines the "Turkish People" as "those who protect and promote the moral, spiritual, cultural and humanistic values of the Turkish Nation."&lt;ref name="TurkishNational"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.meb.gov.tr/Stats/apk2001ing/Section_1/1Generalprincipals.htm |title = Turkish National Education System |accessdate = 2008-02-20 |author = Republic Of Turkey Ministry Of National Education |publisher = T.C. Government }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemalist criteria for national ''identity'' or simply being a Turk also refers to a shared [[language]]. In 1931 in a speech in [[Adana]], Atatürk was quoted during a speech as saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Kieser|editor-first=Hans-Lukas|title=Turkey beyond nationalism : towards post-nationalist identities|year=2006|publisher=Tauris|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9781845111410|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKVSHjjUT2UC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=a%20person%20who%20says%20he%20belongs%20to%20the%20turkish%20nation%20should%20in%20the%20first%20place&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20person%20who%20says%20he%20belongs%20to%20the%20turkish%20nation%20should%20in%20the%20first%20place&amp;f=false|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|accessdate=8 January 2013|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|One of the most obvious, precious qualities of a nation is language.

Many Turkish politicians and intellectuals believed that in order to attain full rights as a Turkish citizen, one must learn and speak Turkish.&lt;ref name="Citizenship in a global world : European questions and Turkish experiences"&gt;{{cite book|editor=E.

American University International Law Review, 26(5), 1241-1313.&lt;/ref&gt; The "pure Turk" teachers received a salary set by the Ministry which was substantially higher than regular teachers, resulting in a heavy financial burden for minority schools.&lt;ref name=pure /&gt;

In 1935, during a speech at the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican Party]]'s fourth congress, Prime Minister [[İsmet İnönü]] was quoted as saying, "We will not remain silent.

The campaign went beyond the measures of mere policy of speaking Turkish, to an outright prevention and prohibition of any other language.&lt;ref name="Turkey beyond nationalism: towards post-nationalist identities" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grammatology and literary modernity in Turkey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cumhuriyet yıllarında Türkiye Yahudleri bir türkleştirme serüveni ; (1923 - 1945)" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Citizenship /&gt;

==="Citizen, speak Turkish!" campaign===
[[File:Proof of Citizen Speak Turkish Campain in Turkey.jpg|thumbnail|left|Cumhuriyet newspaper of the Gönen dictrict of Balıkesir on 21 May 1936]]

On January 13, 1928, the student union at the Darülfünun Law School in [[Istanbul]] started a campaign with the objective of preventing the use of languages other than Turkish to be used in public.&lt;ref name="Grammatology and literary modernity in Turkey" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Citizenship /&gt;&lt;ref name="Türkiye’nin ‘Öz Dil’ Zorbalığı Serüveni"&gt;{{cite news|title=Türkiye’nin ‘Öz Dil’ Zorbalığı Serüveni|url=http://www.haksozhaber.net/turkiyenin-oz-dil-zorbaligi-seruveni-28018h.htm|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Haksoz Haber|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs were held by campaign organizers that proclaimed, "''We cannot call Turk to those who do not speak Turkish''".&lt;ref name="Cumhuriyet yıllarında Türkiye Yahudleri bir türkleştirme serüveni ; (1923 - 1945)" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Citizenship /&gt; Some campaigners also chanted, "Speak Turkish or leave the country!".&lt;ref name=Citizenship /&gt; The campaigners placed posters in the major cities of the country with the slogan "Citizen, speak Turkish!" and the message further spread into the mass media, press, and political circles throughout the country.&lt;ref name=Citizenship /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galanti, A. (2000) Vatandaş Türkçe Konuş Yahut Türkçe'nin Ta'mimi Meselesi: Tarihi, İçtimai, Siyasi (Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt; Signs in theaters, restaurants, hotels, and ferries urged everyone to speak Turkish and many people were harassed in public or criminalized for using a language other than Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekmekcioglu|first=Lerna|title=Improvising Turkishness: Being Armenian in post-Ottoman Istanbul (1918-1933)|year=2010|location=Ann Arbor|isbn=9781124044422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens found to be using a language other than Turkish may sometimes have been charged with violating Article 159 (now defunct) of the Turkish penal code for "insulting Turkishness" as a legal justification.&lt;ref name="Citizenship in a global world : European questions and Turkish experiences" /&gt;

In the 1960s, the movement saw its revival as posters and signs were placed and hung throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonia Susan Byatt|author2=Edouard Roditi|author3=Murat Belge|author4=Işık Şimşek, Association Méditerranéens|title=Istanbul, many worlds|publisher=L'Association Méditerranéens, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peroomian&gt;{{cite book|last=Peroomian|first=Rubina|title=And those who continued living in Turkey after 1915 : the metamorphosis of the post-genocide Armenian identity as reflected in artistic literature|year=2008|publisher=Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute|location=Yerevan|isbn=9789994196326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government sponsorship===
[[File:Mustafa_ulusan.jpg|thumb|165px|right|Mustafa Ulusan, far-right politician who advocated for a law that would fine those who spoke non-Turkish languages in public]]
Prior to the launch of the "Citizen, speak Turkish!" campaign, many initiatives were already taken by the government of Turkey to make Turkish the sole language of the public. In 1924 during a session of the [[Turkish National Assembly]], a law was proposed to make Turkish a compulsory language and refusing to speak it resulted in a fine.&lt;ref name="Cumhuriyet yıllarında Türkiye Yahudleri bir türkleştirme serüveni ; (1923 - 1945)" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Citizenship /&gt; Meanwhile, as the debates in the National Assembly were ongoing, the municipal government of [[Bursa]] took the first initiative and began to impose fines to those who spoke a non-Turkish language in public areas.&lt;ref name="Cumhuriyet yıllarında Türkiye Yahudleri bir türkleştirme serüveni ; (1923 - 1945)" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Citizenship /&gt; This was followed by the cities of [[Balıkesir]] and [[Bergama]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="Cumhuriyet yıllarında Türkiye Yahudleri bir türkleştirme serüveni ; (1923 - 1945)" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Citizenship /&gt;

After the launch of the "Citizen, speak Turkish!" campaign of 1928, arrests were being made all throughout the country with full support of the government who encouraged provincial governors 'to incorporate Turks with foreign dialects into the Turkish community by making Turkish their mother tongue'.&lt;ref name="Tormented by history: nationalism in Greece and Turkey" /&gt; In 1933, in the town of [[Mersin]], British citizens, speaking French, were reportedly attacked in public. It was later reported that hundreds were being arrested for speaking languages other than Turkish in public.&lt;ref name="Islam, Secularism, and Nationalism in Modern Turkey : who is a Turk?" /&gt; In a specific case, a M. Chalfoun and a certain Jewish merchant were arrested for speaking Arabic and French to a merchant in town. The accused were released only after the mayor of [[Mersin]] pardoned them after visiting them in prison.&lt;ref name="Islam, Secularism, and Nationalism in Modern Turkey : who is a Turk?" /&gt;

New laws were being promulgated throughout the country. In 1936, the municipal governments of [[Tekirdağ]], [[Lüleburgaz]], and [[Edirne]] passed decrees to fine those who spoke non-Turkish languages in public.&lt;ref name="Islam, Secularism, and Nationalism in Modern Turkey : who is a Turk?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Türkiye’nin ‘Öz Dil’ Zorbalığı Serüveni" /&gt; Soon thereafter, cities and towns such as [[Diyarbakır]], [[Adana]], [[Ankara]], and [[Kırklareli]] followed suit.&lt;ref name="Türkiye’nin ‘Öz Dil’ Zorbalığı Serüveni" /&gt;

'''Classical Mongolian''' is an extinct{{cn|date=January 2013}} [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] language formerly used in [[Mongolia]], [[China]], and [[Russia]]. It is a standardized written language used in the 18th century and 20th centuries. Notable texts include the translation of the [[Kanjur]] and [[Tanjur]] and several chronicles roughly between 1700 and 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]] (2003): Written Mongol: 32. In: Janhunen (ed.): ''The Mongolic languages''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Classical Mongolian'' sometimes refers to any language documents in [[Mongolian script]] that are neither Pre-classical (i.e. [[Middle Mongol language|Middle Mongol]] in Mongolian script) nor [[Mongolian language|modern Mongolian]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=cmg Linguist List entry for Classical Mongolian]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer-assisted translation''','''computer-aided translation''' or '''CAT''' is a form of [[translation|language translation]] in which a human translator uses [[computer hardware]] to support and facilitate the translation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Computer-aided Translation Technology|last=Bowker|first=Lynne|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Ottawa|pages=144|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer program|Computer]]-assisted translation is sometimes called machine-assisted, or machine-aided, translation (not to be confused with [[machine translation]]).

== Overview ==

The automatic machine translation systems available today are not able to produce high-quality translations unaided: their output must be edited by a human to correct errors and improve the quality of translation. Computer-assisted translation (CAT) incorporates that manual editing stage into the software, making translation an interactive process between human and computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barrachina |first=Sergio |year=2009 |title=Statistical Approaches to Computer-Assisted Translation |journal=Computational Linguistics|volume=35|issue=1|pages=3–28 |issn=0891-2017 |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/J/J09/J09-1002.pdf |doi=10.1162/coli.2008.07-055-r2-06-29|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some advanced computer-assisted translation solutions include controlled machine translation (MT). Higher priced MT modules generally provide a more complex set of tools available to the translator, which may include terminology management features and various other linguistic tools and utilities. Carefully customized user dictionaries based on correct terminology significantly improve the accuracy of MT, and as a result, aim at increasing the efficiency of the entire translation process.

== Range of tools ==

Computer-assisted translation is a broad and imprecise term covering a range of tools, from the fairly simple to the complicated. These can include:
* [[Translation memory]] tools (TM tools), consisting of a [[database]] of text segments in a source language and their translations in one or more target languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=Tina Paulsen|last2=Schjoldager|first2=Anne|title=Translation-Memory (TM) Research: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/10113/Hermes-44paulsen_christensenschjoldager.pdf|journal=Hermes|volume=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Spell checkers]], either built into [[word processing]] software, or available as [[Plug-in (computing)|add-on programs]]
* [[Grammar checker]]s, either built into word processing software, or available as add-on programs. 
* [[Terminology]] managers, which allow translators to manage their own [[terminology bank]] in an electronic form. This can range from a simple table created in the translator's word processing software or spreadsheet, a database created in a program such as [[FileMaker|FileMaker Pro]] or, for more robust (and more expensive) solutions, specialized software packages such as [[SDL MultiTerm]], LogiTerm, Termex, TermWeb, etc.
* Electronic dictionaries, either unilingual or bilingual, also known as dictorobotary
* Terminology databases, either on the host computer or accessible through the Internet, such as [[TERMIUM Plus]] or [[Grand dictionnaire terminologique]] from the [[Office québécois de la langue française]]
* [[Full-text search|Full-text search tools]] (or indexers), which allow the user to query already translated texts or reference documents of various kinds. Some such indexers are [[ISYS Search Software]], [[DtSearch Corp.|dtSearch Desktop]] and Naturel
* [[Concordancer]]s, which are programs that retrieve instances of a word or an expression and their respective context in a monolingual, bilingual or multilingual corpus, such as a bitext or a translation memory
* [[Bitext]] aligners: tools that align a source text and its translation which can then be analyzed using a [[full-text search|full-text search tool]] or a concordancer
* [[Project management software]] that allows linguists to structure complex translation projects in a form of chain of tasks (often called "workflow"), assign the various tasks to different people, and track the progress of each of these tasks

== Concepts ==

===Translation memory software===
[[Translation memory]] programs store previously translated source texts and their equivalent target texts in a database and retrieve related segments during the translation of new texts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Terminology Management and MT|url=http://www.circuitmagazine.org/images/stories/documents/archives/ci_117_12.pdf|journal=Circuit|volume=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such programs split the source text into manageable units known as "segments". A source-text sentence or sentence-like unit (headings, titles or elements in a list) may be considered a segment. Texts may also be segmented into larger units such as paragraphs or small ones, such as clauses. As the translator works through a document, the software displays each source segment in turn, and provides a previous translation for re-use if it finds a matching source segment in its database. If it does not, the program allows the translator to enter a translation for the new segment. After the translation for a segment is completed, the program stores the new translation and moves on to the next segment. In the dominant paradigm, the translation memory is, in principle, a simple database of fields containing the source language segment, the translation of the segment, and other information such as segment creation date, last access, translator name, and so on. Another translation memory approach does not involve the creation of a database, relying on aligned reference documents instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CAT Tools vs. Machine Translation: What’s the Best Method?|url=https://asianabsolute.co.uk/cat-tools-vs-machine-translation-whats-the-best-method/|publisher=Asian Absolute|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some translation memory programs function as [[Computer software|standalone]] environments, while others function as an [[Plug-in (computing)|add-on]] or [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] for commercially available word-processing or other business software programs. Add-on programs allow source documents from other formats, such as desktop publishing files, [[spreadsheet]]s, or [[HTML]] code, to be handled using the TM program.

Translation memory technology is particularly useful to organizations translating text that contains specialized vocabulary related to a particular industry, such as automotive manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Translation Productivity Tools for Businesses|url=https://www.pairaphrase.com/translation-productivity-tools-for-businesses/|website=Pairaphrase|publisher=Pairaphrase Blog|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language search-engine software===
New to the [[translation industry]], Language search-engine software is typically an Internet-based system that works similarly to Internet search engines. Rather than searching the Internet, however, a language search engine searches a large repository of Translation Memories to find previously translated sentence fragments, phrases, whole sentences, even complete paragraphs that match source document segments.

Language search engines are designed to leverage modern search technology to conduct searches based on the source words in context to ensure that the search results match the meaning of the source segments. Like traditional TM tools, the value of a language search engine rests heavily on the Translation Memory repository it searches against.

===Terminology management software===
[[Terminology]] management software provides the translator a means of automatically searching a given terminology database for terms appearing in a document, either by automatically displaying terms in the translation memory software interface window or through the use of hot keys to view the entry in the terminology database. Some programs have other hotkey combinations allowing the translator to add new terminology pairs to the terminology database on the fly during translation. Some of the more advanced systems enable translators to check, either interactively or in [[batch processing|batch mode]], if the correct source/target term combination has been used within and across the translation memory segments in a given project. Independent terminology management systems also exist that can provide workflow functionality, visual taxonomy, work as a type of term checker (similar to spell checker, terms that have not been used correctly are flagged) and can support other types of multilingual term facet classifications such as pictures, videos, or sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etudiant.uqo.ca/tamacanada2008/documents/Tama_workshop_warburton.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425021222/http://etudiant.uqo.ca/tamacanada2008/documents/Tama_workshop_warburton.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Alignment software===
Alignment programs take completed translations, divide both source and target texts into segments, and attempt to determine which segments belong together in order to build a [[translation memory]] or other reference resource with the content. Many alignment programs allow translators to manually realign mismatched segments. The resulting bitext (also known as [[parallel text]]) alignment can then be imported into a translation memory program for future translations or used as a reference document.

===Interactive machine translation===
[[Interactive machine translation]] is a paradigm in which the automatic system attempts to predict the translation the human translator is going to produce by suggesting translation hypotheses. These hypotheses may either be the complete sentence, or the part of the sentence that is yet to be translated.

===Augmented translation===
Augmented translation is a form of human translation carried out within an integrated technology environment that provides translators access to subsegment adaptive [[machine translation]] (MT) and [[translation memory]] (TM), [[Computer-assisted_translation#Terminology_management_software|terminology lookup]] (CAT), and automatic content enrichment (ACE) to aid their work, and that automates project management, file handling, and other ancillary tasks.&lt;ref name="depalma-lommel 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/Default.aspx?Contenttype=ArticleDetAD&amp;tabID=63&amp;Aid=37907&amp;moduleId=390 |title=Augmented Translation Powers up Language Services |last=DePalma  |first=Donald A. and Arle Lommel |date=2017-02-15 |publisher=Common Sense Advisory |access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/focus/cognitive-technologies/artificial-intelligence-government.html |title=AI-augmented government: Using cognitive technologies to redesign public sector work |last=Eggers  |first=William D., David Schatsky, and Dr. Peter Viechnicki |date=2017-04-26 |publisher=Deloitte University Press |access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the concept of [[augmented reality]], augmented translation seeks to make translators more productive by providing them with relevant information on an as-needed basis. This information adapts to the habits and style of individual translators in order to accelerate their work and increase productivity. It differs from classical [[Postediting|postediting of MT]], which has linguists revise entire texts translated by machines, in that it provides machine translation and information as suggestions that can be adopted in their entirety, edited, or ignored, as appropriate.&lt;ref name="depalma-lommel 2017"/&gt;

Augmented translation extends principles first developed in the 1980s that made their way into CAT tools. However, it integrates several functions that have previously been discrete into one environment. For example, translators historically have had to leave their translation environments to do terminology research, but in an augmented environment, an ACE component would automatically provide links to information about terms and concepts found in the text directly within the environment.

As of May 2017, no full implementations of an augmented translation environment exist, although individual developers have created partial systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7353">The '''Consorzio ICoN''' is an interuniversity consortium for [[Italian Studies]] established in 1999. It consists of 21 Italian universities and focuses on [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]]. The consortium is based and administrated at the [[University of Pisa]] and is supported by the Italian [[Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (Italy)|Ministry of University and Research]] (''Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca''). It aims at diffusing Italian language, culture and literature.

* [[University of Trento]] (Università degli Studi di Trento)
* [[University of Turin]] (Università degli Studi di Torino)
* [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]] (Università "Cà Foscari" di Venezia)

== Bachelor's degree ==

The [[University of Pisa]], in collaboration with the consortium, offers a [[bachelor's degree]] program in Italian [[philology]] and [[cultural studies]] (Corso di laurea triennale in ''Lingua e cultura italiana per stranieri'') for foreigners and expatriates, based on [[distance education]] and [[e-learning]]. The program refers to the bachelor's degree class L-10 (literary studies) and offers four majors in

* [[linguistics]] and [[didactics]],
* [[literature]],
* [[arts]] and
* [[history]] and [[culture]].

Exams are carried out at institutions in the country of residence (partner universities, Italian embassies). The title will be issued by the administrative university, actually Pisa, mentioning all participating universities. As Italy is part of [[European Higher Education Area]], the program has a value of 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] points and permits to participate in a [[Master's degree]] program.

== Master's degrees ==

The ICoN consortium organizes three [[executive master's degree]]s (60 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) in the field of Italian studies. They consist of phases of attendance, distance education and e-learning. The offer includes

* [[Translation|Specialized translation]] (English–Italian), issued by the Universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]], [[University of Bari|Bari]] and [[University of Genoa|Genoa]]
* [[Didactics]] of Italian language and literature, issued by the Foreigner Universities of [[University for Foreigners Perugia|Perugia]] and [[Foreigners University of Siena|Siena]]
* [[Cultural heritage management]], issued by the [[University of Parma]]

== Language courses ==

The consortium ICoN also offers language courses and programs in written Italian at distinct levels. For native English speakers special packages have been designed in collaboration with the [[National Italian American Foundation]] and the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]]'s department of Italian. The courses have been awarded with the [[European Commission]]'s ''European Language Label''.

A '''counterword''' (also spelled '''counter word''' and '''counter-word''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsmyth.net/?level=3&amp;ent=counterword+|title=Wordsmyth Dictionary|website=wordsmyth.net}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/counterword?r=66|title=the definition of counterword|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a word such as ''"so"'' that is frequently used to answer ("counter") in a reflex-like manner and that has due to this frequent use quickly taken on a new, much less specific or much looser meaning or is even almost meaningless or performs a completely new function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/counterword|title=Meaning of counterword |website=InfoPlease}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/counterword|title=Counterword definition and meaning |website=Collins English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "so", for example, is frequently used to begin an answer in the sense of "Well,..." or to function as an indirect way of saying "Before answering that, I'd like to..." or even instead of saying "On the contrary,..." or "No, I...".

In a more general sense, the term is used for such words also when they are not used as a reflex-like answer and even for any widely used words that (due to a similar change) now have a broad and vague range of meanings in many very different situations (e.g. case, awfully, fix, job, payoff).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.word.com/idictionary/counterword+|title=Definition of COUNTERWORD|website=i.word.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since such change due to very frequent use occurs much more rapidly than the change in meaning all words go through, and since such words are even sometimes still simultaneously used in their original sense, the new usage is often considered incorrect by some speakers. Other examples include ''nice'', ''terrific'', ''terrible'', ''awful'', ''tremendous'', ''swell'', ''hopefully'' and ''very fine'' (degrading the meaning of ''fine'' to "OK").

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' does not support this and defines counter-word as "countersign", noting that its usage is military and obsolete with a single quotation from 1678.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/43064?redirectedFrom=counterword#eid "counter-word"], ''Oxford English Dictionary''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14147">'''Digital infinity''' is a technical term in [[theoretical linguistics]]. Alternative formulations are "discrete infinity" and "the infinite use of finite means". The idea is that all human languages follow a simple logical principle, according to which a limited set of digits—irreducible atomic sound elements—are combined to produce an infinite range of potentially meaningful expressions. 

[[Image:Galileos Dialogue Title Page.png|thumb|300px|right|Frontispiece and title page of the ''Dialogue'']]{{quotation|'Language is, at its core, a system that is both digital and infinite. To my knowledge, there is no other biological system with these properties....'|{{Citation|title=''Noam Chomsky''}}&lt;ref name="NoamChomsky"&gt;Noam Chomsky, 1991. Linguistics and Cognitive Science: Problems and Mysteries. in Asa Kasher (ed.), ''The Chomskyan Turn.'' Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 26-53, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quotation|‘It remains for us to examine the spiritual element of speech ... this marvelous invention of composing from twenty-five or thirty sounds an infinite variety of words, which, although not having any resemblance in themselves to that which passes through our minds, nevertheless do not fail to reveal to others all of the secrets of the mind, and to make intelligible to others who cannot penetrate into the mind all that we conceive and all of the diverse movements of our souls.’|{{Citation|title=''[[Antoine Arnauld]] and Claude Lancelot''}}&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Arnauld and Claude Lancelot, 1975 (1660). ''The Port-Royal Grammar.'' The Hague: Mouton, pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Noam Chomsky]] cites [[Galileo]] as perhaps the first to recognise the significance of digital infinity. This principle, notes Chomsky, is "the core property of human language, and one of its most distinctive properties: the use of finite means to express an unlimited array of thoughts". In his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogo]]'', Galileo describes with wonder the discovery of a means to communicate one's "most secret thoughts to any other person ... with no greater difficulty than the various collocations of twenty-four little characters upon a paper." This is the greatest of all human inventions, Galileo continues, comparable to the creations of a Michelangelo...&lt;ref name="NoamChomsky" /&gt;

== The computational theory of mind ==
'Digital infinity' corresponds to Noam Chomsky's '[[universal grammar]]' mechanism, conceived as a computational [[Language module|module]] inserted somehow into ''Homo sapiens''{{'}} otherwise 'messy' (non-digital) brain. This conception of human cognition—central to the so-called '[[cognitive revolution]]' of the 1950s and 1960s—is generally attributed to [[Alan Turing]], who was the first scientist to argue that a man-made machine might truly be said to 'think'. The idea of a thinking machine had previously been considered absurd, having been famously dismissed by [[René Descartes]] as ''theoretically'' impossible. Neither animals nor machines can think, insisted Descartes, since they lack a God-given soul.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Descartes, 1985 [1637]. 'Discourse on the Method.' In ''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes.'' Translated by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D. Murdoch. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Vol. 1, pp. 139-141. &lt;/ref&gt; Turing was well aware of this traditional theological objection, and explicitly countered it.&lt;ref name="Turing"&gt;Alan Turing, 1950. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. ''Mind'' 59: 433-60.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today's digital computers are instantiations of Turing's theoretical breakthrough in conceiving the possibility of a man-made ''universal thinking machine''—known nowadays as a '[[Turing machine]]'. No physical mechanism can be intrinsically 'digital', Turing explained, since—examined closely enough—its possible states will vary without limit. But if most of these states can be profitably ignored, leaving only a limited set of relevant distinctions, then ''functionally'' the machine may be considered 'digital':&lt;ref name="Turing"/&gt; {{quotation|'The digital computers considered in the last section may be classified amongst the "discrete-state machines." These are the machines which move by sudden jumps or clicks from one quite definite state to another. These states are sufficiently different for the possibility of confusion between them to be ignored. Strictly speaking, there are no such machines. Everything really moves continuously. But there are many kinds of machine which can profitably be thought of as being discrete-state machines. For instance in considering the switches for a lighting system it is a convenient fiction that each switch must be definitely on or definitely off. There must be intermediate positions, but for most purposes we can forget about them.' |{{Citation|title=''Alan Turing''}}&lt;ref name="Alan Turing"&gt;Alan Turing, 1950. [[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]. ''Mind'' 59: 433-60&lt;/ref&gt;}}
An implication is that 'digits' don't exist: they and their combinations are no more than convenient fictions, operating on a level quite independent of the material, physical world. In the case of a ''binary'' digital machine, the choice at each point is restricted to 'off' versus 'on'. Crucially, the intrinsic properties of the [[Media (communication)|medium]] used to encode signals then have no effect on the message conveyed. 'Off' (or alternatively 'on') remains unchanged regardless of whether the signal consists of smoke, electricity, sound, light or anything else. In the case of analog (more-versus-less) gradations, this is not so because the range of possible settings is unlimited. Moreover, in the analog case it ''does'' matter which particular medium is being employed: equating a certain intensity of smoke with a corresponding intensity of light, sound or electricity is just not possible. In other words, only in the case of ''digital'' computation and communication can information be truly independent of the physical, chemical or other properties of the materials used to encode and transmit messages.

Digital computation and communication operates, then, independently of the physical properties of the computing machine. As scientists and philosophers during the 1950s digested the implications, they exploited the insight to explain why 'mind' apparently operates on so different a level from 'matter'. Descartes celebrated distinction between immortal 'soul' and mortal 'body' was conceptualised, following Turing, as no more than the distinction between (digitally encoded) ''information'' on the one hand, and, on the other, the particular physical ''medium''—light, sound, electricity or whatever—chosen to transmit the corresponding signals. Note that the Cartesian assumption of mind's independence of matter implied—in the human case at least—the existence of some kind of digital computer operating inside the human brain. 

{{quotation|'Information and computation reside in patterns of data and in relations of logic that are independent of the physical medium that carries them. When you telephone your mother in another city, the message stays the same as it goes from your lips to her ears even as it physically changes its form, from vibrating air, to electricity in a wire, to charges in silicon, to flickering light in a fibre optic cable, to electromagnetic waves, and then back again in reverse order. ... Likewise, a given programme can run on computers made of vacuum tubes, electromagnetic switches, transistors, integrated circuits, or well-trained pigeons, and it accomplishes the same things for the same reasons.

This insight, first expressed by the mathematician Alan Turing, the computer scientists Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, and Marvin Minsky, and the philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor, is now called the [[computational theory of mind]]. It is one of the great ideas in intellectual history, for it solves one of the puzzles that make up the 'mind-body problem', how to connect the ethereal world of meaning and intention, the stuff of our mental lives, with a physical hunk of matter like the brain. ... For millennia this has been a paradox. ... The computational theory of mind resolves the paradox.'|{{Citation|title=''Steven Pinker''}}&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, 1997. ''How the Mind Works.'' London: Allen Lane, Penguin, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==A digital apparatus==
Turing did not claim that the human mind really is a digital computer. More modestly, he proposed that digital computers might one day qualify in human eyes as machines endowed with "mind". However, it was not long before philosophers (most notably [[Hilary Putnam]]) took what seemed to be the next logical step—arguing that the human mind ''itself'' is a digital computer, or at least that certain mental "modules" are best understood that way.

[[Noam Chomsky]] rose to prominence as one of the most audacious champions of this 'cognitive revolution'. Language, he proposed, is a computational 'module' or 'device' unique to the human brain. Previously, linguists had thought of language as learned cultural behaviour: chaotically variable, inseparable from social life and therefore beyond the remit of natural science. The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], for example, had defined linguistics as a branch of 'semiotics', this in turn being inseparable from anthropology, sociology and the study of man-made conventions and institutions. By picturing language instead as the ''natural'' mechanism of 'digital infinity', Chomsky promised to bring scientific rigour to linguistics as a branch of strictly ''natural'' science.

[[Image:Sagittalmouth.png|thumb|300px|right|The human speech apparatus in sagittal section]]In the 1950s, phonology was generally considered the most rigorously scientific branch of linguistics. For phonologists, "digital infinity" was made possible by the human vocal apparatus conceptualised as a kind of machine consisting of a small number of binary switches. For example, "voicing" could be switched 'on' or 'off', as could palatisation, nasalisation and so forth. Take the consonant [b], for example, and switch voicing to the 'off' position—and you get [p]. Every possible phoneme in any of the world's languages might in this way be generated by specifying a particular on/off configuration of the switches ('articulators') constituting the human vocal apparatus. This approach became celebrated as '[[distinctive features]]' theory, in large part credited to the Russian linguist and polymath [[Roman Jakobson]]. The basic idea was that every phoneme in every natural language could in principle be reduced to its irreducible atomic components—a set of 'on' or 'off' choices ('distinctive features') allowed by the design of a digital apparatus consisting of the human tongue, soft palate, lips, larynx and so forth. 

Chomsky's original work was in [[Morphophonology|morphophonemics]]. During the 1950s, he became inspired by the prospect of extending Roman Jakobson's 'distinctive features' approach—now hugely successful—far beyond its original field of application. Jakobson had already persuaded a young social anthropologist—[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]—to apply distinctive features theory to the study of kinship systems, in this way inaugurating 'structural anthropology'. Chomsky—who got his job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology thanks to the intervention of Jakobson and his student, Morris Halle—hoped to explore the extent to which similar principles might be applied to the various sub-disciplines of linguistics, including syntax and semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1965. ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 64-127.&lt;/ref&gt; If the phonological component of language was demonstrably rooted in a digital biological 'organ' or 'device', why not the syntactic and semantic components as well? Might not language as a whole prove to be a digital organ or device?

This led some of Chomsky's early students to the idea of '[[generative semantics]]'—the proposal that the speaker generates word and sentence meanings by combining irreducible constituent elements of meaning, each of which can be switched 'on' or 'off'. To produce 'bachelor', using this logic, the relevant component of the brain must switch 'animate', 'human' and 'male' to the 'on' '''(+)''' position while keeping 'married' switched 'off' '''(-)'''. The underlying assumption here is that the requisite conceptual primitives—irreducible notions such as 'animate', 'male', 'human', 'married' and so forth—are genetically determined internal components of the human language organ. While this idea would rapidly encounter intellectual difficulties—sparking controversies culminating in the so-called '[[linguistics wars]]'&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. A. 1993. ''The Linguistics Wars.'' New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;—it attracted young and ambitious scholars impressed by the recent emergence of computer science and its promise of scientific parsimony and unification. If the theory worked, the simple principle of digital infinity would apply to language as a whole. Linguistics in its entirety might then lay claim to the coveted status of ''natural'' science. No part of the discipline—not even semantics—need be contaminated any longer by association with such 'un-scientific' disciplines as cultural anthropology or social science.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept used in [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]]. It refers to the two-level structure inherent to a [[sign system]], insofar as it is composed by two kinds of elements: 1) significant or meaningful, and 2) distinctive or meaningless.

==Theory==
''Double articulation''&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally also "double segmentation".&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the two fold structure of the stream of speech, which can be primarily divided into ''meaningful'' signs (like words or [[morphemes]]), and then secondarily into ''distinctive'' elements (like letters or [[phonemes]]). For example, the meaningful English word "cat" is composed of the sounds [k], [æ], and [t], which are meaningless as separate individual sounds (and which can also be combined to form the separate words "tack" and "act", with distinct meanings). These sounds, called [[phonemes]], represent the secondary and lowest level of articulation in the hierarchy of the organization of speech. Higher, primary, levels of organization (including [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and [[semantics]]) govern the combination of these individually meaningless phonemes into meaningful elements.

==History==
The French concept of ''double articulation'' was first introduced by the [[André Martinet]],&lt;ref&gt;André Martinet, ''Éléments de linguistique générale'', Colin, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1949. The English calque ''double articulation'' has been criticised as inaccurate and is often replaced by ''duality of patterning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3935606 | pmid=24587833 | doi=10.1515/langcog-2012-0014 | volume=4 | title=New perspectives on duality of patterning: Introduction to the special issue | year=2012 | journal=Lang Cogn | pages=251–259 | last1 = de Boer | first1 = B | last2 = Sandler | first2 = W | last3 = Kirby | first3 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charles F. Hockett]] and other linguists, this duality is an important property of human languages, since it allows for the expression of a potentially infinite number of meaningful language sequences. Strictly speaking, however, such expressiveness follows from [[generativity]] or [[Productivity_(linguistics)|productivity]] (a finite number of components combining via rules to produce a potentially infinite arrangement of novel utterances), not of duality per se (one could have a system with 2 levels of the kind referred to as duality, and yet have only finite productivity. For further discussion, see [[figurae]], as well as [[Hockett's_design_features]], which treats productivity and duality as distinct essential properties of language.

[[Sign language]]s may have less double articulation because more gestures are possible than sound and able to convey more meaning without double articulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedivy|first1=Julie|title=The Unusual Language That Linguists Thought Couldn’t Exist|url=http://nautil.us/blog/the-unusual-language-that-linguists-thought-couldnt-exist|website=Nautilus|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book 'Language and economy',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the German sociolinguist [[Florian Coulmas]] discusses "the many ways in which language and economy interact, how economic developments influence the emergence, expansion, or decline of languages; how linguistic conditions facilitate or obstruct the economic process; how multilingualism and social affluence are interrelated; how and why language and money fulfill similar functions in modern societies; why the availability of a [[standard language]] is an [[Comparative advantage|economic advantage]]; how the unequal distribution of languages in [[Multilingual society|multilingual societies]] makes for [[economic inequality]]; how the [[economic value]] of languages can be assessed; why languages have an [[Internal economies of scale|internal economy]] and how they adapt to the demands of the [[external economy]].

States shoulder language costs, because it maintains themselves by means of it, as does business which needs communication competence. Florian Coulmas discusses the language-related expenditures of government and business in Language and economy.&lt;ref&gt;'The constliness of the polyglot world' in : Coulmas, Florian, Language and economy, 1992, p. 55, Oxford, Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book he also discusses the role of language as a commodity, because languages can behave like economic systems.

==Global language and global economy==
Languages are capital investments in a literal sense : language technology is the most important one. It requires substantial investments which, in the absence of profitability, only affluent countries and businesses can afford. In this respect, today ''English is seen as a consequence and an instrument of American imperial power, an appreciable asset for American anglophones in the twenty-first-century global contest for competitive advantage, prosperity, and power''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cohen, [https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-american-linguistic-empire The Rise and Fall of American Linguistic Empire, I want you to speak English], [https://www.dissentmagazine.org/about-dissent-magazine Dissent Magazine], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Though the best business language remains the language of the customers, meaning multilingual business practices, an "ideal' global economy presupposes a single language for the whole world. But an "ideal" global language presupposes a common acceptable and fair language burden for all business partners. See in this respect [[language tax]] to counteract linguistic inequality, as also language for purposes of trade incurs costs to most countries and private entreprises, whereas governments of countries whose language occupies a leading position on the international language market refuse to subsidize the spread of other languages for which they believe they have no need. In his report ''L'enseignement des langues étrangères comme politique publique'', [[François Grin]] argues that 'though some languages would be more beneficial in terms of cost-benefit analysis' such as e.g. Esperanto  (Esperanto business groups such as IKEF have been active for many years), the problem is that a shifting pattern in the valuation of languages is not always brought about by rationally culculable factors only. In addition to its economic potential, language is also a carrier of political, cultural and sociopsychological properties. In spite of the non-economic values attached to language, what prevails in matters of language is often that which is profitable &lt;ref&gt;'The costliness of the polyglot world : language-related expenditures of government and busininess' in : in : Coulmas, Florian, Language and economy, 1992, p. 152, Oxford, Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; and this can lead to the superiority of a dominant language as a means of production, with a high linguistic capital value. In this respect it is evident to see that the will (or necessity) to learn English in the last decades has grown so much and its range of action has been so wide that the economic necessity and other incentives of foreign-language study are generally perceived as unimportant. For similar reasons, former British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] tried to torpedo the LINGUA program of the European Community, as from her point of view, Britain was asked to pay for a program which benefited her country least. Because of the enormous imbalance on current accounts of the major European languages in favour of English, the [[LINGUA programme]] called for an expansion and diversification of foreign-language education in the Member States. For the individual speaker the unequal linguistic balances imply that the first language is an economically exploitable qualification for some who can simply marketing their mother tongue skills, whereas others can not.&lt;ref&gt;Value for Whom ? in : Coulmas, Florian, Language and economy, 1992, p.86, Oxford, Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It is in the general interest of the United States to encourage the development of a world in which the fault lines separating nations are bridged by shared interests. And it is in the economic and political interests of the United States to ensure that if the world is moving toward a common language, it be English; that if the world is moving toward common telecommunications, safety, and quality standards, they be American; that if the world is becoming linked by television, radio, and music, the programming be American; and that if common values are being developed, they be values with which Americans are comfortable."

{{Expand German|Extensionalismus|date=November 2014}}
'''Extensionalism''', in the [[philosophy of language]], in [[logic]] and [[semantics]], is the view that all languages or at least all scientific languages should be [[extensional]]. [[Rudolf Carnap]] (in his earlier work) and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] were prominent proponents of this view.

In [[linguistics]], a '''feature'''  is the assignment of [[wiktionary:binary|binary]] or [[unary operation|unary]] conditions which act as constraints.{{what|date=January 2015}}

==In phonology==
{{main|distinctive feature}}
In [[phonology]], [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s are categorized into [[natural class]]es on the basis of their [[distinctive feature]]s. Each feature is a quality or characteristic of the natural class, such as [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] or [[manner of articulation|manner]]. A unique combination of features defines a [[phoneme]].

Examples of [[phonemic]] or distinctive features are: [+/- [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] ], [+/- [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]] ] (binary features) and [ [[coronal consonant|CORONAL]] ] (a unary feature; also a [[place of articulation|place]] feature).

Surface representations can be expressed as the result of rules acting on the features of the [[underlying representation]]. These rules are formulated in terms of transformations on features.

==In morphology==
In [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], words are often organized into '''[[lexical category|lexical categories]]''' or '''word classes''', such as "noun", "verb", "adjective", and so on. These word classes have '''[[grammatical category|grammatical feature]]s''' (also called ''categories'' or ''inflectional categories''), which can have one of a set of potential '''values''' (also called the ''property'', ''meaning'', or ''feature'' of the category).&lt;ref&gt;Kibort, Anna &amp; Corbett, Greville G. [http://www.grammaticalfeatures.net/inventory.html Grammatical Features - Feature Inventory]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider the [[pronoun]] in English. Pronouns are a ''lexical category''. Pronouns have the [[grammatical person|person]] ''feature'', which can have a ''value'' of "first", "second", or "third". English pronouns also have the [[grammatical number|number]] ''feature'', which can have a value of either "singular" or "plural". As a result, we can describe the English pronoun "they" as a pronoun with [person:3] and [number:plural].

==In semantics==
{{main|semantic feature}}
In [[semantics]], words are categorized into [[semantic class]]es. Intersecting semantic classes share the same [[semantic feature]]s.

'''Frame-based terminology''' is a [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]] approach to [[terminology]] developed by [[Pamela Faber]] and colleagues at the [[University of Granada]]. One of its basic premises is that the [[conceptualization]] of any specialized domain is goal-oriented, and depends to a certain degree on the task to be accomplished. Since a major problem in modeling any domain is the fact that languages can reflect different conceptualizations and construals, texts as well as specialized knowledge resources are used to extract a set of domain concepts. Language structure is also analyzed to obtain an inventory of conceptual relations to structure these concepts.

As its name implies, frame-based terminology uses certain aspects of [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]] to structure specialized domains and create non-language-specific representations. Such configurations are the conceptual meaning underlying specialized texts in different languages, and thus facilitate specialized knowledge acquisition.

Frame-based terminology focuses on:
# conceptual organization;
# the multidimensional nature of terminological units; and
# the extraction of semantic and syntactic information through the use of multilingual corpora.

In frame-based terminology, conceptual networks are based on an underlying domain event, which generates templates for the actions and processes that take place in the specialized field as well as the entities that participate in them.

As a result, knowledge extraction is largely text-based. The terminological entries are composed of information from specialized texts as well as specialized language resources. Knowledge is configured and represented in a dynamic conceptual network that is capable of adapting to new contexts. At the most general level, generic roles of agent, patient, result, and instrument are activated by basic predicate meanings such as make, do, affect, use, become, etc. which structure the basic meanings in specialized texts. From a linguistic perspective, [[Lexical aspect|Aktionsart]] distinctions in texts are based on [[Robert Van Valin, Jr.|Van Valin]]'s classification of predicate types. At the more specific levels of the network, the qualia structure of the [[generative lexicon]] is used as a basis for the systematic classification and relation of nominal entities.

The methodology of frame-based terminology derives the conceptual system of the domain by means of an integrated top-down and bottom-up approach. The bottom-up approach consists of extracting information from a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of texts in various languages, specifically related to the domain. The top-down approach includes the information provided by specialized dictionaries and other reference material, complemented by the help of experts in the field. 

In a parallel way, the underlying conceptual framework of a knowledge-domain event is specified. The most generic or base-level categories of a domain are configured in a prototypical domain event or action-environment interface. This provides a template applicable to all levels of information structuring. In this way a structure is obtained which facilitates and enhances knowledge acquisition since the information in term entries is internally as well as externally coherent.

'''Gibberish''' (sometimes '''Jibberish''') is a [[language game]] that is played in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Ireland]]. Similar games are played in many other countries. The name [[Gibberish]] refers to the nonsensical sound of words spoken according to the rules of this game.&lt;ref name="wikiHow"&gt;[http://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Gibberish How to Speak Gibberish - wikiHow], Oct. 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== In English ==
There are several variations of Gibberish in the English-speaking world. They use ''-itherg-'', ''-uthug-'', ''-elag-'', ''-itug-'', ''-uthaga-'', ''-uvug-'', ''-idig-'', ''-atheg-'' (''th'' in ''then'' and the two vowels are pronounced with a [[schwa]]), and ''-adeg-''. The dialects are given different names. Another form of gibberish known as allibi is spoken using the insertion ''-allib-''.

==="-idig- "''-uddag-''", "''-uvug-''", "''-uthug-''"===
These four dialects of Gibberish are spoken by adding the [[infix]] to each syllable after the [[syllable onset|onset]]. Example:
*dog → {{not a typo|''didigog'', ''duddagog'', ''duvugog'', ''duthugog''}} 
*cat → {{not a typo|''cidigat'' or ''kidigat'', ''cuddagat'', ''cuvugat'', ''cuthugat''}}
When a syllable starts with more than one consonant, the infix is added after the onset consonants. Example:
*creek → {{not a typo|''cridigeek'', ''cruddageek'', ''cruvugeek'', ''cruthugeek''}}
*strong → {{not a typo|''stridigong'', ''struddagong'', ''struvugong'', ''struthugong''}} 
When the syllable begins with a vowel, that vowel is used in place of the first ''i'' in the ''-ithieg-'' infix. Example:
*all → {{not a typo|''idigall'', ''uddagall'', ''uvugall'', ''uthugall''}}
*eat → {{not a typo|''idigeat'', uddageat, ''uvugeat'', ''uthugeat''}}
Words of more than one syllable repeat the rules for each syllable.
*example → {{not a typo|''idigexidigampidigle'', ''uddagex-uddagam-puddagle'', ''uvugex-uvugam-puvugle'', ''uthugex-uthugam-puthugle''}}
*flower → {{not a typo|''flidigow-idiger'', ''fluddagow-uddager'', ''fluvugow-uvuger'', ''fluthugow-uthuger''}} &lt;ref name="Youtube"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3UL_Qtd-fM How to Speak Gibberish in Five Easy Steps], Oct. 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==="''-atheb-''", "''-adag-''"===
This dialect works in much the same way as the previous dialects, with an additional rule. When a single syllable word begins with a vowel, the infix acts as a prefix, with the initial "a" becoming like that vowel.
*all → ''{{not a typo|adagall}}''   
*eat → ''{{not a typo|eadageet}}''
*if → ''{{not a typo|idagif}}''
*it → ''{{not a typo|idagit}}''
*up → ''{{not a typo|udagup}}''
*at → ''{{not a typo|adagat}}''
*is → ''{{not a typo|idagis}}''
*I → ''{{not a typo|idaguy}}''
*hi → ''{{not a typo|hidaguy}}''
*down → ''{{not a typo|dadagown}}''
The sentence "I hit the alarm clock when I woke up" could be "Ittiguy Hittigit thittagee addagalitigarm clidigock wittigen Ittiguy wittigoke uttigup".&lt;ref name="Buzzle"&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/how-to-speak-gibberish.html How to Speak Gibberish], Oct. 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="''-(V)rV+g-''"===
Another paradigm involves infixing ''(V)rV+g'' following the onset of a monosyllabic word, or less usually after each onset or [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] of polysyllabic words. In words consisting of a single [[diphthong]], the Gibberish morpheme breaks up the syllable into a sequence of vowels plus a glide. The vowels of the Gibberish morpheme typically [[vowel harmony|harmonize]] for [[vowel quality|quality]] with the vowel of the syllable nucleus, but can be [[vowel reduction|reduced]] if unstressed according to English stress rules. The {{IPA|[ɡ]}} [[syllabification|syllabifies]] into a new onset. Examples:

*Eye {{IPA|[aɪ]}} → Eregye {{IPA|[ˈærəɡaɪ]}}
*Float {{IPA|[floʊt]}} → {{not a typo|Floragoat}} {{IPA|[ˈflɔrəɡoʊt]}}
*Street {{IPA|[striːt]}} → {{not a typo|Strerageet}} {{IPA|[ˈstɪərɨɡiːt]}}

==="''-(V)lV+g-''"===
L can also be commonly used instead of r. Examples:

*Eye → Elegye {{IPA|[ˈæləɡaɪ]}}
*Float → Flolagoat {{IPA|[ˈflɔləɡoʊt]}}
*Street → Strelegeet {{IPA|[ˈstrɪəlɨɡiːt]}}

===Gibberish family===
The term "gibberish" is used more generally to refer to all [[language game]]s created by inserting a certain infix before the vowel in each syllable. For example, if the code infix were "ob", then "Hello, Thomas" would be translated as "Hobellobo, Thobomobas". While a relatively simple code, this can be difficult to understand when spoken swiftly and sounds merely like meaningless babble, which is how it received its name.  The terms "Double Talk" and "Double Dutch" are alternate names for such codes.  While any syllables could be used as code syllables, some syllables are more commonly used. These include:

* [[Ubbi dubbi]] &amp;ndash; "ub" or "ib"
* Oppish &amp;ndash; "op" or "ob",
* Egglish &amp;ndash; "eg" or "ineg", 
* Izzle  &amp;ndash; "iz" or "izl",
* Carny &amp;ndash; "earz" or "eez" or "iz"
* Fuzzy Wuzzy &amp;ndash; "ez" or "uz"

Another variation consists in the code syllables not having a specific vowel, but repeating the vowel of the syllable in which it is being inserted. This variation is common in Switzerland, where the inserted syllable thus could be "@n@f", where ''@'' denotes the original vowel; e.g. "Hallo, Chrige" would be translated into ''Hanafallonofo, Chrinifigenefe''. Similarly, "Lalafa" replaces each occurrence of a vowel with "@l[[schwa|əf]]@." In Gibberish as spoken in the [[United Kingdom]], the infix code syllable is often "@rag".

In some variants only the first syllable of each word is modified. On the other hand, combining (or double-encoding) forms of Gibberish, or by further encoding with other languages games such as [[Pig Latin]] and [[Tutnese]] can result in increasingly hard to decipher (and pronounce) words. For instance, combining Pig Latin, Hard Gibberish and Openglopish might result in a phrase {{not a typo|''idigopidigatthidigopidigay idigopidigoundsidigopidigay idigopidigikelidigopidigay idigopidigisthidigopidigay''}} ('that sounds like this').

==In other languages==
Language games in the Gibberish family are not unique to English-speaking countries. Gibberish games in other languages include:
*[[Swedish language|Swedish]]: Allspråket (Identical to Pig Latin, but with the suffix "-all" rather than "-ay".)
*[[Finnish language|Finnish]]: Konttikieli, Vedkieli
*[[French language|French]]: [[Javanais]] (consonant + vowel ---&gt; consonant + “av” + vowel), [[Louchébem]] (moving the first consonant to the end; add "-ème" at the end and then "L" at the beginning of the new word), [[Verlan]] (reverse the syllables)
*[[German language|German]]: Löffelsprache &amp;ndash; infix "@ləf"
*[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: "bet" language, "gimel" language (consonant is added after every vowel)
*[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: "babibo" (バビボ）and papipo （パピポ）(after each syllable, add b or p + the preceding vowel. i.e. ichigo would become {{not a typo|ibichibigobi}} or {{not a typo|ipichipigopi}})
*[[Persian language|Persian]]: "Zargari" language ("Z" sound consonantly added after every vowel (e.g Salam =&gt; Sa[Za]la[Za]m))
*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: Madárnyelv ("bird's-language") &amp;ndash; infix "@v" or "@rg" (''Tudsz így beszélni? → {{not a typo|Tuvudsz ívígy beveszévélnivi}}?'')
*[[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Latin America]]): [[Jerigonza]] &amp;ndash; "@p*" (''Hola mundo → Hopolapa mupundopo'') [[efe language]] &amp;ndash; "@f" (''{{lang|es|Hola mundo}} → {{not a typo|Hofolafa mufundofo}}'') or some variations like "@g@d": (''Hola mundo → Hogodolagada mugudundogodo'')
*[[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Venezuela]]): Cuti Talk - Using the prefix "cuti" before every syllable in the word. For instance: "{{lang|es|Buenos Dias}}" would be: ''{{not a typo|cutibué-cutinós cutidí-cutiás}}''.
*[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Língua do P/Língua dos PP/Língua dos Pês ("language of the Ps") &amp;ndash; "p@" (''{{not a typo|Epeupu Apamupu-tepe}}'')
*[[Romanian language|Romanian]]: Păsărească ("bird talk") &amp;ndash; "@p*" (''Bună ziua! → {{not a typo|Bupunăpă zipiuapa}}!'')
*[[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Kuş dili (literally "bird language", adding a new syllable made of g or c sound + original vowel (e.g. ''Seni seviyorum --&gt; {{not a typo|Segenigi segevigiyogorugum}}'', or alternatively ''{{not a typo|Secenici seceviciyocorucum}}'')

'''Glossophilia''' is a love of [[language]], be it [[Foreign language|foreign]] or [[Native language|native]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allwords.com/word-glossophilia.html&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to people with a love for language and the [[Language structure|structure of language]]. Glossophiles also dedicate themselves to the learning of foreign languages and intensely study as many languages as possible. It is not uncommon for glossophiles to be [[Multilingualism|proficient in many languages]].

The '''inscrutability or indeterminacy of reference''' (also '''referential inscrutability''') is a thesis propounded by 20th century [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] in his book ''[[Word and Object]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman (1960): ''Word and Object''. MIT Press; {{ISBN|0-262-67001-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main claim of this theory is that any given sentence can be changed into a variety of other sentences where the parts of the sentence will change in what they reference{{how?|date=March 2016}}, but they will nonetheless maintain the meaning of the sentence as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine/&lt;/ref&gt; The {{cfy|text=referential relation is inscrutable|date=March 2016}}, because it is subject to the {{cfy|text=background language|date=March 2016}} and {{cfy|text=ontological commitments|date=March 2016}} of the speaker.

== Status among Quine's other theories ==
Along with the [[holophrastic indeterminacy]], the inscrutability of reference is the second kind of indeterminacy that makes up Quine's thesis about the [[indeterminacy of translation|indeterminacy of (radical) translation]]. While the inscrutability of reference concerns itself with single words, Quine does not want it to be used for propositions, as he attacks those in another way.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Benjamin Bayer|Bayer, Benjamin]]: [http://www.benbayer.com/quine-skepticism.pdf Quine's Pragmatic Solution to Skeptical Doubts]. July 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He challenges the translation or referential scrutability of whole sentences, proposing his idea of the indeterminacy of translation. In order to accomplish this, Quine makes the statement that there is a so-called holophrastic indeterminacy, which tells that there are always multiple translations of one sentence, {{cfy|text=which are not only different in the meaning of the single parts of them, but moreover is the whole meaning of both translations dissimilar.|date=March 2016}} {{cfy|text=According to Quine, there is no way to give an example for holophrastic indeterminacy, because it affects the whole, and every language. Therefore, one has to blindly accept the validity of this hypothesis, or try to make sense of it via reflecting upon the idea|date=March 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Peter Hylton|Hylton, Peter]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine/#IndTra Willard van Orman Quine]. In: [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], April 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, linked with the inscrutability of reference make up the main characteristics of the indeterminacy of translation.
The inscrutability of reference can also be used in a more extended way, in order to explain Quine's theory of [[ontological relativity]]. We are told that, if we try to determine what the referential object of a certain word is, our answer will always be relative to our own ''{{cfy|text=background language|date=March 2016}}''. Now, as Quine sees it, this idea is not only limited to language, but applies also for scientific questions and philosophical ones. For example, if we are proposed a philosophical theory, we can never definitely {{cfy|text=characterize the [[ontological commitment]]s of it|date=March 2016}}. The most we can do, is to adapt this theory to our current ''background philosophy'', that is {{cfy|text=the theory of which we have already accepted the ontological commitments|date=March 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Michael J. Loux|Loux, Michael J.]]: ''Metaphysics – A Contemporary Introduction''. London: Routledge, 3rd edition, 2006, p. 278f.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this theory, Quine was often regarded as a [[relativism|relativist]], or even a [[scientific skepticism|scientific skepticist]]. He, however, insisted that he belongs in neither of these categories,&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Geert Keil|Keil, Geert]]: ''Quine zur Einführung''. Hamburg: Junius, 1st edition, 2002, 75ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and some authors see in the inscrutability of reference an underdetermination of relativism.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Chris Swoyer|Swoyer, Chris]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#2.6 ''Relativism'']. In: [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], February 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Gavagai}}Illustration by the use of ''gavagai'' ==
In his indeterminacy of translation theory Quine claims that, if one is to translate a language, there are always several alternative translations, of which none is more correct than the other.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Keil (2002), 75ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[radical translation]] is therefore impossible. As a special part of this theory the inscrutability of reference indicates that, in trying to find out to which object a certain word (also sentence, sign etc.) of a language refers, there is never only one single possibility. That is even the case, if the possibilities that come into consideration lie very close together. Quine's example of the word "gavagai" is used to illustrate this. Note that it is also applied at the indeterminacy of translation, but has traditionally been introduced to point up referential inscrutability. The ''gavagai'' [[thought experiment]] tells about a linguist, who tries to find out, what the expression ''gavagai'' means, when uttered by a speaker of a yet unknown, native language upon seeing a rabbit. At first glance, it seems that ''gavagai'' simply translates with ''rabbit''. Now, Quine points out that the background language and its referring devices might fool the linguist here, because he is misled in a sense that he always makes direct comparisons between the foreign language and his own. However, when shouting ''gavagai'', and pointing at a rabbit, the natives could as well refer to something like ''undetached rabbit-parts'', or ''rabbit-[[Trope (philosophy)|tropes]]'' and it would not make any observable difference. The behavioural data the linguist could collect from the native speaker would be the same in every case, or to reword it, several translation hypotheses could be built on the same sensoric stimuli. Hence, the reference between the term ''gavagai'' and its referring object is language- or framework-dependent, and therefore inscrutable. Quine regards this discovery as trivial, because it is already a widely accepted fact that all the different things one word might refer to can be switched out, because of their [[proxy function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
Quine does not want to show that those native speakers might speak in interestingly different ways and we cannot know about it, but rather that there is nothing to be known. Not only is it impossible to discern, by any method, the correct translation and referential relation of ''gavagai'', but, in fact, there is not even a correct answer to this question.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Loux (2006), p. 274ff.&lt;/ref&gt; To make sense of the word ''gavagai'' either way, the linguist simply has to assume that the native speaker does not refer to complicated terms like ''rabbits-tropes''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Reed Loar|Loar, Reed]]: [http://www.rit.edu/cla/philosophy/quine/inscrutability_reference.html ''inscrutability of reference''].&lt;/ref&gt; The finding, then, that ''gavagai'' means ''rabbit'' is not really a translation, but merely a common sense interpretation.
It is important to note that indeterminacy and inscrutability not only occur in the course of translating something from a native, unknown language into a familiar one, but among every language. This holds also for languages which are quite similar, like [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and even for speakers of the same language. One cannot with certainty say, what exactly his/her conversational partner refers to, when that person is talking about a rabbit. We commonly use the [[homophonic rule]] in those cases, i.e., if one utters ''rabbit'', we assume s/he uses it in the same way we do. But, as has been shown, there are multiple possibilities which can be indistinguishable from one another.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Swoyer (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies in our own case. We ourselves do not know what it is we are referring to in using the word ''rabbit'', that is because there is, in Quine's word, ''no fact of the matter'' at all. One must not, however, use different possible referential objects in the same translation, because they are incommensurable and the resulting translation hypothesis would contain logical fallacies.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Keil (2002), 75ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-realist interpretation ==
[[Hilary Putnam]] uses Quine's thesis about the inscrutability of reference to challenge the traditional Realist's view that there is a mind-independent world to which our propositional attitudes refer (e.g. when we talk about or think of something, these things exist not in our minds, but in said mind-independent world). This traditional view implies a [[correspondence theory of truth]] and might simply be called [[Realism in international relations theory|Realism]] about [[Being]]. While [[Michael Dummett]] already tried to show that the correspondence theory fails to obtain in some particular cases, Hilary Putnam is far more radical, for he claims that this theory fails in every case it is tried to be applied. On Putnam's account, the idea that we refer with our sentences and statements to a mind-independent, nonlinguistic world is an illusion. Further he claims that the problem to deal with is a language philosophical one and uses Quine's inscrutability of reference theory to clarify his point of view. He suggests, that, because the referential objects of a language are always inscrutable, the Realist's idea of a mind-independent world is fallacious, because it presupposes distinct referential relations from language to objects in the mind-independent world.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Loux (2006), p. 272ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application in the sorites paradox ==
The inscrutability of reference is also used in the [[sorites paradox]]. The classic example for the sorites paradox mentions a heap of wheat grains of which grains are taken away one by one, until at one time there's only a single grain left. This raises the question of where the line is to be drawn. How long does the heap remain a heap, are two grains still a heap? When one is talking about a heap s/he obviously no proper definition of it ready to hand{{clarify|date=August 2013}}. The referential object of ''heap'' is inscrutable, in the sense that there is no such thing and it is not even necessary for the use of the term ''heap''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Dominic Hyde|Hyde, Dominic]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sorites-paradox/#4.3 ''Sorites Paradox'']. In: [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], January 17, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KB_Japanese.svg|thumb|A Japanese kana keyboard]]
In relation to the '''Japanese language and computers''' many adaptation issues arise, some unique to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and others common to [[language]]s which have a very large number of characters. The number of characters needed in order to write English is very small, and thus it is possible to use only one [[byte]] to encode one English character. However, the number of characters in Japanese is much more than 256, and hence Japanese cannot be encoded using only one byte, and Japanese is thus encoded using two or more bytes, in a so-called "double byte" or "multi-byte" encoding. Some problems relate to [[transliteration]] and  [[romanization]], some to character encoding, and some to the input of Japanese text.

==Character encodings==
{{Update|section|reason=The info about Unicode adoption is sorely out of date|date=January 2018}}
There are several standard methods to [[character encoding|encode]] Japanese characters for use on a computer, including [[JIS encoding|JIS]], [[Shift-JIS]], [[Extended Unix Code|EUC]], and [[Unicode]].  While mapping the set of [[kana]] is a simple matter, [[kanji]] has proven more difficult. Despite efforts, none of the encoding schemes have become the de facto standard, and multiple encoding standards are still in use today.

For example, most Japanese [[email]]s are in [[ISO-2022-JP]] ("JIS encoding") and [[web page]]s in [[Shift-JIS]] and yet mobile phones in Japan usually use some form of [[Extended Unix Code]]. If a program fails to determine the encoding scheme employed,  it can cause {{Nihongo3|"misconverted garbled/garbage characters"|文字化け|''[[mojibake]]''|literally "transformed characters"}} and thus unreadable text on computers.

The first encoding to become widely used was [[JIS X 0201]], which is a [[ISO 646|single-byte encoding]] that only covers standard 7-bit ASCII characters with half-width katakana extensions. This was widely used in systems that were neither powerful enough nor had the storage to handle kanji (including old embedded equipment such as cash registers). This means that only [[katakana]], not kanji, was supported using this technique. Some embedded displays still have this limitation.

The development of kanji encodings was the beginning of the split. [[Shift JIS]] supports kanji and was developed to be completely backward compatible with [[JIS X 0201]], and thus is in much embedded electronic equipment. 

However, [[Shift JIS]] has the unfortunate property that it often breaks any parser (software that reads the coded text) that is not specifically designed to handle it. For example, a text search method can get false hits if it is not designed for Shift JIS. [[Extended Unix Code|EUC]], on the other hand, is handled much better by parsers that have been written for 7-bit ASCII (and thus [[Extended Unix Code|EUC]] encodings are used on UNIX, where much of the file-handling code was historically only written for English encodings). But EUC is not backwards compatible with JIS X 0201, the first main Japanese encoding. Further complications arise because the original Internet e-mail standards only support 7-bit transfer protocols. Thus {{IETF RFC|1468}} ("[[ISO-2022-JP]]", often simply called [[JIS encoding]]) was developed for sending and receiving e-mails.

In [[character set]] standards such as [[JIS X 0208|JIS]], not all required characters are included, so [[gaiji]] ({{lang|ja|外字}} "external characters") are sometimes used to supplement the character set. Gaiji may come in the form of external font packs, where normal characters have been replaced with new characters, or the new characters have been added to unused character positions. However, gaiji are not practical in [[Internet]] environments since the font set must be transferred with text to use the gaiji.  As a result, such characters are written with similar or simpler characters in place, or the text may need to be encoded using a larger character set (such as Unicode) that supports the required character.

[[Unicode]] was intended to solve all encoding problems over all languages. The [[UTF-8]] encoding used to encode Unicode in web pages does not have the disadvantages that Shift-JIS has. Unicode is supported by international software, and it eliminates the need for gaiji. There are still controversies, however. For Japanese, the kanji characters have been [[Han unification|unified]] with Chinese; that is, a character considered to be the same in both Japanese and Chinese is given a single number, even if the appearance is actually somewhat different, with the precise appearance left to the use of a locale-appropriate font. This process, called [[Han unification]], has caused controversy. The previous encodings in Japan, [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]], [[Mainland China]] and [[Korea]] have only handled one language and Unicode should handle all. The handling of Kanji/Chinese have however been designed by a committee composed of representatives from all four countries/areas.  Unicode is slowly growing because it is better supported by software from outside Japan, but still (as of 2011) most web pages in Japanese use Shift-JIS. The [[Japanese Wikipedia]] uses Unicode.

== Text input ==
{{main|Japanese input methods}}
Written Japanese uses several different scripts: [[kanji]] (Chinese characters), 2 sets of ''kana'' (phonetic syllabaries) and roman letters. While kana and roman letters can be typed directly into a computer, entering kanji is a more complicated process as there are far more kanji than there are keys on most keyboards. To input kanji on modern computers, the reading of kanji is usually entered first, then an [[input method editor]] (IME), also sometimes known as a front-end processor, shows a list of candidate kanji that are a phonetic match, and allows the user to choose the correct kanji. More-advanced IMEs work not by word but by phrase, thus increasing the likelihood of getting the desired characters as the first option presented. Kanji readings inputs can be either via [[romanization]] (''[[rōmaji]] nyūryoku,'' {{Nihongo2|[[:ja:ローマ字入力|ローマ字入力]]}}) or direct kana input (''kana nyūryoku,'' {{Nihongo2|[[:ja:かな入力|かな入力]]}}). Romaji input is more common on PCs and other full-size keyboards (although direct input is also widely supported), whereas direct kana input is typically used on mobile phones and similar devices – each of the 10 digits (1–9,0) corresponds to one of the 10 columns in the [[gojūon]] table of kana, and multiple presses select the row.

There are two main systems for the [[romanization]] of Japanese, known as ''[[Kunrei-shiki]]'' and ''[[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]]''; in practice, "keyboard romaji" (also known as ''[[wapuro romaji|wāpuro rōmaji]]'' or "word processor romaji") generally allows a loose combination of both. IME implementations may even handle keys for letters unused in any romanization scheme, such as ''L'', converting them to the most appropriate equivalent. With kana input, each key on the keyboard directly corresponds to one kana. The [[JIS X 6002|JIS keyboard]] system is the national standard, but there are alternatives, like the [[thumb-shift keyboard]], commonly used among professional typists.

== Direction of text ==

Japanese can be written in [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|two directions]]. ''Yokogaki'' style writes left-to-right, top-to-bottom, as with English. ''Tategaki'' style writes first top-to-bottom, and then moves right-to-left.

At present, handling of downward text is incomplete. For example, [[HTML]] has no support for ''tategaki'' and Japanese users must use HTML tables to simulate it. However, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] level 3 includes a property "&lt;tt&gt;writing-mode&lt;/tt&gt;" which can render ''tategaki'' when given the value "&lt;tt&gt;vertical-rl&lt;/tt&gt;" (i.e. top to bottom, right to left). Word processors and [[Desktop publishing|DTP]] software have more complete support for it.

{{expand French|date=January 2016}}
'''Javanais''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒavanɛ}}) is a type of [[French language|French]] [[slang]] where the extra [[syllable]] {{angle bracket|av}} is [[infix]]ed inside a word after every consonant that is followed by a vowel, in order to render it incomprehensible. Some common examples are ''gros'' ({{IPA-fr|ɡʁo|}}, "fat") which becomes ''gravos'' ({{IPA-fr|ɡʁavo|}}); ''bonjour'' ({{IPA-fr|bɔ̃ʒuʁ|}}, "hello"'), which becomes ''bavonjavour'' ({{IPA-fr|bavɔ̃ʒavuʁ|}}); and ''pénible'' ({{IPA-fr|peniblə|}}, "annoying"), becomes ''pavénaviblave'' ({{IPA-fr|pavenaviblavə|}}). ''Paris'' ({{IPA-fr|paʁi|}}) becomes ''Pavaravis'' ({{IPA-fr|pavaʁavi|}}).

Javanais is determined by the production rule:  ''CV → CavV''.  There are also many variations that can be made upon the same pattern such as: ''CabV, CalV, CanV'', etc.

In French the word ''Javanais'' is also used to refer to the [[Javanese language]].

Around 1957, [[Boris Vian]] wrote a song ''La Java Javanaise''. The lyrics are a didactical method to learn the javanais. Each verse is firstly articulated in regular French, then translated in slang. As the title suggests, the song is a [[Java (dance)|Java]], a Parisian [[dance craze]]. In 1962, [[Serge Gainsbourg]] wrote and sang a song called ''[[La Javanaise]]'', a pun playing on Javanese dancing and the javanais style of speaking. The song heavily employs unaltered French words that naturally have an {{angle bracket|av}} sequence; thus the lyrics resemble the word game of javanais.

The '''Jeolla dialect''' of Korean (also known as '''Cholla'''; {{Hangul|전라도 방언/사투리}}, {{Hanja|全羅道方言}}), or '''Southwestern Korean''', are spoken in the [[Honam]] region of South Korea, including the city of [[Gwangju]]. This area was known as [[Jeolla Province]] during the [[Joseon]] era.

Like the [[Chungcheong dialect]], the Jeolla dialect is considered non-standard. Perhaps the most obvious difference comes from common verb endings. In place of the usual ''-seumnida'' (습니다 {{IPA|[sɯmnida]}}) or ''-seyo'' (세요 {{IPA|[sɛjo]}}) endings, a southern Jeolla person will use ''-rau'' (라우 {{IPA|[ɾau]}}) or ''-jirau'' (지라우 {{IPA|[tɕiɾau]}}) appended to the verb. For a causative verb ending, expressed in standard language with a ''-nikka'' (니까 {{IPA|[nik͈a]}}) ending, Jeolla people use ''-ngkkei'' (응게 {{IPA|[ŋk͈ei]}}), so the past tense of the verb "did" ("because someone did it"), ''haesseunikka'' (했으니까 {{IPA|[hɛs͈ɯnik͈a]}}), becomes ''haesseungkke'' (했승게 {{IPA|[hɛs͈ɯŋk͈e]}}). A similar sound is used for the quotative ending, "somebody said...". The usual verb endings are ''-dago'' (다고 {{IPA|[tako]}}) and ''-rago'' (라고 {{IPA|[ɾako]}}). Jeolla dialect prefers ''-dangkke'' (당게 {{IPA|[taŋk͈e]}}).

Regarding pronunciation differences, there is often a tendency to pronounce only the second vowel in a diphthong. For example, the verb ending that indicates "since", ''-neundae'', becomes ''-neundi'' (는디). The name of the large city of [[Gwangju]] (광주) becomes ''Gangju'' (강주), and the verb 'to not have, to be absent', ''eopda'' 없다, becomes very close to ''upda'' (웂다). There are some words that are unique to the dialect as well: ''utjeseo'' (웆제서) for "why", ''sibang'' (시방) for "now", and ''dwitgan'' (뒷간) for "outhouse". Jeolla dialect speakers have a tendency to end their sentences with ''-ing'', (잉) especially when asking a favor. This can be compared to the word "eh," as used by some Canadians.

[[Pansori]] texts are written in the Jeolla dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, vol. 7, p. 935&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalagnanam''' is a Sanskrit language word, which means "Knowledge of Times". '[[Prophecy]]' is the exact the meaning of the word .

The Kalagnanam has many authors, who prophesied the future of their times. Most famous among them are Sri Madvirat Pothuluri Veera Brahmendra Swamy and [[Sarvajna|Saint Sarvajna]]. There are also other people who told Kalagnanam like [[Eswaridevi Matam]] (the grand daughter of Veera Brahmendra Swamy), Yogi Subbaraya Sharma, Swami [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]] (also called Vidyaranya, the minister of [[Harihara I]]) and Dudekula Siddaiah (the disciple of Veera Brahmendra Swamy). 

A brief part of Kalagnanam written by Sri Veera Brahmendra Swamy, which was kept in his native place has been published in Telugu language as a book in 1970 for the first time, along with some other prophet's work. A large volume of the predictions made by Veera Brahmendra Swamy are said to be kept under the [[banyan tree]] of [[Banaganapalle]] village of Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. Out of the brief context of Kalagnanam said by Veera Brahmendra Swamy, 320 verses or poems are very popular with name "Govinda Vakyas". 

Another prophet, Saint Sarvajna has prophesied since rule of King Bijjalaraya to emerge of Future Avatar, Veera Bhoga Vasanta Rayalu. His prophecies are in poetic way called 'Dwipada'. 

The whole part of prophecies said by many saints from South India is included in the kalagnanam book which was published by Brahmamgarimatam. The most part of Kalagnanam alias prophecies collection, describes about the coming King-cum-Avatar, Veera Bhoga Vasanta Rayalu and his acts. About 70 percent of prophecies speak of him, while the other part describes the events to be happened mainly in South India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28418">[[Ku Klux Klan]] nomenclature has evolved over the order's nearly 160 years of existence. The titles and designations were first laid out in the original Klan's prescripts of 1867 and 1868, then revamped with [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]]' [[Kloran]] of 1916. Subsequent Klans have made various modifications.

== Reconstruction period ==

The sources of the rituals, titles and even the name of the original KKK may be found in antebellum [[College fraternity|college fraternities]] and [[Collegiate secret societies in North America|secret societies]] such as the [[Kuklos Adelphon]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing Inc. 1991, p.338&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lester (disambiguation)|John Lester]], one of the original members of the group, stated that the Klan rituals were "modeled on and embraced the leading features of the rituals of an order which has long been popular in many colleges and universities under various names" such as the [[Sons of Confucius]] or [[Guiasticutus]] but always styled '''Ancient and Honorable''' and '''Mirth-Provoking'''. [[Walter L. Fleming]] stated in a footnote to Lester's text that the contemporary (early twentieth century) Southern college fraternity that most nearly mirrored the early Klan was [[Alpha Sigma Sigma]] and the institution of [[snipe hunt]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lester|Lester, John C.]], ''Ku Klux Klan: Its Origin, Growth and Disbandment'' [[Walter L. Fleming]] ed. New York; Neale Publishing Company, 1905. Texts of the first and second prescript as Appendices I and II p.60&lt;/ref&gt;
The original prescript of the Ku Klux Klan was adopted by a convention in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in April 1867. A slightly revised edition appeared the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, Texts of the first and second prescript as Appendices I and II pp.133-176&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher levels ===
In both prescripts there were four levels or "departments" of organization, above the basic level:

*'''Empire''' – constituting the whole area of the Klan's activities. This was led by the '''[[Grand Wizard]]''' and his staff of ten '''Genii''', as well as a '''Grand Exchequer''' (treasurer) and '''Grand Scribe''', whose duty was to keep lists of the subordinate officers. The Genii, Imperial Exchequer and Scribe were appointed by the Imperial Wizard.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136–37, 157–58&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Realms''' – while the role of Realms was laid out in the first prescript they were only identified as [[US states|states]] in the second. Realms were ruled by a '''Grand Dragon''' assisted by eight '''Hydras''', as well as a Grand Exchequer and Grand Scribe, whose duties were identical to the above officers on the imperial level. All officers were appointed by the Grand Dragon.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 138, 155–56, 158–159. The states making up the "empire" were [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], [[Texas]], [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dominions''' – identified in the second prescript as "coterminous with such counties as the Grand Dragons of the several Realms shall assign" and "not to exceed three in number for each [[List of United States congressional districts|Congressional district]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.156, 158&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion was headed by a '''Great Titan''' assisted by six '''Furies''', a Great Exchequer and a Great Scribe, appointed by the Great Titan.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 138–39, 158, 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Provinces''' – the second prescript identified the Provinces as equivalent to a [[Counties of the United States|county]]. It was supervised by a '''Grand Giant''', assisted by four '''Goblins''', a Grand Exchequer, and a Grand Scribe, appointed by the Grand Giant.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first prescript each officer is given the power to appoint Deputies to organize Realms, Dominions, Provinces and Dens until the latter can elect their own officers.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.137–140&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Wizard was to be elected by a majority of Grand Dragons, and each lower level was elected by a majority of the next lower level of officers (Dragons elected by Titans, Titans by Giants etc.), as soon as three units had been formed at each level (three Dominions within a Realm for Grand Dragon, three Provinces within a Dominion for Grand Titan etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143–144&lt;/ref&gt; In the second prescript each officer appoints the lower officer with the approval of his superior.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 141, 158, 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dens ===

The '''Dens''' were the basic level of organization for the Reconstruction Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. ''The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia'' Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing Inc. 1991 p.160&lt;/ref&gt; In the original prescript, its chief officer was the '''Grand Cyclops''', who appointed two '''Nighthawks''', a '''Grand Turk''', a '''Grand Sentinel, Grand Magi''' and a '''Grand Ensign''' in addition to his Grand Scribe.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Cyclops, Grand Exchequer, '''Grand Magi''' (second officer) and '''Grand Monk''' (third officer) were elected by the body politic of the dens, identified as '''Ghouls'''&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.141-3&lt;/ref&gt; In the second prescript the Grand Ensign is dispensed with, while the Grand Exchequer was appointed by the Grand Cyclops, who was now appointed by the Grand Giant. Only the Grand Magi and Grand Monk were elected by the Ghouls.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.160-1, 165-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact function of these officers and the meaning of the titles varied. The two Nighthawks have been identified as couriers.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.428&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Sentinel was in charge of the "'''Grand Guard'''", an organization which is not otherwise elaborated upon in the prescripts, but apparently served as the Den's security detail.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143, 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Turk was the den's "[[executive officer]]" and was charged with informing Klansmen of "all informal or irregular meetings" and helping the Grand Cyclops and the Grand Magi maintain the "control and government" of the Den.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.142, 163&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Ensigns job was to take care of the Klan's flag.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initiation rites ===
The organ for initiation into the Klan was called the '''Investigating Committee''', composed of the Grand Cyclops, Grand Magi and Grand Monk. Upon the nomination of a new member by a current member, the committee would investigate the candidate's "antecedents and his past and present standings and connections" and would then pronounce the candidate "competent and worthy" to become a member. The Grand Turk would escort the candidate to an "outpost" where he would question him and administer a preliminary [[oath]]. After this the Grand Turk would conduct the candidate to the Den, where the Grand Cyclops would administer the final oath.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.140-1, 142, 146-7&lt;/ref&gt; The second prescript elaborates that the candidate must have his left hand on the [[Bible]] and his right hand toward heaven and includes a ten-point "interrogation" that the candidate must answer satisfactorily in order to proceed with the final oath. The questions asked included: are you now or have ever been a member of the [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican Party]], [[Loyal Leagues]] or [[Grand Army of the Republic]]? Did you fight with the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]? Do you believe in [[racial equality|Negro equality]]? among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.171-2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tribunals ===
A system of "judiciary" organs was created in each prescript. In the first the judiciary was divided into a '''Grand Council of Yahoos''', to try officers of the Klan, and a '''Grand Council of Centaurs''' to try regular Ghouls. In Art.IV Sec.4, the Grand Giant is charged with conducting the Council of Yahoo, but Art.VI Sec.2 states that the Council will be composed of officers of the equivalent rank as the accused and presided over by an officer of the next higher rank. A trial of the Grand Wizard would be held by a meeting of all the Grand Dragons, the most senior Grand Dragon presiding&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.140, 144&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if these tribunals were ever functional.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

The second prescript presented an entirely different judiciary, with officers of the first three levels tried by three judges, appointed by the chief officer of the given jurisdiction, and the officers and attaches of the headquarters (presumably the Genii, Hydras, and Furies). Trials of Den officers would be conducted at the provincial headquarters and include five judges, and ordinary ghouls to be tried at their dens with seven judges. As before a trial of the Grand Wizard would be conducted by the most senior Grand Dragon, this time with a quorum of seven dragons. All defendants had the right of appeal to the next higher court, and the proceeding was to be governed as "ordinary [[Court-martial|court martials]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.16-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscellaneous ===
In addition to the structure outlined above, there are documented cases of organs of slightly different nomenclature from Reconstruction. For instance, a group of twenty men who were arrested on April 6, 1868, at their "den" at the corners of [[Beale Street]] and Hernando street in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], was called the '''Supreme Cyclopean Council'''. The constitution that the police captured outlined an organization with a Grand Cyclops, Vice-Grand Cyclops, and Secretary and openly advocated assassination of the "murders and robbers" now ruling the South. Members were bound to participate in the activities of the order, even if it meant leaving the "embraces" of their wife.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Henry Townsend]] ''The Handbook of the year'' London: Wyman &amp; Sons, 1868 p.293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Trelease]] ''White terror: the Ku Klux Klan conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction'' Greenwood Press, 1979 p.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The complete constitution, which identifies the group as part of the KKK was printed in [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038521/1868-04-09/ed-1/seq-1/ Nashville union and dispatch. Vol XXXIV #105 April 09, 1868]&lt;/ref&gt; A '''Grand Klan''', composed of delegates from [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[York County, South Carolina|York]], [[Union County, South Carolina|Union]], and [[Chester County, South Carolina|Chester]] counties in South Carolina and a few from North Carolina met in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]] and declared that no more raids or whippings would be conducted by members of the Klan except by their order and that the penalty for violating this order would be 100 lashes for the first offense and death for the second.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Joint Select Committee Appointed to Inquire Into the Condition of Affairs in the Late Insurrectionary States, So Far as Regards the Execution of Laws, and the Safety of the Lives and Property of the Citizens of the United States and Testimony Taken: Report of the Joint committee, Views of the minority and Journal of the Select committee, April 20, 1871-Feb. 19, 1872'' Washington; GPO 1872 p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt was apparently made to make Ghoul titles for other officers in [[Maury County, Tennessee]] in 1867 and early 1868, but the result was only confusion. Additionally a "'''Grand Tycoon'''" notified Klansmen in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] to cease night riding and the order was apparently effective in restoring calm to [[Wilson County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.236-7&lt;/ref&gt; In some early reconstruction Klan units there was also a '''Lictor''', whose role as a guard of the den was later subsumed by the Nighthawks.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.348&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Era ==
The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. which existed from 1915 to 1944, elaborated on the original prescript in its Kloran and in the constitution and by-laws adopted in 1922. Some titles and jurisdictional designations were carried over from the Reconstruction prescripts intact or slightly modified, and others were original with Imperial Wizard Simmons.

=== Jurisdictions ===
*'''Invisible Empire''' – this designation included both the Klans geographical domain – up to "the whole world" - but also in a "spiritual sense" all the secrets and workings of the order. All things outside this empire were designated the '''Alien World''' and non-members '''Aliens'''.&lt;ref&gt;Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc ''[http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/AmRad/constitutionlawsknights.pdf Constitution and Laws of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc]'' Atlanta, Ga; Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc 1921 [pref. Nov. 1922] pp.12-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan was a military organization and its [[commander in chief]] was the '''Imperial Wizard''', whose power was supreme "within the limits of this Constitution" and whose edicts, decisions and rulings were binding on all members of the order.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.9&lt;/ref&gt; He had a staff of '''Fifteen Genii'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire had an assembly or convention known as a '''Klonvokation'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Realm''' – was carried over from the Reconstruction prescript, but it was no longer restricted to the [[Southern United States|Southern States]]; any state or territory of the United States could become a Realm, and Realms were also given a number based on the date of organization of the Realm. The convention of the Realm was designated the '''Klorero'''&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Realm remained the Grand Dragon; the other officers were collectively known as the '''Nine Hydras'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.45&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Province''' – in the new Klan, a Province was construed as "a county or number of counties" designated by the Grand Dragon. There were a maximum of six provinces per realm, but the Grand Dragon could create more with the permission of the Imperial Wizard. The Provincial convention was the '''Klonverse'''. The chief officer of a Province was a '''Great Titan''', and the other officers were known as the '''Seven Furies'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.13, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klan''' – the basic unit of the Second Era KKK was known simply as a Klan. Its area of jurisdiction was a '''Klanton''' which was defined as "extend[ing] in all directions to a distance midway between the location of the Klan and the nearest Klan thereto" unless otherwise directed by the Grand Dragon or Imperial Wizard. The chief officer of a Klan was an '''Exalted Cyclops''' and the subordinate officers were known as the '''Twelve Terrors'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.13–14, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Officials ===
There was a nearly identical set of subordinate officers at each level:&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.22–23, 59&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klaliff''' – [[vice president]]
*'''Klokard''' – [[lecturer]]
*'''Kludd''' – [[chaplain]]
*'''Kligrapp''' – [[secretary]]
*'''Klabee''' – [[treasurer]]
*'''Kladd''' – "conductor", in charge of initiating new members
*'''Klarogo''' – inner guard, [[serjeant-at-arms]]
*'''Klexter''' – outer guard
*'''Nighthawks''' – couriers

The officers at each level above the local Klan unit were designated by a unique prefix: '''Imperial''' at the Empire level; '''Grand''' at the Realm level; and '''Great''' at the Province level. Thus, for instance, an Imperial Kludd would be the chaplain for the whole organization, a Grand Kludd for the Realm, Great Kludd for a Province and simply Kludd for a local Klan.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.23, 46, 48, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all offices were reproduced at each level. The Kladd, Klarogo, Klexter, and Klokard were not present at the Province level, and the Kladd was not included on the Realm level.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.48, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Klazik''', second vice-president, and '''Klonsul''', attorney, positions only existed at the Imperial level.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.29, 32&lt;/ref&gt; The Klazik's duties included being head of the department of Realms and organizing new Realms and Provinces&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.45–48,&lt;/ref&gt; At the Province level there were three Klaliffs that served as an advisory board. A '''Klokann''' of three members, each one named a '''Klokan''', filled this role at the local levels and a Klokann of four members at the Imperial level, in which they served as a "Supreme Board of Auditors and Special Advisers and was led by a Chief Imperial Klokan.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.23, 33, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Wizards Genii constituted his '''Imperial Kloncilium'''; this was the Imperial Wizards supreme [[advisory board]], as well as the Klans highest administrative organ in between Klonvokations. It met regularly every July, but could also be called when the Imperial Wizard or five Geniis petitioned him to do so. The Kloncilium was also the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of the organization with [[appellate jurisdiction]] and the right to finally determine disputes between Realms, Provinces, Klans and members in unorganized states&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giant''' was adopted as an [[emeritus]] title: Imperial Giant for an ex-Imperial Wizard, Grand Giant for an ex-Grand Dragon, Great Giant for ex-Great Titan and Klan Giant for an ex-Exalted Cyclops.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.35&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[Kleagle]]''' was a recruiter and was responsible for organizing local Klans.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-1944 ==

Since the dissolution of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. in 1944, there have been many Klan groups. Details of the nomenclature have varied, somewhat, among the different groups, but some terms have had more currency than others. Over time, the term '''klavern''' replaced klan for local groups.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.322"&gt;Newton and Newton, p.322&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial Wizard and Grand Dragon have still been generally used for the leader of a Klan organization and for state (realm) leaders. Exceptions included cases of one state Klans, such as the [[Association of Georgia Klans]], whose leader [[Dr. Samuel Green]], kept the title Grand Dragon until shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.238&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] created some innovations in their organization including a bicameral '''Klongress''' with an [[upper house]] Klonvokation and [[Lower house|lower]] '''Klanburgess'''.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.321-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s [[David Duke]]'s [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] dropped the Imperial Wizard title, and the leader was called national director.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; That organization, now known as the Knights Party, no longer uses most of the traditional Klan titles, and the only fraternal titles used are '''Page''', '''Squire''' and '''Knight''' for levels of membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kkk.bz/main/?page_id=43 Structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary ==
Aside from titles and geographical designations, a distinctive vocabulary has grown around the Ku Klux Klan organizations. These include names for rituals, code words, and practices of the various Klans.

*'''Klankraft''' or '''Klanishness''' – the overall practice and state of being a Klan member. This could be defined as the employment and patronizing of fellow Klansmen, as well as sale of official Klan memorabilia, such as T-shirts, watches and belt buckles.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.321&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial Wizard [[Robert Shelton (Ku Klux Klan)|Robert Shelton]] gave this definition "...robes, cross lightings and parades, the mysticism, everything that made the Klan the Klan".&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League ''Danger: Extremism; the major voices and vehicles on America far right fringe'' New York; Anti-Defamation League 1996 p.251&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions included maintaining the sanctity of one's home, maintenance of white supremacy and purity, and loyalty to the Klan itself.&lt;ref&gt;Knights of the Ku Klux Klan ''The Practice of Klanishness'' 1924 p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membership ===
There are terms related to membership and non-membership:&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League pp.392-3&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Alien''' – a non-member
*'''Naturalization''' – the Klan [[Initiation rites|initiation ceremony]]
*'''Citizen''' – a Klan member
*'''Passport''' – [[membership card]]
*'''Banished''' – expelled from the Klan
*'''Yellow dog''' – a [[hazing]] ritual similar to the type used in [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|college fraternities]]; when practiced by imperial officers, called the '''Royal Order of the Purple Dog'''.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.627&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Groups ===
Groups of Klansmen commissioned for "special activities"
*'''Wrecking Crew''' – an action squad commissioned to take physical action against enemies and wayward members of the Klan. Depending on time and organization, these groups consisted of 5 to 8 members and were authorized either by the klokann, the Exalted Cyclops and/or the Kludd. Sometimes led by the Nighthawk. An action taken by the crew is '''wrecked'''. Some names used by wrecking crews include "Secret Six", "Ass-tear Squad" and "Holy terrors".&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.623&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League p.393&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klan Bureau of Investigation''' – Pioneered by the Mississippi White Knights, these groups investigate the Klans enemies and check leaks.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Anti-Defamation League p.292"&gt;Anti-Defamation League p.292&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Degree teams''' – a group which performs the task of initiation.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finances ===
*'''Klectoken''' or '''Klecktokon''' – initiation fee. It stabilized around $10 before the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.322"/&gt;
*'''Imperial tax''' – membership dues&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.285&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Provincial tax''' – secondary dues, paid per capita for the upkeep of a Realm.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.48-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Code words and phrases ===
*'''A.Y.A.K.''' or '''Ayak''' – "Are you a Klansman?" to be answered with below.
*'''A.K.I.A.''' or '''Akia''' – "A Klansman I am"; these were code words for Klansmen meeting in strange surroundings. They would be inserted into common conversation, for instance "Does a Mr. Ayak live in this neighborhood?" to be responded by "No, but a Mr. Akia does." The password would then be accompanied by a [[secret handshake]] or other sign of recognition.&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.292"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.30-1&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''K.I.G.Y''' or '''Kigy''' – "Klansman, I greet you"&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.292"/&gt;&lt;ref name="splcenter1"&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan Ku Klux Klan]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''S.A.N.B.O.G.''' or '''Sanbog''' – "Strangers are near, be on guard"&lt;ref name="splcenter1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.293"&gt;Anti-Defamation League p.293&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''C.A.B.A.R.K.''' – "Constantly Applied By All Real Klansmen"&lt;ref name="splcenter1" /&gt;
*'''O.R.I.O.N''' – Our Race Is Our Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/hate_symbols/ORION.asp |title=A Visual Database of Extremist Symbols, Logos and Tattoos |publisher=Archive.adl.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''L.O.T.I.E''' or '''LOTIE''' – Lady Of The Invisible Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Axelrod]] ''International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders'' New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 p.144. This was one of a number of names for Klan women's auxiliaries&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates and times ===

Two KKK codes for dates and times have been developed, the '''Ku Klux Register''' in the original prescripts and the '''Kalender''' developed by William J. Simmons.

==== Ku Klux Register ====

In the original prescripts the register contained twelve designations, thought to correspond to months:&lt;ref name=" Newton and Newton, p.337"&gt;Newton and Newton, p.337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*1st-'''Dismal'''
*2nd-'''Dark'''
*3rd-'''Furious'''
*4th-'''Portentous'''
*5th-'''Wonderful'''
*6th-'''Alarming'''

{{col-break}}
*7th-'''Dreadful'''
*8th-'''Terrible'''
*9th-'''Horrible'''
*10th-'''Melancholy'''
*11th-'''Mournful'''
*12th-'''Dying'''
{{col-end}}

The second prescript had a slightly different scheme.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.337"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*1-'''Dismal'''
*2-'''Mystic'''
*3-'''Stormy'''
*4-'''Peculiar'''
*5-'''Blooming'''
*6-'''Brilliant'''

{{col-break}}
*7-'''Painful'''
*8-'''Portentous'''
*9-'''Fading'''
*10-'''Melancholy'''
*11-'''Glorious'''
*12-'''Gloomy'''
{{col-end}}

Colors were used for the days of the week:&lt;ref name=" Newton and Newton, p.337"/&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*1st Prescript
*I-'''White'''
*II-'''Green'''
*III-'''Blue'''
*IV-'''Black'''
*V-'''Yellow'''
*VI-'''Crimson'''
*VII-'''Purple'''

{{col-break}}
*2nd Prescript
*I-'''White'''
*II-'''Green'''
*III-'''Yellow'''
*IV-'''Amber'''
*V-'''Purple'''
*VI-'''Crimson'''
*VII-'''Emerald'''
{{col-end}}

Twelve designations were used for the hours of the day:&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.337"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lester, pp.148, 176"&gt;Lester, pp.148, 176&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*1st prescript
*1. '''Fearful'''
*2. '''Startling'''
*3. '''Awful'''
*4. '''Woeful'''
*5. '''Horrid'''
*6. '''Bloody'''
*7. '''Doleful'''
*8. '''Sorrowful'''
*9. '''Hideous'''
*10. '''Frightful'''
*11. '''Appalling'''
*12. '''Last'''

{{col-break}}
*2nd prescript
*1. '''Fearful'''
*2. '''Startling'''
*3. '''Wonderful'''
*4. '''Alarming'''
*5. '''Mournful'''
*6. '''Appalling'''
*7. '''Hideous'''
*8. '''Frightful'''
*9. '''Awful'''
*10. '''Horrible'''
*11. '''Dreadful'''
*12. '''Last'''
{{col-end}}

==== Kalender ====

The Kalender developed by W. J. Simmons included codes for days of the week, weeks, months and years. For months:&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, pp.307-8"&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.307-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Constitution p.87"&gt;''Constitution'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*1st-'''Bloody'''
*2nd-'''Gloomy'''
*3rd-'''Hideous'''
*4th-'''Fearful'''
*5th-'''Furious'''
*6th-'''Alarming'''

{{col-break}}
*7th-'''Terrible'''
*8th-'''Horrible'''
*9th-'''Mournful'''
*10th-'''Sorrowful'''
*11th-'''Frightful'''
*12th-'''Appalling'''
{{col-end}}

For weeks and days:&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, pp.307-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Constitution p.87"/&gt;

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
*Weeks
*1-'''Woeful'''
*2-'''Weeping'''
*3-'''Wailing'''
*4-'''Wonderful'''
*5-'''Weird'''

{{col-break}}
*Days
*1-'''Dark'''
*2-'''Deadly'''
*3-'''Dismal'''
*4-'''Doleful'''
*5-'''Desolate'''
*6-'''Dreadful'''
*7-'''Desperate'''
{{col-end}}

Years were reckoned according to '''reigns''' and '''cycles'''. The '''Reign of Incarnation and Incantation''' was all time up to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The '''First Reign of our Incarnation and Incantation''' was the period between the Revolution and the establishment of the original Klan, which was reckoned to May 6, 1866 in this scheme. The '''Reign of our Second Incarnation and Incantation''' was reckoned between 1866 and Grand Wizard [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]'s dissolution of the Klan, which is reckoned to 1872. The '''Reign of our Third Incarnation and Incantation''' began in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.88, 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan year, '''Anno Klanslar''', began in March of each year, and the cycle was reckoned from December of each calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linguistics in education''' refers to a small but growing field of [[linguistics]] which advocates a greater use of linguistic theory and {{clarify span|linguistic curriculum|date=May 2014}} in [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] [[education]].

== Background ==
Due to changes in national standards for K-12 education in the [[United States]] during the 1960s, [[grammar]] was largely dropped from [[English studies|English]] courses. The belief was that direct grammar instruction was not required for improved instruction in writing. Despite more recent research that has shown the positive effects of grammar instruction,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the attitude that it is unnecessary persists today.

== Challenges ==
Because grammar has not been taught in many years, generations of teachers were never exposed to its direct instruction. Thus, even though many wish to teach it in their classrooms they do not find that they have adequate knowledge on the subject. Unfortunately this often perpetuates [[Folk etymology|linguistic stereotypes]] that can sometimes be discriminatory to speakers on what are believed to be non standard dialects or languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/4564 |title=Should We Teach Grammar in the Upper Elementary School Classroom ? &amp;#124; Serendip Studio |publisher=Serendip.brynmawr.edu |date=2010-01-31 |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another issue is that the curriculum for teachers is already very broad, especially in comparison to other college students, so requiring further courses for would-be teachers is rather unpopular. The same problem exists in the K-12 classroom which already have difficult time constraints on their current curriculum. To add grammar to an already full curriculum is extremely difficult.

== Benefits ==
Studies of how grammar and other linguistic theory can be incorporated into K-12 classrooms have been highly successful both in improving students' conscious knowledge of grammar and changing attitudes about non-standard English dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/11/05/loc_dialect.html |title=Speech modes not right or wrong, just different |publisher=Enquirer.com |date=2004-11-05 |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that grammar instruction can be beneficial to students' writing such that replacing writing or vocabulary instruction with grammar can actually be a more productive use of class time.

== Current theory ==
Linguists have also been involved in this field in attempts to change [[Folk etymology|misconceptions about language]]. One common example is the definition of [[nouns]]. Traditionally a noun is defined as a "person, place, or thing". While this definition captures much of what nouns are it does not incorporate all possible definitions and uses. For example, mental concepts such as "belief" or "idea" are also nouns but do not neatly fit the traditional definition. This can be especially difficult for children to understand. A more comprehensive definition seeks to describe nouns through their features and uses. However this definition requires the teacher to have greater knowledge of English [[syntax]].

[[Linguistic rights]] in Africa are stated in [[constitution]]s which differ by country. These constitutions usually state the [[national language]](s) and/or [[official language]](s), and may or may not explicitly allow for other languages in the country. Most of the linguistic rights stated here are negative rights, which grant freedom of usage of own language and prevent discrimination based on language.

==Linguistic rights in African constitutions==

===[[Algeria]]===
Constitution as adopted on 19 November 1976.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/most/ln2nat.htm Linguistic Rights - National Constitutions], "UNESCO MOST" Accessed 2010-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Article 3'''
::[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the [[National language|national]] and [[Official language|official]] language.
:'''Article 42'''
::(3) In respect to the provisions of the present Constitution, the political parties cannot be founded on religious, linguistic, racial, sex, corporatist or regional basis. The political parties cannot resort to [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] [[propaganda]] on the elements mentioned in the previous paragraph.
:'''Article 178'''
::(4) Any constitutional revision cannot infringe on Arabic as the national and official language.

===[[Benin]]===
Constitution as adopted on 2 December 1990.&lt;ref name="UNESCO 28/10/10"/&gt;

:'''Article 40'''
::The state has the duty to assure the diffusion and the teaching of the Constitution, of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] of 1948, of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] of 1981 as well as all of the international instruments duly ratified and relative to human rights. The state must integrate the rights of the individual into the programs of literacy and of teaching in the various scholastic and university academic cycles and into all the educational programs of the Armed Forces, of the Public Security Forces and of comparable categories. The state must equally assure the diffusion and teaching of these same rights in the national languages by all the means of mass communication, and particularly by radio and television.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29981">The '''MOGUL framework'''  is a research framework aiming to provide a theoretical perspective on the nature of language. MOGUL (Modular On-line Growth and Use of Language) draws on the common ground underlying various related areas of cognitive science including psycholinguistics, [[theoretical linguistics]], first- and second-language acquisition, [[neurolinguistics]] and [[cognitive psychology]]; it is designed to be applicable to all these fields of research.

The MOGUL framework's background assumption is that the mind is composed of [[expert systems]] which have evolved over time, one of which is responsible for human linguistic ability. Historically, scientific studies of language have been divided between many sub-disciplines; theoretical linguists focus on the abstract properties of language&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers in other fields investigate how language is used and processed in real time: either in psychological terms or (in the case of neurolinguistics) through a study of the physical systems of neurons in the brain. Each field of study has developed its own research traditions and technical vocabulary, making it difficult to integrate insights across disciplines. The MOGUL Framework represents an attempt to identify common themes and compatible approaches in different (but related fields), and hence to facilitate integration.

==Overview==
MOGUL is designed as a platform for the generation of new hypotheses, with a terminology and a set of interrelated concepts that can be used across more than one discipline. Although not a full-fledged theory in its own right, it sets out various theoretical claims based on the current literature in a range of research domains. As suggested below it is not connectionist in the most widely used sense of that term, although it employs terms and concepts familiar to connectionists such as competition, activation, activation levels and so forth. The same processing perspective also requires the long-established Chomskyan distinction between competence and performance to be viewed in a somewhat different way. [[Linguistic competence]] (knowledge) is not compartmentalised and placed in a separate box in the model, which then forms the object for a processor (or processors) to act on. Rather, it is instantiated and implicit within the processing system. The distinction between mental representation and processing is still valid, but is expressed in a way that ought to allow the abstract properties of linguistic systems in the mind to be more easily investigated in conjunction with real-time linguistic phenomena. The inspiration for this approach is the work of [[Ray Jackendoff]]. Here the architecture of the [[language faculty]] is formulated in such a way as to facilitate statements about competence-related, representational issues and their relationship to real-time language processing within the same model.

==Scope==
Empirical evidence for the claims and assumptions set out in MOGUL rests essentially on the experimental findings of the various fields of research on which it is based. The MOGUL framework queries current solutions and raises new questions based upon this body of evidence, in the hope that answers to such questions will be sought in the related areas by appropriate researchers.

More specifically, MOGUL represents an attempt to provide ways of investigating how first- or second-language processing relates to linguistic development and how language in the monolingual and multilingual language user is situated within human cognitive architecture in general. What exactly happens, even in milliseconds, when someone is exposed to the sights and sounds of a new language? How do we explain what gets noticed and what gets regularly ignored? What about the fixed stages that people seem to pass though? How is it that we have so little conscious control over what we are attempting to acquire? Why do children appear to be worse language learners in the short run and much better in the long run? How can two or more language systems cohabit in one mind? Answers to these questions require an interdisciplinary approach. Two major sources for inspiration for the approach described here are the ideas of [[Generative linguistics|generative linguist]] [[Ray Jackendoff]] on language faculty and modularity and [[Global Workspace Theory]], as advanced by [[Bernard Baars]].&lt;ref&gt;Baars 1988, 1997; Jackendoff 1987, 2002, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The first MOGUL publication was released in 2004 and was a keynote article in ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'' (Truscott and Sharwood Smith 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Truscott, J &amp; M. Sharwood Smith. (2004). Acquisition by processing: a modular  perspective on language development. ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'' 7,1, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to situate languages within a wider cognitive context, the MOGUL framework is designed to provide a basic architecture that purports to explain how (in general terms) the mind functions. This means that it is not an account of brain function, although it is set out in such a way that might facilitate such accounts.

==Modules, processing units and working memory==
Briefly, MOGUL architecture follows Jackendoff in positing a generic cognitive module (or, in MOGUL, a processing unit) which consists of an integrative processor operating on structural elements (structures) in a memory store. Specifically, it works with activated elements that are raised into working memory from that memory store.

[[File:gen processor.jpg|300px|thumb|MOGUL architecture|alt=Diagram of MOGUL linguistic theory]]Modules are only somewhat generic in structure; the rest is very specific to each module, since each module operates with its own code. Visual memory contains elements that only the visual processor can access; syntactic memory contains elements that only the syntactic processor can deal with, and so on. While Jackendoff prefers to think of [[working memory]] as a separate blackboard onto which elements of long-term memory are written, in MOGUL the alternative view of the working-memory blackboard is adopted: it is part of the unified memory system, and elements are raised to the working memory "surface" within the same store.  In both versions, elements must cross an activation threshold to be visible to the integrative processor.&lt;ref&gt;Baddeley 2007, Cowan 1999, Nairne 2002 and Paradis 2004&lt;/ref&gt;) Note that memory is modularised, so visual memory (including visual working memory) is separate from – and independent of – for example, phonological memory. Modules, useless if entirely autonomous and cut off from other parts of the system as a whole, require some way whereby they can link up and cooperate. This is done by means of interface processors matching structural elements in the memory stores of adjacent modules. The cognitive system as a whole copes with a multitude of different tasks like tying a knot, listening to a speech, driving through a busy city and salsa-dancing by forming appropriate coalitions of processors producing assemblies of structures (linked together via appropriate interfaces) from different modules. The generic structure of a MOGUL module (based on Jackendoff's model) is portrayed in the figure on the right, and also reflected in various places in the third figure in this article (see "MOGUL architecture in a nutshell" below).

This functional architecture may be neurally and anatomically instantiated in different ways: the design of systems such as that proposed by Jackendoff and others (including MOGUL) involves no specific claims about the precise nature and location of the neural system. These are two different levels of description. The auditory module (translated into cortical terms) involves several brain regions distributed across the supratemporal plane; activation in MOGUL terms (when translated into neurological terms) may involve both excitatory and inhibitory [[neurotransmitters]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, functional auditory structure (as described within the MOGUL framework) must be distinguished from anatomical and physiological auditory structure.

==Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT)==
An important portion of the MOGUL account is devoted to the claim that the acquired (and atrophied, or lost) linguistic structures are natural byproducts of online processing. This means that acquisitional mechanisms do not exist as such, but are embodied in the operations of the [[parser]]. This claim is made explicit in Acquisition by Processing Theory (APT). Processing concepts (activation levels, competition and so on), as exploited by other non-modular, domain-specific approaches, are realigned in MOGUL to explain how new cognitive systems emerge. APT is a hypothesis put forward by Sharwood Smith and Truscott as an integral part of MOGUL and is applicable to all kinds of cognitive development, not only [[language acquisition]] and [[language attrition]] (for a similar approach acquisition which is framed within an emergentist perspective, see O'Grady 2005).&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, W. (2005). Syntactic Carpentry: An Emergentist Approach to Syntax. Mahwah, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, the claim is that all development is the lingering effect of processing. As the mind attempts to build mental representations online, various structures at its disposal are activated.  Structures compete with one another to be selected for the current representation. As a simple example, on hearing the word "ship" an English speaker's processing system will activate various candidate structures so (for instance) the phonological structures underlying "sheep" and "shape" will compete for selection (and other candidates as well, including phonological structures belonging to other languages known to the listener).&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra and van Heuven, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The "ship" structure is normally selected as the best fit, and thereby its likelihood of being selected in the future is correspondingly strengthened by a small amount. In this way, a basic "use it or lose it" principle is invoked; this development principle works throughout the cognitive system as a whole.

As we match various types of cognitive structure available to us in order to find the best fit for unfamiliar input from the environment new connections are developed, initially with the relevant structures possessing a low resting level of activation. This means they will have a relatively poor chance of selection for future instances of the same input. However, the more they are selected the more they will show up in the observable behaviour of the individual concerned.

Although the frequency in which we experience given phenomena influences our development, cognitive growth is not an automatic consequence of experience; our mind is modular, and each module is controlled by its own unique processing principles. This limits, for instance, what we can learn to see or hear or say; seeing, hearing and speaking each involve dedicated processing units, which control their own internal operations. In this way, high-frequency events in the environment may still not impact development because the relevant parts of our mind are incapable of processing them. This may be because a) the relevant modules (processing units) are simply not designed to do so, or b) they are not yet ready to process them, because their internal principles require some prerequisite state of affairs before the potential new input can be integrated. By the same token, an internal operation may be halted because although one processing unit has processed input, an adjacent processing unit (module) with which it is connected is not in a ready state to cooperate (find matching structures within its own memory store). Hence frequent events in the external environment may indeed get processed by some part(s) of the cognitive system but still not by every relevant part. MOGUL espouses both [[modularity]] of mind and a constrained form of [[connectionism]] with a complex web of expert systems, each with its own particular organising principles. In this way, MOGUL makes claims not only about language abilities but about the mind in general.

==Comprehension and production==
The core modules involved in language comprehension work in two directions. Phonological, syntactic and conceptual processing work in one direction in response to visual and auditory events in the environment (typically in listening to speech or reading a text), but they also work in the other direction to produce speech or writing (or messages in [[sign language]]). Production involves a physical response to internal events, the creation of a message to be conveyed. This requires articulation of different parts of the body, following the commands of motor structures.  Meanings in the conceptual processor are matched with syntactic structures which in turn are matched with phonological structures; this structural chain continues to be built following different routes according to the selected mode of articulation. The required motor structures that drive the articulation of speech will be different from those involved in [[Writing system|writing]] or signing.

When the basic direction of processing is, say, from conceptual structure to speech, the assembling of an appropriate structural chain is not carried out in a rigid unidirectional sequence; at different levels, different options will be available and compete for selection. In production, some options may be partially formed and then be dropped in favour of a better-fitting rival structure. In this way the ultimate structural chain is built up incrementally, out of the more accessible candidate structures that happen to provide the best overall fit at the time. Comprehension works according to the same principles, with parallel processing and split-second editing and revising until a best-fit interpretation is arrived at. It may be the wrong interpretation but it will be the best fit, given the person's current processing resources at that particular moment in time.

As an example of what processing online means, let us examine speech production in a fluent speaker. The construction of a message will be initiated in the conceptual processor. Conceptual structures will be chosen, which then activate the interface between the conceptual and syntactic system. The conceptual structures are matched up with particular syntactic structures forming the first stage – in other words, a CS+SS (conceptual structure plus [[Syntax|syntactic structure]]) chain. A semantic argument structure in CS code which specifies an action with an agent (the doer) and a patient (what is acted upon), as in "a boy hit the ball", is matched up with a syntactic argument structure with the requisite verb and noun phrases (determiner phrases), each in the appropriate case: one in nominative case and the other in objective case. The interface between SS and PS kicks in, causing various appropriate phonological structures to be activated; an SS/PS match is made, the outcome now being a CS+SS+PS chain.  As is generally the case, more than one option may be selected in parallel before one particular option is settled on. Structural chains are formed incrementally; as more CS is built so more SS and PS are constructed with more context, earlier options that were provisionally selected are dropped as the representation develops and becomes more complex. The PS is matched up with motor structures responsible for the articulation of speech, and the utterance is produced. Each type of structure (AS, PS, SS, CS and so on) is constructed in its own particular module and by its own unique integrative processor, following its own particular set of principles.  Comprehension is a similar process, with the general direction going in reverse; auditory structures are formed in response to acoustic stimuli in the environment. These auditory structures match PS and SS, finally culminating in the interpretation of the message (its conceptual structure).

==Perception and affect (PopS and AfS)==
One feature of the MOGUL approach is an attempt to spell out in coherent terms the role of [[perception]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] in issues of language development in the individual. In the earlier example of "a boy hit the ball" (where a simple example of a how a CS+SS+PS chain was built up), we assume that the conceptual structures evoked also have interfaces with various perceptual and affective structures to account for the associations individuals have with, for example, the concept "boy". In other words, the activation of a chain effectively becomes the activation of a whole network of associations contributed by different modular systems in the mind. The co-activation of structural networks of various kinds is important in explaining facts about attention and noticing. MOGUL follows the view that high levels of activation are strongly implicated in the phenomenon of conscious awareness. This is made explicit in the role of ''perceptual output structures'' (POpS).

POpS is a generic term covering the output of various perceptual systems corresponding to the five senses – or, more properly, the sensory systems currently believed to exist (which number more than the traditional five). Of greatest interest in MOGUL are ''visual structures'' (VS) and ''auditory structures'' (AS), given the fact that language is usually perceived in visual and auditory terms. Structures reside in the memory stores of the appropriate processing system (processing unit, or module). Exposed to the sound of the word "dog" or the sound of a creaking door, the auditory system activates a particular auditory structure (or set of auditory structures) in response to this sensory input. In this way, a given structure can be thought of as an auditory memory that may be re-activated even when there is no external sensory input (in hallucinations and dreams, for example) and grow stronger or weaker (less accessible) depending on the frequency with which it is activated successfully.

Perceptual output structures are strongly interconnected. This enables a coordinated responses to events in the environment and assists the organism's chances of survival. This coordinating function of the POpS system may be related to the role of the global workspace in Baars' theory.&lt;ref&gt;Baars, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, since POpS mediate between the external environment and the internal operations of the mind that are inaccessible to awareness, POpS conform closely with Jackendoff's Intermediate Theory of Consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackendoff, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The rich interconnections between POpS permit very high levels of activation to be achieved, a hypothetical prerequisite for awareness to occur. It is also reflected in the condition known as [[synaesthesia]]: here the connection between two POpS reaches levels that result in an awareness whereby the two senses appear to merge; for example, a particular sound takes on the quality of a particular taste. Another example of connection is provided by the experimentally-induced [[McGurk effect]]. Here, two sensory signals are generated to produce a conflict; the subject's awareness is the result of an attempt to resolve the conflict, so that hearing one sound and simultaneously seeing the speaker pronounce a different sound will create the illusion of hearing a sound halfway between the actual sound and the sound suggested by the speaker's facial gestures (especially the movement of the lips).

The main point is that awareness (whether it can be classified as an illusion or not) is generated indirectly via POpS; we do not have direct access to the contents of any module or processing unit. While we can never become aware of the fine phonological and syntactic properties of the word "dog" - or its semantic and pragmatic properties, its ''conceptual structure''(CS) - we can certainly become aware of its sound. In the same way, we can become aware of the sound of the creaking door. In both cases, it is auditory structure (one of the POpS) that gives rise to the conscious experience. As implied above, it is in the nature of linguistic structures (PS and SS) and its conceptual structures (CS) that they do ''not'' have the rich interconnectivity described above, and consequently do not (and ''cannot'') achieve the appropriate levels of activation for consciousness to occur. What we become conscious of arises directly from POpS activity. In other words, consciousness is always perceptual in nature.

The affective system works with ''affective structures'' (AfS) that are constructed using primitives such as "fear" and "disgust", which are discussed in [[affective neuroscience]] in the work of [[António Damásio]].&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; AfS are connected to POpS and contribute directly to appropriate responses of the organism to events in the immediate environment, to its chances of survival and to the experience of conscious awareness. Making these aspects of mental life more explicit helps researchers to understand and devise hypotheses about how consciousness and emotion affect online language performance and language acquisition. By the same token, it should help to show how certain aspects of language behaviour are (or might be) immune to such influence.

==Knowing a language==
Language is a vague term and is its widest sense involves a host of different processing units, only some of which are what makes human language unique to this species, that is, the phonological and syntactic expert systems that make up what, in [[generative linguistics]], is called the [[language module]] and whose special properties are often subsumed under the name [[Universal Grammar]]. Closely associated with this core system, but not part of the language module per se, are a rich set of conceptual structures developed over the lifespan, as also b) auditory structures that have been matched up with phonological structures and c) visual structures created for interpreting writing and sign language. In addition, there are the various motor structures involved in the production of language in its different modes. One might lump all of this together and call it ''knowledge of language''. None of it, however, constitutes 'knowledge of language' if, by this term, we rather mean language that we can think and talk about and analyse, in other words ''metalinguistic knowledge'', which, as with all forms of [[metacognition]], is constructed out of conceptual structure and various perceptual output structures. [[File:metaroute.jpg|right|thumb|400px|alt=Linguistic diagram]]To take a simple example, the word "horse" can be discussed or pondered; all that is needed for this is an auditory structure (the  sound of the word) and its visual structure (representing its orthographic, written form), both of which are matched up with its meaning as illustrated in the figure on the right. Not represented in the figure is the additional conceptual structure (over above the meaning of horse itself), consisting of metalinguistic concepts such as ''word, syllable, noun, definition'' and the like. These concepts are required for any analytic thinking about language and may vary widely in degree and complexity, depending on an individual's metalinguistic sophistication. In any case, the language module is not directly implicated in any explicit discussion (or explicit thinking) about what is actually a linguistic form. In the MOGUL version of metalinguistic processing, the essential chain of connections that are assembled completely bypasses the PS and SS systems. Processing within the language module will always kick in automatically on exposure of language stimuli, but metalinguistic (explicit) activity is processed elsewhere. Following the standard arguments from [[learnability]] theory as applied in [[generative linguistics]], the language module is nevertheless crucial for all other types of linguistic activity and is vital for explaining the acquisition of language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; No amount of activation of auditory and conceptual structure alone can explain the growth of language in the mind following repeated exposure to speech, most obviously in the case of little children and (arguably) adults as well.

Because of these two modes of knowing, we can appear to be very knowledgeable about the grammar of a particular language or grammar in general and yet be very poor users of that language. Or, like many native speakers, we can make metalinguistic assertions about the rules of our language which are not at all borne out by the way we actually speak and comprehend our mother tongue. Knowledge of a language, in this metalinguistic sense of the word, can also be "right" or "wrong". We can have misconceptions about language, or we can have a view of grammar that accords with the facts. By way of contrast, the system operated subconsciously within our language module can never be right or wrong: it is just the way it is, the way it as has developed in us over time. Metalinguistic knowledge is not useless, however.  An essential part of education in many cultures is acquiring such consciously-accessible knowledge about language, and especially about the mother tongue. In MOGUL, however, this should not be confused with the implicit knowledge of language that drives language performance.

==MOGUL architecture in a nutshell==
In this figure, the MOGUL version of the cognitive system is sketched in simplified form. The circles or ovals represent specialised processors, and the rectangular boxes each represent the particular memory store of structures which they are designed to handle. Affective structures (AfS) are not differentiated in this figure. Also, for simplicity's sake, only five "senses" are portrayed in the POpS system. All languages are handled by the same syntactic and phonological processors, but different languages will involve both shared and unique ''syntactic structures'' (SS) and ''phonological structures'' (PS) residing in (respectively) their syntactic and phonological memory stores. Mental activity is characterised by the formation of chains or networks of structures across different modules. This is achieved by means of interface processors (the dotted arrows) following Jackendoff (1987). These are bimodular, in that they match elements in two adjacent modules; they can only access and link certain structural elements in one or the other module. Moreover, the matching is not a "translation" of one element into terms (the code) of another system; there is no exchange of information, merely a chaining of elements that can otherwise only be processed within its own particular processing unit or module.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9741">The term ''metafunction'' originates in [[systemic functional linguistics]] and is considered to be a property of all languages. [[Systemic functional linguistics]] is functional and semantic rather than formal and syntactic in its orientation. As a functional linguistic theory, it claims that both the emergence of grammar and the particular forms that grammars take should be explained “in terms of the functions that language evolved to serve”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1994. "Systemic Theory". In R.E. Asher (ed) ''Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'', Vol 8. Pergamon Press. Reprinted in full in Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. ''On Language and Linguistics: Volume 3 in the ''Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; While languages vary in how and what they do, and what humans do with them in the contexts of human cultural practice, all languages are considered to be shaped and organised in relation to three functions, or metafunctions. [[Michael Halliday]], the founder of systemic functional linguistics, calls these three functions the ''ideational'', ''interpersonal'', and ''textual''. The ideational function is further divided into the ''experiential'' and ''logical''.

Metafunctions are ''systemic clusters''; that is, they are groups of semantic systems that make meanings of a related kind. The three metafunctions are mapped onto the structure of the clause. For this reason, systemic linguists analyse a clause from three perspectives. Halliday argues that the concept of metafunction is one of a small set of principles that are necessary to explain how language works; this concept of function in language is necessary to explain the organisation of the semantic system of language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Function is considered to be "a fundamental property of language itself".&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ruqaiya Hasan]], the metafunctions in SFL "are not hierarchised; they have equal status, and each is manifested in every act of language use: in fact, an important task for grammatics is to describe how the three metafunctions are woven together into the same linguistic unit".&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan argues that this is one way in which Halliday's account of the functions of language is different from that of [[Karl Bühler]], for example, for whom functions of language are hierarchically ordered, with the referential function the most important of all. For Buhler, the functions were considered to operate one at a time. In SFL, the metafunctions operate simultaneously, and any utterance is a harmony of choices across all three functions.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideational function==
The ideational function is language concerned with building and maintaining a theory of experience. It includes&lt;!--comprises? Or is there something aside from the exper. and logical?--&gt; the experiential function and the logical function.

=== Experiential function ===
The experiential function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to make meanings about the world around us and inside us:

:"Most obviously, perhaps, when we watch small children interacting with the objects around them we can see that they are using language to construe a theoretical model of their experience. This is language in the experiential function; the patterns of meaning are installed in the brain and continue to expand on a vast scale as each child, in cahoots with all those around, builds up, renovates and keeps in good repair the semiotic “reality” that provides the framework of day-to-day existency and is manifested in every moment of discourse, spoken or listened to. We should stress, I think, that the grammar is not merely annotating experience; it is construing experience."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliday argues that it was through this process of humans making meaning from experience that language evolved. Thus, the human species had to “make sense of the complex world in which it evolved: to classify, or group into categories, the objects and events within its awareness”. These categories are not given to us through our senses; they have to be “construed”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1999. Grammar and the construction of educational knowledge. In The Language of Early Childhood. Volume 4 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;  In taking this position on the active role of grammar in construing “reality”, Halliday was influenced by [[Benjamin Lee Whorf|Whorf]].

===Logical function===
Halliday describes the logical function as those systems “which set up logical–semantic relationships between one clausal unit and another”&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The systems which come under the logical function are {{Sc|taxis}} and {{Smallcaps|logico-semantic relations}}. When two clauses are combined, a speaker chooses whether to give both clauses equal status, or to make one dependent on the other. In addition, a speaker choose some meaning relation in the process of joining or binding clauses together. Halliday argues that the meanings we make in such processes are most closely related to the experiential function. For this reason, he puts the experiential and logical functions together into the ideational function.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal function==
The interpersonal function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to enact their complex and diverse interpersonal relations. This tenet of [[systemic functional linguistics]] is based on the claim that a speaker not only talks about something, but is always talking to and with others. Language not only construes experience, but simultaneously acts out “the interpersonal encounters that are essential to our survival”.&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 16"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that these encounters:

:"range all the way from the rapidly changing microencounters of daily life – most centrally, semiotic encounters where we set up and maintain complex patterns of dialogue – to the more permanent institutionalized relationships that collectively constitute the social bond."&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 16"/&gt;

The grammatical systems that relate to the interpersonal function include &lt;!--Can these be not all-caps?--&gt;Mood, Modality, and Polarity.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]. London: Arnold.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual function==
Halliday argues that both experiential and interpersonal functions are intricately organized, but that between the two “there is comparatively very little constraint”. This means that “by and large, you can put any interactional ‘spin’ on any representational content”.&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"/&gt; What allows meanings from these two modes to freely combine is the intercession of a third, distinct mode of meaning that Halliday refers to as the textual function. The term encompasses all of the grammatical systems responsible for managing the flow of discourse. These systems “create coherent text – text that coheres within itself and with the context of situation” &lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"/&gt; They are both structural (involving choices relating to the ordering of elements in the clause), and non-structural (involving choices that create cohesive ties between units that have no structural bond). The relevant grammatical systems include Theme, Given and New,&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. Matthiessen. 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar].

The '''National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters Ltd''' (known as '''NAATI''') is the national standards and accreditation body for translators and [[Language interpretation|interpreters]] in Australia. NAATI's mission, as outlined in the NAATI Constitution, is to set and maintain high national standards in translating and interpreting to enable the existence of a pool of accredited translators and interpreters responsive to the changing needs and demography of the Australian community. The core focus of the company is issuing [[credential]]s (known as accreditations or recognitions) for practitioners who wish to work as translators and interpreters in Australia.

==Current Structure==
NAATI is a profit company that is jointly owned by the [[Commonwealth of Australia|Commonwealth]], [[States and territories of Australia|State and Territory]] governments of Australia. It is governed by a board of directors who are appointed by the members.

The members of NAATI are the nine [[Minister (government)|ministers]] who are responsible for multicultural affairs and/or [[citizenship]] in the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments. Members may appoint a representative to exercise any of their powers in relation to NAATI. These Member Representatives are separate to the NAATI board of directors.

The current members of NAATI include:

==Operational functions==
NAATI provides eight key services to assist individuals gain and maintain a credential to work as a translator or interpreter in Australia. These services include:

* Accreditation testing
* Skills assessments for migration purposes
There are two types of NAATI credentials – accreditation and recognition.

NAATI accreditation is an acknowledgement that an individual has demonstrated the ability to meet the professional standards required by the translation and interpreting industry. NAATI assesses practitioners and aspiring translators and interpreters against these standards so that English speaking and non-English speaking Australians can interact effectively with each other.

There are a couple of different ways you can gain NAATI accreditation, including:

NAATI recognition is granted in emerging languages or languages with very low community demand for which NAATI does not offer accreditation. The granting of NAATI recognition is an acknowledgement that an individual has recent and regular experience as a translator and/or interpreter with no defined skill level.

==Outline of NAATI credentials==
Under NAATI's current system, there are ten different types of credentials. These are listed in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Credential Name !! Pre-1992 Level !! Description
|-
| Conference Interpreter (Senior) || 5 || This is the highest level of NAATI interpreting accreditation. It reflects a level of excellence in conference interpreting, recognised through demonstrated extensive experience and international leadership. It encompasses and builds on the competencies of Conference Interpreter accreditation.
|-
| Advanced Translator (Senior) || 5 || This is the highest level of NAATI translating accreditation. It reflects a level of excellence in specialised translating, recognised through demonstrated extensive experience and international leadership. It encompasses and builds on the competencies of Advanced Translator accreditation.
|-
| Conference Interpreter || 4 (I) || This represents the level of competence required to handle complex, technical and sophisticated interpreting, in both consecutive and simultaneous modes, in line with recognised international practice. Conference interpreters operate in diverse situations including at conferences, high-level negotiations, court proceedings or may choose to specialise in a particular area(s).
|-
| Advanced Translator || 4 (T) || This represents the level of competence required to handle complex, technical and sophisticated translations in line with recognised international practice. Advanced Translators operate in diverse situations and may choose to specialise in a particular area(s) – including translating technical manuals, research papers, conferences, high-level negotiations and court proceedings.
|-
| Professional Interpreter || 3 (I) || This represents the minimum level of competence for professional interpreting and is the minimum level recommended by NAATI for work in most settings including banking, law, health, social and community services. Professional Interpreters are capable of interpreting across a wide range of semi-specialised situations and are capable of using the consecutive mode to interpret speeches or presentations.
|-
| Professional Translator || 3 (T) || This represents the minimum level of competence for professional translating and is the minimum level recommended by NAATI for work in settings including banking, law, health, social and community services. Translators at this level work across a wide range of subjects involving documents with specialised content.
|-
| Paraprofessional Interpreter || 2 (I) || This represents a level of competence in interpreting for the purpose of general conversations. Paraprofessional Interpreters generally undertake the interpretation of non-specialist dialogues. Practitioners at this level are encouraged to obtain Professional level accreditation if available.
|-
| Paraprofessional Translator || 2 (T) || This represents a level of competence enabling the production of a translation of non-specialised information (e.g. a birth certificate). Practitioners at this level are encouraged to obtain Professional level accreditation if available.
|-
| Recognised Interpreter || – || This credential is an acknowledgement that at the time of the award the applicant has had recent and regular work experience as an interpreter, but no level of proficiency is specified. Recognised interpreters are encouraged to obtain accreditation as it becomes available.
|-
| Recognised Translator || – || This credential is an acknowledgement that at the time of the award the applicant has had recent and regular work experience as a translator, but no level of proficiency is specified. Recognised translators are encouraged to obtain accreditation as it becomes available.

NAATI translator accreditation (professional level or higher) is usually awarded in one of the following directions:

* From a [[Languages Other Than English|Language other Than English]] (LOTE) into English; or
* From English into a LOTE; or
* Both directions.

NAATI interpreter accreditations (at all levels) are awarded in both directions.

Occasionally, NAATI has awarded accreditation in a language combination that does not feature English at the Conference Interpreter or Advanced Translator level e.g. Advanced Translator French to German or Conference Interpreter (Senior) French to/from Russian. This sort of accreditation can only be awarded on the basis of a professional membership of an international association such as [[International Association of Conference Interpreters|AIIC]] or AITC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5266">[[Image:new NVC logo small.jpg|right]]
The '''National Vocabulary Championship''' (NVC) was the first-ever U.S.-wide [[vocabulary]] competition for high school students created by [[Game Show Network|GSN]], in association with [[The Princeton Review]]. Thirty thousand high school students from across the United States participated in the inaugural year (2006-2007).

The NVC aimed to inspire students to expand their vocabularies and narrow the [[achievement gap]]. The program offered free educational resources, created spirited competition through testing and game play, and awarded more than $100,000 annually in college tuition and other prizes.

Fifty finalists nationally received a trip to the NVC Finals, where they competed to win $40,000 toward college tuition in the form of a [[529 plan]] and to be crowned the National Vocabulary Champion.

The host of the National Vocabulary Championship was GSN host [[Dylan Lane]].

The NVC was discontinued after the 2007-2008 academic and competition year due to changes in GSN policy and administration.

== How to Compete ==
The NVC was open to eligible high school students in the United States between the ages of 13 and 19 years old and in grades 9-12. [[Home schooling|Home-schooled]] students were also eligible to compete.

There were two ways to enter the competition:

Eligible students at participating schools in eight local markets could qualify to participate in a ''Citywide Championship'' for a chance to win $5,000 toward college tuition and other prizes, as well as a trip to the national finals.

Eligible students nationwide could also participate through a ''National Qualifying Competition'' via on-line and regional exams offered by The Princeton Review for a chance to compete in the NVC Finals.

==2007-2008 Citywide Championships==
Eight U.S. cities across the country were chosen each year to host Citywide Championship events. Eligible students who wanted to compete in one of the local Citywide Championships had to attend a participating high school, register with the designated NVC coach at their school, and take the NVC in-school qualifying exam. All public and private high schools within these markets and their surrounding areas were invited to participate and encourage their students to compete. Approximately 100 top scorers per market qualified to compete in each Citywide Championship, where one winner received $5,000 toward college tuition and other prizes as well as a trip to the national finals.

Below is a list of cities that the NVC visited in 2007-2008:
* Sacramento: Thursday, November 15 -- '''WINNER:''' Yvonne Lin (Sophomore) 
* Nashville: Tuesday, November 27 -- '''WINNER:''' Brian Swenson (Junior)
* St. Louis: Thursday, November 29  -- '''WINNER:''' Rajiv Tarigopula (Sophomore)
* Detroit: Monday, December 3 -- '''WINNER:''' Steven Banks (Senior)
* Northeast Ohio: Thursday, December 6 -- '''WINNER:''' Joel Fichter (Senior)
* New York: Monday, December 10 -- '''WINNER:''' Rebecca Maxfield (Junior)
* Pittsburgh: Monday, January 14 -- '''WINNER:''' John Oxenreiter (Senior)
* Philadelphia: Thursday, January 17 -- '''WINNER:''' Lauren Bezjak (Junior)

==National Qualifying Competition==
Eligible high school students who did not attend a participating school (listed under Citywide Championship) or who did not wish to take the in-school qualifying exam could compete in the National Qualifying Competition by following the below steps:
1) The NVC offered an online national qualifying exam during November 2007 at [http://www.winwithwords.com winwithwords.com]. For months leading up to the online exam, study tools and study modules were available at [http://www.winwithwords.com winwithwords.com]
Or:
2) Top-scoring students on the online national qualifying exam had an opportunity to advance to the regional exams, which took place at designated The Princeton Review locations across the country. Forty-two top scorers from the National Qualifying Competition joined the eight citywide champions at the national finals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26185">Because [[Canada]] has, for over two centuries, contained both English- and French-speakers, the question of the language used in the administration of public affairs has always been a sensitive issue.

Among the aspect of this issue that have excited public attention from time to time are: 
*the perception of fairness or unfairness in hiring and promoting speakers of one official language over speakers of the other;
*the choice of one language over the other for meetings, documents, and internal memoranda (which are sometimes collectively characterized as the work “environment”);
*the promotion of bilingual job candidates over people who only speak only one or the other of the two official languages;
*the availability (or lack of availability) of language training for public servants, who cannot advance without the ability to speak both languages;
*the costs associated with language-based hiring and promotion practices, including the practice of paying a “bilingual bonus” to public servants capable of speaking both official languages;
*the need to provide government services to some Canadians in English, and to others in French.

==Ratio of native English-speakers to native French-speakers==

The issue of proportional hiring and promotion of speakers of both official languages has been an issue in Canadian politics since before Confederation. Members of each linguistic group have, at different times in the country’s history, complained of injustice when their group have been represented, in public service hiring and promotion, in numbers less than would be justified by their proportion of the national population.

For the greater part of Canada’s history, French-speakers were underrepresented, and English-speakers were overrepresented in the ranks of the public service. This disproportion became more pronounced in the more senior ranks of the Public Service. However, this trend has reversed itself in recent decades. Today, French is the first official language of 23% of Canada's population,&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada Census 2011 data. "http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/98-314-x/2011003/tbl/tbl3_1-1-eng.cfm"&lt;/ref&gt; with 29.2% of Public Service of Canada employees identifying French as their first official language,&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Annual Report on Official Languages 2010-2011. "http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/res/stats/demo11-eng.asp#toc01.2.c"&lt;/ref&gt; including 32% of management-level jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Annual Report on Official Languages 2010-2011. "http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/reports-rapports/ol-lo/10-11/arol-ralo/arol-ralo06-eng.asp#toc5.0"&lt;/ref&gt;

The first high-profile complaint of preferential hiring took place in 1834. One of the [[Ninety-Two Resolutions]] of the [[Lower Canada|Lower Canadian]] House of Assembly drew attention to the fact that French Canadians, who at the time were 88% of the colony's population, held only 30% of the posts in the 157-member colonial civil service. Moreover, the resolution stated, French Canadians were, "for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those [British immigrants] who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices...."&lt;ref&gt;'''Resolution 75.''' ''Resolved, That the number of the Inhabitants of the country being about 600,000, those of French origin are about 525,000, and those of British or other origin 75,000; and that the establishment of the civil government of Lower Canada, for the year 1832, accordingly to the yearly returns made by the Provincial Administration, for the information of the British Parliament, contained the names of 157 officers and others receiving salaries, who are apparently of British or foreign origin and the names of 47 who are, apparently, natives of the country, of French origin; that this statement does not exhibit the whole disproportion which exists in the distribution of the public money and power, the latter class being, for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices; that the accumulation of many of the best paid and most influential, and at the same time incompatible, offices in the same person, which is forbidden by the laws and by sound policy, exists especially for the benefit of the former class; and that two-thirds of the persons included in the last commission of the peace issued in the province, are apparently of British or foreign origin, and one-third only of French origin.''&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[responsible government]] in the 1840s, the power to make civil service appointments was transferred to elected politicians, who had a strong incentive to ensure that French Canadian voters did not feel that they were being frozen out of hiring and promotions. Although no formal reform of the hiring and promotion process was ever undertaken, the patronage-driven hiring process seems to have produced a more equitable representation of the two language groups. In 1863, the public service of the united [[Province of Canada]] (which included both of the former colonies of [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]]) had grown to include 450 officials at its administrative headquarters. Of these, 161 persons, or about 36%, were French Canadians. However, French-speaking civil servants accounted for only 20% of the total payroll, suggesting that they were mainly confined to the lower ranks of the colonial administration.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Hodgetts ''Pioneer Public Service: An Administrative History of the United Canadas, 1841-1867.'' Toronto: Canadian Government Series, no. 7, 1955, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between 1867 and the turn of the Twentieth Century, French-Canadians made up about one-third of the Canadian population, and seem also to have represented about one-third of civil service appointments at junior levels, although they had only about half that much representation at most senior level.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Forsey]] writes: “In the Dominion Civil Service, Côté’s ''Political Appointments'', 1867-1895, shows that, over that period, eliminating duplications, the French Canadians had rather over a third of the official of the House and of the two Dominion Courts; rather less than a third of other officials of the rank of Deputy Minister and, of the officials from Chief Clerk up to Deputy Minister rather less than one-seventh.”
Source—Eugene Forsey, ''Freedom and Order: Collected Essays.'' Ottawa: Carleton University Press, 1974, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, it seems to have been the case that throughout the entire period between Confederation and the introduction of merit-based hiring and promotion in 1919, the percentage of French-speakers in the civil service relatively closely matched their percentage of the Canadian population because French-Canadians occupied a more-or-less proportionate share of cabinet posts, and they appointed public servants who were personally loyal to them. This so-called "[[spoils system]]" ensured a rough equity between members of the two language groups. A quarter-century after this system had been abolished, it was summarized as follows in a submission to the 1946 [[Royal Commission on Administrative Classifications in the Civil Service]]:

{{cquote|Before 1919, positions in the bureaucracy were distributed, in large measure, under a patronage system (spoils system) even though some efforts at reform had been put in place and had introduced a degree of permanence in head offices. French-speaking statesmen, just like their [English-speaking] colleagues, were therefore able to obtain their share of the patronage. General administration was not very complicated in those days and ministers could personally take charge of administering the internal organization of their respective departments, as it was possible to personally know every one of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Chambre de Commerce du District de Montréal, ''Mémoire soumis à la Commission Royale d'Enquête sur le Service Civil Fédéral''. April, 1946, p. 14. The original passage is in French, but the words "spoils system" are in English in the original.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1918, just before the reforms began, the percentage of francophones in the [[Public Service of Canada|federal civil service]] stood at just under 22%. The drop in the percentage of French-speakers was in part due to the fact that the proportion of Canadians who were French-speaking was gradually declining; in the 1921 census, persons of French origin were down to 27.9% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard Joy, ''Canada's Official Languages: The Progress of Bilingualism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1992, p. 121 (Table 20).&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] government then in power had almost no representation in Quebec, which meant that for several years there were no French-Canadian ministers appointing and promoting their fellow French-speakers.

The percentage of French-speakers would, however, drop much further as a result of the replacement of a patronage-based appointment system with a merit-based system that was largely based upon the ability to perform efficiently in English. By 1946, according to figures presented in the House of Commons, native speakers of French had declined to only 13% of public service posts.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, House of Commons Debates, 1946, 2nd Session, IV, 3520.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, French-speakers represented slightly under 30% of the Canadian population.&lt;ref&gt;In the 1941 census, French was the mother tongue of 29.2% of Canada's population. See Richard Joy, ''Canada's Official Languages: The Progress of Bilingualism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1992, p. 120 (Table 19).&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to have represented the low point, in terms of inequitably low representation for Francophones within the Public Service; by 1964, French-speakers had risen to 21.5% of the Public Service (which itself had grown to 137,000 officials, meaning that 29,500 French-speakers were employed by the federal government).&lt;ref&gt;Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism’', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969), Table 49, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this represented a substantial improvement, French-speakers at this time represented about 28% of Canada’s population, and therefore continued to be underrepresented. Moreover, French-Canadians continued to be grouped at the bottom of the seniority scale: They represented 23.7% of junior employees earning less than $4,000 per year, but only 10.4% of senior officials with earnings in the highest category (over $15,000).&lt;ref&gt;Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism'', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969), Figure 9, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1960s, the issue of Canada’s seemingly perpetual inability to create an equitable distribution of jobs in the country’s rapidly expanding public service was becoming a key grievance underlying [[Quebec nationalism]].  In 1961, a [[Glasscoe Commission|Royal Commission studying the structure of the federal bureaucracy]] organized a special committee to study the issue of bilingualism within the Public Service. The Commission’s 1962 report included recommendations that the federal government “adopt active measures to develop bilingual capacities among its employees on a selective basis,” and that it more actively recruit qualified French Canadians who would have the potential to advance to the senior ranks of the federal administration.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Government Organization'', vol. I (Ottawa, 1962), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part on the basis of this recommendation, the government of Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]] established a [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]], which made language reform within the public service one of its highest priorities.  Book III of the Royal Commission’s multi-volume report, published in 1969, recommended a radical redesign of the Public Service of Canada, in order to establish full equality between the two official languages in the federal administration, and a permanently equitable distribution of jobs, at all levels of seniority, between French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism'', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent increase in ratio of native French-speakers===
Since the report of the Royal Commission in 1969, the percentage of Francophones in the public service of Canada has increased, and the percentage of Anglophones has decreased.  Both Francophones and Anglophones are overrepresented in the public service due to the number of Canadians who speak neither English nor French.

When looking at public service positions in various regions of the country, the same trend has occurred; however it is much less pronounced outside of the national capital region surrounding Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec.

===Increased Francophone representation in management positions===
Francophone representation in management positions in the Public Service has increased from 10.4% in 1964 to 18% in 1978 and to 30% in 2007.&lt;ref name="Rep by category"&gt;Data on representation of Anglophones and Francophones in the Public Service of Canada:

===Increased number of ‘bilingual imperative’ positions===
Positions in the public service are classified in four ways, depending on the required linguistic capacity of the candidate for the position: bilingual imperative, English essential, French essential or either French or English essential. The bilingual imperative category is further broken down into the level of both languages the candidate is required to speak.  Since 1989 there has been a sharp increase in the number of positions classified as ‘bilingual imperative’ and a sharp decrease in the number of positions open to unilingual Canadians.

==Current situation==
Today, the built-in barriers to the hiring and promotion of francophones have been overcome. French-speakers ceased to be underrepresented in the Public Service in 1978, and the percentage of public servants who are francophones has been growing steadily ever since. At the management level, French-speakers ceased to be under-represented in 1995. There is now a growing over-representation of persons with French as their first official language in the Public Service. In 2007, francophones occupied 31.5% of positions in the core public administration, and 26.9% in institutions subject to the ''Official Languages Act'', overall.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt; Bilingualism is desirable for politicians; [[John Turner]]'s fluency in both English and French, for example, helped him become [[leader of the Liberal Party of Canada|leader of the Liberal Party]] and Prime Minister in 1984.&lt;ref name="martin19840618"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/18/world/man-in-the-news-new-leader-for-canada-john-napier-turner.html | title=New Leader for Canada: John Napier Turner | work=The New York Times | date=1984-06-18 | accessdate=11 September 2015 | author=Martin, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, positions in the core public administration broke down as follows:

"Bilingual" - 40.2%
"English Essential" - 51.2%
"French Essential" - 4.0%
"English or French Essential" - 4.4%&lt;ref name=2006Report&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report on Official Languages 2006-2007|url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/rp/0607ol05-eng.asp|publisher=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat|date=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2008-09 annual report, the Commissioner for Official Languages wrote, "A vast majority of federal institutions have yet to create a workplace where their employees feel comfortable using either official language and are encouraged to do so." He identified the following problem areas:

* "French is not used as much as it should be as a language of work in federal offices located in the National Capital Region and outside Quebec."
* "French does not have its rightful place in communications between the federal government’s head offices and its regional offices in Quebec."
* "English remains underused as a language of work in the Quebec offices of federal institutions."&lt;ref name="2008Report-chap2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/html/ar_ra_2008_09_p7_e.php|title=Chapter 2: Vision, Leadership and Commitment: Fundamentals of the Full Implementation of the Act|date=2009-05-25|work=Annual Report 2008-2009 |publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lack of language proficiency on the part of some managers may contribute to the situation. The Commissioner wrote in his report: "Some managers hinder the use of the minority language, either because they are not proficient enough in the language or because they hesitate to use it. Similarly, Francophones fearing that their professional contribution will not be fully recognized tend to work in English when their superiors do not use French daily and do not stress the importance of using it."&lt;ref name="2008Report-chap2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4246">An '''open-ended question''' cannot be answered with a "yes" or "no" response, or with a static response. Open-ended questions are phrased as a statement which requires a response. The response can be compared to information that is already known to the questioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ackley | first = Betty | title = Nursing diagnosis handbook : an evidence-based guide to planning care | publisher = Mosby | location = Maryland Heights, Mo | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780323071505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of open-ended questions:
*Tell me about your relationship with your supervisor.  
*How do you see your future?
*Tell me about the children in this photograph.
*What is the purpose of government?
*Why did you choose that answer?
*Tap?

== Education: open questioning ==
The received wisdom in education is that open questions are broadly speaking ‘good’ questions. They invite students to give longer responses that demonstrate their understanding. They are preferable to [[Closed-ended question|closed questions]] (i.e. one that demands a yes/no answer) because they are better for discussions or enquiries, whereas closed questions are only good for knowledge testing. 

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are “grammatically closed, but conceptually open”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2016-12-03|title=Ariadne’s Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in standard parlance, ‘is it ever right to lie?’ would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes/no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes/no answer to it can be ‘opened up’ by the questioner (‘why do you think that?,’ ‘Could there be an instance where that’s not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry. 

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, “gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=2017-04-19|work=Tes|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Closed questions, simply require ‘opening up’ strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential. 

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention 'Open Questioning Mindset', or OQM. OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student’s contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls ‘guess what’s in my head’ teaching, that relies on [[Closed-ended question|closed]] and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2015-11-29|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Orality''' is [[thought]] and verbal expression in societies where the technologies of [[literacy]] (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.  The study of orality is closely allied to the study of [[oral tradition]].  

The term “orality” has been used in a variety of ways, often to describe, in a generalised fashion, the structures of consciousness found in cultures that do not employ, or employ minimally, the technologies of writing. 

[[Walter J. Ong]]’s work was foundational for the study of orality, and reminds us that despite the striking success and subsequent power of written language, the vast majority of languages are never written, and  the basic orality of language is permanent.{{sfn|Cronin|Crosson|Eastlake|2009|p=5}} 

In his later publications Ong distinguishes between two forms of orality: 'primary orality' and 'secondary orality'. Primary orality is thought and expression un-touched by the culture of writing of print; ''[[secondary orality]]'' is explained by Ong as oral culture defined by (implicitly influenced) by the written and printed word, and includes oral culture made possible by technology such as a [[newscaster]] reading a news report on television.

In addition, 'residual orality' is also defined - it is the remnants, legacy, or influence of a predominately oral culture carried over into the written realm - an example might include the use of [[dialogue]] as a philosophical or didactic tool in written literature, such as used by the Greek thinker [[Plato]].

== Origins of philosophy and definition  ==

===Impact of literacy on culture===
Before writing became a way for many [[cultures]] before we had orality. Unfortunately many of the retained orality has been lost or drastically changed. Those that were able to be preserved gives us insight to past cultures and just how much we have evolved since then.&lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Orality and Literacy'' (2nd ed. {{harvnb|Ong|2002}}), Ong sums up his own work over the previous three decades as well as the work of numerous other scholars. With regard to oral tradition and primary orality he  draws on pioneering work by [[Milman Parry]], [[Albert B. Lord]], and [[Eric A. Havelock]]. [[Marshall McLuhan]] was among the first to fully appreciate the significance of the Ong's earlier work about print culture and the [[written and printed word]] as a [[technology]].  In his work ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' {{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}} McLuhan quotes and discusses works by Ong in the 1950s regarding print culture.{{sfn|McLuhan|1962|pp= 104, 129, 146, 159–60, 162–63, 168, 174–76}}; Orality gave us the stepping stones that allowed us to get where we are today, it was a necessity for the growth of civilization. &lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;But using his own examples to amplify Ong's thought, McLuhan shows how each stage in the development of this technology throughout the [[history of communication]] – from the invention of speech (primary orality), to [[pictograms]],  to the [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]], to [[typography]], to the electronic communications of today – restructures human consciousness, profoundly changing not only the frontiers of human possibility, but even the frontiers it is possible for humans to imagine.

===Primary orality===
'Primary orality' refers to thought and its verbal expression within cultures "totally untouched by any knowledge of [[writing]] or [[Printing|print]]."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=11}}

All [[sound]] is inherently powerful. If a hunter kills a lion he can see it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because the sound of the lion signals its presence and its power. [[Speech communication|Speech]] is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p= 32}}

Writing is powerful in a different way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex ideas and the [[institution]]s that depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas over a long period of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using [[mnemonic]] tools.

In his studies of the [[Homeric Question]], [[Milman Parry]] was able to show that the poetic metre found in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' had been 'packaged' by oral [[Greece|Greek]] society to meet its information management needs. These insights first opened the door to a wider appreciation of the sophistication of [[oral tradition]]s, and their various methods of managing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first = Adam | editor-last = Parry | title = The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry | publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford| year = 1971|page = 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ancient and medieval mnemonic tools were extensively documented by [[Frances Yates]] in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]''.{{harv|Yates|1966}}

===Residual orality===
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Socrates in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', quoting the prophecy of [[Amun|Ammon]] (Thamus) : ''"[Writing] will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. [..] You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom.."'' (trans. H.N. Fowler; Line 275)]]
‘Residual orality’ refers to thought and its verbal expression in cultures that have been exposed to writing and print, but have not fully ‘interiorized’ (in McLuhan’s term) the use of these technologies in their daily lives.  As a culture interiorizes the technologies of literacy, the ‘oral residue’ diminishes.

But the availability of a technology of literacy to a society is not enough to ensure its widespread diffusion and use.  For example, [[Eric Havelock]] observed in ''A Preface to Plato'' that after the [[ancient Greeks]] invented writing they adopted a [[scribe|scribal]] culture that lasted for generations.  Few people, other than the scribes, considered it necessary to learn to read or write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Havelock | first = Eric A.| title = A Preface to Plato | publisher =  Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts| year =1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other societies, such as [[ancient Egypt]] or [[medieval Europe]], literacy has been a domain confined to political and religious elites.

Many cultures have experienced an equilibrium state in which writing and mass illiteracy have co-existed for hundreds or even thousands of years.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp= 92–93}}

Oral residue rarely disappears quickly and never vanishes completely.  [[Speech communication|Speech]] is inherently an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts.  Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly shown in the arguments of [[Socrates]] against writing in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]''.  Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman.  It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the [[human mind]] into mere objects in the physical world.  By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what they are able to think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory.  True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds.  And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the same thing over and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=78–79}}

The Canadian communications scholar, [[Harold Innis]] argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece in Plato's time. Plato conveyed his ideas by writing down the conversations of Socrates thus "preserving the power of the spoken word on the written page." [[Aristotle]], Innis wrote, regarded Plato's style as "halfway between poetry and prose." Plato was able to arrive at new philosophical positions "through the use of dialogues, allegories and illustrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harold | first = Innis | title = Empire and Communications | location= Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press | year = 1950 | pages = 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as McLuhan emphasizes, modernization attenuates some oral capabilities.  For example, in medieval Europe silent reading was largely unknown.  This tilted the readers' attention towards the poetic and other auditory aspects of the text.  Educated modern adults may also occasionally long for something like "the capacious medieval memory, which, untrammeled by the associations of print, could learn a strange language with ease and by the methods of a child, and could retain in memory and reproduce lengthy epic and elaborate lyric poems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=McLuhan|edition=1962| first=H.J. | last =Chaytor | title = From Script to Print|publisher=  Heffer and Sons|location= Cambridge| year= 1945| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLuhan and Ong also document the apparent re-emergence, in the electronic age, of a kind of '[[secondary orality]]' that displaces written words with audio/visual technologies like [[radio]], [[telephones]], and [[television]].  Unlike primary oral modes of communication, these technologies depend on print for their existence.  Mass Internet collaborations, such as Wikipedia, rely primarily on writing, but re-introduce relationships and responsiveness into the text.

===Importance of the concept===
:''For more details on the social, economic and other effects of literacy or illiteracy see [[Literacy]]''
It has been a habit of literate cultures to view oral cultures simply in terms of their lack of the technologies of writing. This habit, argues Ong, is dangerously misled. Oral cultures are living cultures in their own right. A 1971 study found that of 3,000 extant languages, only 78 had a written [[literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmonson, Monro E.|title=Lore: An Introduction to the Science of Folklore and Literature|publisher= Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|location= New York|date= 1971|pages= 323, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; While literacy extends human possibilities in both thought and action, all literate technologies ultimately depend on the ability of humans to learn oral languages and then translate sound into symbolic imagery.

Understanding between nations may depend to some degree on understanding oral culture. Ong argues that "many of the contrasts often made between 'western' and other views seem reducible to contrasts between deeply interiorized literacy and more or less residually oral states of consciousness."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=29}}

==Theory of the characteristics of oral culture==
Drawing on hundreds of studies from [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]] and the study of [[oral tradition]], Ong summarizes ten key aspects of the '[[psychodynamics]] of orality'. While these are subject to continuing debate, his list remains an important milestone. Ong draws his examples from both primary oral societies, and societies with a very high 'oral residue'.

===Formulaic styling===
To retain complex ideas requires that they be packaged memorably for easy recall.

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| To solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence. Your thoughts must come into being in heavily rhythmic, balanced patterns, in repetitions or antithesis, in alliterations or assonances, in epithetic and other formulary expressions… Serious thought is intertwined with memory systems.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=34}}
|}

Anthropologist [[Marcel Jousse]] identifies a close linkage between [[rhythm]] and breathing patterns, gestures and the bilateral symmetry of the human body in several ancient verse traditions.{{sfn|Ong|2002|loc=p.34 citing {{harv|Jousse|1978}} }} This synergy between the body and the construction of oral thought further fuels memory.

===Additive rather than subordinative===
Oral cultures avoid complex 'subordinative' clauses. Ong cites an example from the [[Douay-Rheims]] version of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (1609–10), noting that this basic additive pattern (in ''italics'') has been identified in many oral contexts around the world:{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=37}}

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning God created heaven and earth. ''And'' the earth was void and empty, ''and'' darkness was on the face of the deep; ''and'' the spirit of God moved over the waters. ''And'' God said …
|}

Demonstrating how oral modes of communication tend to evolve into literate ones, Ong additionally cites the [[New American Bible]] (1970), which offers a translation that is grammatically far more complex:

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters. Then God said …
|}

===Aggregative rather than analytic===
Oral expression brings words together in pithy phrases that are the product of generations of evolution: the 'sturdy oak tree', the 'beautiful princess' or 'clever Odysseus'. This does not apply specifically to [[poetry]] or [[song]]; rather the words are brought together out of habit during general communication. 'Analyzing' or breaking apart such expressions is risky: they represent the work of generations and "there is nowhere outside the mind to store them."

Ong cites an American example, noting that in some parts of the [[United States]] with heavy oral residue, until the early twentieth-century it was still considered normal or even obligatory to use the adjective ‘glorious’ when referring to the '[[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]'.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=39}}

===Redundant or 'copious'===
Speech that repeats earlier thoughts or thought-pictures, or shines a different light on them somehow, helps to keep both the speaker and the listener focused on the topic, and makes it easier for all to recall the key points later. "Oral cultures encourage fluency, fulsomeness, volubility. Rhetoricians were to call this [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]]"{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=40}}

===Conservative or traditionalist===
Because oral societies have no effective access to writing and print technologies, they must invest considerable energy in basic [[information management]]. Storage of information, being primarily dependent on individual or collective recall, must be handled with particular thrift. It is possible to approximately measure oral residue "from the amount of memorization the culture's educational procedures require."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first =Jack|editor-last =  Goody| at = introduction, pp.13-14 | title = Literacy in traditional societies | publisher =  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge | year = 1968  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This creates incentives to avoid exploring new ideas and particularly to avoid the burden of having to store them. It does not prevent oral societies from demonstrating dynamism and change, but there is a premium on ensuring that changes cleave to traditional formulas, and "are presented as fitting the traditions of the ancestors."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=42}}

===Close to the human lifeworld===
Oral cultures take a practical approach to information storage. To qualify for storage, information must usually concern matters of immediate practical concern or familiarity to most members of the society.

Long after the invention of writing, and often long after the invention of print, basic information on how to perform a society’s most important trades was left unwritten, passed from one generation to the next as it always had been: through [[apprenticeship]], observation and practice.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=43}}

By contrast, only literary cultures have launched phenomenological analyses, abstract classifications, ordered lists and tables, etc. Nothing analogous exists in oral societies.

===Agonistically toned===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|left|thumb|Beowulf fights the dragon: the oral world is agonistic]]
'Agonistic' means 'combative', but Ong actually advances a deeper thesis with this point. Writing and to an even greater extent print, he argues, disengage humans from direct, interpersonal struggle.

Products of "the highly polarized, agonistic, oral world of good and evil, virtue and vice, villains and heroes," the great works of [[oral literature]] from [[Homer]] to [[Beowulf]], from the [[Mwindo epic]] to the [[Old Testament]], are extremely violent by modern standards. They are also punctuated by frequent and intense intellectual combat and tongue-lashings on the one hand, and effusive praise (perhaps reaching its height among [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[griot|praise singers]]) on the other.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=43–45}}

===Empathetic and participatory===
In an oral culture the most reliable and trusted technique for learning is to share a "close, empathetic, communal association" with others who know.

Ong cites a study of community decision-making from 12th Century [[England]]. Writing already had a long history in England, and it would have been possible to use texts to establish for example, the age of majority of the heir to an estate. But people were skeptical about texts, noting not only the cost of generating and managing them, but the problems involved in preventing tampering or frauds.

As a result, they retained the traditional solution: gathering together "mature wise seniors of many years, having good testimony", and publicly discussing the age of the heir with them, until agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = M.T. |last = Clanchy | title = From Memory to Written Record, England 1066–1307 | publisher =  Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts | year =  1979 | pages = 230–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hallmark principle of orality, that truth emerges best from communal process, resonates today in the [[jury]] system.

===Homeostatic===
Oral societies conserve their limited capacity to store information, and retain the relevance of their information to the interest of their present members, by shedding memories that have lost their past significance.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|pp=31–34}}

While many examples exist, the classic example was reported by {{harvnb|Goody|Watt|1968}}. Written records prepared by the British in [[Ghana]] in the early 1900s show that [[Ndewura Jakpa]], the seventeenth century founder of the state of the [[Gonja people]], had seven sons, each of whom ruled a territorial division within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised to recount that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|p=33}} Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.

===Situational rather than abstract===
In oral cultures, concepts are used in a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker. A study by [[Alexander Luria]], a psychologist who did extensive fieldwork comparing oral and literate subjects in remote areas of [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kirghizia]] in 1931–2&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Aleksandr Romanovich | last = Luria | title = Cognitive Development: Its Social and Cultural Foundations| editor-first = Michael |editor-last = Cole| translator-first =Martin | translator-last = Lopez-Morillas |translator-first2 = Lynn | translator-last2= Solotaroff |publisher = Harvard University Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London| year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented the highly situational nature of oral thinking.

* Oral subjects always used real objects they were familiar with to refer to geometric shapes; for example a plate or the moon might be used to refer to a circle.
* Asked to select three similar words from the following list "hammer, saw, log, hatchet", oral subjects would reject the literate solution (removing the log to produce a list of 3 tools), pointing out that without the log there wasn't much use for the tools.
* Oral subjects took a practical, not an abstract, approach to syllogisms. Luria asked them this question. ''In the far north, where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is always snow there. What colour are the bears?'' Typical response: "I don't know. I've seen a black bear. I've never seen any others. … Every locality has its own animals."
* Oral subjects proved unwilling to analyze themselves. When asked "what sort of person are you?" one responded: "What can I say about my own heart? How can I talk about my character? Ask others; they can tell you about me. I myself can’t say anything."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=49–54}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3868">A '''passive speaker''' (also referred to as a '''receptive bilingual''' or '''passive bilingual''') is a [[speaker types|category of speaker]] who has had enough exposure to a language in childhood to have a [[native speaker|native-like]] comprehension of it, but has little or no active command of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leap|first=W|date=1998|title=Indian language renewal|url=|journal=Human Organization|volume=47|pages=283–291|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such passively fluent individuals are often raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Basham, Charlotte; Fathman, Ann (19 December 2008). "The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language". ''International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism''. '''11''' (5): 577–597. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1080%2F13670050802149192 10.1080/13670050802149192].&lt;/ref&gt;

Such speakers are especially common in [[language shift]] communities where speakers of a declining language do not acquire active competence. Around 10% of the [[Ainu people]] who speak the language are considered passive speakers. Passive speakers are often targeted in [[language revival]] efforts to increase the number of speakers of a language quickly, as they are likely to gain active and near-native speaking skills more quickly than those with no knowledge of the language. They are also found in areas where people grow up hearing another language outside their family with no formal education.

==Passive language==
A ''passive language'' is a related term used in interpreting or translating. It is the language or languages '''from''' which the interpreter works. For example if an interpreter's job is to translate from German, Dutch and Swedish into French, then French is the active language while the others are passive.

== Language attitudes ==
A more common term for the phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual' in which people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judged as not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare. One's fluency of a bilingual in a languages is domain-specific: it depends on what each language is used for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|page=21|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language although there are social (extralinguistic) factors that underlie their different competencies.

== Basque Country ==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co-official status of [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to become a working reality. As there are now many monolingual Spanish-speakers, and no monolingual Basque-speakers in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], there is little reason for those fluent in Basque to speak it, regardless of the domain, circumstance or interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|date=2009|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|volume=26|pages=229–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2784">A '''performative contradiction''' ({{lang-de|performativer Widerspruch}}) arises when the [[proposition]]al content of a statement contradicts the [[presupposition]]s of asserting it. An example of a performative contradiction is the statement "I am dead" because the very act of proposing it presupposes the actor is alive.

== Usage in philosophy ==
[[Solipsism]] is often held to be a performative contradiction if stated. If not stated it is usually considered an example of the normative application of ''[[Silence procedure|qui tacet consentire videtur]] carborundum'' (He who remains silent vigorously consents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Man For All Seasons |first=Robert |last=Bolt }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jürgen Habermas]] and related philosophers point out that statements spoken during justificatory argumentation carry additional presuppositions and so certain statements are performative contradictions in this context. Habermas claims that [[post-modernism]]'s [[epistemological relativism]] suffers from a performative contradiction. [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] claims in his theory of [[argumentation ethics]] that arguing for any political position other than [[free-market anarchism]] results in a performative contradiction.&lt;ref name="hanshoppe2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoppe |first=Hans-Hermann  |title=The Ultimate Justification of Private Property |journal=Liberty |date=September 1988 |volume=1|page=20 |url=http://www.hanshoppe.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/hoppe_ult_just_liberty.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] more rigorously fleshed out the notion of performative contradiction in analyzing [[Descartes]]' famous ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' argument, concluding that ''cogito ergo sum'' relies on performance rather than logical inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cogito, Ergo Sum: Inference or Performance? |first=Jaakko |last=Hintikka |journal=The Philosophical Review |volume=71 |issue=1 |year=1962 |pages=3–32 |jstor=2183678 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Production support''' is the practices and disciplines of supporting the [[Information technology|IT]] systems/applications which are currently being used by the [[User_(computing)#End_user|end user]]s. A production support person/team is responsible for receiving incidents and requests from [[end-user]]s, analyzing these and either responding to the end user with a solution or escalating it to the other IT teams.  These teams may include [[Software developer|developer]]s, [[system engineer]]s and [[database administrator]]s.

==The importance of production support==
In order to understand the importance of production support, one needs to take a few factors into account.
* Studies have found that the maintenance cost of [[software]] is more than 90% of the total cost.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* We also know that software spends much more time in production than development because it needs to verify the properties{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}.
* The maintenance cost of the hardware.

From the factors listed above, one can see that the way in which production support is managed is extremely crucial.

== Production Support Steps ==
The major steps for Production Support are as below. These Production Support steps are in context of the [[Batch processing]].

=== Recording Production Error ===
Usually a batch job or group of related batch jobs (schedule/stream) runs to accomplish one or more business functions. These batch jobs run unattended and normally complete without any errors or issues. However, sometimes the batch job can have a break/interruption/abend/abort. There could be several reasons why a job could abend.

When a job abends, it can send out an automated alert notification via e-mail, page, text. Also, data center or operations team is also actively monitoring the jobs. They also send alert notification using e-mail, page, text or they can call the on call person responsible for the recovery of the abended job.

The on call person acknowledges the e-mail, page, text or phone call for the abended job. The on call person also records the abended job details in a production issue tracking system. Sometimes, the abended job automatically records the job abend details along with job standard list (job log) in a production issue tracking system. The abended job details (job standard list, error log files, etc.) are available in the production job scheduler tool. The Production issue tracking tool creates a request number and this request number is given to the support team. This request number is used to track the progress of the production support issue. The request is assigned to on call support team person.

=== Notification of Production Error ===
For critical Production Errors (e.g. Production job is in critical path and is likely to delay the batch completion [[Service-level_agreement|SLAs]] and if the Production error is impacting business data), an e-mail is sent to entire organization or impacted teams so that they are aware of the issue. They are also provided with the estimated time for Production error recovery.

=== Investigation or Analysis of Production Error ===
The Production support team on call person collects all the necessary information about the Production error. This information is then recorded in the Production error tracking tool using the correct support request number previously assigned. All the details such as data, environment, process, program logic that failed is used in the investigation. Production batch job, program used or any tool/utility used is reviewed for any possible errors.

=== Resolution of Production Error ===
If similar Production error occurred in the past then the issue resolution steps are retrieved from the support knowledge base and error is resolved using those steps. If it is a new Production error then new Production error resolution steps are created and Production error is resolved. The new Production error resolution steps are recorded in the knowledge base for the future usage. For major Production errors (critical infrastructure or application failures), a phone conference call is initiated and all required support persons/teams join the call and they all work together to resolve the error. This is also called as an Incident Management. If a problem occurs repeatedly then it is recorded and tracked using appropriate tools and processes until it is resolved permanently. This is also called as Problem Management. The issue is closed only after the customer or end user agrees that the problem is resolved.

=== Production job/program code correction ===
If the Production error occurred due to programming errors then a request is created for the Development team to correct programming errors. Problem is identified, defined and root cause analysis is performed. The programming error is fixed using normal SDLC process - analysis/design/programming/QA/testing/release. The new version of the Production job/program is deployed and verified/validated.

=== Production Process correction ===
If the Production error occurred due to job/schedule dependency issues or sequence issues then further analysis is done to find the correct sequence/dependencies. The new sequence/dependencies are verified and validated in [[test environment]] before Production deployment.

=== Infrastructure Issue correction ===
If the Production error occurred due to infrastructure issues then the specific infrastructure team is notified. The infrastructure team then implements permanent fix for the issue and monitors the infrastructure to avoid same error again.

== Production Support Billing ==
If the Production error occurred due to unexpected consequences of infrastructure changes then most often the infrastructure team is not able to bill the time spent in resolving of the issue at the full rate. In some cases hours are completely disqualified from being billed.

== Production Support - Follow up and Reporting ==
The Production error tracking system is used to review all issues periodically (daily, weekly and monthly) and reports are generated to monitor resolved issues, repeating issues, pending issues. Reports are also generated for the IT/IS management for improvement and management of Production jobs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1487">In the [[Neo-Gricean]] approach to [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]] advanced by [[Yale]] linguist [[Laurence Horn]], the R-Principle ("R" for "Relation") is a reformulation of [[Paul Grice]]'s Maxim of Relation (''see'' [[Gricean maxims]]) combining with the second sub-maxim of Quantity and the third and fourth sub-maxims of Manner.&lt;ref name=Horn1989&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horn |first1=Laurence |title=A Natural History of Negation |date=1989|publisher=The University of Chicago press |location=Chicago, IL |pages=193-203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R-Principle states: "Say no more than you must (given Q)." As such it interacts with the [[Q-principle]], which states: "Say as much as you can (given R)." &lt;ref name = SEP&gt; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/ "Implicature"] in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] .&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = ECS&gt; [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0470018860.s00233/full "The Gricean Model"] in the Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science. &lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the R-Principle, there is no reason to make a stronger statement (say more) if the extra information can be contributed by implicature. For instance, the inference from "He broke a finger" to "He broke a finger of his own" is an R-based inference, i.e. deriving from the R-Principle, since the economy of expression implies that a more informative statement was not needed. &lt;ref name = SEP /&gt;

'''Ronde''' (''round'' in French) is a kind of script in which the heavy strokes are nearly upright, giving the characters when taken together a round look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |year=1913 |title=Webster's Dictionary |trans-title= |url= |access-date=|dead-url= |format= |language=English |location= |publisher= |page= |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronde script appeared in France at the end of the 16th century, and was popularized by writing masters such as [[Louis Barbedor]] in the 17th century. In its original form, it borrowed some of its letterforms from the [[Rotunda (script)|round Gothic style]]. This style of writing was still in use (with some modifications) until the 20th century because it was used in French school manuals to teach the bases of cursive writing. It was also commonly used by the scribes of the [[French Ministry of Finance]] until right after World War II,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Marc H.|date=|year=2008|title=Du manuscrit à la typographie numérique : présent et avenir des écritures anciennes|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00646804/|journal=Gazette du Livre Médiéval|publisher=CNRS|volume=|issue=52-53|pages=51–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gave this style the name of ''écriture ronde finnancière'' (''round financial writing'', not to be confused with the ''financière'' writing style).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654540|title=The history and technique of lettering|last=1901-1995.|first=Nesbitt, Alexander,|date=1957|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=9780486204277|edition=[New Dover ed.]|location=New York|oclc=654540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic French rondes where also very present in the work of 18th century type founder and calligrapher [[Nicholas Gando]], which has been revived for the digital medium by way of the French 111 font.&lt;ref&gt;Published by the [[Bitstream]] type foundry in 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3306">'''Sananmuunnos''' ("Word transformation"), sometimes '''kääntösana''', is a sort of verbal play in the [[Finnish language]], similar to [[spoonerism]]s in [[English language|English]].  

Special to Finnish is a narrow phoneme inventory and [[vowel harmony]]. As Finnish is a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-divided language, it is morae that are exchanged, not syllables (often a mora is also a syllable in a Finnish word, but not always). Also, Finnish [[inflectional morphology|inflectional]] and [[derivational morphology]] is extensive, thus applying a suffix from another word often produces a valid word. This leads to large number of possible spoonerisms. Much of practical ''sananmuunnos'' wordplay revolves around obscene [[double entendre]] expressed by spoonerism.

Several books have been written. Some have whole stories with multiple puns in one sentence, for example. Most have a "vocabulary" in the back, usually a hundred or more word pairs long.

== Processes ==
Initial [[mora (linguistics)|morae]] of two adjacent words are exchanged, which is spoonerism by definition.
:[[Johannes Virolainen]] (name of a former leading politician) → Vihannes Jorolainen (''vihannes'' 'vegetable', ''Jorolainen'' an ordinary surname)
:Mikkelin kittaajat ('chuggers of [[Mikkeli]]', a town in Finland) → kikkelin mittaajat ('measurers of [[Penis|weenie]]')

The "extra length" of a [[long vowel]] is a full mora, and thus stays in its original position, making the new vowel long.
:sanan m&lt;u&gt;uu&lt;/u&gt;nnos [sa-nan mu-&amp;#720;nnos] → [mu-nan sa-&amp;#720;nnos] → munan s&lt;u&gt;aa&lt;/u&gt;nnos

If necessary, stilted [[diphthong]]s are converted into allowed diphthongs as per [[phonotactics]]. The first vowel is the determinant for choosing the diphthong. The process preserves opening and closing diphthongs, e.g. the opening 'ie' is reflected as an opening 'uo'. 
:vieno huntti [vi-eno hu-ntti] → [h&lt;u&gt;u-e&lt;/u&gt;no vi-ntti] → h&lt;u&gt;uo&lt;/u&gt;no vintti

If necessary, [[vowel harmony]] is applied. As per vowel harmony, the initial syllable controls the kind of vowel selected.
:häipyvät tavut [hä-ipyvät ta-vut] → [ta-ipyvät hä-vut] → taipuvat hävyt
That is, transformation is A, U, O into Ä, Y, Ö, if the former do not begin the word. Notice that information may be lost in this step, making it irreversible.

== Exceptions ==

It is possible (although not accepted by some "orthodox") to exchange only the initial consonants, if  that is the only way to get a sensible result. E.g. palasokeri [p-ala/s-okeri] 'sugar lump' → salapokeri [s-ala/p-okeri] 'playing poker in secret' (*solapakeri would not mean anything).

Typically presented, spoonerisms are a kind of [[double entendre]]. Appropriately, the very term ''sananmuunnos'' is one; it becomes ''munansaannos'', which can be understood as "small yield of [[penis]]".

'''Terminology extraction''' (also known as '''term''' extraction, '''glossary''' extraction, term '''recognition''', or terminology '''mining''') is a subtask of [[information extraction]]. The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given [[Text corpus|corpus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-66939-7_19|chapter = SemCluster: Unsupervised Automatic Keyphrase Extraction Using Affinity Propagation|title = Advances in Computational Intelligence Systems|volume = 650|pages = 222–235|series = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|year = 2018|last1 = Alrehamy|first1 = Hassan H|last2 = Walker|first2 = Coral|isbn = 978-3-319-66938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[semantic web]] era, a growing number of communities and networked enterprises started to access and interoperate through the [[internet]]. Modeling these communities and their information needs is important for several [[web application]]s, like topic-driven [[web crawler]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Menczer F., Pant G. and Srinivasan P. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/menczer02topicdriven.html Topic-Driven Crawlers: machine learning issues].&lt;/ref&gt; [[web service]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Fan J. and Kambhampati S.

One of the first steps to model the [[Domain knowledge|knowledge domain]] of a [[virtual community]] is to collect a vocabulary of domain-relevant terms, constituting the linguistic surface manifestation of domain [[Ontology (computer science)#Classes .28concepts.29|concepts]]. Several methods to automatically extract technical terms from domain-specific document warehouses have been described in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bourigault D. and Jacquemin C.

Typically, approaches to automatic term extraction make use of linguistic processors ([[part of speech tagging]], [[phrase chunking]]) to extract terminological candidates, i.e. syntactically plausible terminological [[noun phrase]]s, NPs (e.g. compounds "credit card", adjective-NPs "local tourist information office", and prepositional-NPs "board of directors" - in English, the first two constructs are the most frequent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-66939-7_19|chapter = SemCluster: Unsupervised Automatic Keyphrase Extraction Using Affinity Propagation|title = Advances in Computational Intelligence Systems|volume = 650|pages = 222–235|series = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing|year = 2018|last1 = Alrehamy|first1 = Hassan H|last2 = Walker|first2 = Coral|isbn = 978-3-319-66938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Terminological entries are then filtered from the candidate list using statistical and [[machine learning]] methods. Once filtered, because of their low ambiguity and high specificity, these terms are particularly useful for conceptualizing a knowledge domain or for supporting the creation of a [[Ontology (computer science)#Domain ontologies and upper ontologies|domain ontology]] or a terminology base. Furthermore, terminology extraction is a very useful starting point for [[semantic similarity]], [[knowledge management]], [[translation|human translation]] and [[machine translation]], etc.

==Bilingual terminology extraction==

'''''The Interpreter''''' (2003) is [[Suki Kim]]’s first novel. In ''The Interpreter'', Kim creates a twenty-nine-year-old [[Korean American]] court interpreter named Suzy Park who makes a startling and ominous discovery during one court case which ultimately reveals the mystery of her parents' homicide. The award winning novel, mainly a murder mystery, breaks through the stereotypical images of the happy immigrant experience with a story of pain, loss, and murder.

==Plot summary==
Suzy Park is a young, attractive, and achingly alone Korean American woman who works as a [[legal translation|court interpreter]] for the [[New York City Courts|New York City court system]]. She has had two rocky relationships with married men, worked a series of unsatisfying jobs, and cut ties with her family before her parents were shot dead in an unsolved double murder. The life she has chosen as an interpreter is a reflection of Suzy's searching for her own identity and trying to bridge the two cultures to both of which she feels a detachment. During one court case she discovers that her parents were not murdered by random violence, as the police had indicated, but instead had been shot by political enemies. The discovery provides the glint of a new lead for Park, and the novel tracks her investigation into what really happened, which ultimately reveals the mystery of her parents' homicide.

'''''Truth in Translation''''' is a stage play conceived and directed by [[Michael Lessac]], with music by [[Hugh Masekela]]. It tells the story of the [[interpreter]]s at [[South Africa]]'s [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]. 

The play was written in a collaboration between the interpreters who worked at the TRC, writer Paavo Tom Tammi and the company of South African actors. It premiered in [[Rwanda]], has toured [[South Africa]] and is touring to international conflict zones such as [[Northern Ireland]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[the Balkans]], [[Jerusalem]]/[[Ramallah]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Peru]], and [[Indonesia]]/[[Timor]] to tell the story of the South African experience. The project includes workshops with audiences, exhibitions ([[The Forgiveness Project]] and Jillian Edelstein's ''Truth and Lies'') and filming of the interaction between audiences and the company, and attempts to provoke a global dialogue around notions of healing and reconciliation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1410">In the field of [[composition studies]], the place of [[visual rhetoric]] is often uncertain or contested. Proponents of its inclusion in composition typically point to the increasingly visual nature of society, and the increasing presence of visual texts. [[Literacy]], they argue, can no longer be limited only to written text and must also include an understanding of the visual.&lt;ref name="George2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill2003" /&gt; The exact role of visual rhetoric in the composition classroom, however, is unclear.

Despite this focus on [[new media]], the inclusion of '''visual rhetoric in composition studies''' is distinct from a [[media theory of composition]], though the two are obviously related. Visual rhetoric focuses on the rhetorical nature of all visual texts while new media tends to focus on electronic mediums.
