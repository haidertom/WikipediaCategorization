{{legend|#aa0000|Carinthian}}]]

The '''Carinthian dialect group''' (''koroška narečna skupina'', ''koroščina''&lt;ref name="Logar"&gt;Logar, Tine. 1996. ''Dialektološke in jezikovnozgodovinske razprave''. Ljubljana: SAZU.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}) is a group of closely related dialects of [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. The Carinthian dialects are spoken by [[Carinthian Slovenes]] in Austria, in [[Slovenian Carinthia]], and in the northwestern parts of [[Slovenian Styria]] along the upper [[Drava]] Valley, in the westernmost areas of [[Upper Carniola]] on the border with [[Italy]], and in some villages in the [[Province of Udine]] in Italy.

==Phonological and morphological characteristics==
Among other features, this group is characterized by late denasalization of *''ę'' and *''ǫ'', a close reflex of long [[yat]] and open reflex of short [[yat]], lengthening of old acute syllables and short neo-acute syllables, and an ''e''-like reflex of the long semivowel and ''ə''-like reflex of the short semivowel.&lt;ref&gt;Toporišič, Jože. 1992. ''Enciklopedija slovenskega jezika''. Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual dialects and subdialects==

'''Chanchala''' is a [[Sanskrit]] [[adjective]] basically referring to the unsteady vacillating nature of human mind and actions which need to be stilled, neutralized or controlled for gaining right speech and vision.

==Meaning==

'''Chanchala''' ([[Sanskrit]]: चञ्चल) means - 'inconsiderate', 'nimble', 'shaking', 'inconstant', 'moveable', 'flickering', 'moving', 'unsteady', 'fortune', 'wind', 'long pepper', 'goddess of fortune' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+chanchala&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==

''Chanchala'' is the good word for 'vacillation' in Sanskrit language; in [[Sanskrit literature
Sanskrit|poetry]] the girl with the dancing eyes is called ''chanchalakshi'', which is considered to be rare attribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A More Ardent Fire|author=Eknath Easwaran|publisher=Nilgiri Press|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxcNUISHyXEC&amp;pg=PT176&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lDkoU7mABIb8rAfj4YCwBg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as part of the literary evidence of [[Kushan Empire|Kusana period]], the word ''Chanchala'', like ''Dhavani'' and ''Rodini'', indicates the nature or action of [[Mother goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tribal Roots of Hinduism|author=Shiv Kumar Tiwari|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0gwfmPFTLgC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VDsoU5qnB8WJrQeI0YG4CQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDgy#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Bhagavad Gita]](Sloka VI.26):
:यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् |
:ततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव वंश नयेत् ||
the word Chanchala used in the first line refers to the restless and the unsteady mind that wanders away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Geeta|author=Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=446|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVw_Rff7m7AC&amp;pg=PA446&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1TkoU4rWJs2HrgelpoHwAQ&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dasam Granth]], which like the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is an important book of [[Sikhism]], it is not composed in [[raga]]s (its first composition dates 1684 A.D.) tells us that ''Chanchala'' is the name a ''[[chhand]]'' or metre of sixteen syllables having ''ragan'', ''jagan'', ''ragan'', ''jagan'' and ''laghu'' consecutively in each quarter, this metre is also known as ''Chitra'', ''Biraj and ''Brahmrupak'', and has been used twice in ''Choubis Autar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dasam Granth|author=S.S.Kapoor|publisher=Hemkunt Press|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-h8ptzp0lUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uD0oU_G0IYayrgfn2IBQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjha#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==

''Chanchala'', meaning, 'the fickle-fortune', is one of the many names of [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism Vol.3|publisher=Sarup&amp;Sons|page=788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNQ82_yYeK8C&amp;pg=PA788&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mTwoU9PQN4KMrgeh0IDQAQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjhG#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mention of ''Lakshmi'' in the [[Rig Veda]]. [[Lakshmi|Sri]] of the Rig Veda is deified as a personified being in the [[Yajurveda]], and in the [[Atharvaveda]] (I.18) she is prayed to secure prosperity. ''Jatavedas Agni'' is repeatedly asked to make the goddess come to the votary; the epithet ''anapagamini'' reflects the ''chanchala'' i.e. fleet or fickle aspect of the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Goddesses in Ancient India|author=Prithvi Kumar Agrawal |publisher=Abhinav Publications|pages=92–97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FHvf59ceLEC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FzwoU5f0DouMrgfU0IFI&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lakshmi'' or ''Chanchala'' as the mobile one associates only with the rich and the dynamic, no matter what their caste, creed or colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devi: Tales of the Goddess of Our Time|author=Mrinala Pande|publisher=Penguin Books|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1TLsJW-WInIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8TgoU_2hEoWyrAekvoDQBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because ''Lakshmi'' is ''chanchala'' i.e. quick on her feet, to make her ''achala'' i.e. 'immobile', she needs to be worshipped quietly so that she does not get distracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Age Purohit Darpan: Lakshmi Puja|publisher=Associatian of Grandparents of Indian Migrants|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OxMvAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TT4oU8jnC8e-rgfq14DgCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADhu#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In yoga==

In [[Yoga]], ''[[vritti]]'' indicates the contents of mental awareness that are disturbances in the medium of [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Yoga|author=I.K.Taimni|publisher=Theosophical Publishing House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5dSJgAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+science+of+yoga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_AspU570E8PJrAfHloDAAw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''vrittis'' of the ''[[Guṇa|gunas]]'' are ever-active and swift, the ''gunas'' serve as parts of ''[[buddhi]]'', their habitual conduct is fickle, restless, tremulous (''chanchala'') activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2TwoU67eOob8rAfj4YCwBg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCThG#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; which activity can be controlled through ''[[Abhyasa]]'', ''[[Vairagya]]'' and ''[[Ishvarapranidhana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Education E2|author=S.P.Chaube|publisher=-Vikas Publishing House|page=161|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b3BY_dNrRJMC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=vritti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Mw0pU-6_EYSIrgf7nIGYBA&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vritti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sri Narada Pancharatnam'' (Sloka VIII.15) tells us that ''Chanchala'' is the ''[[nadi]]'' which along with ''Medhya'' resides in the ''Visuddha Chakra'' on the throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Narada Pancharatnam|author=Baman Das Basu|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L0aXR7BtY2MC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=chanchala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fz0oU_CrHcSUrAfei4CwAQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAThQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chanchala&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Character encoding''' is used to represent a repertoire of [[character (computing)|characters]] by some kind of [[code|encoding]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Definition from [http://techterms.com/definition/characterencoding The Tech Terms Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the [[abstraction level]] and context, corresponding [[code point]]s and the resulting code space may be regarded as [[bitstream|bit patterns]], [[octet (computing)|octets]], natural [[number]]s, electrical pulses, etc. A character encoding is used in [[computation]], [[computer data storage|data storage]], and transmission of textual [[data]]. "Character set", "character map", "codeset" and "[[code page]]" are related, but not identical, terms.

Early character codes associated with the optical or electrical [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] could only [[Representation (systemics)|represent]] a subset of the characters used in written languages, sometimes restricted to upper case letters, numerals and some punctuation only. The low cost of digital representation of data in modern computer systems allows more elaborate character codes (such as [[Unicode]]) which represent most of the characters used in many written languages. Character encoding using internationally accepted standards permits worldwide interchange of text in electronic form.

==History==
Early binary repertoires include [[Bacon's cipher]], [[Braille]], [[International maritime signal flags]], and the 4-digit encoding of Chinese characters for a [[Chinese telegraph code]] ([[Hans Schjellerup]], 1869). Common examples of character encoding systems include [[Morse code]], the [[Baudot code]], the American Standard Code for Information Interchange ([[ASCII]]) and [[Unicode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.smartbear.com/development/ancient-computer-character-code-tables-and-why-theyre-still-relevant/ | title=Ancient Computer Character Code Tables – and Why They're Still Relevant | publisher=Smartbear | date=17 April 2014 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | author=Tom Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morse code]] was introduced in the 1840s and is used to encode each letter of the [[Latin alphabet]], each [[Arabic numeral]], and some other characters via a series of long and short presses of a [[telegraph key]]. Representations of characters encoded using Morse code varied in length.

The [[Baudot code]], a five-bit encoding, was created by [[Émile Baudot]] in 1870, patented in 1874, modified by Donald Murray in 1901, and standardized by CCITT as International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) in 1930.

[[Fieldata]], a six-or seven-bit code, was introduced by the U.S. Army Signal Corps in the late 1950s.

[[IBM]]'s [[Binary-coded decimal#IBM and BCD|Binary Coded Decimal]] ([[BCD (character encoding)|BCD]]) was a six-bit encoding scheme used by IBM in as early as 1959 in its [[IBM 1401|1401]] and [[IBM 1620|1620]] computers, and in its [[IBM 700/7000 series|7000 Series]] (for example, 704, 7040, 709 and 7090 computers), as well as in associated peripherals. BCD extended existing simple four-bit numeric encoding to include alphabetic and special characters, mapping it easily to punch-card encoding which was already in widespread use. It was the precursor to EBCDIC.

[[ASCII]] was introduced in 1963 and is a seven-bit encoding scheme used to encode letters, numerals, symbols, and device [[control code]]s as fixed-length codes using [[integer]]s.

[[IBM]]'s [[EBCDIC|Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] (usually abbreviated as EBCDIC) is an eight-bit encoding scheme developed in 1963.

The limitations of such sets soon became apparent,{{to whom|date=September 2018}} and a number of ''ad hoc'' methods were developed to extend them. The need to support more [[writing system]]s for different languages, including the [[CJK characters|CJK]] family of [[East Asian scripts]], required support for a far larger number of characters and demanded a systematic approach to character encoding rather than the previous ''ad hoc'' approaches.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} 

In trying to develop universally interchangeable character encodings, researchers in the 1980s faced the dilemma that on the one hand, it seemed necessary to add more bits to accommodate additional characters, but on the other hand, for the users of the relatively small character set of the Latin alphabet (who still constituted the majority of computer users), those additional bits were a colossal waste of then-scarce and expensive computing resources (as they would always be zeroed out for such users).

The compromise solution that was eventually found and developed into Unicode was to break the assumption (dating back to telegraph codes) that each character should always directly correspond to a particular sequence of bits. Instead, characters would first be mapped to a universal intermediate representation in the form of abstract numbers called [[code point]]s. Code points would then be represented in a variety of ways and with various default numbers of bits per character (code units) depending on context. To encode code points higher than the length of the code unit, such as above 256 for 8-bit units, the solution was to implement [[variable-width encoding]]s where an escape sequence would signal that subsequent bits should be parsed as a higher code point.

==Terminology==
[[File:KB Dubeolsik for Old Hangul (NG3).svg|thumb|365x365px]]
Terminology related to character encoding:
* A ''character'' is a minimal unit of text that has semantic value.
* A ''character set'' is a collection of characters that might be used by multiple languages. 
''Example:'' The Latin character set is used by English and most European languages, though the Greek character set is used only by the Greek language.
* A ''coded character set'' is a character set in which each character corresponds to a unique number.
* A ''code point'' of a coded character set is any allowed value in the character set.
* A ''code unit'' is a bit sequence used to encode each character of a repertoire within a given encoding form.

; Character repertoire (the abstract set of characters):

The character repertoire is an abstract set of more than one million characters found in a wide variety of scripts including ''Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, and Aramaic''.

Other symbols such as musical notation are also included in the character repertoire. Both the Unicode and [[GB18030]] standards have a character repertoire. As new characters are added to one standard, the other standard also adds those characters, to maintain parity.

The code unit size is equivalent to the bit measurement for the particular encoding:
* A code unit in [[US-ASCII]] consists of 7 bits;
* A code unit in [[UTF-8]], [[EBCDIC]] and GB18030 consists of 8 bits;
* A code unit in [[UTF-16]] consists of 16 bits;
* A code unit in [[UTF-32]] consists of 32 bits.

''Example of a code unit:'' Consider a ''[[String (computer science)|string]]'' of the letters "abc" followed by {{unichar|10400|DESERET CAPITAL LETTER LONG I}} (represented with 1 char32_t, 2 char16_t or 4 char8_t). That string contains:
* four characters;
* four code points
* either:
*: four code units in UTF-32 (00000061, 00000062, 00000063, 00010400)
*: five code units in UTF-16 (0061, 0062, 0063, d801, dc00), or
*: seven code units in UTF-8  (61, 62, 63, f0, 90, 90, 80).

To express a character in Unicode, the hexadecimal value is prefixed with the string 'U+'. The range of valid code points for the Unicode standard is U+0000 to U+10FFFF, inclusive, divided in 17 [[Plane (Unicode)|planes]], identified by the numbers 0 to 16. Characters in the range U+0000 to U+FFFF are in the plane 0, called the ''[[Plane (Unicode)#Basic Multilingual Plane|Basic Multilingual Plane]]'' (BMP). This plane contains most commonly-used characters. Characters in the range U+10000 to U+10FFFF in the other planes are called ''[[supplementary characters]]''.

The following table shows examples of code point values:

A code point is represented by a sequence of code units. The mapping is defined by the encoding. Thus, the number of code units required to represent a code point depends on the encoding:
* ''UTF-8:'' code points map to a sequence of one, two, three or four code units.
* ''UTF-16:'' code units are twice as long as 8-bit code units. Therefore, any code point with a scalar value less than U+10000 are encoded with a single code unit. Code points with a value U+10000 or higher require two code units each. These pairs of code units have a unique term in UTF-16: [[UTF-16#cite note-Unicode7Ch3s8-5|"Unicode surrogate pairs".]]
* ''UTF-32:'' the 32-bit code unit is large enough that every code point is represented as a single code unit.
* ''GB18030:'' multiple code units per code point are common, because of the small code units. Code points are mapped to one, two, or four code units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/text/terminology.html | title=The Java Tutorials - Terminology | publisher=Oracle | accessdate=25 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|CCS}}Unicode encoding model==
[[Unicode]] and its parallel standard, the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]], together constitute a modern, unified character encoding. Rather than mapping characters directly to octets ([[byte]]s), they separately define what characters are available, corresponding natural numbers ([[code point]]s), how those numbers are encoded as a series of fixed-size natural numbers (code units), and finally how those units are encoded as a stream of octets. The purpose of this decomposition is to establish a universal set of characters that can be encoded in a variety of ways.&lt;ref name=utr17&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr17/ |title=Unicode Technical Report #17: Unicode Character Encoding Model |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To describe this model correctly requires more precise terms than "character set" and "character encoding." The terms used in the modern model follow:&lt;ref name=utr17/&gt;

A '''character repertoire''' is the full set of abstract characters that a system supports. The repertoire may be closed, i.e. no additions are allowed without creating a new standard (as is the case with ASCII and most of the ISO-8859 series), or it may be open, allowing additions (as is the case with Unicode and to a limited extent the [[Windows code page]]s). The characters in a given repertoire reflect decisions that have been made about how to divide writing systems into basic information units. The basic variants of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Cyrillic]] alphabets can be broken down into letters, digits, punctuation, and a few ''special characters'' such as the space, which can all be arranged in simple linear sequences that are displayed in the same order they are read. But even with these alphabets, [[diacritic]]s pose a complication: they can be regarded either as part of a single character containing a letter and diacritic (known as a precomposed character), or as separate characters. The former allows a far simpler text handling system but the latter allows any letter/diacritic combination to be used in text. [[Typographic ligature|Ligatures]] pose similar problems. Other writing systems, such as Arabic and Hebrew, are represented with more complex character repertoires due to the need to accommodate things like bidirectional text and [[glyph]]s that are joined together in different ways for different situations.

A '''coded character set''' (CCS) is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that maps characters to ''[[code point]]s'' (each code point represents one character). For example, in a given repertoire, the capital letter "A" in the Latin alphabet might be represented by the code point 65, the character "B" to 66, and so on. Multiple coded character sets may share the same repertoire; for example [[ISO/IEC 8859-1]] and IBM code pages 037 and 500 all cover the same repertoire but map them to different code points.

A '''character encoding form''' (CEF) is the mapping of code points to ''code units'' to facilitate storage in a system that represents numbers as bit sequences of fixed length (i.e. practically any computer system). For example, a system that stores numeric information in 16-bit units can only directly represent code points 0 to 65,535 in each unit, but larger code points (say, 65,536 to 1.4&amp;nbsp;million) could be represented by using multiple 16-bit units. This correspondence is defined by a CEF.

Next, a '''character encoding scheme''' (CES) is the mapping of code units to a sequence of octets to facilitate storage on an octet-based file system or transmission over an octet-based network. Simple character encoding schemes include [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16BE]], [[UTF-32BE]], [[UTF-16LE]] or [[UTF-32LE]]; compound character encoding schemes, such as [[UTF-16]], [[UTF-32]] and [[ISO/IEC 2022]], switch between several simple schemes by using [[byte order mark]]s or [[escape sequence]]s; compressing schemes try to minimise the number of bytes used per code unit (such as [[Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode|SCSU]], [[Binary Ordered Compression for Unicode|BOCU]], and [[Punycode]]).

Although [[UTF-32BE]] is a simpler CES, most systems working with Unicode use either [[UTF-8]], which is [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with fixed-width ASCII and maps Unicode code points to variable-width sequences of octets, or [[UTF-16BE]], which is [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with fixed-width UCS-2BE and maps Unicode code points to variable-width sequences of 16-bit words. See [[comparison of Unicode encodings]] for a detailed discussion.

Finally, there may be a '''higher level protocol''' which supplies additional information to select the particular variant of a [[Unicode]] character, particularly where there are regional variants that have been 'unified' in Unicode as the same character. An example is the [[XML]] attribute xml:lang.

The Unicode model uses the term '''character map''' for historical systems which directly assign a sequence of characters to a sequence of bytes, covering all of CCS, CEF and CES layers.&lt;ref name="utr17" /&gt;

== Character sets, character maps and code pages ==
Historically, the terms "character encoding", "character map", "character set" and "[[code page]]" were synonymous in [[computer science]], as the same standard would specify a repertoire of characters and how they were to be encoded into a stream of code units – usually with a single character per code unit. But now the terms have related but distinct meanings,&lt;ref name="SteeleMSDN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/shawnste/2005/03/15/whats-the-difference-between-an-encoding-code-page-character-set-and-unicode/|author=Shawn Steele|title=What's the difference between an Encoding, Code Page, Character Set and Unicode?|date=15 March 2005|website=MSDN}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to efforts by standards bodies to use precise terminology when writing about and unifying many different encoding systems.&lt;ref name=utr17/&gt; Regardless, the terms are still used interchangeably, with ''character set'' being nearly ubiquitous.

A "'''code page'''" usually means a [[byte oriented|byte-oriented]] encoding, but with regard to some suite of encodings (covering different scripts), where many characters share the same [[code point|codes]] in most or all those code pages. Well-known code page suites are "Windows" (based on Windows-1252) and "IBM"/"DOS" (based on [[code page 437]]), see [[Windows code page]] for details. Most, but not all, encodings referred to as code pages are single-byte encodings (but see [[Octet (computing)|octet]] on byte size.)

IBM's Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA) designates with coded character set identifiers ([[CCSID]]s) and each of which is variously called a "charset", "character set", "code page", or "CHARMAP".&lt;ref name=utr17/&gt;

The term "code page" does not occur in Unix or Linux where "charmap" is preferred, usually in the larger context of locales.

Contrasted to [[#CCS|CCS above]], a "character encoding" is a map from abstract characters to [[code word]]s. A "character set" in [[HTTP]] (and [[MIME]]) parlance is the same as a character encoding (but not the same as CCS).

"[[legacy system|Legacy]] encoding" is a term sometimes used to characterize old character encodings, but with an ambiguity of sense. Most of its use is in the context of [[Unicode|Unicodification]], where it refers to encodings that fail to cover all Unicode code points, or, more generally, using a somewhat different character repertoire: several code points representing one Unicode character,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basistech.co.jp/knowledge-center/database/uc-trillium-2.ppt "Processing database information using Unicode, a case study"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617193918/http://www.basistech.co.jp/knowledge-center/database/uc-trillium-2.ppt |date=17 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or versa (see e.g. [[code page 437]]). Some sources refer to an encoding as ''legacy'' only because it preceded Unicode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=IWS-Chapter03#79e846db|publisher=[[SIL International]]|title=Character set encoding basics|work=Implementing Writing Systems: An introduction|first=Peter|last=Constable|date=13 June 2001|accessdate=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Windows code pages are usually referred to as legacy, both because they antedate Unicode and because they are unable to represent all 2&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; possible Unicode code points.

== Character encoding translation ==

It is defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cluttering is a fluency disorder characterized by a rate that is perceived to be abnormally rapid, irregular, or both for the speaker (although measured syllable rates may not exceed normal limits). These rate abnormalities further are manifest in one or more of the following symptoms: (a) an excessive number of [[disfluencies]], the majority of which are not typical of people with [[stuttering]]; (b) the frequent placement of pauses and use of [[prosodic|prosodic patterns]] that do not conform to [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] constraints; and (c) inappropriate (usually excessive) degrees of [[coarticulation]] among sounds, especially in multisyllabic words".&lt;ref&gt;St. Louis, K. O., Myers, F. L., Bakker, K., &amp; Raphael, L. J. (2007). Understanding and treating cluttering. In E. G. Conture &amp; R. F. Curlee (Eds.) Stuttering and related disorders of fluency, 3rd ed. (pp. 297-325). NY: Thieme.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[Stuttering]] is often misapplied as a common term referring to any dysfluency. It is also often incorrectly applied to normal dysfluency rather than dysfluency from a disorder.  Cluttered speech is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering. This is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.

Cluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech, but they are distinct. A stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but may have a difficult time vocally expressing those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking. Cluttering affects not only speech, but also thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html When speech is too cluttered - British Stammering Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151645/http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances. In contrast, clutterers are most clear at the start of utterances, but their speaking rate increases and intelligibility decreases towards the end of utterances.

Stuttering is characterized by struggle behavior, such as overtense speech production muscles. Cluttering, in contrast, is effortless.  Cluttering is also characterized by [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], especially dropped or distorted /r/ and /l/ sounds; and monotone speech that starts loud and trails off into a murmur.

A clutterer described the feeling associated with a clutter as:
{{cquote|It feels like 1) about twenty thoughts explode on my mind all at once, and I need to express them all, 2) that when I'm trying to make a point, that I just remembered something that I was supposed to say, so the person can understand, and I need to interrupt myself to say something that I should have said before, and 3) that I need to constantly revise the sentences that I'm working on, to get it out right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Differential diagnosis==
Cluttering can often be confused with [[language delay]], [[language disorder]], [[learning disabilities]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Treatment==
Because clutterers have poor awareness of their disorder, they may be indifferent or even hostile to speech-language pathologists. [[Delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF) is usually used to produce a more deliberate, exaggerated oral-motor response pattern. Other treatment components include improving [[narrative structure]] with [[Storytelling|story-telling]] [[picture book]]s, turn-taking practice, pausing practice, and language therapy.

==History==
[[Battaros]] was a legendary [[Libya]]n king who spoke quickly and in a disorderly fashion.  Others who spoke as he did were said to suffer from ''battarismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the earliest record of the speech disorder of cluttering.

In the 1960s, cluttering was called ''tachyphemia'', a word derived from the Greek for "fast speech". This word is no longer used to describe cluttering because fast speech is not a required element of cluttering.

Deso Weiss described cluttering as the outward manifestation of a "central language imbalance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Society and culture==
Weiss claimed that Battaros, [[Demosthenes]], [[Pericles]], [[Justinian]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], and [[Winston Churchill]] were clutterers.  He says about these people, "Each of these contributors to [[World History|world history]] viewed his world holistically, and was not deflected by exaggerated attention to small details.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">'''Cognitive hearing science''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] science field concerned with the physiological and cognitive basis of hearing and its interplay with [[signal processing]] in [[hearing aid]]s. The field includes [[genetics]], [[physiology]], medical and technical [[audiology]], cognitive [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[linguistics]] and [[social psychology]].

Theoretically the research in cognitive hearing science combines a physiological model for the information transfer from the outer [[Ear|auditory]] organ to the auditory [[cerebral cortex]], and a cognitive model for how [[language comprehension]] is influenced by the interplay between the incoming language signal and the individual's [[cognition|cognitive]] skills, especially the [[long-term memory]] and the [[working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Project database |  url=http://vrproj.vr.se/detail.asp?arendeid=57495 | publisher=[[Swedish Research Council]] | accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers examine the interplay between type of [[hearing impairment]] or [[deafness]], type of signal processing in different [[hearing aid]]s, type of listening environment and the individual's cognitive skills.

Research in cognitive hearing science has importance for the knowledge about different types of hearing impairment and its effects, as for the possibilities to determine which individuals can make use of certain type of signal processing in hearing aid or [[cochlear implant]] and thereby adapt hearing aid to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About Linnaeus Centre Head p. 3-4 |  url=http://www.ibl.liu.se/cdd/ihv/högerspalt-startsida-ihv/1.189512/broschyrHEADLinncentrum.pdf | publisher=[[Linköping University]] | accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive hearing science has been introduced by researchers at the [[Linköping University]] research centre Linnaeus Centre HEAD (HEaring And Deafness) in Sweden, created in 2008 with a major 10-year grant from the Swedish Research Council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16248">'''Discourse ethics''' refers to a type of [[argument]] that attempts to establish normative or ethical truths by examining the presuppositions of discourse.&lt;ref&gt;“Discourse Ethics.” Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics, Encyclopedia.com, www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/discourse-ethics.&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of this argument have been used in the establishment of [[egalitarian]] ethics, as well as [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] ethics.

==Habermas and Apel==
German philosophers [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Karl-Otto Apel]] are considered the originators of modern discourse ethics.&lt;ref name="Àbba"&gt;{{cite book|last=Àbba|first=Giuseppe|title=Quale Impostazione per la filosofia morale?|publisher=LAS|location=Roma|year=1996|isbn=978-88-213-0314-2|pages=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas's discourse ethics is his attempt to explain the implications of [[communicative rationality]] in the sphere of moral insight and normative validity. It is a complex theoretical effort to reformulate the fundamental insights of Kantian [[deontological ethics]] in terms of the analysis of communicative structures.  This means that it is an attempt to explain the universal and obligatory nature of morality by evoking the universal obligations of communicative rationality. It is also a [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivist]] moral theory, which means it holds that justifying the validity of moral norms can be done in a manner analogous to the justification of facts.  However, the entire project is undertaken as a [[rational reconstruction]] of moral insight.  It claims only to reconstruct the implicit normative orientations that guide individuals and it claims to access these through an analysis of communication.

===Public discourse ethics===
This type of ethics consists of conversations about ideas in civic or community contexts marked by diversity of perspectives requiring thoughtful public engagement. This discourse is made up of differing insights that helps to shape the public's engagement with one another.&lt;ref name= "Arnett, Fritz, &amp; Bell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnett, Fritz, &amp; Bell|title=Communication ethics Literacy|publisher= SAGE Publications Inc.|location=California|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-4214-0|pages=99–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discourse is meant to protect and to promote the public good. For public discourse ethics to be successful there must be an effective level of civility between people or persons involved. It was Sigmund Freud who once said, "civilization began the first time an angry person cast a word instead of a rock" and that statement is something that continues to be seen in society today.&lt;ref name= "Waisanen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Waisanen|first=D|title=TOWARD ROBUST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT:THE VALUE OF DELIBERATIVE DISCOURSE FOR CIVIL COMMUNICATION|pages=287–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard Law Review accurately examines public discourse and explains it in a manner that is appropriate and conceptually accurate. "Every man who publishes a book commits himself to the judgement of the public, and anyone may comment upon his performance.... [W]hatever their merits, others have a right to pass their judgement upon them-to censure them if they be censurable, and to turn them into ridicule if they be ridiculous".&lt;ref name= "Post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Post|first=Robert|title=''Harvard Law Review''|year=1990|page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the public discourse ethics to be productive there must be accountability on the public stage as the Harvard Law Review calls into question. Without any act of accountability the ethicality of the discourse is no longer valid and cannot go on. Public accountability consists of three basic factors. The factors are a diversity of ideas, an engagement  of public decision making, and finally an account for continuing a practice or way of doing something or a means or reason for changing the practice. Finally, public discourse ethics puts a great responsibility on the individual. They must continually be asking questions and finding answers. They will not always be right; and that is okay. As long as they are able to make a positive decision in the end.

===Presupposition===
Habermas maintains that normative validity cannot be understood as separate from the argumentative procedures used in everyday practice, such as those used to resolve issues concerning the legitimacy of actions and the validity of the norms governing interactions. He makes this claim by making reference to the validity dimensions attached to speech acts in communication and the implicit forms of argumentation they imply (see [[Universal pragmatics]]). The basic idea is that the validity of a moral norm cannot be justified in the mind of an isolated individual reflecting on the world. The validity of a norm is justified only intersubjectively in processes of argumentation between individuals; in a [[dialectic]]. The validity of a claim to normative rightness depends upon the mutual understanding achieved by individuals in argument.

From this it follows that the [[presupposition]]s of argumentation would become important. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] extracted moral principles from the necessities forced upon a rational subject reflecting on the world. Habermas extracts moral principles from the necessities forced upon individuals engaged in the discursive justification of validity claims, from the inescapable presuppositions of communication and argumentation. These presuppositions were the kinds of idealization that individuals had to make in order for communication and argumentation to even begin. For example:
* The presupposition that participants in communicative exchange are using the same linguistic expressions in the same way
* The presupposition that no relevant argument is suppressed or excluded by the participants
* The presupposition that no force except that of the better argument is exerted
* The presupposition that all the participants are motivated only by a concern for the better argument

There were also presuppositions unique to discourse:
* The presupposition that everyone would agree to the universal validity of the claim thematized
* The presupposition that everyone capable of speech and action is entitled to participate, and everyone is equally entitled to introduce new topics or express attitudes needs or desires
* The presupposition that no validity claim is exempt in principle from critical evaluation in argumentation

These are all at the center of Habermas's moral theory. Habermas's discourse ethics attempts to distill the idealized moral point of view that accompanies a perfectly rational process of argumentation (also idealized), which would be the moral principle implied by the presuppositions listed above.  The key point is that the presuppositions of argumentation and communication that have been rationally reconstructed by Habermas are both factual and normative.  This can be said about his entire project because it is explicitly attempting to bridge the gap between the "is" and the "ought."  Habermas speaks of the mutual recognition and exchanging of roles and perspectives that are demanded by the very structural condition of rational argumentation. He maintains that what is implied in these factual presuppositions of communication is the deep structure of moral norms, the conditions that every valid norm must fulfill.

===Universalization===
The presuppositions of communication express a universal obligation to maintain impartial judgment in discourse, which constrains all affected to adopt the perspectives of all others in the exchange of reasons.  From this Habermas extracts the following principle of universalization (U), which is the condition every valid norm has to fulfill:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(U) All affected can accept the consequences and the side effects that [the norm's] general observance can be anticipated to have for the satisfaction of everyone's interests, and the consequences are preferred to those of known alternative possibilities for regulation. (Habermas, 1991:65)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This can be understood as the deep structure of all acceptable moral norms, and should not be confused with the principle of discourse ethics (D), which presupposes that norms exist that satisfy the conditions specified by (U).

&lt;blockquote&gt;(D) Only those norms can claim to be valid that meet (or could meet) with the approval of all affected in their capacity as participants in a practical discourse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implications of (U) and (D) are quite profound. (U) claims to be a rational reconstruction of the impartial moral point of view at the heart of all cognitivist moral theories. According to moral cognitivists (e.g. Kant, Rawls etc.), it is only from such a moral point of view that insight into the actual (quasi-factual) impersonal obligations of a general will can be gained, because this perspective relieves decisions from the inaccuracies of personal interests.  Of course, Habermas's reconstruction is different because it is intersubjective.  That is, Habermas (unlike [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] or [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) formulates the moral point of view as it arises out of the multiple perspectives of those affected by a norm under consideration.  The moral point of view explicated in (U) is not the property of an individual subject but the property of a community of interlocutors, the results of a complex dialogical process of role taking and perspective exchanging.  Furthermore, (U) is deduced from a rational reconstruction of the presupposition of communication, which downgrades the strong transcendentalism of Kantian ethics by establishing a foundation in inner-worldly processes of communication.

(D) on the other hand is a principle concerning the manner in which norms conforming to (U) must be justified through discourse.  Again, Habermas takes the task of moral reflection out of the isolated individual's head and gives it to intersubjective processes of communication.  What (D) proposes is that moral principles must be validated in actual discourse and that those to be affected by a norm must be able to participate in argumentation concerning its validity.  No number of thought experiments can replace a communicative exchange with others regarding moral norms that will affect them.  Moreover, this general prescription concerning the type of discourse necessary for the justification of moral norms opens the process of moral deliberation to the kind of learning that accompanies a fallibilistic orientation.  (U) and (D) are catalysts for a moral learning process, which although fallible is not relative.  The flesh and blood insights of participants in communicative exchange are refracted through the universal guidelines explicated from the deep structures of communication and argumentation.  This spawns discourses with a rational trajectory, which are grounded in the particular circumstances of those involved but aimed at a universal moral validity.

===Practical applications===

The practical applications of discourse ethics have taken a significant turn after the publication of Habermas' book [[Between Facts and Norms]] (1992),&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen (1995). Between Facts and Norms. Cambridge: [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; where its application to democracy and the legislative process was substantially refined and expanded. Prior to this book, Habermas had left open the question of the various applications of discourse theory to almost any type of consensus oriented group&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen (1986). Moral Consciousness and Communicative Ethics. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from highly visible political and governmental groups, such as Parliament in Great Britain and Congressional debate in the United States, and other consensus oriented activities as found in public and private institutions such as those supported on various international websites and Wikipedia.{{third-party-inline|date=September 2013}}&lt;!-- The whole paragraph --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5731">The '''enactment effect''', also called self-performed task effect (SPT effect) &lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, RL (1981) "On the generality of some memory laws". ''Scandinavian Journal of Psychology'', 22:267-281.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term that was created in the early 80's to describe the fact that [[verb phrase]]s are memorized better if a learner performs the described action during learning, compared to just getting the verbal information or seeing someone else perform the action.&lt;ref name="Engelkamp"&gt;Engelkamp, Johannes &amp; Krumnacker, Horst (1980). „Imaginale und motorische Prozesse beim Behalten verbalen Materials". ''Zeitschrift für experimentelle und angewandte Psychologie'' 27: 511-533.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[gesture]]s improves the quantity of phrases that can be recalled, the phrases can be recalled for a longer amount of time, and they can be accessed easier. Knowing that enacting improves memory performance can be useful in education and treatment of patients with [[memory disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Macedonia2012"&gt;Macedonia, Manuela &amp; von Kriegstein, Katharina (2012) . „Gestures Enhance Foreign Language Learning”. Biolinguistics 6(3-4): 393-416.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Studies showing the enactment effect==
In their study, Engelkamp and Krumnacker (1980) gave participants verbal phrases like “brush the teeth” or "shuffle the cards". In a [[Recognition memory|recognition task]] and a [[free recall]] task, the memory of participants was tested under four learning conditions: one group performed the action, a second group was supposed to imagine the action, the third group watched someone perform the action, and the last group just heard the phrases. The group that had enacted the gestures performed best in both tasks.&lt;ref name="Engelkamp"/&gt;
Around the same time, Cohen examined recall capacity of verbal phrases in participants under three conditions: one group performed the action on a concrete object, a second group saw the experimenter perform the action on an object, and a third group only got verbal instructions. The self-performed task led to the best results, supporting the claim that the enactment effect exists.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;
Since then, the effect has been reduplicated in many studies.&amp;nbsp; Recall after enactment tasks was shown to be superior to recall after verbal tasks in children as well as in adults.&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Eli &amp; Sizanne Donnenwerth-Nolan (1981) "Does Motoric Imagery Facilitate Memory for Sentences? A Selective Interference Test". ''JOURNAL OF VERBAL LEARNING AND VERBAL BEHAVIOR'' 20:322-332.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the enactment effect is existent in elderly people and people with moderate dementia of the Alzheimer type.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, S., Sheppard, L., Rusted, J.M., &amp; H.H., Ratner(1996) "Structuring and Retrieval Environment to Facilitate Learning in Individuals with Dementia of the Alzheimer Type". ''MEMORY'' 4(2):113-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enactment effect in [[Second Language Acquisition|second language acquisition]]==
Gestures have been shown to be a useful tool in teaching a foreign language. The enactment effect can be used in second language teaching&amp;nbsp;in order to learn a language more efficiently, faster, and to prevent forgetting. Various studies have shown that the use of gestures while learning new words improves [[Recall (memory)|recall and retention]].&lt;ref name="Macedonia2012"/&gt; The enactment effect in second language learning could be shown in children as well as adults.&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, M. (2008) "The effect of gestures on second language memorization by young children". ''Gesture'' 8(2):219-235&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacedoniaKnösche"&gt;Macedonia, Manuela &amp; Thomas R. Knösche (2011) "Body in Mind: How Gestures Empower Foreign Language Learning". ''Mind, Brain, and Education'' 5:4, 196-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinn-Allen, Linda (1995) "The effects of emblematic gestures on the development and access of mental representations of French expressions". ''The Modern Language Journal'' 79:521-529.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does enactment improve memorization, but also the use of words in speech production.&lt;ref name="MacedoniaKnösche"/&gt; Using gestures while learning is helpful in learning concrete words as well as abstract words such as “change” or “difference”. Studies supported this claim in showing that abstract words were better remembered when a gesture was used while encoding.&lt;ref name="MacedoniaKnösche"/&gt;

==[[Neurolinguistics|Neurolinguistical]] research on the enactment effect==
In more recent studies, researchers have been trying to find the neurological explanation of the enactment effect, and the reason why memory is enhanced after enactment. It was shown that not mere physical motor information leads to the enactment effect, but that the [[Semantics|semantic]] content of the gesture plays a role as well.&lt;ref&gt;Masumoto, K., Yamaguchi, M., Sutani, K., Tsuneto, S., Fujita, A., &amp; M., Tonoike(2006) "Reactivation of physical motor information in the memory of action events". ''Brain Research'' 1101:102-109.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://multimodalityglossary.wordpress.com/gesture/ Iconic gestures] enhance memory compared to meaningless gestures which have no positive effect on memorization.&lt;ref name="MacedoniaKnösche"/&gt; [[Event-related potential]]s showed that enactment leads to deeper processing of new information, eliciting the assumption that by using gestures, the meaning of the new word is connected with an already existing concept in one’s native language.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Spencer D., Tara McDevitt, &amp; Megan Esch (2009) "Brief training with co-speech gesture lends a hand to word learning in a foreign language". ''Language and Cognitive Processes'', 24:313-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eskimo–Uralic''' hypothesis posits that the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] language families belong to a common [[language family]] of which they are the two branches. Although substantial arguments for the hypothesis have been made, it is not generally accepted by [[linguist]]s. The best-known advocate of the Eskimo–Uralic hypothesis is [[Knut Bergsland]]. The hypothesis dates back to the pioneering Danish linguist [[Rasmus Rask]] in 1818, upon noticing similarities between [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic Eskimo]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30647">In [[cognitive psychology]], '''fast mapping''' is the term used for the hypothesized mental process whereby a new concept is learned (or a new hypothesis formed) based only on a single exposure to a given unit of information.  Fast mapping is thought by some researchers to be particularly important during [[language acquisition]] in young children, and may serve (at least in part) to explain the prodigious rate at which children gain vocabulary. In order to successfully use the fast mapping process, a child must possess the ability to use "referent selection" and "referent retention" of a novel word. There is evidence that this can be done by children as young as two years old, even with the constraints of minimal time and several distractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Chad Spiegel and Justin Halberda|url=http://www.psy.jhu.edu/~labforchilddevelopment/pdf_files/Spiegal%20Halberda%202011.pdf|title=Rapid fast-mapping abilities in 2-year-olds|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|volume=109|issue=1|pages=132–40|year=2010|accessdate=23 January 2014|doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2010.10.013|pmid=21145067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research in fast mapping has also shown that children are able to retain a newly learned word for a substantial amount of time after they are subjected to the word for the first time (Carey and Bartlett, 1978). Further research by Markson and Bloom (1997), showed that children can remember a novel word a week after it was presented to them even with only one exposure to the novel word. While children have also displayed the ability to have equal recall for other types of information, such as novel facts, their ability to extend the information seems to be unique to novel words. This suggests that fast mapping is a specified mechanism for word learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Behrend, D.A., Scofield, J., &amp; Kleinknecht, E.E.|title=Beyond fast mapping: Young children's extensions of novel words and novel facts|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2001|volume=37|issue=5|pages=698–705|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.5.698|pmid=11552764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was first formally articulated and the term 'fast mapping' coined by [[Harvard]] researchers [[Susan Carey]] and Elsa Bartlett in 1978.&lt;ref name="Carey"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Carey, S.  |author2=Bartlett, E. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1978|title=Acquiring a single new word|conference=Proceedings of the Stanford Child Language Conference|volume=15|pages=17–29}} (Republished in Papers and Reports on Child Language Development 15, 17–29.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence against ==
Today, there is evidence to suggest that children do not learn words through 'fast mapping' but rather learn probabilistic, predictive relationships between objects and sounds that develop over time. Evidence for this comes, for example, from children's struggles to understand color words: although infants can distinguish between basic color categories,&lt;ref name="Bornstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bornstein | first1 = M. H. | last2 = Kessen | first2 = W. | last3 = Weiskopf | first3 = S. | year = 1976 | title = Color vision and hue categorization in young human infants | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 115–129 | doi=10.1037/0096-1523.2.1.115| pmid = 1262792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many sighted children use color words in the same way that blind children do up until the fourth year.&lt;ref name="Gleitman"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Landau, B., &amp; Gleitman, L. R.|year=1985|title=Language and experience: Evidence from the blind child|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, words such as "blue" and "yellow" appear in their vocabularies and they produce them in appropriate places in speech, but their application of individual color terms is haphazard and interchangeable. If shown a blue cup and asked its color, typical three-year-olds seem as likely to answer "red" as "blue." These difficulties persist up until around age four, even after hundreds of explicit training trials.&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rice, N.|year=1980|title=Cognition to language|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=University Park Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability for children to understand color stems from the cognitive process of whole object constraint. Whole object constraint is the idea that a child will understand that a novel word represents the entirety of that object. Then, if the child is presented with further novel words, they attach inferred meanings to the object. However, color is the last attribute to be considered because it explains the least about the object itself. Children's behavior clearly indicates that they have knowledge of these words, but this knowledge is far from complete; rather it appears to be predictive, as opposed to all-or-none.

=== Alternate theories ===
An alternate theory of deriving the meaning of newly learned words by young children during language acquisition stems from John Locke's "associative proposal theory". Compared to the "intentional proposal theory", associative proposal theory refers to the deduction of meaning by comparing the novel object to environmental stimuli.  A study conducted by Yu &amp; Ballard (2007), introduced cross-situational learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chen, Yu|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~dll/papers/yu_psychscience07.pdf|title=Rapid Word Learning Under Uncertainty via Cross-Situational Statistics|journal=Psychological Science|volume=18|issue=5|year=2006|accessdate=18 September 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01915.x|pmid=17576281|pages=414–420|citeseerx=10.1.1.385.7473}}&lt;/ref&gt; a method based on Locke's theory. Cross-situtational learning theory is a mechanism in which the child learns meaning of words over multiple exposures in varying contexts in an attempt to eliminate uncertainty of the word's true meaning on an exposure-by-exposure basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank, Michael|url=http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers/F-chapterunderreview.pdf|title=Learning words through probabilistic inferences about speakers' communicative intentions|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, more recent studies&lt;ref name="Medina"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Medina, T. N., Snedeker, J., Trueswell, J. C., and Gleitman, L. R.|year=2010|title=How words can and cannot be learned by observation|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105040108|pmid=21576483|pmc=3107260|pages=9014–9019|volume=108|issue=22|journal=PNAS|url=http://www.ircs.upenn.edu/~truesweb/lila_pdfs/Medina%20Snedeker%20Trueswell%20&amp;%20Gleitman%202011%20-%20word-learning%20by%20observation.pdf|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.9014M}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that some amount of fast mapping does take place, questioning the validity of previous laboratory studies that aim to show that probabilistic learning does occur.  A critique to the theory of fast mapping is how can children connect the meaning of the novel word with the novel word after just one exposure? For example, when showing a child a blue ball and saying the word "blue" how does the child know that the word blue explains the color of the ball, not the size, or shape? If children learn words by fast mapping than they must use inductive reasoning to understand the meaning associated with the novel word. A popular theory to explain this inductive reasoning is that children apply [[Word learning biases|word-learning constraints]] to the situation where a novel word is introduced. There are speculations as to why this is; Markman and Wachtel (1988) conducted a study that helps explain the possible underlying principles of fast mapping. They claim children adhere to the theories of [[Word learning biases#cite note-Hansen-3|whole-object bias]], the assumption that a novel label refers to the entire object rather than its parts, color, substance or other properties, and mutual exclusivity bias, the assumption that only one label applies to each object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = M.B. | last2 = Markman | first2 = E.M. | year = 2009 | title = Children's use of mutual exclusivity to learn labels for parts of objects | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 592–596 | doi=10.1037/a0014838| pmid = 19271842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment, children were presented with an object that they either were familiar with or was presented with a whole object term. Markman and Watchel concluded that the mere juxtaposition between familiar and novel terms may assist in part term acquisition. In other words, children will put constraints on themselves and assume the novel term refers to the whole object in view rather than to its parts.&lt;ref name=Almgren&gt;{{cite book|authors=Braisby, Nick; Dockrell, Julie E. and Best, Rachel M.|year=2001|chapter=Children's acquisition of science terms: does fast mapping work?|editors=Almgren, Margareta; Barreña, Adoni; Ezeizabarrena, María-José; Idiazabal, Itziar and MacWhinney, Brian |title=Research on child language acquisition: proceedings of the 8th Conference of the International Association for the Study of Child Language|location=Somerville, MA, USA|publisher=Cascadilla Press|pp=1066–1087|url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/3641/1/IASCL_Paper_II.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been six lexical constraints proposed (reference, extendibility, object scope, categorical scope, novel name, conventionality) that guide a child's learning of a novel word.&lt;ref name=Almgren/&gt; When learning a new word children apply these constraints. However, this purposed method of constraints is not flawless. If children use these constraints there are many words that children will never learn such as actions, attributes, and parts. Studies have found that both toddlers and adults were more likely to categorize an object by its shape than its size or color.&lt;ref name=Trueswell/&gt;

==Cross-situational learning versus propose but verify==
The next question in fast mapping theory is how exactly is the meaning of the novel word learned? An experiment performed in October 2012 by the Department of Psychology by University of Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name=Trueswell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trueswell|first1=John C.|last2=Medina|first2=Tamara Nicol|last3=Hafri|first3=Alon|last4=Gleitman|first4=Lila R.|title=Propose but verify: Fast mapping meets cross-situational word learning|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=February 2013|volume=66|issue=1|pages=126–156|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2012.10.001|pmid=23142693|pmc=3529979|bibcode=1992CogPs..24..535V}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers attempted to determine if fast mapping occurs via cross-situational learning or by another method, "Propose but verify". In cross-situational learning, listeners hear a novel word and store multiple conjectures of what the word could mean based on its situational context. Then after multiple exposures the listener is able to target the meaning of the word by ruling out conjectures. In propose but verify, the learner makes a single conjecture about the meaning of the word after hearing the word used in context. The learner then carries that conjecture forward to be reevaluated and modified for consistency when the word is used again. The results of the experiment seems to support that propose but verify is the way by which learners fast map new words.&lt;ref name=Trueswell/&gt;

=== Criticisms ===
There is also controversy over whether words learned by fast mapping are retained or forgotten. Previous research has found that generally, children retain a newly learned word for a period of time after learning. In the aforementioned Carey and Bartlett study (1978), children who were taught the word "chromium" were found to keep the new lexical entry in working memory for several days, illustrating a process of gradual lexical alignment known as "extended mapping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swingley|first1=Daniel|title=Fast Mapping and Slow Mapping in Children's Word Learning|journal=Language Learning and Development|date=30 June 2010|volume=6|issue=3|pages=179–183|doi=10.1080/15475441.2010.484412|url=http://www.psych.upenn.edu/~swingley/papers/swingley_LLD10_fastmap.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study, performed by Markson and Bloom (1997), showed that children remembered words up to 1 month after the study was conducted. However, more recent studies have shown that words learned by fast mapping tend to be forgotten over time. In a study conducted by Vlach and Sandhofer (2012), memory supports, which had been included in previous studies, were removed. This removal appeared to result in a low retention of words over time. This is a possible explanation for why previous studies showed high retention of words learned by fast mapping.&lt;ref name=Vlach/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Some researchers are concerned that experiments testing for fast mapping are produced in artificial settings. They feel that fast mapping doesn't occur as often in more real life, natural situations. They believe that testing for fast mapping should focus more on the actual understanding of a word instead of just its reproduction. For some, testing to see if the child can use the new word in a different situation constitutes true knowledge of a word, rather than simply identifying the new word.&lt;ref name=Almgren/&gt;

== Variables affecting an individual's fast mapping ability==

=== Bilingualism ===

When learning novel words, it is believed that early exposure to multiple linguistic systems facilitates the acquisition of new words later in life. This effect was referred to by Kaushanskaya and Marian (2009) as the bilingual advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaushanskaya|first1=M|last2=Marian|first2=V|title=The Bilingual Advantage in Novel Word Learning|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=16|issue=4|pages=705–710|doi=10.3758/pbr.16.4.705|pmid=19648456|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, a bilingual individual's ability to fast map can vary greatly throughout their life.

During the language acquisition process, a child may require a greater amount of time to determine a correct referent than a child who is a monolingual speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alt|first=Mary|author2=Christina Meyers |author3=Cecilia Figueroa |title=Factors That Influence Fast Mapping in Children Exposed to Spanish and English|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|year=2013|volume=56|issue=4|pages=1237–38|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2012/11-0092)|pmid=23816663|pmc=4487618}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time a bilingual child is of school age, they perform equally on naming tasks when compared to monolingual children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheng|first1=Li|last2=McGregor|first2=Karla|last3=Marian|first3=Viorica|title=Lexical-Semantic Organization in Bilingual Children: Evidence from a Repeated Word Association Task|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|date=June 2006|volume=49|issue=3|pages=572–587|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2006/041)|pmc=1894819|pmid=16787896}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of adulthood, bilingual individuals have acquired word-learning strategies believed to be of assistance on fast mapping tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marian|first1=V|last2=Faroqi-Shah|first2=Y|last3=Kaushanskaya|first3=M|last4=Blumenfeld|first4=H|last5=Sheng|first5=L|title=Bilingualism: Consequences for Language, Cognition, Development, and the Brain|journal=ASHA Leader|date=2009|volume=14|issue=13|pages=10–13|doi=10.1044/leader.FTR2.14132009.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is speech practice, a strategy where the participant listens and reproduces the word in order to assist in remembering and decrease the likelihood of forgetting .&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Bilingualism can increase an individual's cognitive abilities and contribute to their success in fast mapping words, even when they are using a nonnative language.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fong Kan|first1=Pui|last2=Sadagopan|first2=Neeraja|last3=Janich|first3=Lauren|last4=Andrade|first4=Marixa|title=Effects of Speech Practice on Fast Mapping in Monolingual and Bilingual Speakers|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|date=June 2014|volume=57|issue=3|pages=929–941|doi=10.1044/2013_jslhr-l-13-0045|pmid=24167242}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Socioeconomic status ===

Children growing up in a low-socioeconomic status environment receive less attention than those in high-socioeconomic status environments. As a result, these children may be exposed to less words and therefore their language development may suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirk | first1 = E. | last2 = Howlett | first2 = N. | last3 = Pine | first3 = K.

When working with children from low SES homes, providing a context of the word that attributes meaning, is a linguistic strategy that can benefit the child's word knowledge development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer|first1=E.J|last2=Schuele|first2=C|title=An Examination of Fast Mapping Skills in Preschool Children from Families with Low Socioeconomic Status|journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics|volume=26|issue=10|pages=845–862|doi=10.3109/02699206.2012.705215|year=2012|pmid=22954365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face-to-face interaction ===
Three learning supports that have been proven to help with the fast mapping of words are saliency, repetition and generation of information.&lt;ref name=Vlach&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vlach|first1=Haley|last2=Sandhofer|first2=Catherine|title=Fast mapping across time: memory processes support children's retention of learned words|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=February 2012|volume=3|pages=1–8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00046|pmc=3286766|pmid=22375132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of [[face-to-face interaction]] a child has with their parent affects his or her ability to fast map novel words. Interaction with a parent leads to greater exposure to words in different contexts, which in turn promotes language acquisition. Face to face interaction cannot be replaced by educational shows because although repetition is used, children do not receive the same level of correction or trial and error from simply watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christakis | first1 = DA | last2 = Gilkerson | first2 = J | last3 = Richards | first3 = JA | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Audible Television and Decreased Adult Words, Infant Vocalizations, and Conversational Turns: A Population-Based Study | url = | journal = Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med | volume = 163 | issue = 6| pages = 554–558 | doi = 10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.61 | pmid = 19487612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a child is asked to generate the word it promotes the transition to long-term memory to a larger extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bertsch|first1=Sharon|last2=Pesta|first2=B.J|last3=Wiscott|first3=R|last4=McDaniel|first4=M|title=The generation effect: A meta-analytic review|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date=2007|volume=35|issue=2|doi=10.3758/bf03193441|pages=201–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence of fast mapping in other animals ==
It appears that fast mapping is not only limited to humans, but can occur in dogs as well. In an experiment, a dog, named Rico, was able to learn the labels of over 200 various items. He was also able to identify novel objects simply by exclusion learning. Exclusion learning occurs when one learns the name of a novel object because one is already familiar with the names of other objects belonging to the same group. The researchers, who conducted the experiment, mention the possibility that a language acquisition device specific to humans does not control fast mapping.  They believe that fast mapping is possibly directed by simple memory mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaminski | first1 = J | last2 = Call | first2 = J | last3 = Fischer | first3 = J | year = 2004 | title = Word Learning in a Domestic Dog: Evidence for "Fast Mapping | url = | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5677| pages = 1682–1683 | doi=10.1126/science.1097859 | pmid=15192233| bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1682K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the deaf population ==
A study by Lederberg et al., was performed to determine if deaf and hard of hearing children fast map to learn novel words. In the study, when the novel word was introduced, the word was both spoken and signed. Then the children were asked to identify the referent object and even extend the novel word to identify a similar object. The results of the study indicated that deaf and hard of hearing children do perform fast mapping to learn novel words. However, compared to children with normal hearing (aging toddlers to 5 years old) the deaf and hard of hearing children did not fast map as accurately and successfully. The results showed a slight delay which disappeared as the children were a maximum of 5 years old. The conclusion that was drawn from the study is that the ability to fast map has a relationship to the size of the lexicon. The children with normal hearing had a larger lexicon and therefore were able to more accurately fast map compared to deaf and hard of hearing children who did not have as large of a lexicon. It is by around age 5 that deaf and hard of hearing children have a similar size lexicon to 5 year old children of normal hearing. This evidence supports the idea that fast mapping requires inductive reasoning so the larger the lexicon (number of known words) the easier it is for the child to reason out the accurate meaning for the novel word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Diane Clark|author2=Marc Marschark|author3=Michael A. Karchmer|year=2001|title=Context, Cognition, and Deafness|pages=103–107|publisher=Gallaudet University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of cochlear implants (CIs), there are variegated opinions on whether cochlear implants impact a child's ability to become a more successful fast mapper.  In 2000, a study by Kirk, Myomoto, and others determined that there was a general correlation between the age of Cochlear Implant implementation and improved lexical skills (e.g. fast mapping and other vocabulary growth skills). They believed that children given implants prior to two years of age yielded higher success rates than older children between five and seven years of age.  With that said, researchers at the University of Iowa wish to amend that very generalization.  In 2013, "Word Learning Processes in Children with Cochlear Implants" by Elizabeth Walker and others indicated that although there may be a some levels of increased vocabulary acquisition in CI individuals, many post-implantees generally were slower developers of his/her own lexicon.  Walker bases her claims on another research study in 2007 (Tomblin et al.)  One of the purposes of this study was to note a CI child's ability to comprehend and retain novel words with related referents.  When compared with non-deaf children, the CI children had lower success scores in retention.  This finding was based on scorings obtained from their test: from 0 to 6 (0 the worst, 6 the best), CI children averaged a score around a 2.0 whereas non-deaf children scored higher (roughly 3.86).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Walker, Elizabeth|author2=McGregor, Karla|author3=Bacon, Sid|author4=Tobey, Emily|title=Word Learning Processes in Children with Cochlear Implants|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, &amp; Hearing Research|volume=56|issue=2|pages=375–87|year=2013|pmid=22896047|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2012/11-0343)|pmc=3578980 |url=https://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In individuals with ADHD==
An experiment was performed to assess fast mapping in adults with typical language abilities, disorders of spoken/written language (hDSWL), and adults with hDSWL and ADHD. 
The conclusion draw from the experiment revealed that adults with ADHD were the least accurate at "mapping semantic features and slower to respond to lexical labels." 
The article reasoned that the tasks of fast mapping requires high attentional demand and so "a lapse in attention could lead to diminished encoding of the new information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mary|first=Alt|author2=Michelle L. Gutmann|title=Fast mapping semantic features: Performance of adults with normal language, history of disorders of spoken and written language, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder on a word learning task|journal=J Communication Disorders|volume=42|issue=5|date=April 5, 2009|pages=347–364|pmid=19439319|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2009.03.004|pmc=2771630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In individuals with language deficits==

Fast mapping in individuals with [[aphasia]] has gained research attention due to its effect on speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Research done by Blumstein makes an important distinction between those with [[Broca's aphasia]], who are limited in physical speech, as compared to those with [[Wernicke's aphasia]], who cannot link words with meaning. In Broca's aphasia, Blumstein found that whereas individuals with Wernicke's aphasia performed at the same level as the normal control group, those with Broca's aphasia showed slower reaction times for word presentations after reduced voice onset time stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blumstein, S. E.|author2=Milberg, W.|author3=Brown, T.|author4=Hutchinson, A.|author5=Kurowski, K.|author6=Burton, M. W.|year=2000|lastauthoramp=y|title=The mapping from sound structure to the lexicon in aphasia: Evidence from rhyme and repetition priming|journal=Brain and Language|volume=72|issue=2|pages=75–99|pmid=10722782|doi=10.1006/brln.1999.2276}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, when stimuli were acoustically altered, individuals with Broca's aphasia experienced difficulty recognizing the novel stimuli upon second presentation. Bloomstein's findings reinforce the crucial difference between one's ability to retain novel stimuli versus the ability to express novel stimuli. Because individuals with Wernicke's aphasia are only limited in their understanding of semantic meaning, it makes sense that the participant's novel stimulus recall would not be affected. On the other hand, those with Broca's aphasia lack the ability to produce speech, in effect hindering their ability to recall novel stimuli. Although individuals with Broca's aphasia are limited in their speech production, it is not clear whether they simply cannot formulate the physical speech or if they actually did not process the stimuli.

Research has also been done investigating fast mapping abilities in children with language deficits.  One study done by Dollaghan compared children with normal language to those with expressive syntactic deficits, a type of specific language impairment characterized by simplified speech.  The study found that normal and language impaired children did not differ in their ability to connect the novel word to referent or to comprehend the novel word after a single exposure.  The only difference was that the language-impaired children were less successful in their production of the novel word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dollaghan, C. |year=1987|title=Fast Mapping in Normal and Language-Impaired Children|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders|volume=52|issue=3|pages=218–222|pmid=3455444|doi=10.1044/jshd.5203.218}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that expressive language deficits are unrelated to the ability to connect word and referent in a single exposure.  The problem for children with those deficits arises only when trying to convert that mental representation into verbal speech.

==In individuals with intellectual disabilities==
A few researchers looked at fast mapping abilities in boys with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), also referred to as [[autism spectrum]], and boys with [[fragile X syndrome]] (FXS). The experimental procedure consisted of a presentation phase where two objects were presented, one of which was a novel object with a nonsense word name. This was followed by a comprehension testing phase, which assessed the boys' ability to remember and correctly select the novel objects. Even though all groups in the study had fast mapping performances above chance levels, in comparison to boys showing typical development, those with ASD and FXS demonstrated much more difficulty in comprehending and remembering names assigned to the novel objects. The authors concluded that initial processes involved in associative learning, such as fast mapping, are hindered in boys with FXS and ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDuffie | first1 = A. | last2 = Kover | first2 = S.

==Computational models==
Research in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] to reproduce computationally this ability, termed [[one-shot learning]]. This is pursued to reduce the learning curve, as other models like [[reinforcement learning]] need thousand of exposures to a situation to learn it.

'''Fluency''' (also called '''volubility''' and '''eloquency''') is the property of a [[person]] or of a [[system]] that delivers [[information]] quickly and with [[expertise]].

== Language use ==
{{further|Language proficiency}}Language fluency is one of a variety of terms used to characterize or measure a person's language ability,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Bilingual Education|last=González|first=Josué M.|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781412937207|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used in conjunction with accuracy and complexity.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58970182|title=Analysing learner language|author=Ellis, Rod|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Barkhuizen, Gary Patrick.|isbn=0194316343|location=Oxford|oclc=58970182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no widely agreed-upon definitions or measures of language fluency,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Francine|title=What do we mean by fluency?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0346-251X(97)00046-8|journal=System|volume=25|issue=4|pages=535–544|doi=10.1016/s0346-251x(97)00046-8|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt; someone is typically said to be fluent if their use of the [[language]] appears ''fluid'', or natural, coherent, and easy as opposed to slow, halting use.&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; In other words, fluency is often described as the ability to [[Language production|produce language]] on demand and be understood.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

Varying definitions of fluency characterize it by the language user’s automaticity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=R.|date=1992|title=Psychological mechanisms underlying second language fluency|url=|journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition|volume=14|pages=357–385|via=|doi=10.1017/s0272263100011189}}&lt;/ref&gt; their speed and coherency of language use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual differences in language ability and language behavior|last=Fillmore|first=C.

Language fluency is sometimes contrasted with accuracy (or correctness of language use, especially grammatical correctness)&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; and complexity (or a more encompassing knowledge of vocabulary and discourse strategies).&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; Fluency, accuracy, and complexity are distinct but interrelated components of [[language acquisition]] and [[Language proficiency|proficiency]].

=== Types of fluency ===
There are four commonly discussed types of fluency: reading fluency, oral fluency, oral-reading fluency, and written or compositional fluency. These types of fluency are interrelated, but do not necessarily develop in tandem or linearly. One may develop fluency in certain type(s) and be less fluent or nonfluent in others.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

In the sense of proficiency, "fluency" encompasses a number of related but separable skills:
* '''Reading fluency''' refers to the link between the recognition of words while reading and [[reading comprehension]],&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rasinski/&gt; which manifests itself in the speed and accuracy that one is able to read text.&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt; Research on reading fluency aligns concepts of accuracy, automaticity, and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].&lt;ref name=Rasinski/&gt;  To achieve reading fluency, readers must have knowledge of the content of the language as well as the [[vocabulary]] being used. Interventions designed to help children learn to read fluently generally include some form of repeated reading, but this process may differ for children with [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], who may struggle with reading fluency.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;
* '''Oral fluency''' or '''speaking fluency''' is a measurement both of production and reception of [[speech]], as a fluent speaker must be able to understand and respond to others in conversation. [[Spoken language]] is typically characterized by seemingly non-fluent qualities (e.g., fragmentation, pauses, false starts, hesitation, repetition) because of ‘task stress.’ How orally fluent one is can therefore be understood in terms of perception, and whether these qualities of speech can be perceived as expected and natural (i.e., fluent) or unusual and problematic (i.e., non-fluent).&lt;ref name=Guillot&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44961785|title=Fluency and its teaching|author=Guillot, Marie-Noëlle,|date=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=1853594393|location=Clevedon, U.K.|oclc=44961785}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oral reading fluency''' is sometimes distinguished from oral fluency. Oral reading fluency refers to the ability to read words accurately and quickly while using good vocal expression and phrasing.&lt;ref name=Rasinski&gt;{{cite book |author=Rasinski, T. V. |year=2006 |chapter=A brief history of reading fluency |editor1=Samuels, S. |author2=Farstrup, A. |title=What research has to say about fluency instruction |pages=70–93 |location=Newark, DE |publisher=International Reading Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral reading fluency is often linked to Schreiber’s Theory of Prosody, which places importance on the [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], rhythm, and expressiveness of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreiber|first=Peter A.|date=1991-06-01|title=Understanding prosody's role in reading acquisition|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405849109543496|journal=Theory Into Practice|volume=30|issue=3|pages=158–164|doi=10.1080/00405849109543496|issn=0040-5841}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Written or compositional fluency''' can be measured in a variety of ways. Researchers have measured by length of the [[Composition (language)|composition]] (especially under timed conditions), words produced per minute, sentence length, or words per clause. Ratio measures (e.g., words per clause, words per sentence, and words per error-free sentence) have historically been most valid and reliable.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40664312|title=Second language development in writing : measures of fluency, accuracy, &amp; complexity|author1=Wolfe-Quintero, Kate|date=1998|publisher=Second Language Teaching &amp; Curriculum Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa|author2=Shunji, Inagaki |author3=Hae-Young, Kim|isbn=9780824820695|location=Honolulu|oclc=40664312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluency in second-language acquisition ===

Because an assessment of fluency is typically a measure or characterization of one's language ability, determining fluency may be a more challenging task when the speaker is acquiring a second language. It is generally thought that the later in life a learner approaches the study of a foreign language, the harder it is to acquire receptive  ([[Hearing (sense)|auditory]]) comprehension and fluent production (speaking) skills. For adults, once their mother tongue has already been established, the acquisition of a second language can come more slowly and less completely, ultimately affecting fluency. However, the [[critical period hypothesis]] is a hotly debated topic, with some scholars stating that adults can in fact become fluent in acquiring a second language. For instance, reading and writing skills in a foreign language can be acquired more easily even after the primary [[language acquisition]] period of youth is over.&lt;ref name=harrell/&gt;

So although it is often assumed that young children learn languages more easily than adolescents and adults,{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}} the reverse is in fact true; older learners are faster. The only exception to this rule is in [[pronunciation]]. Young children invariably learn to speak their second language with native-like pronunciation, whereas learners who start learning a language at an older age only rarely reach a native-like level.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}}

====Second-language acquisition in children====

Since childhood is a [[critical period]], widespread opinion holds that it is easier for young children to learn a second language than it is for adults.  Children can even acquire native fluency when exposed to the language on a consistent basis with rich interaction in a social setting.  In addition to capacity, factors like; 1) motivation, 2) aptitude, 3) personality characteristics, 4) age of acquisition 5) first language typology 6) socio-economic status and 7) quality and context of L2 input play a role in L2 acquisitions rate and building fluency.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|title=Second Language Acquisition in Childhood|last=Paradis|first=Johanne|date=August 2006|website=University of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|archive-date=2018-05-09|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second language acquisition (SLA) has the ability to influence children’s cognitive growth and linguistic development.

Skill that consists of ability to produce words in target language develops until adolescence.  Natural ability to acquire a new language with a deliberate effort may begin to diminish around puberty i.e. 12–14 years of age.  Learning environment, comprehensible instructional materials, teacher, and the learner are indispensable elements in SLA and developing fluency in children.  Extensive reading in L2 can offer twofold benefits in foreign language learning i.e. "reading to comprehend English and reading to learn English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|title=The Role of Unput, Interaction and Output in the Development of Oral Fluency|last=Zhang|first=Shumei|date=December 2009|website=English Language Teaching|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202053320/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-02|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradis (2006)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; study on childhood language acquisition and building fluency examines how first and second language acquisition patterns are generally similar including vocabulary and morphosyntax.  Phonology of first language is usually apparent in SLA and initial L1 influence can be lifelong, even for child L2 learners.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Children can acquire a second language simultaneously (learn L1 and L2 at the same time) or sequentially (learn L1 first and then L2).  In the end, they develop fluency in both with one dominant language which is spoken largely by the community they live in.

According to one source, there are five stages of SLA and developing fluency:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McREL International|title=McREL - The Five Stages of Second Language Acquisition|date=2014-08-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|accessdate=2017-12-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|archivedate=2018-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2018}}

====Second-language acquisition in adults====

The process of learning a second language or "L2," among older learners differs from younger learners because of their [[working memory]]. Working memory, also connected to fluency because it deals with automatic responses, is vital to language acquisition. This happens when information is stored and manipulated temporarily. During working memory, words are filtered, processed, and rehearsed, and information is stored while focusing on the next piece of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackey | first1 = A. | last2 = Sachs | first2 = Rebecca | year = 2012 | title = Older Learners in SLA Research: A First Look at Working Memory, Feedback, and L2 Development | url = | journal = Language Learning | volume = 62 | issue = 3| page = 724 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2011.00649.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These false starts, pauses or repetitions found in fluency assessments, can also be found within one's working memory as part of communication.

Those with education at or below a high school level are least likely to take language classes. It has also been found that women and young immigrants are more likely to take language classes.&lt;ref&gt;Adamuti-Trache’ (2012). Language Acquisition Among Adult Immigrants in Canada: The Effect of Premigration Language. Adult Education Quarterly, 63(2), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Further, highly educated immigrants who are searching for skilled jobs – which require interpersonal and intercultural skills that are difficult to learn – are the most affected by lower fluency in the L2.

==Speech-language pathology==
Fluency is a [[speech language pathology]] term that means the smoothness or flow with which sounds, syllables, words and phrases are joined together when speaking quickly.&lt;ref name=harrell&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Fluency disorders" is used as a collective term for [[cluttering]] and [[stuttering]].  Both disorders have breaks in the fluidity of speech, and both have the fluency breakdown of repetition of parts of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65617513|title=Stuttering and cluttering : frameworks for understanding and treatment|last=9-|first=Ward, David, 1956 December|date=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781841693347|location=Hove [England]|oclc=65617513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In creativity ==

Studies in the assessment of creativity list fluency as one of the four primary elements in creative thinking, the others being flexibility, originality and elaboration. Fluency in creative thinking is seen as the ability to think of many diverse ideas quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16354591|title=The Nature of creativity : contemporary psychological perspectives|date=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Sternberg, Robert J.|isbn=052133036X|location=Cambridge|oclc=16354591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gangwon dialect''' is spoken in [[South Korea]]'s [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]] and in [[North Korea]]'s [[Kangwon Province (North Korea)|Kangwŏn Province]]. Although they are large provinces by area, relatively few people lived in the Gangwon Province. As a result, people living in the western side of Gangwon ([[Yeongseo]]) did not develop a highly distinctive dialect. However, the part of Gangwon that stretches on the eastern coast of Korea ([[Yeongdong (region)|Yeongdong]]), did develop a distinctive dialect. This is because the [[Taebaek Mountains]] bisect the Gangwon Province, and the people on eastern Gangwon are isolated from the high mountains. The Gangwon dialect uses tones distinguish homophonic words, much like [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] do.

'''Information and media literacy''' ('''IML''') enables people to interpret and make informed judgments as users of information and media, as well as to become skillful creators and producers of information and media messages in their own right.&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"/&gt;

Prior to the 1990s, the primary focus of [[information literacy]] was research skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422143339/http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media literacy]], a study that emerged around the 1970s, traditionally focuses on the analysis and the delivery of information through various forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html |title=About CML &amp;#124; Center for Media Literacy |publisher=Medialit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825191946/http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html |archivedate=2010-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the study of information literacy has been extended to include the study of media literacy in many countries like the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730105014/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx |date=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530015206/http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "information and media literacy" is used by [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15886&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Media and Information Literacy |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate the combined study from the existing study of information literacy. It is also referred to as information and communication technologies ([[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711210412/http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html |date=July 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/ICTREPORT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Educators such as [[Gregory Ulmer]] have also defined the field as [[electracy]].

IML is a combination of information literacy and media literacy. The purpose of being information and media literate is to engage in a digital society; one needs to be able to understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically. It is important to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204091732/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx |date=February 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformative nature of IML includes creative works and creating new knowledge; to publish and collaborate responsibly requires ethical, cultural and social understanding.

==21st-century students==
The IML learning capacities prepare students to be 21st century literate.  According to Jeff Wilhelm (2000), "technology has everything to do with literacy. And being able to use the latest electronic technologies has everything to do with being literate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm Literacy by Design:  Why is all This Technology so Important?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034957/http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports his argument with J. David Bolter's statement that "if our students are not reading and composing with various electronic technologies, then they are illiterate. They are not just unprepared for the future; they are illiterate right now, in our current time and context".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm's statement is supported by the 2005 Wired World Phase II (YCWW II) survey conducted by the Media Awareness Network of Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca |title=MediaSmarts |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 5000 Grade 4 – 11 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm |title=MediaSmarts |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425195852/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key findings of the survey were:
*62% of Grade 4 students prefer the [[Internet]].
*38% of Grade 4 students prefer the library.
*91% of Grade 11 students prefer the Internet.
*9% of Grade 11 students prefer the library.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005a, para. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Prensky (2001) uses the term "[[digital native]]" to describe people who have been brought up in a digital world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has been a pervasive element of young people's home lives. 94% of kids reported that they had Internet access at home, and a significant majority (61%) had a high-speed connection.

By the time kids reach Grade 11, half of them (51 percent) have their own Internet-connected computer, separate and apart from the family computer.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; The survey also showed that young Canadians are now among the most wired in the world. Contrary to the earlier stereotype of the isolated and awkward computer nerd, today's wired kid is a social kid.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, many students are better networked through the use of technology than most teachers and parents, who may not understand the abilities of technology. Students are no longer limited to desktop computera. They may use mobile technologies to graph mathematical problems, research a question for social studies, text message an expert for information, or send homework to a drop box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.wmich.edu/~b4poppen/IPhoneArticle3.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are accessing information by using [[MSN]], personal Web pages, [[Weblog]]s and [[social network service|social networking sites]].

== Teaching and learning in the 21st century ==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
Many teachers continue the tradition of teaching of the past 50 years. Traditionally teachers have been the experts sharing their knowledge with children. Technology, and the learning tools it provides access to, forces us to change to being facilitators of learning.  We have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information, and students as consumers of information, in order to meet the needs of digital students. Teachers not only need to learn to speak digital, but also to embrace the language of digital natives.

Language is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information.  Digital natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices. People born prior to 1988 are sometimes referred to as "digital immigrants."  They experience difficulty programming simple devices like a VCR.  Digital immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work.

Learning a language is best done early in a child's development.

In acquiring a second language, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of 6 and 7 seemed to be a cut-off point for bilinguals to achieve native-like proficiency.  After that age, second language learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would, while consisting of very few actual errors, have enough errors that would set them apart from the first language group.

Kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 are critical to student success as digital natives because not all students have a "digital"-rich childhood.  Students learning technological skills before Grade 3 can become equivalently bilingual. "Language-minority students who cannot read and write proficiently in English cannot participate fully in American schools, workplaces, or society. They face limited job opportunities and earning power." Speaking "digital" is as important as being literate in order to participate fully in North American society and opportunities.

==Students' struggle==
Many students are considered illiterate in media and information for various reasons. They may not see the value of media and information literacy in the 21st-century classroom.  Others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information.  Educators need to introduce IML to these students to help them become media and information literate.  Very little changes will be made if the educators are not supporting information and media literacy in their own classrooms.

Performance standards, the foundation to support them, and tools to implement them are readily available.  Success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established.  Shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary.

When the staff and community, working together, identify and clarify their values, beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do, an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; Using the capacity tools to assess IML will allow students, staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology.

The IML Performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student-learning needs are being met.  After assessing student IML, three questions can be asked:

* What does each student need to learn?
* How does one know whether students have met the capacities?
* How does one respond when students have difficulty in learning?

Teachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support.  Students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves.

==In the curriculum==
This integration of technology across the [[curriculum]] is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]].  In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. [[International Society for Technology in Education]] (ISTE)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=About_ISTE&lt;/ref&gt; has been developing a standard IML curriculum for the US and other countries by implementing the [[National Educational Technology Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net/ |title=NETS Implementation - home |publisher=Nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the UK, IML has been promoted among educators through an information literacy website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; developed by several organizations that have been involved in the field.

===US===
IML is included in the Partnership for the 21st Century program sponsored by the US Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314140756/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120 |archivedate=2009-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special mandates have been provided to Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522125507/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189 |archivedate=2009-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual school districts, such as the Clarkstown Central School District,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913115949/http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also developed their own information literacy curriculum. ISTE has also produced the National Educational Technology Standards for Students, Teachers and Administrators.

===Canada===
In [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], the Ministry of Education has de-listed the Information Technology K to 7 IRP &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/irp/resdocs/itk7.pdf Information Technology K to 7 IRP (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; as a stand-alone course.  It is still expected that all the prescribed learning outcomes continue to be integrated.

This integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]]. In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology.  Unfortunately, there has been no clear direction to implement IML.

The BC Ministry of Education published the Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/perf_stands/icti/ Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;  These standards provide performance standards expectations for Grade 5 to 10; however, they do not provide guidance for other grades, and the expectation for a Grade 5 and Grade 10 student are the same.

===Arab World===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In the Arab region, media and information literacy was largely ignored up until 2011, when the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut, the Open Society Foundations and the Arab-US Association for Communication Educators (AUSACE) launched a regional conference themed "New Directions: Digital and Media Literacy". The conference attracted significant attention from Arab universities and scholars, who discussed obstacles and needs to advance media literacy in the Arab region, including developing curricula in Arabic, training faculty and promoting the field. 

Following up on that recommendation, the Media Studies Program at AUB and the Open Society Foundations in collaboration with the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change launched in 2013 the first regional initiative to develop, vitalize, and advance media literacy education in the Arab region. The Media and Digital Literacy Academy of Beirut (MDLAB) offered an annual two-week summer training program in addition to working year-round to develop media literacy curricula and programs. The academy is conducted in Arabic and English and brings pioneering international instructors and professionals to teach advanced digital and media literacy concepts to young Arab academics and graduate students from various fields. MDLAB hopes that the participating Arab academics will carry what they learned to their countries and institutions and offers free curricular material in Arabic and English, including media literacy syllabi, lectures, exercises, lesson plans, and multi-media material, to assist and encourage the integration of digital and media literacy into Arab university and school curricula. 

In recognition of MDLAB's accomplishments in advancing media literacy education in the Arab region, the founder of MDLAB received the 2015 UNESCO-UNAOC International Media and Information Literacy Award. 

Prior to 2013, only two Arab universities offered media literacy courses: the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the American University of Sharjah (AUS). Three years after the launch of MDLAB, over two dozen Arab universities incorporated media literacy education into their curricula, both as stand-alone courses or as modules injected into their existing media courses. Among the universities who have full-fledged media literacy courses (as of 2015) are Lebanese American University (Lebanon), Birzeit University (Palestine), University of Balamand (Lebanon), Damascus University (Syria), Rafik Hariri University (Lebanon), Notre Dame University (Lebanon), Ahram Canadian University (Egypt), American University of Beirut (Lebanon), American University of Sharjah (UAE), and Al Azm University (Lebanon). The first Arab school to adopt media literacy as part of its strategic plan is the International College (IC) in Lebanon. Efforts to introduce media literacy to the region's other universities and schools continues with the help of other international organizations, such as UNESCO, UNAOC, AREACORE, DAAD, and OSF.

===Asia===

==Barriers==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
One barrier to learning to read is the lack of books, while a barrier to learning IML is the lack of technology access. Highlighting the value of IML helps to identify existing barriers within school infrastructure, staff development, and support systems.  While there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access, the biggest obstacle is school climate.

Marc Prensky&lt;ref&gt;Marc Prensky 2006, para. 25&lt;/ref&gt; identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions: "Let's admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that, given the opportunity to use them, students would vote with their attention, just as adults would 'vote with their feet' by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling."{{clarification needed|date=June 2018}}

The mindset of banning new technology, and fearing the bad things that can happen, can affect educational decisions. The decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives.

Any tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe.  Safety lessons are mandatory in industrial technology and science.  Yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology.

Not all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs.  One school district in Ontario banned digital devices from their schools.  Local schools have been looking at doing the same. These kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and not about teaching, learning or creating solutions.  Many barriers to IML exist.

'''Koryak''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔːr|i|æ|k}}) is a [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] language spoken by about 1,700 people in the easternmost extremity of [[Siberia]], mainly in [[Koryak Okrug]].  It is mostly spoken by [[Koryaks]].  Its close relative, the [[Chukchi language]], is spoken by about three times that number. The language together with Chukchi, [[Kerek language|Kerek]], [[Alutor language|Alutor]] and [[Itelmen language|Itelmen]] forms the Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family. Its native name in Koryak is нымылан ''nymylan'', but the Russian name is more common.

The Chukchi and Koryaks form a cultural unit with an economy based on [[reindeer herding]] and both have autonomy within the [[Russia|Russian Federation]].

'''Language''' is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of [[communication]], particularly the [[human]] ability to do so&lt;!--Do not remove the qualifier "human" without first reading the article or consulting the discussions about this issue.--&gt;; and '''a language''' is any specific example of such a system.

The scientific study of language is called [[linguistics]]. Questions concerning the [[philosophy of language]], such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated at least since [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] have argued that language originated from [[emotion]]s while others like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].

Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and [[dialect]]s. [[Natural language]]s are [[speech|spoken]] or [[sign language|signed]], but any language can be [[Encoding (semiotics)|encoded]] into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]&amp;nbsp;– for example, in [[Whistled language|whistling]], [[sign language|signed]], or [[braille]]. This is because human language is [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]]-independent. Depending on [[philosophy of language|philosophical perspectives]] regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, "language" may refer to the [[cognitive]] ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules. All languages rely on the process of [[semiosis]] to relate [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] to particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. [[Oral language|Oral]], [[sign language|manual]] and tactile languages contain a [[phonology|phonological]] system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or [[morpheme]]s, and a [[syntax|syntactic]] system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances.

Human language has the properties of [[Productivity (linguistics)|productivity]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], and relies entirely on social convention and learning. Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of [[animal communication]]. Language is thought to have originated when early [[hominin]]s started gradually changing their primate communication systems, acquiring the ability to form a [[Theory of mind|theory of other minds]] and a shared [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Chomsky|Fitch|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. Language is processed in many different locations in the [[human brain]], but especially in [[Broca's area|Broca's]] and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Humans [[language acquisition|acquire]] language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old. The use of language is deeply entrenched in human [[culture]]. Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language also has many social and cultural uses, such as signifying group [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[social stratification]], as well as [[social grooming]] and [[entertainment]].

Languages [[language change|evolve]] and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] by [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparing]] modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a [[language family]]. The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]] is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hindi]]; the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family]] includes [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]] and the other [[Chinese language]]s, and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]; the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic family]] includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the [[Bantu languages]] include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout [[Africa]]; and the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] include [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the [[Pacific]]. The languages of the [[Dravidian language|Dravidian family]], spoken mostly in Southern India, include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]].  Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become [[Language death|extinct]] by the year 2100.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Philosophy of language}}
The English word ''language'' derives ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s}}'' "tongue, speech, language" through [[Latin]] ''lingua'', "language; tongue", and [[Old French]] ''[[wikt:language#Old French|language]]''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=language |encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=3rd|year=1992|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is sometimes used to refer to [[code]]s, [[cipher]]s, and other kinds of [[constructed language|artificially constructed communication systems]] such as formally defined computer languages used for [[programming language|computer programming]]. Unlike conventional human languages, a [[formal language]] in this sense is a [[system]] of [[Sign (linguistics)|signs]] for [[encoding]] and decoding [[information]]. This article specifically concerns the properties of [[Natural language|natural human language]] as it is studied in the discipline of [[linguistics]].

As an object of linguistic study, "language" has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. "[[French language|French]]". The Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word ''langage'' for language as a concept, ''[[langue and parole|langue]]'' as a specific instance of a language system, and ''parole'' for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Lyons2"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking of language as a general concept, definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="LyonsIntro"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory.&lt;ref name="TraskLanguage"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pages=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as [[Gorgias]] and [[Plato]] debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.{{sfn|Bett|2010}}

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its debates about human origins, it became fashionable to speculate about the origin of language. Thinkers such as [[Rousseau]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world&amp;nbsp;– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led to the question of whether philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the [[linguistic turn]] and philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.{{sfn|Devitt|Sterelny|1999}}

===Mental faculty, organ or instinct===
One definition sees language primarily as the [[mind|mental faculty]] that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the [[human brain]]. Proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, [[creole languages]] and spontaneously developed sign languages such as [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]]. This view, which can be traced back to the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely [[innatism|innate]], for example, in [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] theory of [[Universal Grammar]], or American philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]]'s extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a [[cognitive science]] framework and in [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hauser|Fitch|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Pinker|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal symbolic system===
Another definition sees language as a [[formal system]] of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. This definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed [[structural linguistics|structural systems]] consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=93}} This [[structuralism|structuralist]] view of language was first introduced by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]],&lt;ref name="Saussure"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Saussure|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of Saussure's view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is [[Noam Chomsky]], the originator of the [[generative linguistics|generative theory of grammar]], who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars.{{sfn|Trask|2007|p=130}} Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the rudiments of what language is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Chomsky|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in [[formal logic]], in [[formal grammar|formal]] [[theoretical linguistics|theories of grammar]], and in applied [[computational linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=93, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|1998|pp=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and other [[formal logic]]ians.

===Tool for communication===
[[File:ASL family.jpg|right|thumb|A conversation in [[American Sign Language]]]]
Yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to exchange verbal or symbolic utterances. This definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment. [[Functional theories of grammar]] explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions, and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was "tailored" to serve the communicative needs of its users.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Van Valin|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of language is associated with the study of language in [[pragmatics|pragmatic]], [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]], and interactive frameworks, as well as in [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]]. Functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena, as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers. This view places importance on the study of [[linguistic typology]], or the classification of languages according to structural features, as it can be shown that processes of [[grammaticalization]] tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt; In the philosophy of language, the view of pragmatics as being central to language and meaning is often associated with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as [[J.L. Austin]], [[Paul Grice]], [[John Searle]], and [[Willard van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]].{{sfn|Nerlich|2010|p=192}}

===Unique status of human language===
{{main|Animal language|Great ape language}}

A number of features, many of which were described by [[Charles Hockett]] and called [[Hockett's design features|design features]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |title=The Problem of Universals in Language |last=Hockett |first=Charles F. |date=1966 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110023354/http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~swinters/371/designfeatures.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2013-05-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; set human language apart from other known systems of communication, such as those used by non-human [[Animal language|animals]].

Communication systems used by other animals such as [[Bee learning and communication|bees]] or [[great ape language|apes]] are closed systems that consist of a finite, usually very limited, number of possible ideas that can be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Hockett|1960}}; {{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human language is open-ended and [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]], meaning that it allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because human language is based on a dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences).&lt;ref name="Trask5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the [[chestnut-crowned babbler]], is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Crane |first2=Jodie S.|last3=Savage |first3=James L.|last4=Russel |first4=Andrew F. |last5=Townsend |first5=Simon W. |date=29 June 2015 |title=Experimental Evidence for Phonemic Contrasts in a Nonhuman Vocal System |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=13|issue=6|pages=e1002171|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002171|pmid=26121619 |pmc=4488142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Southern pied babbler|pied babblers]] have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Engesser |first1=Sabrina|last2=Ridley |first2=Amanda R.|last3=Townsend |first3=Simon W. |date=20 July 2017 |title=Element repetition rates encode functionally distinct information in pied babbler 'clucks' and 'purrs' |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=5|pages=953–60|doi=10.1007/s10071-017-1114-6|pmid=28730513|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/89798/7/WRAP-element-repetition-rates-encode-functionally-Townsend-2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of animals have proved to be able to acquire forms of communication through social learning: for instance a [[bonobo]] named [[Kanzi]] learned to express itself using a set of symbolic [[lexigram]]s. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gorilla [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]] reportedly uses as many as 1000 words in [[American Sign Language]], and understands 2000 words of spoken English. There are some doubts about whether her use of signs is based on complex understanding or simple [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]]; {{harvcoltxt|Candland|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Deacon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ [[grammatical categories|grammatical and semantic categories]], such as noun and verb, present and past, which may be used to express exceedingly complex meanings.&lt;ref name="Deacon 1997"/&gt; Human language is also unique in having the property of [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursivity]]: for example, a noun phrase can contain another noun phrase (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[[the chimpanzee]'s lips]&lt;/nowiki&gt;") or a clause can contain another clause (as in "&lt;nowiki&gt;[I see [the dog is running]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;").&lt;ref name="Hauser 2002"/&gt; Human language is also the only known natural communication system whose adaptability may be referred to as ''modality independent''. This means that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium, but through several. For example, spoken language uses the auditive modality, whereas [[sign language]]s and writing use the visual modality, and [[braille]] writing uses the tactile modality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=165–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called ''[[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]'', and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of [[bee]]s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique.&lt;ref name="Trask5"/&gt;

The [[Christian mythology|Biblical myth]] of the [[Tower of Babel]] is one such account; other cultures have different stories of how language arose.&lt;ref name="Haugen"/&gt;
}}
Theories about the origin of language differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are based on the idea that language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on the generative view of language pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]] see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ulbaek|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky is one prominent proponent of a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins.&lt;ref name="Ulbaek 1998"/&gt; He suggests that for scholars interested in the nature of language, "talk about the evolution of the language capacity is beside the point."{{sfn|Chomsky|1972|p=86}} Chomsky proposes that perhaps "some random mutation took place [...] and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}} Though cautioning against taking this story literally, Chomsky insists that "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language."{{sfn|Chomsky|2000|p=4}}

Continuity-based theories are held by a majority of scholars, but they vary in how they envision this development. Those who see language as being mostly innate, for example psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], hold the precedents to be [[animal cognition]],&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt; whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist [[Michael Tomasello]], see it as having developed from [[animal communication]] in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation.&lt;ref name="Tomasello 2008"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Tomasello|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from [[music]], a view already espoused by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], and [[Charles Darwin]]. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist [[Steven Mithen]].{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=466–507}} [[Stephen R. Anderson|Stephen Anderson]] states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered&amp;nbsp;... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Anderson|2012|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because language emerged in the early [[prehistory]] of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and it is believed that no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a [[larynx]] capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=250–92}}

It was mostly undisputed that pre-human [[australopithecine]]s did not have communication systems significantly different from those found in [[great ape]]s in general. However, a 2017 study on [[Origin of language#Ardipithecus ramidus|Ardipithecus ramidus]] challenges this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jchb.2017.03.001 |pmid=28363458 |title=Ardipithecus ramidus  and the evolution of language and singing: An early origin for hominin vocal capability |journal=HOMO |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=101–21 |year=2017 |last1=Clark |first1=Gary |last2=Henneberg |first2=Maciej }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.8 million years ago) or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with [[Anatomically modern humans|Anatomically Modern ''Homo sapiens'']] with the [[behavioral modernity|Upper Paleolithic revolution]] less than 100,000 years ago.{{sfn|Foley|1997|pp=70–74}}{{sfn|Fitch|2010|pp=292–93}}

{{main|Linguistics|History of linguistics}}
The study of language, [[linguistics]], has been developing into a science since the first grammatical descriptions of particular languages in [[India]] more than 2000 years ago, after the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. Modern linguistics is a science that concerns itself with all aspects of language, examining it from all of the theoretical viewpoints described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Newmeyer|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdisciplines===
The academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles, all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics. For example, [[descriptive linguistics]] examines the grammar of single languages, [[theoretical linguistics]] develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages, [[sociolinguistics]] studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description, [[neurolinguistics]] studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories, [[computational linguistics]] builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses, and [[historical linguistics]] relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the [[comparative method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
The formal study of language is often considered to have started in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 5th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. However, [[Sumer]]ian scribes already studied the differences between [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammar around 1900 BC. Subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2001|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century AD, the French [[Port-Royal Grammar]]ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by British [[philologist]] and expert on ancient India [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1914|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.&lt;ref name="Saussure"/&gt;

By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still fundamental in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|Langue-parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue''), from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clarke|1990|pages=143–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary linguistics===
In the 1960s, [[Noam Chomsky]] formulated the [[Generative linguistics|generative theory of language]]. According to this theory, the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]]; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school, [[Functional theories of grammar|functional theories of language]] propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. [[Formal grammar|Formal theories of grammar]] seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Functional grammar analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyzes the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approaches not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate even as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formal and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation"; {{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of [[cognitive linguistics]] interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|Cruse|2004|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological and neural architecture of language and speech==
Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. The production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus, the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds, and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=11–14, 105–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[genetics|genetic]] bases for human language is at an early stage: the only gene that has definitely been implicated in language production is [[FOXP2]], which may cause a kind of [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia|congenital language disorder]] if affected by [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fisher|Lai|Monaco|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
{{main|Neurolinguistics|Language processing in the brain}}
[[File:Brain Surface Gyri.SVG|thumb|Language Areas of the brain. The [[Angular Gyrus]] is represented in orange, [[Supramarginal Gyrus]] is represented in yellow, [[Broca's area]] is represented in blue, [[Wernicke's area]] is represented in green, and the [[Primary Auditory Cortex]] is represented in pink.]] The brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity; it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited, though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques. The discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called [[neurolinguistics]].&lt;ref name="Lesser205"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lesser|1989|pp=205–06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is [[Wernicke's area]], which is in the posterior section of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop [[receptive aphasia]], a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal [[syntax|sentence structure]]. The second area is [[Broca's area]], in the posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop [[expressive aphasia]], meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|pp=105–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, [[word repetition]], and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences. Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|p=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With technological advances in the late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[electrophysiology]] to study language processing in individuals without impairments.&lt;ref name="Lesser205"/&gt;

Spoken language relies on human physical ability to produce [[sound]], which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the [[ear drum]]. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box ([[larynx]]), and the upper vocal tract&amp;nbsp;– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the different parts of the speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of [[Segment (linguistics)|segmental and suprasegmental]] elements. The segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences, which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts, such as the Roman script. In free flowing speech, there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next, nor usually are there any audible pauses between words. Segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations, and they can be either vowels or consonants. Suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[phonation]] type, voice [[timbre]], and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], all of which may have effects across multiple segments.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consonant]]s and [[vowel]] segments combine to form [[syllable]]s, which in turn combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations. [[Acoustics|Acoustically]], these different segments are characterized by different [[formant]] structures, that are visible in a [[spectrogram]] of the recorded sound wave (See illustration of Spectrogram of the formant structures of three English vowels). Formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPA"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|pp=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract. They vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; Vowels are called ''[[Close vowel|close]]'' when the lips are relatively closed, as in the pronunciation of the vowel {{ipa|[i]}} (English "ee"), or ''[[open vowel|open]]'' when the lips are relatively open, as in the vowel {{ipa|[a]}} (English "ah"). If the tongue is located towards the back of the mouth, the quality changes, creating vowels such as {{ipa|[u]}} (English "oo"). The quality also changes depending on whether the lips are [[Roundedness|rounded]] as opposed to unrounded, creating distinctions such as that between {{ipa|[i]}} (unrounded front vowel such as English "ee") and {{ipa|[y]}} ([[rounded front vowel]] such as German "ü").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=11–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, [[alveolar ridge]], [[palate]], [[Soft palate|velum]], [[uvula]], or [[glottis]]. Each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by [[manner of articulation]], or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called ''[[occlusive]]'' or ''[[stop consonant|stop]]'', or different degrees of aperture creating ''[[fricative]]s'' and ''[[approximant consonant|approximants]]''. Consonants can also be either ''[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced or unvoiced]]'', depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English {{ipa|[s]}} in ''bus'' ([[sibilant|unvoiced sibilant]]) from {{ipa|[z]}} in ''buzz'' ([[Voiced alveolar sibilant#Voiced alveolar sibilant|voiced sibilant]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1989|pp=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity, and these are called ''[[Nasal consonant|nasals]]'' or ''[[Nasalization|nasalized]]'' sounds. Other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called ''[[Lateral consonant|laterals]]'', because the air flows along both sides of the tongue), and the r-sounds (called ''[[rhotics]]'') that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream.&lt;ref name="IPA"/&gt;

By using these speech organs, humans can produce hundreds of distinct sounds: some appear very often in the world's languages, whereas others are much more common in certain language families, language areas, or even specific to a single language.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
When described as a system of [[symbolic communication]], language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[meaning (semiotics)|meanings]], and a [[code (semiotics)|code]] connecting signs with their meanings. The study of the process of [[semiosis]], how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called [[semiotics]]. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, or written, and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at [[Thanjavur]]]]
Some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.&lt;ref name="Lyons17"/&gt;

The rules by which signs can be combined to form words and phrases are called [[syntax]] or grammar. The meaning that is connected to individual signs, morphemes, words, phrases, and texts is called [[semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de Saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|pp=218–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantics===
{{main|Semantics|Semiotics|Meaning (linguistics)}}
Languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must be something that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.

Thus, languages must have a [[vocabulary]] of signs related to specific meaning. The English sign "dog" denotes, for example, a member of the species ''[[Canis familiaris]]''. In a language, the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the [[lexicon]], and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a [[lexeme]]. Not all meanings in a language are represented by single words. Often, semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of [[Grammatical category|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages contain the semantic structure of [[predicate (grammar)|predication]]: a structure that predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign [[truth value]]s to statements, so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[x [is y]]" or "[x [does y]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref name="Levinson 1983"/&gt;

===Sounds and symbols===

Depending on modality, language structure can be based on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Goldsmith|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called [[phonetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.&lt;ref name="LadefogedMaddieson"/&gt;

Sounds as part of a linguistic system are called [[phonemes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemes are abstract units of sound, defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words, a so-called [[minimal pair]]. In English, for example, the words ''bat'' {{ipa|[bæt]}} and ''pat'' {{ipa|[pʰæt]}} form a minimal pair, in which the distinction between {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} differentiates the two words, which have different meanings. However, each language contrasts sounds in different ways. For example, in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants, the sounds {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[b]}} (if they both occur) could be considered a single phoneme, and consequently, the two pronunciations would have the same meaning. Similarly, the English language does not distinguish phonemically between [[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated and non-aspirated]] pronunciations of consonants, as many other languages like [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Hindi]] do: the unaspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''spin'' {{ipa|[spɪn]}} and the aspirated {{IPA|/p/}} in ''pin'' {{ipa|[pʰɪn]}} are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme (such variants of a single phoneme are called [[allophones]]), whereas in [[Mandarin Chinese]], the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words {{ipa|[pʰá]}} 'crouch' and {{ipa|[pá]}} 'eight' (the accent above the á means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone).&lt;ref name="Trask214"/&gt;

All [[oral language|spoken languages]] have phonemes of at least two different categories, [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], that can be combined to form [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="MacMahon5"/&gt; As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[pitch accent|pitch]], [[Vowel length|duration]], and [[tonal language|tone]] to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called [[suprasegmental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]] and [[Pirahã language]] with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like [[Taa language#Phonology|Taa]] may have as many as 141 phonemes.&lt;ref name="Trask214"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sign language]]s, [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|the equivalent to phonemes]] (formerly called [[chereme]]s) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C. (1960). ''Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf,'' Studies in linguistics: Occasional papers (No. 8). Buffalo: Dept. of Anthropology and Linguistics, University of Buffalo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokoe, William C.; Dorothy C. Casterline; Carl G. Croneberg (1965). ''A dictionary of American sign languages on linguistic principles.'' Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Sandler|Lillo-Martin|2001|pp=539–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Writing system]]s represent language using visual symbols, which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The [[Latin alphabet]] (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the [[Inuktitut]] syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In [[logographic]] scripts, each sign represents an entire word,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.

Because all languages have a very large number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the [[Arabic script]]), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Coulmas|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to represent the sounds of the world's languages in writing, linguists have developed the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
{{main|Grammar}}
Grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called ''[[morpheme]]s'' within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be ''free'' or ''bound''. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called ''[[word]]s'', and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called [[affix]]es. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called ''syntax''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grammatical categories====
{{main|Grammatical category}}
Grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Allerton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically [[morphosyntactic alignment|distinguishing between their relations]] to a predicate, the encoding of [[Grammatical tense|temporal]] and [[Preposition and postposition|spatial]] relations on predicates, and a system of [[grammatical person]] governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Word classes====
Languages organize their [[parts of speech]] into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts. All languages, for instance, make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events. The first group, which includes English words such as "dog" and "song", are usually called [[noun]]s. The second, which includes "run" and "sing", are called [[verb]]s. Another common category is the [[adjective]]: words that describe properties or qualities of nouns, such as "red" or "big". Word classes can be "open" if new words can continuously be added to the class, or relatively "closed" if there is a fixed number of words in a class. In English, the class of pronouns is closed, whereas the class of adjectives is open, since an infinite number of adjectives can be constructed from verbs (e.g. "saddened") or nouns (e.g. with the -like suffix, as in "noun-like"). In other languages such as [[Korean language|Korean]], the situation is the opposite, and new pronouns can be constructed, whereas the number of adjectives is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar. Prototypically, verbs are used to construct [[predicate (grammar)|predicates]], while nouns are used as [[argument]]s of predicates. In a sentence such as "Sally runs", the predicate is "runs", because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument "Sally". Some verbs such as "curse" can take two arguments, e.g. "Sally cursed John". A predicate that can only take a single argument is called [[transitivity (grammar)|''intransitive'']], while a predicate that can take two arguments is called [[transitive verb|''transitive'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other word classes exist in different languages, such as [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] like "and" that serve to join two sentences, [[article (grammar)|articles]] that introduce a noun, [[interjections]] such as "wow!", or [[ideophones]] like "splash" that mimic the sound of some event. Some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity. Many languages have [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape. For instance, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the general noun classifier for humans is ''nin'' (人), and it is used for counting humans, whatever they are called:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Senft|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''san-nin no gakusei'' (三人の学生) lit. "3 human-classifier of student"&amp;nbsp;— three students
For trees, it would be:
:''san-bon no ki'' (三本の木) lit. "3 classifier-for-long-objects of tree"&amp;nbsp;— three trees

====Morphology====
In linguistics, the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In most languages, it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several [[morpheme]]s. For instance, the English word "unexpected" can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes "un-", "expect" and "-ed".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aronoff|Fudeman|2011|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or [[affix]]es can be classified according to their position in relation to the root: ''[[prefix]]es'' precede the root, [[suffix]]es follow the root, and [[infix]]es are inserted in the middle of a root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word "run", which in the past tense is "ran". This process is called ''[[ablaut]]''. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of [[inflection]], which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], which creates a new word from an existing one. In English, the verb "sing" has the inflectional forms "singing" and "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix "-er".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bauer|2003}}; {{harvcoltxt|Haspelmath|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called [[Isolating language|isolating]], or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word ''bonus'', or "good", consists of the root ''bon-'', meaning "good", and the suffix -''us'', which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and [[nominative]] case. These languages are called ''[[fusional languages]]'', because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are [[agglutinative languages]] which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is [[Turkish language|Turkish]], where for example, the word ''evlerinizden'', or "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ''ev-ler-iniz-den'' with the meanings ''house-plural-your-from''. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called [[polysynthetic languages]]. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in [[Persian language|Persian]] the single word ''nafahmidamesh'' means ''I didn't understand it'' consisting of morphemes ''na-fahm-id-am-esh'' with the meanings, "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq'', which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages use morphology to cross-reference words within a sentence. This is sometimes called ''[[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]]''. For example, in many Indo-European languages, adjectives must cross-reference the noun they modify in terms of number, case, and gender, so that the Latin adjective ''bonus'', or "good", is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. In many polysynthetic languages, verbs cross-reference their subjects and objects. In these types of languages, a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in English. For example, in the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''ikusi nauzu'', or "you saw me", the past tense auxiliary verb ''n-au-zu'' (similar to English "do") agrees with both the subject (you) expressed by the ''n''- prefix, and with the object (me) expressed by the – ''zu'' suffix. The sentence could be directly transliterated as "see you-did-me"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntax====
{{main|Syntax}}
[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|In addition to word classes, a sentence can be analyzed in terms of grammatical functions: "The cat" is the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the phrase, "on the mat" is a [[locative (case)|locative]] phrase, and "sat" is the core of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].]]

Another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as "I love you" is meaningful, but "*love you I" is not.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The prefixed asterisk * conventionally indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical, i.e. syntactically incorrect.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, and how those constraints contribute to meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Baker|2001|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in English, the two sentences "the slaves were cursing the master" and "the master was cursing the slaves" mean different things, because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in [[Latin language|Latin]], both ''Dominus servos vituperabat'' and ''Servos vituperabat dominus'' mean "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because ''servos'', or "slaves", is in the [[accusative case]], showing that they are the [[Object (grammar)|grammatical object]] of the sentence, and ''dominus'', or "master", is in the [[nominative case]], showing that he is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of [[Wh-movement|inverse word order in questions]], which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase "John is talking to Lucy" is turned into a question, it becomes "Who is John talking to?", and not "John is talking to who?". The latter example may be used as a way of placing [[focus (linguistics)|special emphasis]] on "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called [[phrase]]s, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels.{{sfn|Baker|2001|pp=269–70}} To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trask|2007|pp=218–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out. For example, "the cat" is one phrase, and "on the mat" is another, because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase: "[And] on the mat, the cat sat".&lt;ref name="Trask 2007 218–19"/&gt; There are many different formalist and functionalist frameworks that propose theories for describing syntactic structures, based on different assumptions about what language is and how it should be described. Each of them would analyze a sentence such as this in a different manner.&lt;ref name="NewmeyerForm"/&gt;

===Typology and universals===
{{Main|Linguistic typology|Linguistic universal}}

Languages can be classified in relation to their grammatical types. Languages that belong to different families nonetheless often have features in common, and these shared features tend to correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Nichols|1992}};{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, languages can be classified on the basis of their basic [[word order]], the relative order of the [[verb]], and its constituents in a normal indicative [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In English, the basic order is [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]]: "The snake(S) bit(V) the man(O)", whereas for example, the corresponding sentence in the [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] would be ''d̪uyugu n̪ama d̪ayn yiːy'' (snake man bit), [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]].&lt;ref name="CroftErg"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word order type is relevant as a typological parameter, because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters, such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives, or of the use of [[prepositions]] or [[postpositions]]. Such correlations are called [[Linguistic universals|implicational universals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Greenberg|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most (but not all) languages that are of the [[Subject-object-verb|SOV]] type have postpositions rather than prepositions, and have adjectives before nouns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009|p=45}}; {{harvcoltxt|MacMahon|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All languages structure sentences into Subject, Verb, and Object, but languages differ in the way they classify the relations between actors and actions. English uses the [[Nominative–absolutive language|nominative-accusative]] word typology: in English transitive clauses, the subjects of both intransitive sentences ("I run") and transitive sentences ("I love you") are treated in the same way, shown here by the nominative pronoun ''I''. Some languages, called [[Ergativity|ergative]], Gamilaraay among them, distinguish instead between Agents and Patients. In ergative languages, the single participant in an intransitive sentence, such as "I run", is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence, giving the equivalent of "me run". Only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun "I" be used.&lt;ref name="CroftErg"/&gt; In this way the semantic roles can map onto the grammatical relations in different ways, grouping an intransitive subject either with Agents (accusative type) or Patients (ergative type) or even making each of the three roles differently, which is called the [[Tripartite language|tripartite type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Croft|2001|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently. Their co-occurrence might be due to universal laws governing the structure of natural languages, "language universals", or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve.&lt;ref name="Myths"/&gt;

==Social contexts of use and transmission==
[[File:Place des Abbesse (the plaque with the je t'aime=te iubesc in 311 laguages).jpg|thumb|The [[Wall of Love]] in [[Paris]], where the phrase "I love you" is featured in 250 languages of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.travelfranceonline.com/wall-of-love-mur-des-je-taime-montmartre/|title=Wall of Love&amp;nbsp;– Mur des Je t'aime&amp;nbsp;– Montmartre|publisher=Travel France Online|accessdate = 30 November 2014|date=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While humans have the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an environment in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on [[speech community|communities of speakers]] in which children [[language acquisition|learn language]] from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to [[communicate]] and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes.&lt;ref name="Myths"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Evans|Levinson|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to [[language contact]]. The process is similar to the process of [[evolution]], where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a [[phylogenetic tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, languages differ from biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of [[diffusion]], as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their [[first language]] or languages as children, or learning new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming [[endangered language|endangered]] as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage and meaning===
{{main|Pragmatics}}

The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called [[deixis]], which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, "I" (which designates the person speaking), "now" (which designates the moment of speaking), and "here" (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=54–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called [[speech act]]s, although they can also be carried out through writing or hand signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=226–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context. For example, if at a dinner table a person asks, "Can you reach the salt?", that is, in fact, not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed, but a request to pass the salt across the table. This meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken; these kinds of effects of meaning are called [[conversational implicature]]s. These social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities, and learning them is a large part of acquiring [[communicative competence]] in a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Levinson|1983|pp=100–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
{{main|Language acquisition|Second-language acquisition|Second language|Language education}}
All healthy, [[Human development (biology)|normally developing]] human beings learn to use language. Children acquire the language or languages used around them: whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood. The development is essentially the same for children acquiring [[sign language|sign]] or [[oral language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bonvillian |first1=John D. |author2=Michael D. Orlansky |author3=Leslie Lazin Novack |title=Developmental milestones: Sign language acquisition and motor development |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=December 1983 |pages=1435–45 |doi=10.2307/1129806|pmid=6661942 |jstor=1129806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This learning process is referred to as first-language acquisition, since unlike many other kinds of learning, it requires no direct teaching or specialized study. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'', naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] called this process "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art".&lt;ref name="Language Instinct"/&gt;

First language acquisition proceeds in a fairly regular sequence, though there is a wide degree of variation in the timing of particular stages among normally developing infants. From birth, newborns respond more readily to human speech than to other sounds. Around one month of age, babies appear to be able to distinguish between different [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. Around six months of age, a child will begin [[babbling]], producing the speech sounds or [[handshape]]s of the languages used around them. Words appear around the age of 12 to 18 months; the average [[vocabulary]] of an eighteen-month-old child is around 50 [[word]]s. A child's first [[utterance]]s are [[Holophrasis|holophrases]] (literally "whole-sentences"), utterances that use just one word to communicate some idea. Several months after a child begins producing words, he or she will produce two-word utterances, and within a few more months will begin to produce [[telegraphic speech]], or short sentences that are less [[Grammar|grammatically]] complex than adult speech, but that do show regular syntactic structure. From roughly the age of three to five years, a child's ability to speak or sign is refined to the point that it resembles adult language.&lt;ref name="OGrady-Cho"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=O'Grady |first1=William |last2=Cho |first2=Sook Whan |chapter=First language acquisition |title=Contemporary Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=fourth |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford St. Martin's |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennison"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kennison|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies published in 2013 have indicated that unborn [[fetus]]es are capable of language acquisition to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;"First Impressions: We start to pick up words, food preferences and hand-eye coordination long before being born", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 313, no. 1 (July 2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Skwarecki, "Babies Learn to Recognize Words in the Womb", ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', 26 August 2013 [http://news.sciencemag.org/brain-behavior/2013/08/babies-learn-recognize-words-womb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age, through exposure in daily life or courses. Children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Macaro|editor-first1=Ernesto| year=2010 | title=Continuum companion to second language acquisition|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9922-5|pages=137–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
{{see also|Culture#Language_and_culture|l1=Culture|Speech community}}
[[File:Arnold Lakhovsky Conversation.png|thumb|right|[[Arnold Lakhovsky]], ''The Conversation'' (c. 1935)]]
Languages, understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them. Languages differ not only in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, but also through having different "cultures of speaking." Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group as well as difference from others. Even among speakers of one language, several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]], and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between [[Speech community|speech communities]].&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Duranti|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists use the term "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]" to refer to the different ways of speaking a language. This term includes geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status as a second language speaker. These kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Agha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between [[social class]]es, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]], a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dixon|1972|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of "social [[deixis]]", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Foley|1997|pp=311–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor", or "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt;

===Writing, literacy and technology===
{{main|Writing|Literacy}}
[[File:Winnipeg Forks - Plains Cree Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An inscription of [[Swampy Cree language|Swampy Cree]] using [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], an [[abugida]] developed by Christian missionaries for Indigenous Canadian languages]]
Throughout history a number of different ways of representing language in graphic media have been invented. These are called [[writing systems]].

The use of writing has made language even more useful to humans. It makes it possible to store large amounts of information outside of the human body and retrieve it again, and it allows communication across distances that would otherwise be impossible. Many languages conventionally employ different genres, styles, and registers in written and spoken language, and in some communities, writing traditionally takes place in an entirely different language than the one spoken. There is some evidence that the use of writing also has effects on the cognitive development of humans, perhaps because acquiring literacy generally requires explicit and [[formal education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Olson|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[4th millennium BC]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]]. It is generally agreed that Sumerian writing was an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian writing was developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of [[cultural diffusion]]. A similar debate exists for the [[Chinese script]], which developed around 1200 BC. The [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] (including among others [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script]]s) are generally believed to have had independent origins.&lt;ref name="Coulmas"/&gt;

===Change===
{{main|Language change|Grammaticalization}}
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The first page of the poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', written in [[Old English]] in the early medieval period (800–1100 AD). Although Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, it is unintelligible to contemporary English speakers.]]
All languages change as speakers adopt or invent new ways of speaking and pass them on to other members of their speech community. Language change happens at all levels from the phonological level to the levels of vocabulary, morphology, syntax, and discourse. Even though language change is often initially evaluated negatively by speakers of the language who often consider changes to be "decay" or a sign of slipping norms of language usage, it is natural and inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Trask|1999|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes may affect specific sounds or the entire [[Phonological change|phonological system]]. [[Sound change]] can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or [[distinctive feature|phonetic feature]] by another, the complete loss of the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none. Sound changes can be ''conditioned'' in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be ''regular'', which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be ''sporadic'', affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a [[chain shift]] in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the [[Germanic languages]] when the sound change known as [[Grimm's law]] affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant *{{PIE|bʰ}} became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous *{{PIE|b}} in turn became /p/, and the previous *{{PIE|p}} became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why [[Italic languages]] such as Latin have ''p'' in words like '''''p'''ater'' and '''''p'''isces'', whereas Germanic languages, like English, have '''''f'''ather'' and '''''f'''ish''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Clackson|2007|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in English, which is the reason that the spelling of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin ''mea domina'' to eventually become the [[French language|French]] ''madame'' and American English ''ma'am''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aitchison|2001|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as [[idiom]]s or particular constructions become [[grammaticalized]]. This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element. For example, in some varieties of [[Caribbean Spanish]] the final /s/ has eroded away. Since [[Standard Spanish]] uses final /s/ in the morpheme marking the [[grammatical person|second person]] subject "you" in verbs, the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun ''tú''. This means that the sentence "what's your name" is ''¿como te llamas?'' {{ipa|[ˈkomo te ˈjamas]}} in Standard Spanish, but {{ipa|[ˈkomo ˈtu te ˈjama]}} in Caribbean Spanish. The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Zentella|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms, for example, the way the English "going to" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full-fledged future tense (e.g. ''I'm gonna'').

Language change may be motivated by "language internal" factors, such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce, or through patterns of change that cause some rare types of constructions to [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] towards more common types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes of language change are social, such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups, such as social classes, or with [[Language ideology|ideologies]], and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas. In this way, issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact===
{{main|language contact}}
One important source of language change is contact and resulting [[Trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]] of linguistic traits between languages. Language contact occurs when speakers of two or more languages or [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] interact on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multilingualism]] is likely to have been the norm throughout [[human history]] and most people in the modern world are multilingual. Before the rise of the concept of the [[Nation state|ethno-national state]], monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands. But with the ideology that made one people, one state, and one language the most desirable political arrangement, monolingualism started to spread throughout the world. Nonetheless, there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages, which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Romaine|2001|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speakers of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this may lead to the formation of [[Sprachbund|language areas]] in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language areas have been documented, among them, the [[Balkan language area]], the [[Mesoamerican language area]], and the [[Ethiopian language area]]. Also, larger areas such as [[South Asia]], Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal features]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Campbell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Aikhenvald|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena, including [[language convergence]], [[loanword|borrowing]], and [[relexification]] (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new [[mixed language]]s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called [[pidgins]] occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a [[creole language]]. An example of such mixed languages is [[Tok Pisin]], the official language of [[Papua New-Guinea]], which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and [[Austronesian languages]]; others are [[Haitian Creole|Kreyòl ayisyen]], the French-based creole language spoken in [[Haiti]], and [[Michif language|Michif]], a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}}; {{harvcoltxt|Thomason|2001}}; {{harvcoltxt|Matras|Bakker|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[SIL Ethnologue]]'' defines a "living language" as "one that has at least one speaker for whom it is their first language". The exact number of known living languages varies from 6,000 to 7,000, depending on the precision of one's definition of "language", and in particular, on how one defines the distinction between languages and [[dialects]]. As of 2016, ''Ethnologue'' cataloged 7,097 living human languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics|title = Ethnologue statistics|website = Summary by world area {{!}} Ethnologue|publisher = SIL|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ethnologue'' establishes linguistic groups based on studies of [[mutual intelligibility]], and therefore often includes more categories than more conservative classifications. For example, the [[Danish language]] that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages (Danish and [[Jutlandic dialect|Jutish]]) by the ''Ethnologue''.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"/&gt;

According to the ''Ethnologue'', 389 languages (nearly 6%) have more than a million speakers. These languages together account for 94% of the world's population, whereas 94% of the world's languages account for the remaining 6% of the global population. To the right is a table of the world's 10 most spoken languages with population estimates from the ''Ethnologue'' (2009 figures).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages and dialects===
{{main|Dialect#Dialect or language}}
[[File:Novi Sad mayor office.jpg|thumb|[[Multilingualism|Multi-lingual]] sign outside the [[mayor]]'s office in [[Novi Sad]], written in the four official languages of the city: [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]]]
There is no [[Language or dialect|clear distinction]] between a language and a [[dialect]], notwithstanding a famous [[aphorism]] attributed to linguist [[Max Weinreich]] that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]".&lt;ref name="5 minute linguist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rickerson |first=E.M. |title=What's the difference between dialect and language? |url=http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |work=The Five Minute Linguist |publisher=College of Charleston |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219070627/http://spinner.cofc.edu/linguist/archives/2005/08/whats_the_diffe.html?referrer=webcluster&amp; |archivedate=19 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects. [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are, for example, often classified as "dialects" of Chinese, even though they are more different from each other than [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. Before the [[Yugoslav civil war]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was considered a single language with two dialects, but now [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are considered different languages and employ different writing systems. In other words, the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences, distinctive [[writing system]]s, or degree of [[mutual intelligibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Lyons|1981|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language families of the world===
{{Main|Language family|Dialectology|Historical linguistics|List of language families}}
[[File:Primary Human Language Families Map.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Principal language families of the world (and in some cases geographic groups of families). For greater detail, see ''[[:Template:Distribution of languages in the world|Distribution of languages in the world]]''.]]
The world's languages can be grouped into [[Language family|language families]] consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry. Linguists recognize many hundreds of language families, although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in-depth studies are carried out. At present, there are also dozens of [[language isolate]]s: languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world. Among them are [[Basque language|Basque]], spoken in Europe, [[Zuni language|Zuni]] of [[New Mexico]], [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] of Mexico, [[Ainu language|Ainu]] of Japan, [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] of [[Pakistan]], and many others.&lt;ref name="Katzner"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Katzner|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language family of the world that has the most speakers is the [[Indo-European languages]], spoken by 46% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lewis|2009}}, "[http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/family Summary by language family]"&lt;/ref&gt; This family includes major world languages like [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ([[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the [[Eurasia]]n [[Migration Period]] (c. 400–800 AD),{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and subsequently through the [[History of colonialism|European colonial expansion]], which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the [[Americas]] and much of [[Africa]]. The [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] are spoken by 20%&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Cantonese]], and hundreds of smaller languages.&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Comrie|2009}}; {{harvcoltxt|Brown|Ogilvie|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] is home to a large number of language families, the largest of which is the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo language family]], which includes such languages as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]]. Speakers of the Niger-Congo languages account for 6.9% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; A similar number of people speak the [[Afroasiatic languages]], which include the populous [[Semitic languages]] such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language]], and the languages of the [[Sahara]] region, such as the [[Berber languages]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]].&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The [[Austronesian languages]] are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from [[Madagascar]] to [[maritime Southeast Asia]] all the way to [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueFamily"/&gt; It includes such languages as [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Maori language|Māori]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and many of the indigenous languages of [[Indonesia]] and [[Formosan languages|Taiwan]]. The Austronesian languages are considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[South Asia]] (among them [[Kannada language|Kannada]] [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] (among them [[Khmer language|Khmer]]), and [[Tai–Kadai languages]] of [[Southeast Asia]] (including [[Thai language|Thai]]).&lt;ref name="ComrieOgilvie"/&gt;

The areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity, such as the Americas, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[West Africa]], and South-Asia, contain hundreds of small language families. These areas together account for the majority of the world's languages, though not the majority of speakers. In the Americas, some of the largest language families include the [[Quechumaran languages|Quechumaran]], [[Arawak languages|Arawak]], and [[Tupi-Guarani languages|Tupi-Guarani]] families of South America, the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]], and [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] of [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]], [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language families of [[North America]]. In Australia, most indigenous languages belong to the [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan family]], whereas New Guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates, as well as a number of Austronesian languages.&lt;ref name="Katzner"/&gt;

===Language endangerment===
{{main|Endangered language|Language loss|Language shift|Language death|}}
[[File:Linguistic diversity.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Together, the eight countries in red contain more than 50% of the world's languages. The areas in blue are the most linguistically diverse in the world, and the locations of most of the world's endangered languages.]]
[[endangered language|Language endangerment]] occurs when a language is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or [[language shift|shift]] to speaking another language. [[Language loss]] occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a ''[[dead language]]''. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an ''[[extinct language]]''. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of [[globalization]] and [[neo-colonialism]], where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The more commonly spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The total number of languages in the world is not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Moseley|2010}}: "[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php Statistics]"&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of languages by number of native speakers|top 20 languages]], those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) operates with five levels of language endangerment: "safe", "vulnerable" (not spoken by children outside the home), "definitely endangered" (not spoken by children), "severely endangered" (only spoken by the oldest generations), and "critically endangered" (spoken by few members of the oldest generation, often [[Speaker types|semi-speakers]]). Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common ''[[lingua franca]]'', such as English or [[Esperanto]], there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world. It is a common belief, going back to the biblical narrative of the [[tower of Babel]] in the [[Old Testament]], that linguistic diversity causes political conflict,&lt;ref name="Haugen"&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Haugen|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the fact that many of the world's major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity, such as the [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslav]] and [[American Civil War]], or the genocide of [[Rwanda]], whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Austin|Sallabank|2011|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many projects aim to prevent or slow this loss by [[language revitalization|revitalizing]] endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted [[Language policy|specific legislation]] to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous [[speech community|speech communities]]. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Language Icon.jpg|thumb|148x148px]]
The '''language icon''' is a specific icon designed for people to select a specific language to use when they face multi-lingual, multi-national websites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languageicon.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__
== History ==
The Language icon was designed by Onur Mustak Cobanli and his team in 2008 when they planned to build a [[multi-lingual]], [[international|multi-national]] website. After the first language icons were rejected, the design contest was organized by [[A’ Design Award &amp; Competition]].&lt;ref&gt;https://competition.adesignaward.com/competitions/custom/Language-Icon-Graphic-Design-Competition.html&lt;/ref&gt; Farhat Datta designed the winning entry, “Turnstile Language Icon.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languageicon.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.designforu.org/article.php?ID=454&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}
'''Language development''' is a process starting early in human life. Infants start without knowing a language, yet by 10 months, babies can distinguish speech sounds and engage in [[babbling]]. Some research has shown that the earliest learning begins in utero when the [[fetus]] starts to recognize the sounds and speech patterns of its [[mother's voice]] and differentiate them from other sounds after birth.&lt;ref name="Graven, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graven|first=Stanley N.|last2=MD|last3=Browne|first3=Joy V.|date=December 2008|title=Auditory development in the fetus and infant|url=|journal=Newborn and Infant Nursing Reviews|volume=8|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, children develop receptive language abilities before their verbal or expressive language develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guess|first=D|date=1969|title=A functional analysis of receptive language and productive speech: acquisition of the plural morpheme|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=2 |issue=1|pages=55–64|via=|pmid=16795203|pmc=1311037}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Receptive language]] is the internal processing and understanding of language. As receptive language continues to increase, [[expressive language]] begins to slowly develop.

Usually, productive language is considered to begin with a stage of pre-verbal communication in which infants use gestures and vocalizations to make their intents known to others. According to a general principle of development, new forms then take over old functions, so that children learn words to express the same communicative functions they had already expressed by proverbial means.&lt;ref name="Kennison, 2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kennison, S. M. |title=Introduction to language development |publisher=Sage |location= Los Angeles, CA |year=2013 |isbn=9781412996068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical frameworks==
{{main|Language acquisition}}

Language development is thought to proceed by ordinary processes of learning in which children acquire the forms, meanings, and uses of words and utterances from the linguistic input.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Children often begin reproducing the words that they are repetitively exposed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cameron-Faulkner|first=Thea|last2=Lieven|first2=Elena|last3=Tomasello|first3=Michael|date=2003-11-01|title=A construction based analysis of child directed speech|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1207/s15516709cog2706_2|journal=Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=843–873|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2706_2|issn=1551-6709}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method in which we develop language skills is universal; however, the major debate is how the rules of [[syntax]] are acquired.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} There are two major approaches to syntactic development, an empiricist account by which children learn all syntactic rules from the linguistic input, and a [[Innatism|nativist]] approach by which some principles of syntax are innate and are transmitted through the human genome.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The '''[[Psychological nativism|nativist theory]]''', proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]], argues that language is a unique human accomplishment, and can be attributed to either "millions of years of evolution" or to "principles of neural organization that may be even more deeply grounded in physical law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aspects of the Theory of Syntax|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|publisher=MIT Press|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky says that all children have what is called an innate [[language acquisition device]] (LAD). Theoretically, the LAD is an area of the brain that has a set of universal syntactic rules for all languages. This device provides children with the ability to make sense of knowledge and construct novel sentences with minimal external input and little experience. Chomsky's claim is based upon the view that what children hear—their linguistic input—is insufficient to explain how they come to learn language.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  He argues that linguistic input from the environment is limited and full of errors. Therefore, nativists assume that it is impossible for children to learn linguistic information solely from their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=Alan|title=Nativism|journal=The Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|date=November 2012|doi=10.1002/9781405198431.wbeal0856|isbn=9781405194730}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because children possess this LAD, they are in fact, able to learn language despite incomplete information from their environment. Their capacity to learn language is also attributed to the theory of universal grammar (UG), which posits that a certain set of structural rules are innate to humans, independent of sensory experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last1=Flevaris|first1=Taki|title=Nativism in Linguistics: Empirical and Theoretical Issues|date=2015|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has dominated linguistic theory for over fifty years and remains highly influential, as witnessed by the number of articles in journals and books.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The ''' [[empiricist|empiricist theory]]''' suggests, contra Chomsky, that there is enough information in the linguistic input children receive and therefore, there is no need to assume an innate language acquisition device exists (see above). Rather than a LAD evolved specifically for language, empiricists believe that general brain processes are sufficient enough for language acquisition. During this process, it is necessary for the child to actively engage with their environment. For a child to learn language, the parent or caregiver adopts a particular way of appropriately communicating with the child; this is known as child-directed speech (CDS).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} CDS is used so that children are given the necessary linguistic information needed for their language. Empiricism is a general approach and sometimes goes along with the interactionist approach. '''[[Statistical language acquisition]]''', which falls under empiricist theory, suggests that infants acquire language by means of pattern perception.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Other researchers embrace an '''[[interactionist|interactionist perspective]]''', consisting of '''social-interactionist theories''' of language development. In such approaches, children learn language in the interactive and communicative context, learning language forms for meaningful moves of communication. These theories focus mainly on the caregiver's attitudes and attentiveness to their children in order to promote productive language habits.&lt;ref name="Poll 2011"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Poll| first1=G. H.|title=Increasing the Odds: Applying Emergentist Theory in Language Intervention|journal=Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools| volume=42| issue=4| year=2011| pages=580–591|doi=10.1044/0161-1461(2011/10-0041)| pmid=21616988|pmc=3164388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An older empiricist theory, the '''[[behaviorist theory]]''' proposed by [[B. F. Skinner]]  suggested that language is learned through operant conditioning, namely, by imitation of stimuli and by reinforcement of correct responses. This perspective has not been widely accepted at any time, but by some accounts, is experiencing a resurgence. New studies use this theory now to treat individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. Additionally, Relational Frame Theory is growing from the behaviorist theory, which is important for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.&lt;ref name="Roediger"&gt;Roediger, R. (2004) "[http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=1540 What happened to Behaviorism]." American Psychological Society.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[empiricist|empiricist theory]] accounts today use behaviorist models.&lt;ref name="Ramscar, 2007a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramscar M, Yarlett D |title=Linguistic self-correction in the absence of feedback: a new approach to the logical problem of language acquisition |journal=Cogn Sci |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=927–60 |date=November 2007 |pmid=21635323 |doi=10.1080/03640210701703576 |url=http://psych.stanford.edu/~michael/papers/ramscar-and-yarlett-lwof.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other relevant theories about language development include [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]], which considers the development of language as a continuation of general cognitive development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clibbens|first=John|title=From theory to practice in child language development|journal=Down Syndrome Research and Practice|date=October 1993|volume=1|issue=3|pages=101–106|url=http://www.down-syndrome.org/reviews/20/reviews-20.pdf|accessdate=2012-11-20|doi=10.3104/reviews.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vygotsky's social theories that attribute the development of language to an individual's social interactions and growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Phyllis|author2=Watkins, Ruth |title=Applying Vygotskian Developmental Theory to Language Intervention|journal=Language, Speech &amp; Hearing Services in Schools|date=April 1996|volume=27|issue=2|pages=157–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological preconditions==
[[Evolutionary biologists]] are skeptical of the claim that syntactic knowledge is transmitted in the human genome. However, many researchers claim that the ability to acquire such a complicated system is unique to the human species. Non-biologists also tend to believe that our ability to learn spoken language may have been developed through the [[evolution]]ary process and that the foundation for language may be passed down genetically. The ability to speak and understand human language requires [[speech production]] skills and abilities as well as [[multisensory integration]] of [[sensory processing]] abilities.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

One hotly debated issue is whether the biological contribution includes capacities specific to language acquisition, often referred to as universal grammar. For fifty years, linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued for the hypothesis that children have innate, language-specific abilities that facilitate and constrain language learning.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  In particular, he has proposed that humans are biologically prewired to learn language at a certain time and in a certain way, arguing that children are born with a language acquisition device (LAD).&lt;ref name="Santrock, 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Santrock, John W. |title=A Topical Approach to Lifespan Development |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0-07-338264-7 |oclc=171151508 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since he developed the [[minimalist program]], his latest version of theory of syntactic structure, Chomsky has reduced the elements of universal grammar, which he believes are prewired in humans to just the principle of recursion, thus voiding most of the nativist endeavor.&lt;ref name="Hauser, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hauser MD, Chomsky N, Fitch WT |title=The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5598 |pages=1569–79 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12446899 |doi=10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228122250/http://www.chomsky.info/articles/20021122.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers who believe that grammar is learned rather than innate, have hypothesized that language learning results from general cognitive abilities and the interaction between learners and their human interactants.  It has also recently been suggested that the relatively slow development of the [[prefrontal cortex]] in humans may be one reason that humans are able to learn language, whereas other species are not.&lt;ref name="Thompson-Schill 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thompson-Schill SL, Ramscar M, Chrysikou EG |title=Cognition without control: When a little frontal lobe goes a long way |journal=Curr Dir Psychol Sci |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=259–263 |year=2009 |pmid=20401341 |pmc=2855545 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01648.x |url=http://psych.stanford.edu/~michael/papers/Ramscar_control.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramscar, 2007b"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramscar M, Gitcho N |title=Developmental change and the nature of learning in childhood |journal=Trends Cogn.

===Children versus adults===
{{see also|Gestures in language acquisition}}
Language development and processing begins before birth. Evidence has shown that there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=DeCasper A. |author2=Lecanuet J. |author3=Bunsel M. |author4=Granier-Deferre C. |author5=Maugeais R. | year = 1994 | title = Fetal Reactions to Recurrent Maternal Speech | url = http://www.psych.yorku.ca/adler/courses/4010/Articles/DeCasper%20et%20al%201994.pdf | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 17 |issue=2 | pages = 159–164 | doi=10.1016/0163-6383(94)90051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud during the last few weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able to recognize what they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.

Throughout the first year of life, infants are unable to communicate with language. Instead, infants communicate with [[gesture]]s. This phenomenon is known as prelinguistic gestures, which are nonverbal ways that infants communicate that also had a plan backed with the gesture. Examples of these could be pointing at an object, tugging on the shirt of a parent to get the parent's attention, etc. Harding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Harding C. |  year = 1983 | title = An Investigation Of Developmental Mechanisms In The Development Of Intentional Communication | url = http://storage.rockarch.org/0db54f4c-8a3d-4394-b3f3-0bf52b46804a-FCD001_103_00113.pdf | journal = Foundation for Child Development | pages = 1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1983, devised the major criteria that come along with the behavior of prelinguistic gestures and their intent to communicate. There are three major criteria that go along with a prelinguistic gesture: waiting, persistence, and ultimately, development of alternative plans. This process usually occurs around 8 months of age, where an appropriate scenario may be of a child tugging on the shirt of a parent to wait for the attention of the parent who would then notice the infant, which causes the infant to point to something they desire. This would describe the first two criteria. The development of alternative plans may arise if the parent does not acknowledge what the infant wants, the infant may entertain itself to satisfy the previous desire.

When children reach about 15–18 months of age, language acquisition flourishes. There is a surge in word production resulting from the growth of the cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Saffran J. |author2=Aslin R. |author3=Newport E. | year = 1994 | title = Statistical learning by 8-month-old infants | url = http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/newport/saffran1996.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5294.1926 | journal = Science | volume = 274 | issue = 5294 | pages = 1926–1928 | pmid=8943209}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that humans learn first about the sounds of a language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.

It appears that during the early years of language development females exhibit an advantage over males of the same age. When infants between the age of 16 to 22 months were observed interacting with their mothers, a female advantage was obvious. The females in this age range showed more spontaneous speech production than the males and this finding was not due to mothers speaking more with daughters than sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Huttenlocher J. |author2=Haight W. |author3=Bryk A. |author4=Seltzer M. |author5=Lyons T. | year = 1991 | title = Early vocabulary growth: Relation to language input and gender | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1991-20903-001 | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 236–248 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.27.2.236}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, boys between 2 and 6 years as a group did not show higher performance in language development over their girl counterparts on experimental assessments.  In studies using adult populations, 18 and over, it seems that the female advantage may be task dependent. Depending on the task provided, a female advantage may or may not be present.&lt;ref name="Bornstein2004"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Bornstein| first1=M. H.|title=Specific and general language performance across early childhood: Stability and gender considerations|journal=First Language|volume=24| issue=3| year=2004| pages=267–304| doi=10.1177/0142723704045681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, one study found that out of the 5.5% of American children with language impairments, 7.2% are male, and 3.8% are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danger|first=S|date=2005|title=Child-Centered Group Play Therapy with Children with Speech Difficulties.|url=|journal=International Journal of Play Therapy|volume=14 |issue=1|pages=1–97|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different suggested explanations for this gender gap in language impairment prevalence.

===Lateralization effect on language===
It is currently believed that in regards to [[Lateralization of brain function|brain lateralization]] males are left-lateralized, while females are bilateralized. Studies on patients with unilateral [[lesion]]s have provided evidence that females are in fact more bilateralized with their verbal abilities. It seems that when a female has experienced a [[lesion]] to the [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemisphere]], she is better able to compensate for this damage than a male can. If a male has a lesion in the left hemisphere, his verbal abilities are greatly impaired in comparison to a control male of the same age without that damage.&lt;ref name="Frith Vargha-Khadem 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frith|first1=Uta|last2=Vargha-Khadem| first2=Faraneh|title=Are there sex differences in the brain basis of literacy related skills?

=== Fine motor development rate ===
Shriberg, Tomblin, and McSweeny (1999) suggest that the fine motor skills necessary for correct speech may develop more slowly in males.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shriberg|first=Lawrence D.|last2=Tomblin|first2=J. Bruce|last3=McSweeny|first3=Jane L.|date=1999-12-01|title=Prevalence of Speech Delay in 6-Year-Old Children and Comorbidity With Language Impairment|url=https://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1781216|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|language=en|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1461–1481|doi=10.1044/jslhr.4206.1461|issn=1092-4388}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could explain why some of the language impairments in young males seems to spontaneously improve over time.

=== Over diagnosis ===
It is also suggested that the gender gap in language impairment prevalence could also be explained by the clinical over diagnosis of males. Males tend to be clinically over diagnosed with a variety of disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Visibility ===
The study by Shriber et al. (1999) further explains that this gap in the prevalence of language impairment could be because males tend to be more visible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These researchers reveal that male children tend to act out behaviorally when they have any sort of disorder, while female children tend to turn inward and develop emotional disorders as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, the high ratio of males with language impairments may be connected with the fact that males are more visible, and thus more often diagnosed.

==Writing development==

Research in writing development has been limited in psychology.&lt;ref name="Christie, F. 2010"&gt;Christie, F., &amp; Derewianka, B. (2010). School discourse: Learning to write across the years of schooling. Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In the research that has been conducted, focus has generally centred on the development of written and spoken language and their connection. Spoken and written skills could be considered linked. Researchers believe that children's spoken language influences their written language.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"&gt;Kroll, B. M. (1981) Developmental relationships between speaking and writing. In Kroll &amp; Vaan (eds) (1981), 32–54&lt;/ref&gt; When a child learns to write they need to master letter formation, spelling, punctuation and they also have to gain an understanding of the structure and the organisational patterns involved in written language.&lt;ref name="Perera, K. 1984"&gt;Perera, K. (1984). Children's writing and reading: Analysing classroom language. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroll's theory is one of the most significant on children's writing development. He proposed that children's writing development is split into 4 phases. Kroll explicitly states that these phases are 'artificial' in the sense that the boundaries between the phases are imprecise and he recognises that each child is different, thus their development is unique.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"/&gt; The phases of writing development have been highlighted to give the reader a broad outline of what phases a child goes through during writing development; however when studying an individual's development in depth, the phases may be disregarded to an extent.

The first of Kroll's phases is the preparation for writing phase. In this phase the child is believed to grasp the technical skills needed for writing, allowing them to create the letters needed to write the words the children say. In this initial phase children experience many opportunities to extend their spoken language skills. Speaking and writing are considered fairly separate processes here, as children's writing is less well developed at this stage, whereas their spoken language is becoming more skilled.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"/&gt;

Kroll considers the second phase in writing development to be consolidation. Here, children begin to consolidate spoken and written language. In this phase children's writing skills rely heavily on their spoken language skills, and their written and spoken language becoming integrated.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"/&gt; Children's written language skills become stronger as they use their spoken language skills to improve their writing.  Then in turn, when a development in children's written language skills is seen, their spoken language skills have also improved. A child's written language in this phase mirrors their spoken language.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"/&gt;

In the third phase, differentiation, children begin to learn that written language regularly differs in structure and style from spoken language. The growth from consolidation to differentiation can be challenging for some children to grasp.&lt;ref name="Kroll, B. M. 1981"/&gt; Children can 'struggle with the transformation from the basically overt language of speech to the essentially covert activity of writing'.&lt;ref&gt;Petty 1978 Petty, W. T. The writing of young children. In C. R. Cooper &amp; L. Odell (Eds.), Research on composing: Points of departure. Urbana, Il.: NCTE, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In this phase, the child learns that writing is generally considered more formal than spoken language, which is thought to be casual and conversational. Here, it is believed that children begin to understand that writing serves a purpose.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kroll, B. M. (1981) Developmental relationships between speaking and writing. In Kroll &amp; Vaan (eds) (1981), 32–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroll considers the last phase to be the systematic integration phase. A differentiation and integration between the child's speaking and writing can be seen in this phase. This means that speaking and writing have 'well-articulated forms and functions';&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; however, they are also integrated in the sense that they use the same system. As a result of the individual being aware of the audience, context and reason they are communicating, both written and spoken language are able to overlap and take several forms at this stage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Kroll used the four phases to give an explanation and generalise about the development of these two aspects of language. The highest significance is placed on the second and third phase, consolidation and differentiation respectively.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It could be concluded that children's written and spoken language, in certain respects, become more similar to age, maturation, and experience; however, they are also increasingly different in other respects. The content of the skills are more similar, but the approach used for both writing and speaking are different.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; When writing and speaking development is looked at more closely it can be seen that certain elements of written and spoken language are differentiating and other elements are integrating, all in the same phase.

Perera conducted a survey and her view mirrors that of Kroll to the extent that she used Kroll's four phases.&lt;ref name="Perera, K. 1984"/&gt; When a child undergoes initial learning of the written language, they have not yet fully mastered the oral language.&lt;ref name="Perera, K. 1984"/&gt; It is clear that their written language development is aided by their spoken language; it can also be said that their spoken language development is aided by the development of their written language skills.  Kantor and Rubin believe that not all individuals successfully move into the final stage of integration.&lt;ref&gt;Kantor, K. J. &amp; Rubin, D. L. (1981) Between speaking and writing: processes of differentiation. In Kroll &amp; Vaan (eds) (1981), 55–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Perera is also aware that it is hard to assign chronological ages to each phase of writing development, because each child is an individual, and also the phases are 'artificial'.

Other than Kroll's theory, there are four principles on early patterns in writing development discussed by Marie Clay in her book ''What Did I Write?''. The four principles are recurring principle, the generative principle, the sign principle, and the inventory principle. The recurring principle involves patterns and shapes in English writing that develop throughout writing development. The generative principle incorporates the idea that a writer can create new meanings by organizing units of writing and letters of the alphabet. The sign principle is understanding that the word print also involves paper arrangement and word boundaries. And lastly, the inventory principle is the fact that children have the urge to list and name items that they are familiar with, and because of this they can practice their own writing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sulzby|first=Elizabeth|last2=Teale|first2=William H.|date=1985|title=Writing Development in Early Childhood|jstor=42925853|journal=Educational Horizons|volume=64|issue=1|pages=8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research has also explored writing development. Myhill concentrated on the development of written language skills in adolescents aged 13 to 15.&lt;ref name="Myhill, D. 2008"&gt;Myhill, D. (2008). Towards a linguistic model of sentence development in writing. Language and Education, 22(5), 271–288.&lt;/ref&gt; Myhill discovered that the more mature writer was aware of the shaping of text, and used non-finite clauses, which mirrored Perera's results (1984).&lt;ref name="Myhill, D. 2008"/&gt; Other researchers focused on writing development up until late adolescence, as there has been a limited research in this area.&lt;ref name="Christie, F. 2010"/&gt; Chrisite and Derewianke recognize that the survey conducted by Perera (1984) is still one of the most significant research studies in the writing development field and believe Perera's study is similar to theirs. Chrisite and Derewianke (2010) again propose four phases of writing development. The researchers believe that the process of writing development does not stop when an individual leaves formal education, and again, the researchers highlight that these phases are flexible in their onset. The first phase focuses on spoken language as the main aid for writing development, and the development then takes its course reaching the fourth phase, which continues beyond formal education.&lt;ref name="Christie, F. 2010"/&gt;

==Environmental influences==
The environment a child develops in has influences on language development. The environment provides language input for the child to process. Speech by adults to children help provide the child with correct language usage repetitively.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Rhea|last2=Elwood|first2=Terril J.|date=1991-10-01|title=Maternal Linguistic Input to Toddlers With Slow Expressive Language Development|url=https://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1779056|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|language=en|volume=34|issue=5|pages=982–988|doi=10.1044/jshr.3405.982|issn=1092-4388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental influences on language development are explored in the tradition of [[social interactionist theory]] by such researchers as [[Jerome Bruner]], [[Alison Gopnik]], [[Andrew Meltzoff]], [[Anat Ninio]], [[Roy Pea]], [[Catherine E. Snow|Catherine Snow]], Ernest Moerk and [[Michael Tomasello]]. [[Jerome Bruner]] who laid the foundations of this approach in the 1970s, emphasized that adult "[[scaffolding]]" of the child's attempts to master linguistic communication is an important factor in the developmental process.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

One component of the young child's linguistic environment is [[child-directed speech]] (also known as baby talk or motherese), which is language spoken in a higher pitch than normal with simple words and sentences. Although the importance of its role in developing language has been debated, many linguists think that it may aid in capturing the infant's attention and maintaining communication.&lt;ref name="Mani, Plunkett, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mani|first1=Nivedita|last2=Plunkett|first2=Kim|title=Twelve-Month-Olds Know Their Cups From Their Keps and Tups |journal=Infancy|volume=15 |issue=5|year=2010 |pages=445–470|issn=1525-0008 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00027.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When children begin to communicate with adults, this motherese speech allows the child the ability to discern the patterns in language and to experiment with language.

Throughout existing research, it is concluded that children exposed to extensive vocabulary and complex grammatical structures more quickly develop language and also have a more accurate syntax than children raised in environments without complex grammar exposed to them.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HOFF|first=E|title=How social contexts support and shape language development☆|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0273229705000316|journal=Developmental Review|volume=26|issue=1|pages=55–88|doi=10.1016/j.dr.2005.11.002|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; With motherese, the mother talks to the child and responds back to the child, whether it be a babble the child made or a short sentence. While doing this, the adult prompts the child to continue communicating, which may help a child develop language sooner than children raised in environments where communication is not fostered.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathanson|first=Amy I.|last2=Rasmussen|first2=Eric E.|date=2011-10-01|title=TV Viewing Compared to Book Reading and Toy Playing Reduces Responsive Maternal Communication with Toddlers and Preschoolers|url=https://academic.oup.com/hcr/article/37/4/465-487/4107512|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=37|issue=4|pages=465–487|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2011.01413.x|issn=0360-3989}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Baby talk|Child-directed speech]] concentrates on small core vocabulary, here and now topics, exaggerated facial expressions and gestures, frequent questioning, para-linguistic changes, and verbal rituals.&lt;ref name="Owens 2012"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Owens | first1 = Robert E. | title = Language development : an introduction | date = 2012 | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston | isbn = 978-0-13-258252-0 | oclc = 682896734 | pages = 130–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An infant is least likely to produce vocalizations when changed, fed, or rocked. The infant is more likely to produce vocalizations in response to a nonverbal behavior such as touching or smiling.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Child-directed speech also catches the child's attention, and in situations where words for new objects are being expressed to the child, this form of speech may help the child recognize the speech cues and the new information provided.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Data shows that children raised in highly verbal families had higher language scores than those children raised in low verbal families{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Continuously hearing complicated sentences throughout language development increases the child's ability to understand these sentences and then to use complicated sentences as they develop. Studies have shown that students enrolled in high language classrooms have two times the growth in complex sentences usage than students in classrooms where teachers do not frequently use complex sentences.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Adults use strategies other than child-directed speech like recasting, expanding, and labeling:
* '''Recasting''' is rephrasing something the child has said, perhaps turning it into a question or restating the child's immature utterance in the form of a fully grammatical sentence. For example, a child saying "cookie now" a parent may respond with "Would you like a cookie now?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholas|first=Howard|last2=Lightbown|first2=Patsy M.|last3=Spada|first3=Nina|date=2001-12-01|title=Recasts as Feedback to Language Learners|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0023-8333.00172/abstract|journal=Language Learning|language=en|volume=51|issue=4|pages=719–758|doi=10.1111/0023-8333.00172|issn=1467-9922}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Expanding''' is restating, in a linguistically sophisticated form, what a child has said. For example, a child may say "car move road" and the parent may respond "A car drives on the road."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} 
* '''Labeling''' is identifying the names of objects.&lt;ref name="Santrock, 2007" /&gt; If a child points to an object such as a couch the mother may say "couch" in response. Labeling can also be characterized as referencing.&lt;ref name="Owens 2012" /&gt;
Some language development experts have characterized child directed speech in stages. Primarily, the parents use repetition and also variation to maintain the infant's attention. Secondly, the parent simplifies speech to help in language learning. Third, any speech modifications maintain the responsiveness of the child. These modifications develop into a conversation that provides context for the development.&lt;ref name="Owens 2012" /&gt;

===Cultural and socioeconomic effects===
While most children throughout the world develop language at similar rates and without difficulty, cultural and socioeconomic differences have been shown to influence development.  An example of cultural differences in language development can be seen when comparing the interactions of mothers in the United States with their infants with mothers in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tamis-LeMonda|first=Catherine S.|last2=Bornstein|first2=Marc H.|last3=Cyphers|first3=Lisa|last4=Toda|first4=Sueko|last5=Ogino|first5=Misako|date=2016-06-30|title=Language and Play at One Year: A Comparison of Toddlers and Mothers in the United States and Japan|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=19–42|doi=10.1177/016502549201500102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mothers in the United States use more questions, are more information-oriented, and use more grammatically correct utterances with their 3-month-olds.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  Mothers in Japan, on the other hand, use more physical contact with their infants, and more emotion-oriented, nonsense, and environmental sounds, as well as baby talk, with their infants.  These differences in interaction techniques reflect differences in "each society's assumptions about infants and adult-to-adult cultural styles of talking."&lt;ref name="Owens 2012"/&gt;

Specifically in North American culture, maternal race, education, and socioeconomic class influence parent-child interactions in the early linguistic environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  When speaking to their infants, mothers from middle class "incorporate language goals more frequently in their play with their infants," and in turn, their infants produce twice as many vocalizations as lower class infants.&lt;ref name="Owens 2012"/&gt; Mothers from higher social classes who are better educated also tend to be more verbal, and have more time to spend engaging with their infants in language.  Additionally, lower class infants may receive more language input from their siblings and peers than from their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burchinal|first=Margaret R.|last2=Roberts|first2=Joanne E.|last3=Nabors|first3=Laura A.|last4=Bryant|first4=Donna M.|date=1996|title=Quality of Center Child Care and Infant Cognitive and Language Development|jstor=1131835|journal=Child Development|volume=67|issue=2|pages=606–620|doi=10.2307/1131835}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Social preconditions==
It is crucial that children are allowed to socially interact with other people who can vocalize and respond to questions. For language acquisition to develop successfully, children must be in an environment that allows them to communicate socially in that language. Children who have learnt sound, meaning and grammatical system of language that can produce clear sentence may still not have the ability to use language effectively in various social circumstance. Social interaction is the footing stone of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michnik Golinkoff&amp;Hirsh-Pasek|first=Roberta&amp;Kathy|title=How Babies Talk|year=2000|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few different theories as to why and how children develop language. The most popular—and yet heavily debated—explanation is that language is acquired through imitation. This theory has been challenged by Lester Butler, who argues that children do not use the grammar that an adult would use. Furthermore, "children's language is highly resistant to alteration by adult intervention", meaning that children do not use the corrections given to them by an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Lester G.|title=Language Acquisition of Young Children: Major Theories and Sequences|journal=Elementary English|date=1947|volume=51|issue=8|pages=1120–1123, 1137|jstor=41388312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most accepted theories in language development are [[psychological]] and [[Functional theories of grammar|functional]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Psychological explanations focus on the mental processes involved in childhood language learning. Functional explanations look at the social processes involved in learning the first language.

==Different aspects==
*'''[[Phonology]]''' involves the rules about the structure and sequence of speech sounds.
*'''[[Semantics]]''' consists of [[vocabulary]] and how concepts are expressed through words.
*'''[[Grammar]]''' involves two parts.
:* The first, '''[[syntax]]''', is the rules in which words are arranged into sentences. 
:* The second, '''[[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]''', is the use of grammatical markers (indicating tense, active or passive voice etc.). 
*'''[[Pragmatics]]''' involves the rules for appropriate and effective communication. Pragmatics involves three skills:
**using language for greeting, demanding etc.,
**changing language for talking differently depending on who it is you are talking to;
**following rules such as turn taking, staying on topic.

Each component has its own appropriate developmental periods.

===Phonological development===
Babies can recognize their mother's voice from as early as few weeks old. It seems like they have a unique system that is designed to recognize speech sound. Furthermore, they can differentiate between certain speech sounds.   A significant first milestone in phonetic development is the babbling stage (around the age of six months). This is the baby's way of practicing his control over that apparatus. Babbling is independent from the language.  Deaf children for instance, babble the same way as hearing ones.
As the baby grows older, the babbling increases in frequency and starts to sound more like words (around the age of twelve months). Although every child is an individual with different pace of mastering speech, there is a tendency to an order of which speech sounds are mastered:
*Vowels before consonants
*Stop sounds before any other consonant sounds (for example: 'p','t','b')
*Place of articulation – labials, alveolar, velars, alveopalatals, and interdentals in that order by the age of 4.  That means that there is some order to the development of the physical system in young children.

==== Early phonetic processes====
As the children's ability to produce sound develops, their ability to perceive the phonetic contrast of their language develops. The better they get in mastering the sound, the more sensitive they become to the changes in those sounds in their language once they get exposed to it. They learn to isolate individual phenomes while speaking which also serves as the basis of reading.

Some processes that occur in early age:

*Syllable deletion – stressed syllables are emphasis that may be given to certain syllables in a word. They are more likely to be retained in children's pronunciation than unstressed syllables (less emphasis on the sound) because they are more salient to children in an early language acquisition process. So children may say ''helikat'' instead of ''helicopter'' or ''fowe'' instead of ''telephone''. That way, they don't pronounce the more emphasized sound in the word.
*Syllable simplification – another process that happens in order to simplify syllable structure, children delete certain sounds systematically. For example, children might say 'tap' instead of "stop" and completely drop the 's' sound in that word. That is a common process in children's speech development.
*Substitution – systematic replacement of one sound by an alternative, easier one to articulate (substitution process – stopping, fronting, gliding). It means that the young toddler may use sounds that are easier to produce instead of the proper sound in a word. We may see that the child replace the 'r' sound with 'l' or 'w', the 'n' with 'd' and so on.
* Assimilation – modification of segments of the word influenced by neighboring sounds, due to ease of articulation. In order for the young speaker to produce sounds easier, he or she may replace the sound in a specific word to a different one, which is somewhat similar. For example, the word "pig" may sound as "big" – 'p' and 'b' are close in their sound. (Lightbown, Spada, Ranta &amp; Rand, 2006).

From shortly after birth to around one year, the baby starts to make speech sounds. 
At around two months, the baby engages in cooing, which mostly consists of vowel sounds. At around four to six months, cooing turns into [[babbling]], which is the repetitive [[consonant]]-[[vowel]] combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speechclinic.com.au/speech-language-milestones/|title=Speech &amp; Language Milestones – Speech Clinic™|website=Speech Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babies understand more than they are able to say. In this '''0–8 months''' range, the child is engaged in vocal play of vegetative sounds, laughing, and cooing.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Once the child hits the '''8–12 month''', range the child engages in canonical babbling, i.e. dada as well as variegated babbling. This jargon babbling with intonational contours the language being learned.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

From '''12–24 months''', babies can recognize the correct pronunciation of familiar words. Babies also use phonological strategies to simplify word pronunciation. Some strategies include repeating the first consonant-vowel in a multisyllable word ('TV' → 'didi') or deleting unstressed syllables in a multisyllable word ('banana' → 'nana'). Within this first year, two word utterances and two syllable words emerge. This period is often called the '''holophrastic''' stage of development, because one word conveys as much meaning as an entire phrase.  For instance, the simple word "milk" can imply that the child is requesting milk, noting spilled milk, sees a cat drinking milk, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernandez|first=Eva|title=Fundamentals of Psycholinguistics|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=West Sussex|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that children at this age were capable of comprehending 2-word sentences, producing 2–3 word sentences, and naming basic colors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luinge|first=Margreet R.|last2=Post|first2=Wendy J.|last3=Wit|first3=Hero P.|last4=Goorhuis-Brouwer|first4=Sieneke M.|date=2006-10-01|title=The Ordering of Milestones in Language Development for Children From 1 to 6 Years of Age|url=https://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1767648|journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research|language=en|volume=49|issue=5|pages=923–940|doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2006/067)|pmid=17077206|issn=1092-4388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By '''24–30 months''' awareness of rhyme emerges as well as rising intonation.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} One study concludes that children between the ages of 24–30 months typically can produce 3–4 word sentence, create a story when prompted by pictures, and at least 50% of their speech is intelligible.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

By '''36–60 months''', phonological awareness continues to improve as well as pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} At this age, children have a considerable experience with language and are able to form simple sentences that are 3 words in length.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They use basic prepositions, pronouns, and plurals. They become immensely creative in their language use and learn to categorize items such as recognizing that a shoe is not a fruit. At this age, children also learn to ask questions and negate sentences to develop these questions. Over time, their syntax gets more and more unique and complex. A study reveals that at this age, a child's speech should be at least 75% intelligible.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

By '''6–10 years''', children can master syllable stress patterns, which helps distinguish slight differences between similar words.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Semantic development===
The average child masters about fifty words by the age of eighteen months.  These might include words such as, milk, water, juice and apple (noun-like words). Afterwards they acquire 12 to 16 words a day. By the age of six, they master about 13 to 14 thousand words.

The most frequent words include adjective-like expressions for displeasure and rejection such as 'no'. They also include social interaction words, such as "please" and "bye".

There are three stages for learning the meaning of new words:

# Whole object assumption: &lt;br/&gt; A new word refers to a whole object. For example, when an eighteen-months old child sees a sheep and his mother points at it and says the word 'sheep', the child infers that the word 'sheep' describes the whole animal and not parts of it (such as color, shape, etc.).
# Type assumption: &lt;br/&gt; A new word refers to a type of thing, not just to a particular thing. For example, when the child hears the word 'sheep' he infers that it is used for the animal type and not only for that particular sheep that he saw.
# Basic level assumption: &lt;br/&gt; A new word refers to objects that are alike in basic ways (appearance, behavior, etc.).

In other words, when the child hears the word "sheep" he overgeneralizes it to other animals that look like sheep by the external appearance, such as white, wooly and four-legged animal.

Contextual clues are a major factor in the child's vocabulary development.

*

The child uses contextual clues to draw inferences about the category and meaning of new words. By doing so, the child distinguishes between names and ordinary nouns.

For example, when an object is presented to the child with the determiner "a" (a cat, a dog, a bottle) he perceives it as an ordinary noun.

However, when the child hears a noun without the determiner, he perceives it as a name, for instance "this is Mary".

Children usually make correct meaning associations with the words that the adults say. However, sometimes they make semantic errors.

There are a few types of semantic errors:

Overextension: When a child says or hears a word, they might associate what they see or hear as more generalized concept than the real meaning of the word. For example, if they say "cat", they might overextend it to other animals with same features.

Underextension: It involves the use of lexical items in an overly restrictive fashion. In other words, the child focuses on core members of a certain category. For example: 'cat' may only refer to the family cat and no other cat, or 'dog' may refer to certain kinds of dogs that the child is exposed to.

Verb meaning: when a pre-school child hears the verb 'fill', he understands it as the action 'pour' rather than the result, which is 'make full'.

Dimensional terms: the first dimensional adjectives acquired are big and small because they belong to the size category. The size category is the most general one. Later children acquire the single dimension adjectives, such as, tall-short, long-short, high-low. Eventually they acquire the adjectives that describe the secondary dimension, such as thick-thin, wide-narrow and deep-shallow.

From birth to one year, comprehension (the language we understand) develops before production (the language we use). There is about a 5-month lag in between the two. Babies have an innate preference to listen to their mother's voice. Babies can recognize familiar words and use preverbal gestures.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Within the first '''12–18 months''' semantic roles are expressed in one word speech including agent, object, location, possession, nonexistence and denial. Words are understood outside of routine games but the child still needs contextual support for lexical comprehension.&lt;ref name="Brandone 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brandone | first1 = Amanda C | last2 = Salkind | first2 = Sara J. | last3 = Golinkoff | first3 = Roberta Michnick | last4 = Hirsh-Pasek | first4 = Kathy | title = Language Development | editors = George G Bear; Kathleen M Minke | work = Children's needs III : development, prevention, and intervention | publisher = National Association of School Psychologists | year = 2006 | location = Bethesda, Md | accessdate = 2013-12-09 | isbn = 9780932955791 | oclc = 70691810| url=http://udel.edu/~roberta/pdfs/Bear%20chaptBrandone.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''18–24 months''' Prevalent relations are expressed such as agent-action, agent-object, action-location.&lt;ref name="Brandone 2006"/&gt;
Also, there is a vocabulary spurt between 18–24 months, which includes fast mapping. Fast mapping is the babies' ability to learn a lot of new things quickly. The majority of the babies' new vocabulary consists of object words (nouns) and action words (verbs).

'''30–36 months''' The child is able to use and understand why question and basic spatial terms such as in, on or under.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''36–42 months''' There is an understanding of basic color words and kinship terms. Also, the child has an understanding of the semantic relationship between adjacent and conjoined sentences, including casual and contrastive.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''42–48 months''' When and how questions are comprehended as well as basic shape words such as circle, square and triangle.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

'''48–60 months''' Knowledge of letter names and sounds emerges, as well as numbers.

By '''3–5 years''', children usually have difficulty using words correctly. Children experience many problems such as underextensions, taking a general word and applying it specifically (for example, 'cartoons' specifically for 'Mickey Mouse') and overextensions, taking a specific word and applying it too generally (example, 'ant' for any insect). However, children coin words to fill in for words not yet learned (for example, someone is a cooker rather than a chef because a child may not know what a chef is). Children can also understand metaphors.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

From '''6–10 years''', children can understand meanings of words based on their definitions. They also are able to appreciate the multiple meanings of words and use words precisely through metaphors and puns. Fast mapping continues.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
Within these years, children are now able to acquire new information from written texts and can explain relationships between multiple meaning words. Common idioms are also understood.

=== Syntactic development ===
The development of syntactic structures follows a particular pattern and reveals much on the nature of language acquisition, which has several stages. According to O'Grady and Cho (2011), the first stage, occurring between the ages of 12–18 months, is called "one-word stage." In this stage, children cannot form syntactic sentences and therefore use one-word utterances called "holophrases" that express an entire sentence. In addition, children's comprehension is more advanced than their production abilities. For example, a child who wants candy may say "candy" instead of expressing a full sentence.

The following stage is the "two-word stage" in which children begin to produce "mini-sentences" that are composed of two words, such as "doggy bark" and "Ken water" (O'Grady &amp; Cho, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;346). At this stage, it is unclear whether children have an understanding of underlying rules of the language such as syntactic categories, since their "mini-sentences" often lack distinction between the categories. However, children do exhibit sensitivity to sentence structures and they frequently use appropriate word order.

After several months of speech that is restricted to short utterances, children enter the "telegraphic stage" and begin to produce longer and more complex grammatical structures (O'Grady &amp; Cho, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;347). This stage is characterized by production of complex structures as children begin to form phrases consisting of a subject and a complement in addition to use of modifiers and composition of full sentences. Children use mostly content words and their sentences lack function words. For example, a child may say "fill cup water," instead of saying, "Fill my cup with water." Subsequently, language acquisition continues to develop rapidly and children begin to acquire complex grammar that shows understanding of intricate linguistic features, such as the ability to switch the position of words in sentences.

Throughout the process of syntactic development, children acquire and develop question structures. According to O'Grady and Cho (2011), at the early stages of language acquisition, children ask yes-no questions by rising intonation alone as they develop awareness to auxiliary verbs only at a later stage. When auxiliary verbs make their appearance, it takes children a few months before they are able to use inversion in yes-no questions. The development of WH- questions occurs between the ages of two and four, when children acquire auxiliary verbs that then leads to the ability to use inversion in questions. However, some children find inversion easier in yes-no questions than in WH- questions, since the position of the WH- word and the auxiliary verb both must changed (e.g., "You are going where?" instead of "Where are you going?").

=== Morphological development ===
Morphological structures development occurs over a period of several years. Before language is acquired, children lack any use of morphological structures.

The morphological structures that children acquire during their childhood, and even up to the early school years, are: determiners (a, the), -ing inflection, plural –s, auxiliary be, possessive –s, third person singular –s, past tense –ed).

When children start using them they tend to overgeneralize the rules and project them upon all the words in the language, including irregulars. For example: if a child knows the –ed (past tense) there is a possibility that they'll say "I eated"( Man-mans cat-cats). These errors result from overgeneralization of rules.

This overgeneralization is very noticeable, in fact, children do that in less than 25 percent of the time at any point before reducing that percentage. Then they improve their mastery, which can be tested in various ways, such as the "wug test" (Berko, 1958).

Children often figure out quickly frequent irregular verbs, such as go and buy rather than less common ones, such as win. This suggests that children must hear the word several hundred times before they are able to use it correctly.

This development of bound morphemes is similar in order among children, for example: -''ing'' is acquired before the article ''the''. The interesting part though is that parents tend to use a different order while speaking to their kids, for example, parents use the article 'the' more frequently than -ing. Meaning, other factors determine the order of acquisition, such as:

# Morphemes that come at the end of an utterance are remembered better.
# Children seem to remember morphemes such as –ing better because they contain their own syllables rather than single consonant morpheme, such as plural –s.
# Affixes with more than one meaning are more difficult to acquire, e.g., –s functions both as plural noun and singular third.

As it comes to word formation processes such as derivation and compounding, the earliest derivational suffixes to show up in children's speech are those they hear adults use most frequently. (-er as the *'doer' of the action such as walker.) When it comes to compounds, children first make up names for agents and instruments that they don't know by a pattern (N-N), though some of them do not follow the pattern (*cutter grass for grass cutter). Then, they might have the right structure but the words are inappropriate since English already has words with the intended meaning such as car-smoke = exhaust. This process points to a preference for building words from other words, thus place less demand on memory than learning an entirely new word for each concept.

===Grammatical development===
Grammar describes the way sentences of a language are constructed, which includes both [[syntax]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grammar|title = Grammar|date = |access-date = |website = Dictionary.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syntactic development and morphological development====

Syntactic development involves the ways that various morphemes are ordered or combined in sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the definition of syntactic|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/syntactic|website = Dictionary.com|access-date = 2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Morpheme]]s, which are basic units of meaning in language, get added as children learn to produce simple sentences and become more precise speakers. Morphemes can be whole words (like "happy") or parts of words that change meaning of words ("&lt;u&gt;un"&lt;/u&gt;happy). Brown&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; proposed a stage model that describes the various types of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] structures that are developed in English and the age range within which they are normally acquired.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.speech-language-therapy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33:brown&amp;catid=2:uncategorised&amp;Itemid=117|title = Brown's Stages of Syntactic Development|date = 1998|access-date = |website = speech language therapy dot com|publisher = |last = Bowen|first = C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stage I:''' From '''15–30 months''', children start using telegraphic speech, which are two word combinations, for example 'wet diaper'. Brown (1973)&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, R. (1973). A first language: The early stages. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; observed that 75% of children's two-word utterances could be summarized in the existence of 11 [[semantic]] relations:&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*Attributive: 'Big house'
*Agent-action: 'Daddy hit'
*Action-object: 'Hit ball'
*Agent-object: 'Daddy ball'
*Nominative: 'That ball'
*Demonstrative: 'There ball'
*Recurrence: 'More ball'
*Non-existence: 'All-gone ball'
*Possessive: 'Daddy chair'
*Entity + Locative: 'book table'
*Action + Locative: 'go store'
{{div col end}}

'''Stage II:''' At around '''28–36 months''', children begin to engage in the production of simple sentences, usually 3 word sentences. These simple sentences follow syntactic rules and are refined gradually as development&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; continues. The morphological developments seen in this age range include use of present progressive (&lt;u&gt;-ing&lt;/u&gt; endings), the prepositions "in" and "on", and regular plurals (&lt;u&gt;-s&lt;/u&gt; endings).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Stage III:''' Around '''36–42 months''', children continue to add morphemes and gradually produce complex grammatical structures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The morphemes that are added at this age include irregular past tense, possessive ('s), and use of the verb 'to be' (It &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt;, I &lt;u&gt;am&lt;/u&gt;, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Stage IV:'''Around '''40–46 months''' children continue to add to their morphological knowledge. This range is associated with use of articles (&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt;), regular past tense (&lt;u&gt;-ed&lt;/u&gt; endings), and regular third person speech (&lt;u&gt;He likes&lt;/u&gt; it).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Stage V:''' Around '''42-52+ months''' children refine the complex grammatical structures and increase their use of morphemes to convey more complex ideas. Children in this stage use irregular third-person speech, the verb 'to be' as an auxiliary verb (She &lt;u&gt;was not&lt;/u&gt; laughing), and in its contraction forms (It&lt;u&gt;'s&lt;/u&gt;, She&lt;u&gt;'s&lt;/u&gt;, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Pragmatics development===
From birth to one year, babies can engage in [[joint attention]] (sharing the attention of something with someone else). Infants also can engage in turn taking activities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rochat|first=Philippe|last2=Querido|first2=Jane G.|last3=Striano|first3=Tricia|date=1999|title=Emerging sensitivity to the timing and structure of protoconversation in early infancy.|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=950–957|doi=10.1037//0012-1649.35.4.950|issn=0012-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of their sensitivity to reactive contingency, which can elicit social responses in the babies from very early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=John S.|date=1972|title=SMILING, COOING, AND "THE GAME"|jstor=23084026|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly of Behavior and Development|volume=18|issue=4|pages=323–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*By '''1–2 years''', they can engage in conversational turn taking and topic maintenance {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and understand that turn taking interaction of others can convey relevant, communicative information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=György|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27804-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|issn=2045-2322|pmc=6015048|pmid=29934630}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*By '''age 3–5''', children can master illocutionary intent, knowing what you meant to say even though you might not have said it and turnabout, which is turning the conversation over to another person.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
*By '''age 6–10''', shading occurs, which is changing the conversation topic gradually. Children are able to communicate effectively in demanding settings, such as on the telephone.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Effect of bilingualism===

There is a large debate regarding whether or not [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] is truly beneficial to children. Parents of children often view learning a second language throughout elementary and high school education beneficial to the child.&lt;ref name="Bialystok 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bialystok | first1 = E. | last2 = Craik | first2 = FI. | last3 = Luk | first3 = G. | title = Bilingualism: consequences for mind and brain | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 240–50 |date=Apr 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2012.03.001 | pmid = 22464592 | pmc = 3322418 | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:10587326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another perspective dictates that the second language just confuses the child and prevents them from mastering their primary language.&lt;ref name="Blumenfeld 2009 10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blumenfeld|first=H|author2=Faroqi-Shah, Y |title=Bilingualism: Consequences for language, cognition, development, and the brain|journal=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|year=2009|volume=14|issue=13|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that American bilingual children have greater [[cognitive flexibility]], better perceptual skills and tend to be divergent thinkers than [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] children between the ages of five to ten.&lt;ref name="Bialystok 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blumenfeld 2009 10"/&gt;  Better executive functioning skills are likely because bilingual children have to choose one language to speak while actively suppressing the other. This builds stronger selective attention and cognitive flexibility because these skills are being exercised more.&lt;ref name = "Poulin-Dubois 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Poulin-Dubois | first1 = D. | last2 = Blayne | first2 = A. | last3 = Coutya |first3= J. | last4 = Bialystok | first4 = E. | title = The effects of bilingualism on todders' executive functioning | journal =  Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 108 | issue =  3 | pages = 567–579 | date = Mar 2011 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcep2010.10.009 | doi-broken-date = 2018-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, bilingual children have a better understanding of universal language concepts, such as grammar, because these concepts are applied in multiple languages.&lt;ref name = "Katsos 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Katsos | first1 = N. | last2 = Ezeisabarrena | first2 = MJ. | last3 = Gavarró | first3 = A. | last4 = Kraljević | first4 = JK. | last5 = Hrzica | first5 = G. | last6 = Noveck | first6 = I. | title = The acquisition of quantification across languages: some predictions. | journal = Cascadilla Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies comparing Swedish-Finnish bilingual children and Swedish monolingual children between the ages of five to seven have also shown that the bilingual children have a smaller vocabulary than monolingual children.&lt;ref name="Korkman 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Korkman | first1 = M. | last2 = Stenroos | first2 = M. | last3 = Mickos | first3 = A. | last4 = Westman | first4 = M. | last5 = Ekholm | first5 = P. | last6 = Byring | first6 = R. | title = Does simultaneous bilingualism aggravate children's specific language problems? | journal = Acta Paediatr | volume = 101 | issue = 9 | pages = 946–52 |date=Sep 2012 | doi = 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2012.02733.x | pmid = 22591054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study throughout America, elementary school English-monolingual children performed better in mathematics and reading activities than their non-English-dominant bilingual and non-English monolingual peers from kindergarten to grade five.&lt;ref name="Han 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Han | first1 = WJ. | title = Bilingualism and academic achievement. | journal = Child Dev | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 300–21 | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01686.x | pmid = 22098584 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning two languages simultaneously can be beneficial or a hindrance to a child's language and intellectual development.  Further research is necessary to continue to shed light on this debate.

In addition to the study of bilingualism in children, similar research is being conducted in adults. Research findings show that although bilingual benefits are muted in middle adulthood,&lt;ref name="Bialystok 2012" /&gt; they are more profound in older age when those who develop dementia experience onset about 4.5 years later in bilingual subjects.&lt;ref name = "Alladi 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alladi | first1 = S. | last2 = Bak | first2 = TH. | last3 = Duggirala | first3 = V. | last4 = Surampudi | first4 = B. | last5 = Shailaja | first5 = M. | last6 = Shukla | first6 = AK. | last7 = Kaul | first7 = S. | title = Bilingualism delays age at onset of dementia, independent of education and immigration status | journal = Neurology | volume = 18 | issue = 20 | pages = 1938–1944 | date = Nov 2013 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000436620.33155a4 | doi-broken-date = 2018-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased attentional control, inhibition, and conflict resolution developed from bilingualism may be accountable for the later onset of dementia.&lt;ref name="Bialystok 2012" /&gt;

==== Misdiagnoses as a language impairment ====
There is some research that demonstrates that bilingualism may often be misdiagnosed as a language impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohnert|first=K|date=2010|title=Bilingual children with primary language impairment: Issues, evidence, and implications for clinical actions|url=|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=15 |issue=1|pages=20–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subtopic of bilingualism in the literature is nonstandard varieties of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stockman|first=Ida J.|date=2010-01-01|title=A Review of Developmental and Applied Language Research on African American Children: From a Deficit to Difference Perspective on Dialect Differences|url=https://lshss.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1782696|journal=Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools|language=en|volume=41|issue=1|pages=23–38|doi=10.1044/0161-1461(2009/08-0086)|pmid=20051577|issn=0161-1461}}&lt;/ref&gt; While bilingualism and nonstandard varieties of English cannot be considered a true language impairment, they are misrepresented in the population of those receiving language interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dockrell|first=Julie E.|last2=Marshall|first2=Chloë R.|date=2015-05-01|title=Measurement Issues: Assessing language skills in young children|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/camh.12072|journal=Child and Adolescent Mental Health|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=116–125|doi=10.1111/camh.12072|issn=1475-3588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language disorders ==
A '''[[language disorder]]''' is the impaired comprehension and or use of a spoken, written, and/or other symbol system. A disorder may involve problems in the following areas: 
#The form of language i.e. [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], or [[syntax]] {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
#The content i.e. semantics{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
#The function of language in communication i.e. pragmatics {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Olswang and colleagues have identified a series of behaviors in children in the '''18–36 month''' range that are predictors for the need of language intervention.&lt;ref name="Olswang 1998"&gt;{{Cite web  | last1=Olswang| first1 = Lesley B |last2 = Rodriguez| first2=Barbara| last3=Timler| first3=Geralyn| title = Recommending Intervention for Toddlers With Specific Language Learning Difficulties | url =http://courses.washington.edu/sop/RecInterventionToddlers.pdf  | publisher = American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology| volume= 7 | pages= 23–32 | date = 1998| accessdate = 9 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These predictors include: 
* A smaller than average vocabulary 
* A language comprehension delay of 6 months or a comprehension deficit with a large comprehension production gap 
* Phonological problems such as restricted [[babbling]] or limited vocalizations 
* Few spontaneous vocal imitations and reliance on direct modeling in imitation tasks 
* Little combinatorial or symbolic play 
* Few communicative or symbolic gestures 
* Behavior problems&lt;ref name="Olswang 1998"/&gt;

'''Linguistic philosophy''' is the view that philosophical problems are problems which may be solved (or dissolved) either by reforming language, or by understanding more about the language we presently use.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty 1967, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The former position is that of ideal language philosophy, the latter the position of [[ordinary language philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Rorty 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lithuanian press ban''' ({{lang-lt|spaudos draudimas}}) was a ban on all [[Lithuanian language]] publications printed in the [[Latin alphabet]] in force from 1865 to 1904 within the [[Russian Empire]], which controlled [[Lithuania]] at the time.  Lithuanian-language publications that used [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] were allowed and even encouraged. 

The concept arose after the failed [[January Uprising]] of 1863, taking the form of an administrative order in 1864, and was not lifted until 26 April 1904. The Russian courts reversed two convictions in press ban cases in 1902 and 1903, and the setbacks of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in early 1904 brought about a loosened Russian policy towards minorities.&lt;ref name=LTR_en&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/Lithuanian_Resistance.en.htm Lithuanian Resistance]. Spaudos.lt, reprinted from [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]], Boston, 1970-1978. Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the ban, it was illegal to print, import, distribute, or possess any publications in the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name=lituanus3&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1996/96_3_03.htm Lithuania 1863-1893: Tsarist Russification And The Beginnings Of The Modern Lithuanian National Movement].

Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tsar]]ist authorities hoped that this measure, part of a larger [[Russification]] plan, would decrease Polish influence on Lithuanians and would return them to what were considered their ancient historical ties with Russia.&lt;ref name=geras/&gt; However, Lithuanians organized printing outside the Empire, largely in [[Lithuania Minor]] ([[East Prussia]]), and in the United States. 

[[Knygnešiai]] (Lithuanian book smugglers) smuggled illegal books and periodicals across the border. The number of such publications kept increasing despite strict sanctions and persecution of the activists. The ban created a well-defined and organized opposition to Russian rule and culture—the opposite of its original intent. The Lithuanian historian [[Edvardas Gudavičius]] has described the ban as a test of the concept of Lithuania: had there been no resistance, the language would have become a historical footnote, and the modern nation would never have been created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfpr.lt/uploads/File/1999-4/Gudavicius.pdf The Year 2000: History and Contemporary Experience] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162352/http://www.lfpr.lt/uploads/File/1999-4/Gudavicius.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}.

==Background==
[[File:Mazvydo katekizmas.jpg|right|150 px|thumb|[[Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas]] published in 1547]]
The first book published in print in the Lithuanian language was [[Lutheran]] [[Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas]] in 1547. Other milestone publications included [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]]'s ''Grammar'' in 1653, a publication of the [[Bible]] in 1735, and the first work of imaginative literature, [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]]' ''Metai'' ([[The Seasons (poem)|The Seasons]]), in 1818.  During the years of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which lasted from 1569 to 1781, the [[Polish language]] gained ground as the written ''[[lingua franca]]'' of greater Lithuania, although the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] areas of [[Lithuania Minor]] continued to issue publications in Lithuanian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelviewpublications.net/cilp/003/0062/cilp0030062.pdf Locating Lithuanian in the (Re-) Intellectualisation Debate]. channelviewpublications.net.

At the beginning of the 19th century, use of the [[Lithuanian language]] was largely limited to Lithuanian rural areas, apart from its use in Prussia; it was, however, retained by some members of the minor nobility, especially in the [[Samogitia]]n region. Several factors contributed to its subsequent revival: the language drew attention from scholars of the emerging science of [[comparative linguistics]]; after the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom in the Russian Empire in 1861]], [[social mobility]] increased, and Lithuanian intellectuals arose from the ranks of the rural populace; and language became associated with identity in Lithuania, as elsewhere across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1989/89_4_06.htm The Lithuanian language and nation through the ages: Outline of a history of Lithuanian in its social context] William R.

A closer relationship developed between the educated clergy, who were increasingly of ethnic Lithuanian stock, and their parishioners, including a sympathy with their wish to use the Lithuanian language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1988/88_3_02.htm Christianity in Lithuania]. Stanley Vardys, [[Lituanus]], Fall 1988. Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt; The emerging national movement sought to distance itself from both Polish and Russian influences, and the use of the Lithuanian language was seen as an important aspect of this movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/0472098985-ch7.pdf Nationalism in Post-Soviet Lithuania].

According to the [[bibliographer]] [[Vaclovas Biržiška]], between 1800 and 1864, when the press ban was enacted, 926 book titles were published in the Lithuanian language using its Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name=ltword&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/LietKalba/Books.en.htm ''Book, in the Lithuanian Language''].

After the [[partitions of Poland|partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the late 18th century, significant portions of Lithuania and Poland were incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]]. The uprising of 1863, seeking to re-establish the Commonwealth, convinced many Russian politicians that Polish cultural and political influence was the main obstacle hindering the Russification of Lithuania. They believed that if the Lithuanian peasantry were distanced from the [[Szlachta|Polonized nobility]] and the [[Catholic Church]], Lithuanians would naturally come under Russian cultural influence, as they had allegedly been during previous eras.&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Simas Sužiedėlis |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] |title=Press ban |year=1970–1978 |publisher=Juozas Kapočius |volume=IV |location=Boston, Massachusetts |id={{LCC|74-114275}} |pages=342–345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian politician Nikolai Miliutin wrote that "Russian letters will finish that which was begun with the Russian sword."&lt;ref name=schmalstieg1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1995_1/95_1_01.htm |title=Baudouin de Courtenay's Contribution to Lithuanian Linguistics |publisher=[[Lituanus]] |year=1995 |author=William R.

On 13 May 1863 Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] appointed [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov-Vilensky|Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov]] as the Governor General of the [[Vilna Governorate]].&lt;ref name=miknys/&gt; His duties included both suppression of the uprising, and implementation of the Russification policy. Because the situation was perceived as critical, Muravyov was temporarily granted extremely wide powers.&lt;ref name=le&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Lietuvių enciklopedija | title=Spaudos draudimas | location=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher=Lietuvių enciklopedijos leidykla |year=1963 |volume=28 |pages=334–337 |id={{LCC|55020366}} |url=http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/SD_issamiau.htm|accessdate= 2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muravyov and [[Ivan Petrovich Kornilov]], the newly appointed director of the [[Vilnius]] educational district, prepared a radical long-term Russification program that became known as the ''Program of Restoration of Russian Beginnings'' ({{lang-lt|Rusų pradų atkūrimo programa}}). Its stated goals were to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lietuvos istorija 11–12 klasėms | first=Rūstis |last=Kamuntavičius |author2=Vaida Kamuntavičienė |author3=Remigijus Civinskas |author4=Kastytis Antanaitis  |year=2001 |publisher=Vaga |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-415-01502-7 |pages=303–304|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Eliminate the Polish language from public life
# Prevent the employment of Catholics in government institutions
# Control and restrict the Catholic Church
# Create favorable conditions for the spread of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]
# Replace Lithuanian parish schools with Russian grammar schools
# Encourage ethnic Russians to resettle in Lithuanian lands
# Replace the Latin alphabet with the Cyrillic alphabet
# Ban any Lithuanian-language publications in the Latin alphabet

On 22 May 1864 Tsar Alexander II approved this program.&lt;ref name=miknys&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/History_a.en.htm | first=Rimantas |last=Miknys | title=Acquaintance with Lithuania. Book of the Millennium |volume=I |location=Kaunas |publisher=[[Kraštotvarka]] |year=1999 |pages=68–74 |isbn=9986-892-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later Muravyov issued an administrative order that forbade printing Lithuanian language textbooks written in the Latin alphabet. This order was developed into a comprehensive ban on September 6, 1865 by [[Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman]], Muravyov's successor.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; Kaufman issued an order to six neighboring governorates declaring a full ban on all publications and demanding that censorship committees enforce it without hesitation. A week later the order was extended to the entire Empire by [[Pyotr Valuev]], Minister of the Interior. In 1866 the ban was further extended to include all academic books.&lt;ref name=le/&gt;

Despite its strict and widespread enforcement, none of the ban's supporting measures were ever actually codified into law. The ban was enforced based solely on administrative orders and the tsar's approval.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; When the special temporary powers of the Governor General were revoked in 1871, these administrative orders lost any legal value. From that point on the ban had no legal basis, but it was still strictly enforced.&lt;ref name=le/&gt;

At first the Russian authorities encouraged and sponsored the publication of Lithuanian-language works in the Cyrillic alphabet. The idea of replacing the Latin alphabet with Cyrillic was first elaborated by the well-known [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]] [[Alexander Hilferding]] in his 1863 book ''Lithuania and Samogitia''.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; &lt;!-- Vasili Kulin, an educational superintendent, argued that the administration should use all its means to support Orthodoxy as well, and that results could be expected within five years.{{Citation needed|date = March 2009}}   --&gt;

The first experiments with the conversion of Lithuanian writings into Cyrillic were conducted by a Lithuanian linguist, [[Jonas Juška]]. He showed some samples of adapted texts to both Muravyov and Kornilov in February 1864.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; However, Juška discontinued his work and Kornilov formed a committee to work on publishing Lithuanian books in Cyrillic. The committee had four members: the Polish librarian [[Stanisław Mikucki]] from [[Warsaw]], Russian Jonas Kerčinskis, a Lithuanian [[Catholic]] priest who had converted to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], Antanas Petkevičius, and the well-known Lithuanian educator and publisher [[Laurynas Ivinskis]].&lt;ref name=le/&gt; Ivinskis soon withdrew from the committee. The first such  book was a primer intended for use in the new Russian schools that were replacing the Lithuanian parish schools. It appeared during the summer of 1864. The committee also published a [[Breviary|prayer book]], a calendar, and other religious literature.

About 55 Lithuanian-Cyrillic titles were published during the 40 years of the ban; about half of these were published during its first decade.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; Seeing that the Lithuanian people were unwilling to accept these books, even when they were offered for free, the Russian government shifted its attention to eliminating the illegal publications.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The Russian Ministry of Education issued a report in May 1898 recommending that the press ban be repealed. The report stated that the ban had produced adverse and unforeseen results, including the development of Lithuanian nationalism. Other Russian officials had opined that the interests of the Russian state would be better served by the presence of a legal Lithuanian press that could be censored.&lt;ref name=LTR_en/&gt;

During the years of the ban, 3,047 people (829 [[knygnešiai|smugglers]], 859 distributors, and 1,359 persons possessing banned books) were arrested in connection with the ban.&lt;ref name=geras&gt;{{cite book | last=Jakštas | first=Juozas | editor=Ed.

Anti-Russian sentiment and distrust of the tsarist authorities had arisen after the 1863 revolt. The ban was also perceived as a threat to the Catholic Church; the Eastern Orthodox Church used the Cyrillic alphabet, and loyalty to the Latin alphabet was also a symbolic loyalty to Catholicism.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; Attempts were made to circumvent the ban by using [[Blackletter|Gothic script]]. However, that was also banned in 1872. A number of problems arose with the various Lithuanian-Cyrillic orthographies, which were all criticized as ill-adapted to the Lithuanian language. Within Russia, the ban was opposed by scholarly, liberal, and pro-democratic groups, which served to mitigate the punishments.&lt;ref name=lituanus3/&gt;
[[File:List of confiscated Lithuanian books.jpg|thumb|right|List of confiscated Lithuanian books in 1896]]
The organized resistance to the ban, both legal and illegal, was largely initiated by bishop [[Motiejus Valančius]], who petitioned the government to exempt prayer books from the ban. He then moved towards sponsoring the [[Knygnešiai|illegal flow of books from outside Lithuania]]. The period from Valančius death in 1875 to 1883 saw the establishment of the Lithuanian-language newspaper ''[[Auszra]]'' (The Dawn), and the resistance at this time is associated with bishop [[Antanas Baranauskas]]. The resistance intensified towards the end of the 19th century, after another major newspaper, ''[[Varpas]]'' (The Bell), edited by [[Vincas Kudirka]], was established in 1889. Between 1891 and 1893, 31,718 publications were confiscated and destroyed; between 1900 and 1902 this number increased to 56,182, reflecting their increased flow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/Knygnesiai/Knygnesys.en.htm Knygnešys/Booksmuggler]. The Lithuanian Word, Reprinted from the [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]], Boston, 1970-1978. Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from 1890 to 1904 saw the publication of about 2,500 book titles in the Lithuanian Latin alphabet.  The majority of these were published in [[Tilsit]], a city in [[East Prussia]], although some publications reached Lithuania from the [[United States]]. A largely standardized written version of the language was achieved by the turn of the twentieth century, based on historical and [[Aukštaitija]]n (highland) usages;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lki.lt/index.php?test=206] Lithuanian Language Institute Abstracts.&lt;/ref&gt; the letters -č- and -š- were taken from [[Czech language|Czech]] orthography.&lt;ref name=gied&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/classes/lith/lith410/SUB_2004_double_orthography_SCHMA.pdf Double Orthography in American Lithuanian Newspapers at the Turn of the Twentieth Century].

A number of challenges to the ban's legal basis were made, and the use of this venue intensified at the end of the 19th century, along with an increasing number of letters, petitions, and protests from Lithuanians. In 1902 and 1903 the Russian Supreme Court reversed two press ban convictions that had been brought against Antanas Macijauskas and [[Povilas Višinskis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Awakening Lithuania |first=Jack J. |last=Stukas | publisher=The Florham Park Press | year=1966 |id={{LCC|66-28716}} |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decisions stated that the original executive decree creating the ban was illegal. The outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in February 1904 contributed to the Russian government's perception that its minorities needed to be accommodated.&lt;ref name=LTR_en/&gt; The ban was officially lifted on 26 April 1904.&lt;ref name=ltword/&gt;

==Effect on education==

Public and private education in Lithuanian was adversely affected by the press ban. The level of pent-up demand for schooling in the 19th century is illustrated by the increase in literacy in the [[Rietavas]] area; between 1853 and 1863, just before the ban, the number of literate persons rose from 11,296 to 24,330.&lt;ref name="lituanus3"/&gt; The subsequent ban is thought to have contributed to [[illiteracy]] in 19th-century Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/2004/04_4_2Markelis.htm Talking Through Letters - Collaborative Writing in Early Lithuanian Immigrant Life]. [[Lituanus]], Winter 2004. Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the ruling, parish schools were closed. A shortage of teachers led to the closure of a number of state schools as well, in spite of population growth. Parents began to withdraw their children from the state schools, since they were associated with the policy of Russification; students were not allowed to speak Lithuanian among themselves, and a discouraging atmosphere was created by the system of searches, inspections, and spying. Many students were schooled at home or in small secret groups instead, although this practice also resulted in sanctions.&lt;ref name=lituanus3/&gt;

A census of the [[Kovno Governorate]] in 1897 showed that a higher proportion of older people than younger had received formal education: of persons age 30 to 39, 61.87% had experienced some level of formal education, compared to only 54.68% of persons aged 10 to 19.&lt;ref name="lituanus3"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Proclamation of 1904.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Lithuanian proclamation after press ban lift, title reads ''Press is allowed!'' (1904)]]
After the ban was lifted, printing presses and their supporting social and cultural infrastructure needed to be established. The first issue of a Lithuanian newspaper after the ban, ''[[Vilniaus žinios]]'', appeared on December 23, 1904; the [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]], which took place in November 1905, was now able to issue its announcements and publications in Lithuanian.

The publishing houses of Martynas Kukta, [[Saliamonas Banaitis]], and the Society of [[St. Casimir]] in [[Kaunas]] were responsible for many of the publications issued between the end of the ban in 1904 and the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1918. The businessman [[Petras Vileišis]] installed a printing press at his [[Vileišis Palace|palace]], commissioned in 1904. During this period 4,734 Lithuanian-language titles in the Latin alphabet were published in Lithuania and abroad. After Lithuanian independence was established, the rate of publication increased steadily; 16,721 book titles were printed from 1918 to 1939. Between 1925 and 1939 about 800 to 900 book titles were printed annually.&lt;ref name=ltword/&gt;

A standard Lithuanian orthography and grammar were established during the ban, despite the fact that the co-ordination of this process, involving competing dialects, was forced to take place in several countries. The ban is widely felt to have stimulated the Lithuanian national movement, rather than discouraging it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lithuania/History#toc37338 |title=Lithuania - History - Russian Rule |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the 100th anniversary of the ban's end was noted in [[UNESCO]]'s events calendar, and the Lithuanian [[Seimas]] declared the "Year of the Lithuanian Language and Book." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/Knygnesiai/Lithuanian_Preserve.en.htm Preserving the Language].

[[File:Logos.svg|Left|thumb|[[Greek alphabet|Greek spelling]] of ''logos'']]

'''''Logos''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|ɒ|s|,_|ˈ|l|ɒ|ɡ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|oʊ|s}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]]|lógos}}; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}, {{transl|grc|légō}}, {{Literal translation|'I say'|lk=on}}) is a term in [[Western philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[rhetoric]], and [[religion]] derived from a Greek word variously meaning "ground", "plea", "opinion", "expectation", "word", "speech", "account", "reason", "proportion", and "discourse",&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: logos, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entrys[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; but it became a technical term in [[Western philosophy]] beginning with [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa| 535| 475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}), who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Heraclitus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' is the logic behind an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html |title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos |last=Butler|first=S|website=members.tripod.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' tries to persuade an audience using [[logical argument]]s and supportive evidence. ''Logos'' is a persuasive technique often used in writing and rhetoric.

Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways. The [[sophist]]s used the term to mean [[discourse]]; [[Aristotle]] applied the term to refer to "reasoned discourse"&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"/&gt; or "the argument" in the field of rhetoric, and considered it one of the three [[modes of persuasion]] alongside ''[[ethos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Christof, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/ Aristotle's Rhetoric]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers identified the term with the [[divine]] animating principle pervading the Universe. Within [[Hellenistic Judaism]], [[Philo of Alexandria]] ({{Circa| 20&amp;nbsp;BC| 50&amp;nbsp;AD}}) adopted the term into [[Jewish philosophy]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Philo Judaeus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of John]] identifies the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], through which all things are made, as divine (''[[God|theos]]''),&lt;ref name = "May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; and further identifies [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[incarnate]] Logos. The term is also used in [[Sufism]], and the analytical psychology of [[Carl Jung]].

Despite the conventional translation as "word", it is not used for a [[word]] in the grammatical sense; instead, the term ''lexis'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέξις|λέξις]]}}, {{transl|grc|léxis}}) was used.&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: lexis, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both ''logos'' and ''lexis'' derive from the same verb {{transl|grc|légō}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}), meaning  "(I) count, tell, say, speak".&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlego"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw2 ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: legō, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a "premise". She states that, to find the reason behind a rhetor's backing of a certain position or stance, one must acknowledge the different "premises" that the [[rhetor]] applies via his or her chosen diction.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahnestock|first1=Jeanne|title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetor's success, she argues, will come down to "certain objects of agreement...between arguer and audience". "Logos is logical appeal, and the term logic is derived from it. It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker's topic."&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotle's Three Modes of Persuasion in Rhetoric|url=http://www.mountainman.com.au/ESSENES/aristotles_modes_of_persuasion_in_rhetoric.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, logos is credited with appealing to the audience's sense of logic, with the definition of "logic" being concerned with the thing as it is known.&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"/&gt;
Furthermore, one can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways.  The first is through [[inductive reasoning]], providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://courses.durhamtech.edu/perkins/aris.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second is through [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[enthymeme]], providing the audience with general scenarios and then indicating commonalities among them.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"/&gt;

Philo distinguished between ''logos prophorikos'' ("the uttered word") and the ''logos endiathetos'' ("the word remaining within").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adam Kamesar|title=The ''Logos Endiathetos'' and the ''Logos Prophorikos'' in Allegorical Interpretation: Philo and the D-Scholia to the ''Iliad'' |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501000000*/https://web.duke.edu/classics/grbs/FTexts/44/Kamesar.pdf |journal=Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies (GRBS)|volume=44|year=2004|pages=163–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] also spoke of the ''[[logos spermatikos]]'' (the generative principle of the Universe) which foreshadows related concepts in [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L.

Eerdmans Publishing Co|year=1992|isbn=0-8028-3634-8|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early translators of the Greek [[New Testament]] such as [[Jerome]] (in the 4th century AD) were frustrated by the inadequacy of any single Latin word to convey the meaning of the word ''Logos'' as used to describe Jesus Christ in the [[Gospel of John]]. The [[Vulgate]] Bible usage of {{lang|la|in principio erat verbum}} was thus constrained to use the (perhaps inadequate) noun {{lang|la|verbum}} for "word", but later [[Romance language]] translations had the advantage of nouns such as {{lang|fr|le mot}} in French. Reformation translators took another approach. [[Martin Luther]] rejected {{lang|de|Zeitwort}} (verb) in favor of {{lang|de|Wort}} (word), for instance, although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving ''the living word'' as felt by Jerome and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==

===Heraclitus===
{{Further|Heraclitus#Logos}}
The writing of [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa|535|475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}})&lt;!---maintain consistency throughout article re: BC vs. BCE---&gt; was the first place where the word ''logos'' was given special attention in [[ancient Greek philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, ''Greek Philosophical Terms'', New York University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, Cambridge University Press, 1962, pp. 419ff.&lt;/ref&gt; For Heraclitus, ''logos'' provided the link between rational discourse and the world's rational structure.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This ''logos'' holds always but humans always prove unable to ever understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this ''logos'', humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.|[[Diels–Kranz]]|22B1}}

{{quote|For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the ''logos'' is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.|Diels–Kranz|22B2}}

{{quote|Listening not to me but to the ''logos'' it is wise to agree that all things are one.|Diels–Kranz|22B50&lt;ref&gt;Translations from Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Hackett, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What ''logos'' means here is not certain; it may mean "reason" or "explanation" in the sense of an objective cosmic law, or it may signify nothing more than "saying" or "wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;''Handboek geschiedenis van de wijsbegeerte 1'', Article by Jaap Mansveld &amp; Keimpe Algra, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, an independent existence of a universal ''logos'' was clearly suggested by Heraclitus.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie, ''The Greek Philosophers: From Thales to Aristotle'', Methuen, 1967, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle identifies two specific types of persuasion methods: artistic and inartistic.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovering the Arguments: Artistic and Inartistic Proofs|url=http://www.classicalwriting.com/blog/2010/01/12/discovering-the-arguments-artistic-and-inartistic-proofs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines artistic proofs as arguments that the [[rhetor]] generates and creates on their own. Examples of these include  relationships, testimonies, and conjugates. He defines inartistic proofs as arguments that the rhetor quotes using information from a non-self-generated source. Examples of these include laws, contracts, and [[oath]]s.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"/&gt;

===Aristotle's rhetorical logos===
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|Aristotle, 384–322 BC.]]
Following one of the other meanings of the word, [[Aristotle]] gave ''logos'' a different technical definition in the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', using it as meaning argument from reason, one of the three [[modes of persuasion]]. The other two modes are ''[[pathos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθος|πᾰ́θος]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthos}}), which refers to persuasion by means of emotional appeal, "putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind";&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', in Patricia P. Matsen, Philip B. Rollinson, and Marion Sousa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R3iLyz9zd7cC&amp;pg=PA120 Readings from Classical Rhetoric]'', SIU Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8093-1592-0}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[ethos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἦθος|ἦθος]]}}, {{transl|grc|êthos}}), persuasion through convincing listeners of one's "moral character".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt; According to Aristotle, ''logos'' relates to "the speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html translation by W. Rhys Roberts], this reads "the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself".&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Paul Rahe:

{{Quote|For Aristotle, ''logos'' is something more refined than the capacity to make private feelings public: it enables the human being to perform as no other animal can; it makes it possible for him to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse the difference between what is advantageous and what is harmful, between what is just and what is unjust, and between what is good and what is evil.&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"&gt;Paul Anthony Rahe, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zymp_kM33ZcC&amp;pg=PA21 Republics Ancient and Modern: The Ancien Régime in Classical Greece]'', University of North Carolina Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-8078-4473-X}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'' can all be appropriate at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Garver, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PoXnLHQ5mgwC&amp;pg=PA114 Aristotle's Rhetoric: An art of character]'', University of Chicago Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-226-28424-7}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments from reason (logical arguments) have some advantages, namely that [[data]] are (ostensibly) difficult to manipulate, so it is harder to argue against such an argument; and such arguments make the speaker look prepared and knowledgeable to the audience, enhancing ''ethos''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} On the other hand, trust in the speaker—built through ''ethos''—enhances the appeal of arguments from reason.&lt;ref&gt;Garver, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Wardy]] suggests that what Aristotle rejects in supporting the use of ''logos'' "is not emotional appeal [[Per se (Latin)|per se]], but rather emotional appeals that have no 'bearing on the issue', in that the ''pathē'' [{{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθη|πᾰ́θη]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthē}}] they stimulate lack, or at any rate are not shown to possess, any intrinsic connection with the point at issue—as if an advocate were to try to whip an [[antisemitic]] audience into a fury because the accused is Jewish; or as if another in drumming up support for a politician were to exploit his listeners's reverential feelings for the politician's ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wardy, "Mighty Is the Truth and It Shall Prevail?", in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QkIn37h_TMUC&amp;pg=PA64 Essays on Aristotle's Rhetoric]'', Amélie Rorty (ed), University of California Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-520-20228-7}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle comments on the three modes by stating: 
{{Quote|Persuasion is clearly a sort of demonstration, since we are most fully persuaded when we consider a thing to have been demonstrated. Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. ... Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. ... Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech stirs their emotions. ... Thirdly, persuasion is effected through the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.{{whose translation}}|Aristotle|''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''|350&amp;nbsp;BC}}

===Stoics===
[[Stoic philosophy]] began with [[Zeno of Citium]] {{Circa|300&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}, in which the ''logos'' was the active [[reason]] pervading and animating the [[Universe]]. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with [[God]] or [[Nature]]. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal logos'' ("''[[logos spermatikos]]''"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos''.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics took all activity to imply a ''logos'' or spiritual principle. As the operative principle of the world, the ''logos'' was ''[[anima mundi]]'' to them, a concept which later influenced [[Philo of Alexandria]], although he derived the contents of the term from Plato.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wUF15rypDscC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Anima+mundi+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jwl8TP_xI8KSjAfUm-jSDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Anima%20mundi%20logos&amp;f=false ''Studies in European Philosophy''], by James Lindsay, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4067-0173-4}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In his Introduction to the 1964 edition of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote that "''Logos'' ... had long been one of the leading terms of [[Stoicism]], chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isocrates' logos===
Public discourse on ancient Greek rhetoric has historically emphasized Aristotle's appeals to ''logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'', while less attention has been directed to [[Isocrates]]' teachings about philosophy and ''logos'',&lt;ref name="David M 2010"&gt;David M. Timmerman and [[Edward Schiappa]], ''Classical Greek Rhetorical Theory and the Disciplining of Discourse'' (London: Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010): 43–66&lt;/ref&gt; and their partnership in generating an ethical, mindful ''[[polis]]''. Isocrates does not provide a single definition of ''logos'' in his work, but Isocratean ''logos'' characteristically focuses on speech, reason, and civic discourse.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt; He was concerned with establishing the "common good" of [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] citizens, which he believed could be achieved through the pursuit of philosophy and the application of ''logos''.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt;

==In Hellenistic Judaism==
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
In the [[Septuagint]] the term ''logos'' is used for the word of God in the creation of heaven in Psalm 33:6, and in some related contexts.

===Philo of Alexandria===
[[Philo]] ({{Circa|20&amp;nbsp;BC|50&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}), a [[Hellenized Jew]], used the term Logos to mean an intermediary divine being or [[demiurge]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"/&gt; Philo followed the Platonic distinction between [[Hylic|imperfect matter]] and perfect Form, and therefore intermediary beings were necessary to bridge the enormous gap between God and the material world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"&gt;[[Frederick Copleston]], ''A History of Philosophy'', Volume 1, Continuum, 2003, pp. 458–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Logos'' was the highest of these intermediary beings, and was called by Philo "the first-born of God".&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;
Philo also wrote that "the Logos of the living God is the bond of everything, holding all things together and binding all the parts, and prevents them from being dissolved and separated".&lt;ref&gt;Philo, ''De Profugis'', cited in [https://archive.org/details/hellenismchristi00frieiala Gerald Friedlander, ''Hellenism and Christianity'', P. Vallentine, 1912, pp. 114–15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato's Theory of Forms]] was located within the Logos, but the Logos also acted on behalf of God in the physical world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt; In particular, the [[Angel of the Lord]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Old Testament]]) was identified with the Logos by Philo, who also said that the Logos was God's instrument in the creation of the Universe.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main article|Logos (Christianity)}}
[[File:Prologus Ioanni Vulgata Clementina.jpg|thumb|''In principio erat verbum'', [[Latin (language)|Latin]] for ''In the beginning was the Word'', from the [[Clementine Vulgate]], [[Gospel of John]], 1:1–18.]]
In [[Christology]], the ''Logos'' ({{lang-el|Λόγος|lit='Word", "Discourse", or "Reason'}})&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; is a name or title of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], seen as the pre-existent second [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)#Christian_theology|person]] of the [[Trinity]]. The concept derives from [[John 1:1]], which in the [[Douay–Rheims]], [[King James Version|King James]], [[New International Version|New International]], and other versions of the [[Bible]], reads:
{{quote|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the translations, "Word" is used for Λόγος, although the term is often used [[transliterated]] but untranslated in theological discourse.
The Koine Greek reads, "Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν '''πρὸς τὸν θεόν''', '''καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος'''.(En arkhêi ên ho lógos, kaì ho lógos ên ''pròs tòn theón, kaì theòs ên ho lógos''.) The definite article is used with 'theos/god', making it 'God', and the second usage is indefinite (without an article), rendering it 'god'. Thus David Bentley Hart translates it as 'In the origin there was the Logos, and the Logos was present with GOD, and the Logos was god'.&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart. ''The New Testament: A Translation''. Yale, 2017, ISBN 0-978-0-300-18609-3, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many ancient Greek scholars, including Dr. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature) explains that concepts of definite articles in English and Koine Greek are not similar: "In the New World Translation the opening verse of the Gospel according to John is mistranslated as follows: “Originally the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.” A footnote which is added to the first word, “Originally,” reads, “Literally, In (At) a beginning.” By using here the indefinite article “a” the translators have overlooked the well-known fact that in Greek grammar nouns may be definite for various reasons, whether or not the Greek definite article is present. A prepositional phrase, for example, where the definite article is not expressed, can be quite definite in Greek, [in Hebrew 10:31, "εις χειρας θεου ζωντος" is properly rendered (even by the New World Translation) with the definite article expressed twice, “into the hands of the living God.”] as in fact it is in John 1:1"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Bruce M.|date=April 1953|title=The Jehovah'S Witnesses and Jesus Christ: A Biblical and Theological Appraisal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004057365301000110|journal=Theology Today|volume=10|pages=65-85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=729|title=WHAT GREEK SCHOLARS REALLY THINK!|last=|first=|date=2003|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letusreason.org/jw38.htm|title=The dispute on Jn.1:1|last=|first=|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhema==
The word ''logos'' has been used in different senses along with ''[[rhema]]''. Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] used the term ''logos'' along with ''rhema'' to refer to sentences and propositions.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 {{ISBN|0-87840-278-0}} p. 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600'' by Vivien Law 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-56532-4}} p. 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=M_ooh9Q9cDMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3Up4TPWLA-DT4wallLWvBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek uses the terms ''rhema'' and ''logos'' as equivalents and uses both for the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[dabar]]'', as the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Theological dictionary of the New Testament, Volume 1'' by Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich, Geoffrey William Bromiley 1985 {{ISBN|0-8028-2404-8}} p. 508 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ltZBUW_F9ogC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=dabar+rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nhR5TOrOBtuT4gbY9uyrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dabar%20rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z'' by Geoffrey W.

==Neoplatonism==
[[File:Plotinus and disciples.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Plotinus]] with his disciples.]]
[[Neoplatonist]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] ({{Circa|204/5|lk=on}}{{snd}}270&amp;nbsp;AD) used the term "Logos" in ways that drew on Plato and the [[Stoics]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Wagner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZJMzbtNFNsC&amp;pg=PA116 Neoplatonism and Nature: Studies in Plotinus' Enneads]'', Volume 8 of ''Studies in Neoplatonism'', SUNY Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7914-5271-9}}, pp. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt; but the term Logos was interpreted in different ways throughout Neoplatonism, and similarities to Philo's concept of Logos appear to be accidental.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Rist, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=n49OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA84 Plotinus: The road to reality]'', Cambridge University Press, 1967, {{ISBN|0-521-06085-0}}, pp. 84–101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Logos was a key element in the [[meditation]]s of Plotinus&lt;ref&gt;''Between Physics and Nous: Logos as Principle of Meditation in Plotinus'', The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, 1999, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as the first Neoplatonist. Plotinus referred back to [[Heraclitus]] and as far back as [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;Handboek Geschiedenis van de Wijsbegeerte I, Article by Carlos Steel&lt;/ref&gt; in interpreting Logos as the principle of meditation, existing as the interrelationship between the [[hypostases]]—the [[soul]], the intellect (''[[nous]]''), and the [[Monad (philosophy)|One]].&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, Institute of Global Cultural Studies, Binghamton University, 1999, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus used a trinity concept that consisted of "The One", the "Spirit", and "Soul". The comparison with the Christian [[Trinity]] is inescapable, but for Plotinus these were not equal and "The One" was at the highest level, with the "Soul" at the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jcg83ynsJEwC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=plotinus+trinity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Is18TLriMt6U4gakq5CGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=plotinus%20trinity&amp;f=false] ''Ancient philosophy'' by Anthony Kenny 2007 {{ISBN|0-19-875272-5}} p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; For Plotinus, the relationship between the three elements of his trinity is conducted by the outpouring of Logos from the higher principle, and ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' (loving) upward from the lower principle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Enneads'' by Plotinus, [[Stephen MacKenna]], John M.

==Islam==
{{Main article|Logos (Islam)}}
The concept of the ''logos'' also exists in [[Islam]], where it was definitively articulated primarily in the writings of the classical [[Sunni]] [[Sufism|mystics]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], as well as by certain [[Shi'a]] thinkers, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardet, L., "Kalām", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., "ʿAḳl", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sunni Islam]], the concept of the ''logos'' has been given many different names by the denomination's [[metaphysician]]s, mystics, and philosophers, including ''ʿaql'' ("Intellect"), ''al-insān al-kāmil'' ("Universal Man"), ''kalimat Allāh'' ("Word of God"), ''haqīqa muḥammadiyya'' ("The Muhammadan Reality"), and ''nūr muḥammadī'' ("The Muhammadan Light").

===''ʿAql''===
One of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is ''ʿaql'', which is the "Arabic equivalent to the Greek {{lang|grc|[[nous|νοῦς]]}} ('intellect')."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; In the writings of the Islamic [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers, such as [[al-Farabi]] ({{Circa|872|950&amp;nbsp;AD}}) and [[Avicenna]] (d. 1037),&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; the idea of the ''ʿaql'' was presented in a manner that both resembled "the late Greek doctrine" and, likewise, "corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;

The concept of Logos in Sufism is used to relate the "Uncreated" (God) to the "Created" (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the Logos. The Logos is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is "unique" within each region. [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] are seen as the personifications of the Logos, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.&lt;ref&gt;''Sufism: love &amp; wisdom'' by Jean-Louis Michon, Roger Gaetani 2006 {{ISBN|0-941532-75-5}} p. 242 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVt-EvXnEC4C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BMNQNOHXKOMC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false ''Sufi essays''] by Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1973{{ ISBN|0-87395-233-2}} p. 148]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the Neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]], who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works ''The Ringstones of Wisdom'' (''Fusus al-Hikam'') and ''The Meccan Illuminations'' (''Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya''). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a Logos ([[Kalimah]]), as an aspect of the unique Divine Being. In his view the Divine Being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with Logos providing the link between man and divinity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N.

Ibn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the Logos concept from Neoplatonic and Christian sources,&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Frazee, "Ibn al-'Arabī and Spanish Mysticism of the Sixteenth Century", ''Numen'' '''14''' (3), Nov 1967, pp. 229–40.&lt;/ref&gt; although (writing in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Little |first=John T. |last2= |first2= |date=January 1987 |title=AL-INSĀN AL-KĀMIL: THE PERFECT MAN ACCORDING TO IBN AL-'ARAB? |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x/abstract |journal=The Muslim World |publisher=Hartford Seminary |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=43–54 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x |access-date=30 May 2016 |quote="Ibn al-'Arabi uses no less than twenty-two different terms to describe the various aspects under which this single Logos may be viewed."}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobie  |first=Robert J. |date=17 November 2009 |title=Logos and Revelation: Ibn 'Arabi, Meister Eckhart, and Mystical Hermeneutics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWVwT3UpthUC&amp;pg=PA225 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Catholic University of America Press  |page=225 |isbn= 081321677X |quote="For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Sufi writers also show the influence of the Neoplatonic Logos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Henry Whinfield]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=l0vHUo0wnlgC&amp;pg=PR25 Masnavi I Ma'navi: The spiritual couplets of Maulána Jalálu-'d-Dín Muhammad Rúmí]'', Routledge, 2001 (originally published 1898), {{ISBN|0-415-24531-1}}, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century [[Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī]] introduced the ''Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man''. For al-Jīlī, the "perfect man" (associated with the Logos or the Holy Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N. Hanif 2002 {{ISBN|81-7625-266-2}} p. 98 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bhpr7RTLMAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jili&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sufism, Şeyh Gâlib (d. 1799) articulates Sühan (Logos-''Kalima'') in his ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'') in parallel to Ibn Arabi's Kalima. In the romance, ''Sühan'' appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Betül Avcı, "Character of ''Sühan'' in Şeyh Gâlib’s Romance, ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'')" ''Archivum Ottomanicum'', 32 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2018}}

==Jung's analytical psychology==
[[File:Carl Jung (1912).png|thumb|150px|A 37-year-old [[Carl Jung]] in 1912.]]
[[Carl Jung]] contrasted the critical and rational faculties of logos with the emotional, non-reason oriented and mythical elements of ''eros''.&lt;ref&gt;''C.G. Jung and the psychology of symbolic forms'' by Petteri Pietikäinen 2001 {{ISBN|951-41-0857-4}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Jung's approach, logos vs eros can be represented as "science vs mysticism", or "reason vs imagination" or "conscious activity vs the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;''Mythos and logos in the thought of Carl Jung'' by Walter A. Shelburne 1988 {{ISBN|0-88706-693-3}} p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yV-ZE8pyZjkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jung, logos represented the masculine principle of rationality, in contrast to its female counterpart, ''[[eros (concept)|eros]]'':

{{Quote|Woman’s psychology is founded on the principle of ''Eros'', the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is ''Logos''. The concept of ''Eros'' could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of ''Logos'' as objective interest.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Aspects of the Feminine'', Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-7100-9522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jung attempted to equate logos and eros, his intuitive conceptions of masculine and feminine consciousness, with the [[alchemical]] Sol and Luna. Jung commented that in a man the lunar [[Anima and animus|anima]] and in a woman the solar [[Anima and animus|animus]] has the greatest influence on consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=jung+eros+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3CR5TLn_IqiM4gbNvYSUBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=jung%20eros%20logos&amp;f=false ''Aspects of the masculine'' by Carl Gustav Jung, John Beebe p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung often proceeded to analyze situations in terms of "paired opposites", e.g. by using the analogy with the eastern [[yin and yang]]&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Gustav Jung: critical assessments'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 1992 {{ISBN|0-415-04830-3}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and was also influenced by the Neoplatonists.&lt;ref&gt;See the Neoplatonic section above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' Jung made some important final remarks about anima and animus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In so far as the spirit is also a kind of "window on eternity"... it conveys to the soul a certain influx divinus... and the knowledge of a higher system of the world, wherein consists precisely its supposed animation of the soul.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in this book Jung again emphasized that the animus compensates eros, while the anima compensates logos.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of Jungian psychology: theory, practice and applications'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 2006 {{ISBN|1-58391-147-2}} p. 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt7FfLRi17kC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jung&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Lost in Translation''''' is a novel written by [[Nicole Mones]], published by Bantam Dell in 1999. It is the story of an American woman trying to lose her past by living as a translator in [[China]]. Emotionally charged and erotic, this widely translated bestseller has been universally praised for its authoritative portrayal of a China rarely captured in contemporary fiction. The novel’s accolades include the Kafka Prize for the year’s best work of fiction by any American woman, the Pacific Northwest Bookseller’s Association Book Award for the year’s best novel from the five northwestern states, and the New York Times Book Review’s ''Notable Book'' and ''Editor’s Choice''.

== Summary ==
Expatriate translator Alice Mannegan spends her nights in Beijing’s smoky bars, seeking fleeting encounters with Chinese men to blot out the shame of her racist father back in Texas. But when she signs on to an archaeological expedition searching for the missing bones of Peking Man in China’s remote Northwest deserts, her world cracks open. As the group follows the trail of the Jesuit philosopher/paleontologist Teilhard de Chardin to close in on one of archaeology’s greatest mysteries, Alice finds herself increasingly drawn to a Chinese professor who is shackled by his own painful memories. Love in all its forms–human, sexual, divine, between a nation and its history, a man and his past, a father and his daughter–drives the story to its breathtaking finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lost in Translation {{!}} Nicole Mones|url = http://www.nicolemones.com/books/lost-in-translation/|website = www.nicolemones.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews and comments ==
* Julie Checkoway: "Isn't ancestry, one's place in a personal, familial and cultural lineage, a difficult fact to ignore or erase? It is the obsessive concern with this question that drives the plot of Nicole Mones's ambitious debut novel, Lost in Translation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nicole Mones - Lost in Translation - Book Review|url = http://bookpage.com/reviews/173-nicole-mones-lost-translation#.Vpjf5hXhDIU|website = BookPage.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lisa See: "Mones has used her story to talk about race and racism, especially in the ways that Chinese and Americans view each other. (...) While Mones seems to be exploring issues of race and taboo, her treatment of them is finally muddled. Still, her search for (...) that enigmatic place where man and woman fall in love is thought-provoking, sometimes disturbing and undeniably entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sex, Race and Peking Man|url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/20/reviews/980920.20seelt.html|website = www.nytimes.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a blog interview discussing her works, Mones described Alice, the main character, as "one of the few characters who really seemed to write herself". Mones also recalls her past working in China as an inspiration for Alice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NICOLE MONES: NIGHT IN SHANGHAI TOOK ME FIVE YEARS|url = http://landofbooks.org/2015/03/29/nicole-mones-night-in-shanghai-took-me-five-years/|website = Land Of Books|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"When I was young, I was close to a young man whose father was suspected of having committed a racially motivated murder during the Civil Rights movement in the U.S. in the early 1960s. The burden of second-hand guilt lay heavy on my friend, and he moved to Hong Kong and refused to return to America. Then, he was killed in an accident. Looking back, I think I started writing the novel a few years after his death in order to play out his story and give it an ending."''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9741">The term ''metafunction'' originates in [[systemic functional linguistics]] and is considered to be a property of all languages. [[Systemic functional linguistics]] is functional and semantic rather than formal and syntactic in its orientation. As a functional linguistic theory, it claims that both the emergence of grammar and the particular forms that grammars take should be explained “in terms of the functions that language evolved to serve”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1994. "Systemic Theory". In R.E. Asher (ed) ''Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'', Vol 8. Pergamon Press. Reprinted in full in Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. ''On Language and Linguistics: Volume 3 in the ''Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; While languages vary in how and what they do, and what humans do with them in the contexts of human cultural practice, all languages are considered to be shaped and organised in relation to three functions, or metafunctions. [[Michael Halliday]], the founder of systemic functional linguistics, calls these three functions the ''ideational'', ''interpersonal'', and ''textual''. The ideational function is further divided into the ''experiential'' and ''logical''.

Metafunctions are ''systemic clusters''; that is, they are groups of semantic systems that make meanings of a related kind. The three metafunctions are mapped onto the structure of the clause. For this reason, systemic linguists analyse a clause from three perspectives. Halliday argues that the concept of metafunction is one of a small set of principles that are necessary to explain how language works; this concept of function in language is necessary to explain the organisation of the semantic system of language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Function is considered to be "a fundamental property of language itself".&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ruqaiya Hasan]], the metafunctions in SFL "are not hierarchised; they have equal status, and each is manifested in every act of language use: in fact, an important task for grammatics is to describe how the three metafunctions are woven together into the same linguistic unit".&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan argues that this is one way in which Halliday's account of the functions of language is different from that of [[Karl Bühler]], for example, for whom functions of language are hierarchically ordered, with the referential function the most important of all. For Buhler, the functions were considered to operate one at a time. In SFL, the metafunctions operate simultaneously, and any utterance is a harmony of choices across all three functions.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideational function==
The ideational function is language concerned with building and maintaining a theory of experience. It includes&lt;!--comprises? Or is there something aside from the exper. and logical?--&gt; the experiential function and the logical function.

=== Experiential function ===
The experiential function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to make meanings about the world around us and inside us:

:"Most obviously, perhaps, when we watch small children interacting with the objects around them we can see that they are using language to construe a theoretical model of their experience. This is language in the experiential function; the patterns of meaning are installed in the brain and continue to expand on a vast scale as each child, in cahoots with all those around, builds up, renovates and keeps in good repair the semiotic “reality” that provides the framework of day-to-day existency and is manifested in every moment of discourse, spoken or listened to. We should stress, I think, that the grammar is not merely annotating experience; it is construing experience."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliday argues that it was through this process of humans making meaning from experience that language evolved. Thus, the human species had to “make sense of the complex world in which it evolved: to classify, or group into categories, the objects and events within its awareness”. These categories are not given to us through our senses; they have to be “construed”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1999. Grammar and the construction of educational knowledge. In The Language of Early Childhood. Volume 4 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;  In taking this position on the active role of grammar in construing “reality”, Halliday was influenced by [[Benjamin Lee Whorf|Whorf]].

===Logical function===
Halliday describes the logical function as those systems “which set up logical–semantic relationships between one clausal unit and another”&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The systems which come under the logical function are {{Sc|taxis}} and {{Smallcaps|logico-semantic relations}}. When two clauses are combined, a speaker chooses whether to give both clauses equal status, or to make one dependent on the other. In addition, a speaker choose some meaning relation in the process of joining or binding clauses together. Halliday argues that the meanings we make in such processes are most closely related to the experiential function. For this reason, he puts the experiential and logical functions together into the ideational function.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal function==
The interpersonal function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to enact their complex and diverse interpersonal relations. This tenet of [[systemic functional linguistics]] is based on the claim that a speaker not only talks about something, but is always talking to and with others. Language not only construes experience, but simultaneously acts out “the interpersonal encounters that are essential to our survival”.&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 16"&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the "architecture" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that these encounters:

:"range all the way from the rapidly changing microencounters of daily life – most centrally, semiotic encounters where we set up and maintain complex patterns of dialogue – to the more permanent institutionalized relationships that collectively constitute the social bond."&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 16"/&gt;

The grammatical systems that relate to the interpersonal function include &lt;!--Can these be not all-caps?--&gt;Mood, Modality, and Polarity.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]. London: Arnold.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual function==
Halliday argues that both experiential and interpersonal functions are intricately organized, but that between the two “there is comparatively very little constraint”. This means that “by and large, you can put any interactional ‘spin’ on any representational content”.&lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"/&gt; What allows meanings from these two modes to freely combine is the intercession of a third, distinct mode of meaning that Halliday refers to as the textual function. The term encompasses all of the grammatical systems responsible for managing the flow of discourse. These systems “create coherent text – text that coheres within itself and with the context of situation” &lt;ref name="Halliday, M.A.K 2003. p. 17"/&gt; They are both structural (involving choices relating to the ordering of elements in the clause), and non-structural (involving choices that create cohesive ties between units that have no structural bond). The relevant grammatical systems include Theme, Given and New,&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. Matthiessen. 2004. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]. Arnold&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the systems of cohesion, such as Reference, Substitution, and Ellipsis.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Hasan, R. 1976. Cohesion in English. London: Longman&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that the textual function is distinct from both the experiential and interpersonal because its object is language itself. Through the textual function, language “creates a semiotic world of its own: a parallel universe, or ‘virtual reality’ in modern terms”.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M. A. K. (2003 [2001]). Is the grammar neutral? Is the grammarian neutral? In J.J. Webster (Ed.), On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York 2003, p 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48218">In [[linguistics]], '''mutual intelligibility''' is a relationship between [[language]]s or [[dialect]]s in which speakers of different but related [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] can readily understand each other without prior familiarity or special effort. It is sometimes used as an important criterion for distinguishing languages from dialects, although [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] factors are often also used.

Intelligibility between languages can be asymmetric, with speakers of one understanding more of the other than speakers of the other understanding the first. When it is relatively symmetric, it is characterized as "mutual". It exists in differing degrees among many related or geographically proximate languages of the world, often in the context of a [[dialect continuum]].

[[Linguistic distance]] is the name for the concept of calculating a measurement for how different languages are from one another. The higher the linguistic distance, the lower the mutual intelligibility. One common metric used is the [[Levenshtein distance]].

==Intelligibility==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}

For individuals to achieve moderate proficiency or understanding in a language (called L2) other than their [[first language]] (L1) typically requires considerable time and effort through study and/or [[Practice (learning method)|practical application]]. However, many groups of languages are partly mutually intelligible, i.e. most speakers of one language find it relatively easy to achieve some degree of understanding in the related language(s). Often the languages are [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]], and they are likely to be similar to each other in [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]], [[pronunciation]], or other features.

Intelligibility among languages can vary between individuals or groups within a language population according to their knowledge of various registers and vocabulary in their own language, their exposure to additional related languages, their interest in or familiarity with other cultures, the domain of discussion, [[psychology|psycho]]-[[cognition|cognitive]] traits, the mode of language used (written vs. oral), and other factors.

==Mutually intelligible languages or varieties of one language==
There is no formal distinction between two distinct languages and two [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of a single language, but some linguists use mutual intelligibility as one of the primary factors in deciding between the two cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gröschel |first=Bernhard| authorlink=Bernhard Gröschel |year=2009 |language=German |title=Das Serbokroatische zwischen Linguistik und Politik: mit einer Bibliographie zum postjugoslavischen Sprachenstreit |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Between Linguistics and Politics: With a Bibliography of the Post-Yugoslav Language Dispute |series=Lincom Studies in Slavic Linguistics ; vol 34 |location=Munich |publisher=Lincom Europa |pages=132–136 |isbn=978-3-929075-79-3 |oclc=428012015 |lccn=2009473660 |ol=15295665W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KordiJin/&gt;

Some linguists&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. P.H. Matthews, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics'', OUP 2007, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that mutual intelligibility is, ideally at least, the primary criterion separating languages from dialects. On the other hand, speakers of closely related languages can often communicate with each other; thus there are varying degrees of mutual intelligibility, and often other criteria are also used. As an example, in the case of a linear [[dialect continuum]] that shades gradually between varieties, where speakers near the center can understand the varieties at both ends, but speakers at one end cannot understand the speakers at the other end, the entire chain is often considered a single language. If the central varieties then die out and only the varieties at both ends survive, they may then be reclassified as two languages, even though no actual language change has occurred.

In addition, political and social conventions often override considerations of mutual intelligibility. For example, the [[varieties of Chinese]] are often considered a single language even though there is usually no mutual intelligibility between geographically separated varieties. Another similar example would be [[varieties of Arabic]]. In contrast, there is often significant intelligibility between different [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], but as each of them has its own standard form, they are classified as separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | pages = 3–4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also significant intelligibility between [[Thai languages]] of different regions of Thailand.

To deal with the conflict in cases such as [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic]], Chinese and [[German dialects|German]], the term ''[[Abstand and ausbau languages#Roofing|Dachsprache]]'' (a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] "umbrella language") is sometimes seen: Chinese and German are languages in the sociolinguistic sense even though some speakers cannot understand each other without recourse to a standard or prestige form.&lt;!--"Macrolanguage" is jargon specific to ''Ethnologue''; it is not a normal linguistic term, and it is unreliable because it is inconsistently applied by the ''Ethnologue''.--&gt;

==Asymmetric intelligibility==
Asymmetric intelligibility refers to two languages that are considered partially mutually intelligible, but where one group of speakers has more difficulty understanding the other language than the other way around. There can be various reasons for this. If, for example, one language is related to another but has simplified its grammar, the speakers of the original language may understand the simplified language, but less vice versa. For example, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speakers tend to find it easier to understand [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] than vice versa as a result of Afrikaans's simplified grammar&lt;ref name="gooskens"/&gt;.

Perhaps the most common reason for apparent asymmetric intelligibility is that speakers of one variety have more exposure to the other than vice versa. For example, speakers of [[Scottish English]] have frequent exposure to standard [[American English]] through movies and TV programs, whereas speakers of American English have little exposure to Scottish English; hence, American English speakers often find it difficult to understand Scottish English or, especially, [[Scots language|Scots]] (which differs significantly from standard Scottish English), whereas Scots tend to have few problems understanding standard American English.

Northern Germanic languages spoken in Scandinavia form a [[dialect continuum]] where two furthermost dialects have almost no mutual intelligibility. As such, spoken Danish and Swedish normally have low mutual intelligibility,&lt;ref name="gooskens"/&gt; but Swedes in the [[Öresund]] region (including [[Malmö]] and [[Helsingborg]]), across a strait from the Danish capital [[Copenhagen]], understand Danish somewhat better, largely due to the proximity of the region to Danish-speaking areas (see [[North Germanic languages#Mutual intelligibility|''Mutual intelligibility in North Germanic languages'']]). While Norway was under [[Denmark–Norway|Danish rule]], the [[Bokmål]] written standard of Norwegian originates from [[Dano-Norwegian]], a [[koiné]] that evolved among the urban elite in Norwegian cities during the later years of the union. Additionally, Norwegian assimilated a considerable amount of Danish vocabulary as well as traditional Danish expressions.&lt;ref name="gooskens"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/gooskens/pdf/publ_JMMD_2007.pdf |title=The Contribution of Linguistic Factors to the Intelligibility of Closely Related Languages |first=Charlotte|last=Gooskens |journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|volume=28|issue=6|year=2007 |accessdate=2010-05-19|doi=10.2167/jmmd511.0|page=445|citeseerx=10.1.1.414.7645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, spoken mutual intelligibility is not reciprocal.&lt;ref name=gooskens/&gt;

Similarly, in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], standard German or Italian speakers may have great difficulty understanding the "dialects" from regions other than their own, but virtually all "dialect" speakers learn the standard languages in school and from the media.

** The non-standard vernacular dialects of Serbo-Croatian ([[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]], [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]] and [[Torlakian dialect|Torlakian]]) are considered by some linguists to be separate, albeit closely related languages to Serbo-Croatian (Shtokavian), rather than its dialects, as Shtokavian has its own [[Shtokavian#Classification|set of subdialects]]. Their mutual intelligibility varies greatly, both between the dialects themselves as well as with other languages. Kajkavian has higher mutual intelligibility with [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] than the national varieties of Shtokavian, while Chakavian has a low mutual intelligibility with either, in part due to large number of loanwords from [[Venetian language|Venetian]]. Torlakian (considered a subdialect of Serbian Old Shtokavian by some) has a significant level of mutual intelligibility with [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].&lt;ref name=Bul20&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7-Bees_VvAC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=%D0%97%D0%B0+%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0+%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0+%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD+%D1%80%D1%8A%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81+%D0%BE%D1%82+18+%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA,+%D0%B2:+%D0%91%D1%8A%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%82+%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BA+%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7+%D0%A5%D0%A5+%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BA&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Българският език през ХХ век|first=Василка|last=Радева|date=15 July 2018|publisher=Pensoft Publishers|via=Google Books|isbn=9789546421135}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[South Slavic languages]] in effect form a large [[dialect continuum]] of gradually mutually intelligible varieties depending on distance between the areas where they are spoken.

'''Old Hindi''' ({{lang-hi|पुरानी हिंदी|translit=Purānī Hindī}}) was the earliest stage of the [[Khariboli]] dialect of the [[Hindi language]], and so the ancestor of Modern Standard Hindi. It was spoken by the peoples of the [[Hindi belt]], especially around [[Delhi]], in roughly the 13th–15th centuries. It is attested in only a handful of literature, including some works by the poet [[Amir Khusrau]] and some verses by the Sufi saint [[Baba Farid]] in the ''[[Adi Granth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Masica|first1=Colin P.|title=The Indo-Aryan Languages|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521299442}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} The works of [[Kabir]] also may be included, as they use a Khariboli-like dialect.

The language ultimately gave way to [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].

It is not to be confused with the general context of the term "outline", which a summary or overview of a subject, presented verbally or written in prose&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]: "outline ''n.''3.a. In ''pl.'' The main features or general principles of a subject, proposal, etc. 3.b. A brief verbal or written description of something, giving a general idea of the whole but leaving details to be filled in; a draft, a summary. Also: a précis of a proposed article, novel, scenario, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, ''[[The Outline of History]]'' is not an outline of the type presented below). The outlines described in this article are lists, and come in several varieties.

A sentence outline is a tool for composing a document, such as an essay, a paper, a book, or even an encyclopedia. It is a list used to organize the facts or points to be covered, and their order of presentation, by section. Topic outlines list the subtopics of a subject, arranged in levels, and while they can be used to plan a composition, they are most often used as a summary, such as in the form of a table of contents or the topic list in a college course's syllabus.

Outlines are further differentiated by the index prefixing used, or lack thereof.  Many outlines include a numerical or alphanumerical prefix preceding each entry in the outline, to provide a specific path for each item, to aid in referring to and discussing the entries listed. An alphanumerical outline uses alternating letters and numbers to identify entries. A decimal outline uses only numbers as prefixes. An outline without prefixes is called a "bare outline".

Specialized applications of outlines also exist. A reverse outline is a list of sentences or topics that is created from an existing work, as a revision tool; it may show the gaps in the document's coverage so that they may be filled, and may help in rearranging sentences or topics to improve the structure and flow of the work. An integrated outline is a composition tool for writing scholastic works, in which the sources, and the writer's notes from the sources, are integrated into the outline for ease of reference during the writing process.

A software program designed for processing outlines is called an [[outliner]].

== Types of outlines ==

Outlines are differentiated by style, the inclusion of prefixes, and specialized purpose. There are also hand-written outlines (which are highly limited in utility), and digitized outlines, such as those contained within an [[outliner]] (which are much more useful).

=== By style ===

There are two main styles of outline: sentence outlines and topic outlines.

==== A sample topic outline application: An outline of human knowledge ====

 
[[Propædia]] is the historical attempt of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] to present a hierarchical "Outline of Knowledge" in a separate volume in the 15th edition of 1974. The ''[[Outline of Knowledge]]'' was a project by [[Mortimer Adler]]. Propædia had three levels, 10 "Parts" at the top level, 41 "Divisions" at the middle level and 167 "Sections" at the bottom level, numbered, for example, "1. Matter and Energy", "1.1 Atoms", "1.1.1. Structure and Properties of Atoms".

=== By prefixing used ===

A feature included in many outlines is prefixing. Similar to [[section numbers]], an outline prefix is a label (usually alphanumeric or numeric) placed at the beginning of an outline entry to assist in referring to it.

==== Bare outlines ====

Bare outlines include no prefixes.

==== Alphanumeric outline ====

An ''alphanumeric outline'' includes a prefix at the beginning of each topic as a reference aid. The prefix is in the form of [[Roman numerals]] for the top level, [[Letter case|upper-case]] letters (in the alphabet of the language being used) for the next level, [[Arabic numerals]] for the next level, and then lowercase letters for the next level.  For further levels, the order is started over again.  Each numeral or letter is followed by a period, and each item is capitalized, as in the following sample:

{{Quotation|
'''Thesis statement''': E-mail and [[Internet surveillance|internet monitoring]], as currently practiced, is an invasion of employees' rights in the workplace.

:I. The situation: Over 80% of today's companies monitor their employees.
::A. To prevent fraudulent activities, theft, and other workplace related violations.
::B. To more efficiently monitor employee productivity.
::C. To prevent any legal liabilities due to harassing or offensive communications.
:II. What are employees' privacy rights when it comes to electronic monitoring and surveillance in the workplace?
::A. American employees have basically no legal protection from mean and snooping bosses.
:::1. There are no federal or State laws protecting employees.
:::2. Employees may assert privacy protection for their own personal effects.
::B. Most managers believe that there is no right to privacy in the workplace.
:::1. Workplace communications should be about work; anything else is a misuse of company equipment and company time
:::2. Employers have a right to prevent misuse by monitoring employee communications
}}

Some call the Roman numerals "A-heads" (for "A-level headings"), the upper-case letters, "B-heads", and so on. Some writers also prefer to insert a blank line between the A-heads and B-heads, while often keeping the B-heads and C-heads together.

If more levels of outline are needed, lower-case Roman numerals and numbers and lower-case letters, sometimes with single and double parenthesis can be used, although the exact order is not well defined, and usage varies widely.

The scheme recommended by the ''[[MLA Handbook]]'',&lt;ref name="MLA 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers |year=2009 |publisher=Modern Language Association of America |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1-60329-024-1 |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |edition=Seventh |page=45 |chapter=1.8.3: Final Outline }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Purdue Online Writing Lab]]'',&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/544/03/ |title=Developing an Outline |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=[[Purdue Online Writing Lab]] |year=2011 |publisher=[[Purdue University]] |location= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, uses the usual five levels, as described above, then repeats the Arabic numerals and lower-case letter surrounded by parentheses (round brackets)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; I. A. 1. a. i. (1) (a)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and does not specify any lower levels,&lt;ref name="MLA 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Purdue" /&gt; though "(i)" is usually next.  In common practice, lower levels yet are usually Arabic numerals and lowercase letters again, and sometimes lower-case Roman again, with single parentheses &amp;ndash; 1) a) i)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; but usage varies. MLA style is sometimes incorrectly referred to as APA style,&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite web |url= http://examples.yourdictionary.com/apa-outline-format-examples.html |title=APA Outline Format Examples |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |work=YourDictionary.com |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''[[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association|APA Publication Manual]]'' does not address outline formatting at all.

A very different style recommended by ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'',&lt;ref name="Chicago 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago 2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chicago Manual of Style |author=&lt;!--Staff writers; no by-line.--&gt; |edition=15th |pages=270&amp;ndash;275 |chapter=Lists and Outline Style (6.124&amp;ndash;130) |publisher=U. of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |year=2003 |isbn=0-226-10403-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the practice of the [[United States Congress]] in drafting legislation, suggests the following sequence, from the top to the seventh level (the only ones specified):  I. A. 1. ''a'') (1) (''a'') ''i'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; capital Roman numerals with a period, capital letters with a period, Arabic numerals with a period, italic lowercase letters with a single parenthesis, Arabic numerals with a double parenthesis, italic lowercase letters with a double parenthesis, and italic lowercase Roman numerals with a single parentheses, though the italics are not required).  Because of its use in the [[United States Code|US Code]] and other US law books, Many American [[lawyers]] consequently use this outline format.

Another alternative scheme repeats all five levels with a single parenthesis for the second five &amp;ndash; I) A) 1) a) i)&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and then again with a double parenthesis for the third five&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; (I) (A) (1) (a) (i).{{citation needed|date=October 2011|reason=Not used in any source cited so far.}}

Many oft-cited style guides besides the ''APA Publication Manual'', including the ''[[Associated Press Stylebook|AP Stylebook]]'', the ''[[New York Times Manual|NYT Manual]]'', [[Fowler's Modern English Usage|Fowler]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' Style Guide, and [[The Elements of Style|Strunk &amp; White]], are curiously silent on the topic.

One side effect of the use of both Roman numerals and uppercase letters in all of these styles of outlining is that in most alphabets, "I." may be an item at both the top (A-head) and second (B-head) levels. This is usually not problematic because lower level items are usually referred to hierarchically. For example, the third sub-sub-item of the fourth sub-item of the second item is item II. D. 3.  So, the ninth sub-item (letter-I) of the first item (Roman-I) is item I. I., and only the top level one is item I.

==== Decimal outline ====

The ''decimal outline'' format has the advantage of showing how every item at every level relates to the whole, as shown in the following sample outline:

{{Quotation|
'''Thesis statement''': ---

:1.0 Introduction
::1.1 Brief history of Liz Claiborne
::1.2 Corporate environment
:2.0 Career opportunities
::2.1 Operations management
:::2.1.1 Traffic
:::2.1.2 International trade and corporate customs
:::2.1.3 Distribution
::2.2 Product development
}}

=== By specialized purpose ===

Special types of outlines include reverse outlines and integrated outlines.

==== Reverse outline ====

A ''reverse outline'' is an outline made from an existing work. Reverse outlining is like reverse engineering a document. The points or topics are extracted from the work, and are arranged in their order of presentation, by section, in the outline. Once completed, the outline can be filled in and rearranged as a plan for a new improved version of the document.

==== Integrated outline ====

An ''integrated outline'' is a helpful step in the process of organizing and writing a scholarly paper ([[literature review]], [[research]] paper, [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]]). When completed the integrated outline contains the relevant scholarly sources (author's last name, publication year, page number if quote) for each section in the outline. An integrated outline is generally prepared after the scholar has collected, read and mastered the literature that will be used in the research paper. Shields and Rangarajan (2013) recommend that new scholars develop a system to do this. Part of the system should contain a systematic way to take notes on the scholarly sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields|Shields, Patricia]] and Rangarjan, N. 2013. ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. See Chapter 8 for a detailed discussion of an integrated outline with examples.&lt;/ref&gt; These notes can then be tied to the paper through the integrated outline. This way the scholar reviews all of the literature before the writing begins.

An integrated outline can be a helpful tool for people with [[writer's block]] because the content of the paper is organized and identified prior to writing. The structure and content is combined and the author can write a small section at a time. The process is less overwhelming because it can be separated into manageable chunks. The first draft can be written using smaller blocks of time.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia. 2014. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263861162_Tools_for_Writing_Excellent_Papers_2014_ASPA_Student_Summit Tools for Excellent Papers]: 2014 ASPA Student Summit. Presentation at the [[American Society for Public Administration]] annual conference, Washington DC March 15, This powerpoint describes a system for writing paper that contains an integrated outline. Slides 37 - 46 examine the components of an integrated outline with an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand-written vs computerized ===

For a comparison, see [[#Outliners|Outliners]], below.

== Applications ==

Outlines are used for composition, summarization, and as a development and storage medium.

=== Composition ===

''Merriam-Webster's manual for writers and editors'' (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;290) recommends that the section headings of an article should when read in isolation, combine to form an outline of the article content. Garson (2002) distinguishes a 'standard outline', presented as a regular [[table of contents]] from a refined tree-like 'hierarchical outline', stating that "such an outline might be appropriate, for instance, when the purpose is taxonomic (placing observed phenomena into an exhaustive set of categories). ... hierarchical outlines are rare in quantitative writing, and the researcher is well advised to stick to the standard outline unless there are compelling reasons not to."&lt;ref&gt;G. David Garson, ''Guide to writing empirical papers, theses, and dissertations''. CRC Press, 2002, {{ISBN|978-0-8247-0605-0}}, chapter "Typical Outlines", pp. 23-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers of [[fiction]] and [[creative nonfiction]], such as Jon Franklin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Writing for Story|date = 1994|last = Franklin|first = Jonathan|publisher = Plume|isbn = 9780452272958}}&lt;/ref&gt; may use outlines to establish plot sequence, character development and dramatic flow of a story, sometimes in conjunction with [[free writing]].

Preparation of an outline is an intermediate step in the process of writing a scholarly [[research]] paper, [[literature review]], [[thesis]] or [[dissertation]]. A special kind of outline (integrated outline) incorporates scholarly sources into the outline before the writing begins.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia M. 2004.[http://store.newforums.com/STEP-by-STEP-Building-a-Research-Paper-SWB01.htm ''Step by Step: Building a Research Paper.''] Stillwater OK: New Forums Press. {{ISBN|1-58107-117-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summarization ===

In addition to being used as a composition tool during the drafting process, outlines can also be used as a publishing format. Outlines can presented as work's table of contents, but they can also be used as the body of a work.  The ''[[Outline of Knowledge]]'' from the 15th edition of the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' is an example of this. Wikipedia includes outlines that summarize subjects (for example, see [[Outline of chess]], [[Outline of Mars]], and [[Outline of knowledge]]).

Professors often hand out to their students at the beginning of a term, a summary of the subjects to be covered throughout the course in the form of a topic outline. It may also be included as part of a larger course synopsis.

Outlines are also used to summarize talking points for a speech or lecture.

=== Personal information management ===

Outlines, especially those used within an [[outliner]], can be used for planning, scheduling, and recording.

== Outliners ==
{{Main|Outliner}}

An [[outliner]] (or "outline processor") is a specialized type of [[word processor]] used to view, create, build, modify, and maintain outlines. It is a computer program, or part of one, used for displaying, organizing, and editing [[hierarchy|hierarchically]] arranged text in an outline's [[tree structure]]. Textual information is contained in discrete sections called "nodes", which are arranged according to their topic-subtopic (parent-child) relationships, sort of like the members of a [[family tree]]. When loaded into an outliner, an outline may be [[text folding|collapsed or expanded]] to display as few or as many levels as desired.

Outliners are used for storing and retrieving textual information, with terms, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs attached to a tree.  So rather than being arranged by document, information is arranged by topic or content. An outline in an outliner may contain as many topics as desired.  This eliminates the need to have separate documents, as outlines easily include other outlines just by adding to the tree.

The main difference between a hand-written outline and a digital one, is that the former is usually limited to a summary or blueprint of a planned document, while the latter may easily include all of the content of the entire document and many more.  In other words, as a hand-written work an outline is a writing tool, but on a computer, it is a general purpose format supported by a robust development and display medium capable of handling knowledge from its creation to its end use.

Outliners may be used in [[content creation]] instead of general word processors for capturing, organizing, editing, and displaying knowledge or general textual information. Outliners are ideal for managing lists, organizing facts and ideas, and for [[computer programming|writing computer programs]].  They are also used for goal and task management (including [[personal information management]] and [[project management]]), and for writing books and movie scripts.

The graphical counterpart to outliners are [[mind mapper]]s.

'''Production support''' is the practices and disciplines of supporting the [[Information technology|IT]] systems/applications which are currently being used by the [[User_(computing)#End_user|end user]]s. A production support person/team is responsible for receiving incidents and requests from [[end-user]]s, analyzing these and either responding to the end user with a solution or escalating it to the other IT teams.  These teams may include [[Software developer|developer]]s, [[system engineer]]s and [[database administrator]]s.

==The importance of production support==
In order to understand the importance of production support, one needs to take a few factors into account.
* Studies have found that the maintenance cost of [[software]] is more than 90% of the total cost.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* We also know that software spends much more time in production than development because it needs to verify the properties{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}.
* The maintenance cost of the hardware.

From the factors listed above, one can see that the way in which production support is managed is extremely crucial.

== Production Support Steps ==
The major steps for Production Support are as below. These Production Support steps are in context of the [[Batch processing]].

=== Recording Production Error ===
Usually a batch job or group of related batch jobs (schedule/stream) runs to accomplish one or more business functions. These batch jobs run unattended and normally complete without any errors or issues. However, sometimes the batch job can have a break/interruption/abend/abort. There could be several reasons why a job could abend.

When a job abends, it can send out an automated alert notification via e-mail, page, text. Also, data center or operations team is also actively monitoring the jobs. They also send alert notification using e-mail, page, text or they can call the on call person responsible for the recovery of the abended job.

The on call person acknowledges the e-mail, page, text or phone call for the abended job. The on call person also records the abended job details in a production issue tracking system. Sometimes, the abended job automatically records the job abend details along with job standard list (job log) in a production issue tracking system. The abended job details (job standard list, error log files, etc.) are available in the production job scheduler tool. The Production issue tracking tool creates a request number and this request number is given to the support team. This request number is used to track the progress of the production support issue. The request is assigned to on call support team person.

=== Notification of Production Error ===
For critical Production Errors (e.g. Production job is in critical path and is likely to delay the batch completion [[Service-level_agreement|SLAs]] and if the Production error is impacting business data), an e-mail is sent to entire organization or impacted teams so that they are aware of the issue. They are also provided with the estimated time for Production error recovery.

=== Investigation or Analysis of Production Error ===
The Production support team on call person collects all the necessary information about the Production error. This information is then recorded in the Production error tracking tool using the correct support request number previously assigned. All the details such as data, environment, process, program logic that failed is used in the investigation. Production batch job, program used or any tool/utility used is reviewed for any possible errors.

=== Resolution of Production Error ===
If similar Production error occurred in the past then the issue resolution steps are retrieved from the support knowledge base and error is resolved using those steps. If it is a new Production error then new Production error resolution steps are created and Production error is resolved. The new Production error resolution steps are recorded in the knowledge base for the future usage. For major Production errors (critical infrastructure or application failures), a phone conference call is initiated and all required support persons/teams join the call and they all work together to resolve the error. This is also called as an Incident Management. If a problem occurs repeatedly then it is recorded and tracked using appropriate tools and processes until it is resolved permanently. This is also called as Problem Management. The issue is closed only after the customer or end user agrees that the problem is resolved.

=== Production job/program code correction ===
If the Production error occurred due to programming errors then a request is created for the Development team to correct programming errors. Problem is identified, defined and root cause analysis is performed. The programming error is fixed using normal SDLC process - analysis/design/programming/QA/testing/release. The new version of the Production job/program is deployed and verified/validated.

=== Production Process correction ===
If the Production error occurred due to job/schedule dependency issues or sequence issues then further analysis is done to find the correct sequence/dependencies. The new sequence/dependencies are verified and validated in [[test environment]] before Production deployment.

=== Infrastructure Issue correction ===
If the Production error occurred due to infrastructure issues then the specific infrastructure team is notified. The infrastructure team then implements permanent fix for the issue and monitors the infrastructure to avoid same error again.

== Production Support Billing ==
If the Production error occurred due to unexpected consequences of infrastructure changes then most often the infrastructure team is not able to bill the time spent in resolving of the issue at the full rate. In some cases hours are completely disqualified from being billed.

== Production Support - Follow up and Reporting ==
The Production error tracking system is used to review all issues periodically (daily, weekly and monthly) and reports are generated to monitor resolved issues, repeating issues, pending issues. Reports are also generated for the IT/IS management for improvement and management of Production jobs.

      <comment>Removed external link to an archive of "Recent Proxy Statements" published by the SEC. This link takes the user to an archive of 2009 proxy statements and surfing the URL screenshots to more recent archives only go through 2012. These screenshot archives are therefore irrelevant and certainly not "recent." Perhaps a new web URL now houses recent proxy statements.</comment>

A '''proxy statement''' is a statement required of a firm when soliciting shareholder votes. This statement is filed in advance of the annual meeting. The firm needs to file a proxy statement, otherwise known as a Form DEF 14A (Definitive Proxy Statement), with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].  This statement is useful in assessing how management is paid and potential conflict-of-interest issues with auditors.  The statement includes:
* Voting procedure and information.
* Background information about the company's nominated directors including relevant history in the company or industry, positions on other corporate boards, and potential conflicts in interest.
* Board compensation.
* Executive compensation, including salary, bonus, non-equity compensation, stock awards, options, and [[deferred compensation]]. Also, information is included about perks such as personal use of company aircraft, travel, and tax gross-ups. Many companies will also include pre-determined payout packages for if an executive leaves the company.
* Who is on the audit committee, as well as a breakdown of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor.

SEC proxy rules: The term "proxy statement" means the statement required by Section 240.14a-3(a) whether or not contained in a single document.

In many cases, shareholder votes—particularly institutional shareholder votes—are determined by [[proxy firm]]s which advise the shareholders...

Traditionally, [[broker-dealer]]s have been permitted to vote for "routine" proposals on behalf of their shareholders if the shareholders do not return the proxy statement. This has been controversial, and in 2006 the NYSE Proxy Working Group recommended that the rules be modified so that uncontested director elections were not considered routine.&lt;ref&gt;NYSE Working Group. (June 5, 2006). [https://www.nyse.com/pdfs/REVISED_NYSE_Report_6_5_06.pdf REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PROXY WORKING GROUP TO THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE].&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC approved the rule on July 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyse/2009/34-60215.pdf Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, as modified by Amendment No. 4, to Amend NYSE Rule 452 and Corresponding Listed Company Manual Section 402.08 to Eliminate Broker Discretionary Voting for the Election of Directors, Except for Companies Registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and to Codify Two Previously Published Interpretations that Do Not Permit Broker Discretionary Voting for Material Amendments to Investment Advisory Contracts with an Investment Company]. Release No. 34-60215; File No. SR-NYSE-2006-92. Discussed by the NY Times Dealbook at: [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/sec-split-on-broker-voting-change/ Curbs on Broker Voting Are Approved].&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the SEC announced that it was seeking public comment on the efficiency of the proxy system.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-122.htm SEC Votes to Seek Public Comment on U.S. Proxy System].&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some controversy over "proxy access" which is a method to allow shareholders to nominate candidates which appear on the proxy statement. Currently, only the nominating board can place candidates on the proxy statement. The United States [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] specifically allowed the SEC to rule on this issue. In 2010, the SEC passed a rule which allowed certain shareholders to place candidates on the proxy statement;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-155.htm SEC Adopts New Measures to Facilitate Director Nominations by Shareholders].&lt;/ref&gt; however, the rule was struck down by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120403125211/http://corpgov.proxyexchange.org/2011/07/what-would-proxy-access-look-like-if-done-right/ What Would Proxy Access Look Like if Done Right?].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1024">'''Reallocation''' is a term in the [[media industry]] used to describe the practice of relocating an unsuccessful series that was originally developed for a [[broadcast network]] onto a [[cable network]] in hopes of gaining the attention and interest of a [[niche audience]] as well as  growing a larger audience.

Reasons for reallocation are not always due to [[Cancellation (television)|cancellation]]. Reallocation is  also used to regain expenses lost due to production fees on under performing content. In some cases reallocation is used in order to promote an unsuccessful series.

Although not a common practice,

These theories conceive of second-language acquisition as being learned in the same way as any other skill, such as learning to drive a car or play the piano. That is, they see [[practice (learning method)|practice]] as the key ingredient of language acquisition. The most well-known of these theories is based on [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]]'s [[adaptive control of thought]] model.&lt;ref name="VanPatten2010skill"&gt;{{Harvnb|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=149–150}}, "Skill/s".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptive control of thought ==
{{Main|ACT-R}}
The adaptive control of thought model assumes a distinction between [[declarative knowledge]], knowledge that is conscious and consists of facts,&lt;ref name="Schmidt2010declarative"&gt;{{Harvnb|Richards|Schmidt|2009}}, "Declarative knowledge".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[procedural knowledge]], knowledge of how an activity is done.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2010procedural"&gt;{{Harvnb|Richards|Schmidt|2009}}, "Procedural knowledge".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt2010ACT"&gt;{{Harvnb|Richards|Schmidt|2009}}, "Adaptive control of thought".&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, skill acquisition is seen as a progression from declarative to procedural knowledge.&lt;ref name="Schmidt2010ACT" /&gt; Adaptive control of thought is a general model of cognition, and second-language acquisition is just one application of a wide area of research in cognitive psychology.&lt;ref name="VanPatten2010ACT"&gt;{{Harvnb|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=62}}, "Adaptive Control of Thought model".&lt;/ref&gt; Second-language acquisition is seen as a progression through three stages, declarative, procedural, and autonomous.&lt;ref name="VanPatten2010ACT" /&gt;

'''Social Media Language Learning''' ('''SMLL''') links interactive [[social media]] channels to language learning. This enables students to develop [[communication]] and [[language]] skills. Social media consist of interactive forms of media that allow users to interact with and publish to each other, generally by means of the internet. Daily observations and recent scholarly traditions suggest that a certain amount of learning takes place beyond the confines of the individual mind.&lt;ref name=Salomon&gt;{{cite book|last=Salomon|first=Gavriel|title=Individual and social aspects of learning:Review of research in education|year=1998|publisher=American Educational Research Association|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=1–24|jstor=10.2307/1167286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that language acquisition and learning is socially constructed and interactive in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McClanahan|first1=Lorna|title=Training Using Technology in the Adult ESL Classroom|journal=Journal of Adult Education|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=22–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reinhardt|first1=Jonathon|last2=Zander|first2=Victoria|title=Social Networking in an Intensive English Program Classroom: A Language Socialization Perspective|journal=CALICO Journal|date=2011|volume=28|issue=2|pages=326–344|jstor=calicojournal.28.2.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of language socialization, language learning is interwoven with cultural interaction and "mediated by linguistic and other symbolic activity".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; From this perspective, the use of technologies that facilitate communication and connection, particularly social media applications and programs, makes a lot of sense. Language learners are able to enhance their language skills due to the different avenues in which new social media have created. Social media provides the learner with the possibility of participating in actual, real-time, relevant [[conversation]]s taking place online, and practicing the target language with or without the help of an experienced teacher by his or her side.

==Background==
The Social Media Language Learning (SMLL) method was originally created by a Barcelona, Spain, based company called Idiomplus. It consists of applying interactive [[social media]] channels to [[language learning]], which will in turn enable the student to develop communication skills while using these social networks.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The method provides the learner with the possibility of participating in actual, real-time, relevant conversations taking place online, and practicing the target language with the help of an experienced teacher by his or her side.

The Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) method provided the basis for the development of the SMLL method, given both emphasise the importance of teaching within a great scope of contexts with the objective of developing a functional knowledge of the language. Perfect grammar and pronunciation are not essential to the process, rather setting the focus on the communicative competence of the student and the ability to understand and make him/herself understood.

The Social Media Language Learning is based upon three tenets:

#Importance of live and actual communication in the target language through interaction and updated content comprehension and production based on Social Media channels.
#Students' personal experience and interests play a defining role in learning, enabling relevant usage of language during and between classes with active participation of teacher and virtual community.
#Fostering of social media communication skills at the same time as the language learning is taking place, in terms of editing, strategy, conceptualization, business insight, etc.

The student is therefore invited to emerge as much as possible in activities which require the use of language, given that all of them will result in learning. In-class and out-of-class communication are equally important. It combines the benefits of another method, known as [[blended learning]], which allows the student to learn autonomously, whenever and wherever he wants, with all the required material available online, and at the same time have the support of an experienced teacher who eases the process and provides a professional  and live explanation of the subjects at hand.

On-site classes with the teacher are intertwined with the ongoing online conversations with other relevant people. Learning is considered to be a constant, ever-flowing, indivisible part of everyday life, thus making the target language a part of it.

== Classroom ==

A range of social media can be used to facilitate language learning, including blogs, [[online role-playing game]]s, [[fan fiction]] writing, and so on.

===Blogs===
Web logs or [[blogs]] are one of many forms of social media. A blog is an online platform that people can use to express issues related to their lives and different viewpoints they may have.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Liam|author2=Triona Hourigan |title=Blogs for specific purposes:expressivist or socio-cognitivist|journal=ReCall|year=2008|volume=20|issue=1|pages=82–97|doi=10.1017/s0958344008000719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blogs address a wide range of topics and are used in many different ways for diverse purposes. As blogging architecture became more user-friendly the popularity of blogs increased.&lt;ref name="carney"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carney|first=Nathaniel|title=Language study through blog exchanges|journal=Education and Mobile Assisted Learning|pages=109–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blogs can be used for language learning. The ability to comment on other peoples blogs as well as have people post comments on your own is key to blogging.&lt;ref name="carney" /&gt; The development of a language is not normally the primary goal of the person who is participating in a blog but a blog is a place that can provide a foundation for reflecting on the language that is being written within it.&lt;ref name="carney" /&gt; Blogs can increase a users language competence as well "blogs are egalitarian learning and teaching tools par excellence".&lt;ref name="dieu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dieu|first=Barbara|title=Blogs for language learning|journal=Essential Teacher|year=2004|volume=1|issue=4|pages=26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When writing in a blog it is done to express feelings and to be creative&lt;ref name="murray" /&gt; but as a result language learning can be achieved.

Steven Thorne&lt;ref name="thorne"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorne|first=Steven|title='Community', semiotic flows, and mediated contribution to activity|journal=Lang. Teach.|year=2009|volume=42|issue=1|pages=81–94|doi=10.1017/s0261444808005429|url=http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=wll_fac}}&lt;/ref&gt; has reported a number of trends with respect to blogging and language learning. Blogs used within language classrooms he has observed produce encouraging written production along with increased scores on standardized [[educational assessment|assessment]] measures showing significant language development. The use of blogs also enable teachers and instructors to assess written language learning in a relatively accessible way. Blogs, it is argued, allow students to create fluent sets of sentences from sentences that previously would stand alone. It also allows students to write in paragraphs and to use different tenses with more confidence to discuss topics within their blogs.&lt;ref name="thorne" /&gt;

Hui-Ju Wu and Pai-Lu Wu&lt;ref name="Wu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Hui-Ju|author2=Pai-Lu Wu |title=Learners' perceptions on the use of blogs for efl earning|journal=US-China Education Review A3|year=2011|pages=323–330|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED524902}}&lt;/ref&gt; finds trends with blogging and language learning. Blogs help with language learning. Blogs help to develop vocabulary, increase reading speed, develop proper use of grammar and enhanced reading comprehension. Blogs produced better sentence fluency, a higher vocabulary, better sentence fluency and an awareness of looking for grammar mistakes in their writing. Blogs can give the confidence to write more sentences and to use different and more tenses.&lt;ref name="Wu" /&gt;

==Outside the classroom==
A growing body of research is documenting the ways in which primarily young people are learning languages via their social media, on their own, outside of formal language learning classes or programs. Social media studied include: online role-playing games, fan fiction writing, instant messaging, fan websites, virtual worlds, chat, and the like.

===Online gaming===
Many [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] (massively multiplayer online) games cross national and linguistic boundaries. They often have built-in chat functions and enable participants to chat with players from all over the world who speak various languages. This can provide players with the opportunity to learn a new language—at least at a basic level—so they can participate more fully in the game with the other players.&lt;ref name="Thorne and Black"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Torne|first=Steven|author2=Rebecca Black |title=. Language and literacy development in computer-mediated contexts and communities|journal=Annual Review of Applied Linguistics|year=2007|volume=27|pages=1–28|doi=10.1017/s0267190508070074}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social interaction these players engage in while playing the game helps with their understanding of the grammar constructions and conversational ways of the language they are using. In short, gamers may well be using a language they are learning much sooner than they otherwise might, given the highly contetxualised nature of the talk typically found within game-play situations and the text-based medium of interaction. Without this social interaction, many students may be less willing to practice their new skills which would enhance their abilities in the language they are learning.&lt;ref name="Rankin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rankin|first=Yolanda|author2=Rachel Gold |author3=Bruce Gooch |title=Evaluating Interactive Gaming as a Language Learning Tool|journal=Proceedings of EuroGraphics|year=2006|volume=25|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rankin, Morrison, Mckenzie, McNeal, Gooch and Shute found&lt;ref name="Rankin morrison"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rankin|first=Yolanda|author2=Deidra Morrison |author3=Mckenzie McNeal |author4=Bruce Gooch |author5=Marcus W. Shute |title=Time will tell: In-game social interactions that facilitate second language acquisition|journal=Proceedings of the 4th international conference on foundations of digital games|year=2009|pages=161–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  found that [[English as a foreign or second language|English as a second Language]] (ESL) students were able to acquire more language skills through the social communication that they had with the native speakers of English.

Learning language from [[video game]]s, it is argued, is a contextual process. Gamers playing a game that has text and audio in a language other than their own (e.g., an English-speaking player playing a Japanese game) can draw on the context of the game to help them understand what is being said or written within the game. Many video games use repetition in their commands and this enables the player to recognize these words and come to understand what they mean and represent over time.&lt;ref name=dehaan&gt;{{cite journal|last=deHaan|first=Jonathan William|title=Acquisition of japanese as a foreign language through a baseball video game|journal=Foreign Language Annals|year=2005|volume=38|issue=2|pages=278–282|doi=10.1111/j.1944-9720.2005.tb02492.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games transform the learning process from a passive task to one in which individuals engage actively in the experience of learning by focussing first on meaning. Computer games, researchers' argue, supply authentic environments for language learning, complete with ample opportunities for students to develop and test their emerging target language knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rankin" /&gt;

It is important to note that not all people who play these MMOs or video games necessarily start out wanting to learn a new language. Individuals playing MMOs typically want to be able to maintain social relationships with people who speak another language.&lt;ref name="Thorne 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorne|first=Steven|title=Transcultural communication in open Internet environments and massively multiplayer online games|journal=Mediating Discourse|year=2008|pages=305–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social networking===
In Wan Shun Eva Lam's research, she studies how forms of [[social networking]] in electronic media have provided alternative contexts of language development for young immigrants in the US. As a result, the two students' experiences with English in an [[Internet]] chat room can be seen as a process of language [[socialization]] through which they acquired a particular linguistic variety of English to construct ethnic identifications with other young people of Chinese descent around the world.&lt;ref name="Lam"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lam|first=Wan Shun Eva|title=Second language socialization in a bilingual chat room: global and local considerations|year=2004|volume=8|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lam explains that by studying closely how people navigate across contexts of socialization in the locality of the nation-state and the [[virtual reality|virtual]] environments of the Internet, we may discover how practices of English in the global sphere articulate with local practices of English in constituting the identities and life trajectories of people.&lt;ref name="Lam" /&gt; Through such studies, the different kinds of constraints as well as opportunities are made evident through what the internet offers language learners in various forms.&lt;ref name="Lam" /&gt;

Online interests groups influence language learning. According to Thorne, Black and Sykes's research,&lt;ref name="Thorne black"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorne|first=Steven|author2=Rebecca Black |author3=Julia Sykes |title=Second language use, socialization, and learning in internet interest communities and online gaming|journal=[[The Modern Language Journal]]|year=2009|volume=93|pages=802–822|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.2009.00974.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; participating in Internet interest communities has the potential to propel language learners beyond the confines of the institutional identity. Participation in these semiotically mediated communities may help to strengthen the ecological linkages between forms of language use and identity dispositions.&lt;ref name="Thorne black" /&gt;

A number of social networking sites help individuals engage in language learning and interest. Facebook, for example, allows language barriers to be broken down.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Livemocha is a social networking site in which allows members to communicate and learn language skills. According to the site, it has approximately 12 million registered members from 196 countries around the globe (although this includes members who have signed up for 1 day and never returned). Over 400,000 users visit the site daily.&lt;ref name=livemocha&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfram|first=Alpha|title=Livemocha Statistics|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=livemocha.com|accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social media and language teachers' development==

The use of social media tools in language education is important because it creates a community for language teachers. The difference between social media as professional development tools and other professional development tools is that social media gives the teachers a community to participate with. The US Department of Education stresses that teachers should not only be connected to resources but they should have communities of practice that provide career-long personal learning opportunities for educators within and across schools, pre-service preparation and in-service education institutions, and professional organizations (Office of Educational Technology, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/technology/netp-2010/executive-summary|title=National Education Technology Plan - Office of Educational Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities of practice are "groups of people informally bound together by shared expertise and passion for a joint enterprise" (Wenger &amp; Snyder, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;139).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Wenger |last2=Snyder|year=2000|url=https://hbr.org/2000/01/communities-of-practice-the-organizational-frontier|title=Communities of Practice: The Organizational Frontier|magazine=Harvard Business Review|volume=78|pp=139–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social media tools help the language teachers to stay connected with their peers around the world and updated about their fields. Moreover, these online buttons give the language teachers the chance to help others in their fields, find solutions to their problems and improve their teaching language careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alhamami, M.|year=2013|title=Social media for language teachers' development|journal=Arab World English Journal|volume=4|issue=3|pp=183–192|url=http://www.awej.org/images/AllIssues/Volume4/Volume4Number3Sept2013/15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8259">A '''Special Weather Statement''' (Codename SPS with [[FEMA]] and [[National Weather Service]]) is a form of weather advisory. Special Weather Statements are issued by the [[National Weather Service]] of the United States (the NWS) and the [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] (the MSC). There are no set criteria for special weather statements in either country.

==United States==

A Special Weather Statement may be issued by the NWS for hazards that have not yet reached warning or advisory status or that do not have a specific code of their own, such as widespread [[funnel cloud]]s. They are also occasionally used to clear counties from severe weather [[tornado watch|watches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lmk/product_guide/products/severe/sps.php Special Weather Statement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of special weather statement is a [[significant weather alert]]. Occasionally special weather statements appear as [[heat advisory|heat advisories]]. An EAS activation can and may be requested on very rare occasions.

==United States: Other Uses==

Special Weather Statements may also be issued for possible [[fire weather]] conditions, such as an enhanced risk. They even can be issued for rain/snow that may hit Advisory criteria such as snow being one inch that isn't going to likely pose a threat. Sometimes Special Weather Statements may be issued to update on current weather conditions, but that is sometimes issued by a [[Short Term Forecast]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1963">A '''termbase''', or '''term base''' (a contraction of [[terminology]] and [[database]]), is a database consisting of concept-oriented terminological entries (or ‘concepts’) and related information, usually in multilingual format. Entries may include any of the following additional information:
* a definition; 
* source or context of the term; 
* subject area, domain, or industry; 
* grammatical information (verb, noun, etc.); 
* notes; 
* [[usage label]] (figurative, American English, formal, etc.); 
* author (‘created by’), 
* creation/modification date (‘created/modified at’);
* verification status (‘verified’ or ‘approved’ terms), and
* an ID. 

A termbase allows for the systematic management of approved or verified terms and is a powerful tool for promoting consistency in terminology.

'''''The Inner World of Aphasia''''' is a 1968 [[Medical training in the US|medical training]] film by co-directors Edward Feil and Naomi Feil of Edward Feil Productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/2015-additions-to-the-national-film-registry/14/|title=2015 additions to the National Film Registry|date=2016-09-05|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It portrays patients suffering from [[aphasia]] and follows their experiences through their recoveries. Notable for its innovative artistic direction and empathetic approach to patients with aphasia, the film was added to the [[National Film Registry]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-15-216/2015-national-film-registry-ghostbusters-gets-the-call/2015-12-16/|title=2015 National Film Registry: "Ghostbusters" Gets the Call|work=The Library of Congress|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film follows Marge Nelson (portrayed by Naomi Feil), a nurse who treats patients suffering from aphasia. Marge is overworked and unsympathetic towards her patients, experiencing frustration at their behavior and apparent inability to communicate.

Upon having an accident and suffering brain damage, Marge herself experiences aphasia and undergoes treatment at the same hospital where she previously worked. While struggling to deal with the emotions around her trauma and new issues with processing information and communicating, Marge also discovers a startling lack of empathy from hospital staff and therapists treating her.

Marge finds a new friend in a second patient who is suffering from aphasia. The film shows us that, like Marge, this second patient has also experienced a lack of empathy from others, except in his case it is his family members who are unable to understand his illness.

Through this new friendship and her own determination, Marge changes the emotional direction of her life and takes the first steps towards her recovery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1968|title=CINE/68|jstor=20686999|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|volume=20| issue =  3|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diller|first=Leonard|date=January 1969|title=The Treatment of Aphasia: A Film|url=http://access.portico.org/stable?au=phzjr78wh|journal=PsycCRITIQUES|publisher=American Psychological Association|volume=14|pages=43–44|via=Portico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''The Inner World of Aphasia'' was praised by contemporary sources for its attention to [[patient experience]], particularly for drawing attention to the ways in which patients treated for aphasia in the 1960s were dehumanized by hospital staff and family members.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Compared to other media portrayals of aphasia the time, ''The Inner World of'' ''Aphasia'' was unique for its focus on portraying "the complex subjective feel of what it is like to be an aphasic."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Its use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], optical distortions, and audio editing techniques were noted by medical professionals as accurately conveying the experience of a person suffering from aphasia (such as [[hemiplegia]] and [[hemianopsia]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Awards and Recognition ==
In 1968, ''The Inner World of Aphasia'' received the Golden Eagle from The Council on International Non-Theatrical Events (CINE), the organization's highest honor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1969, ''[[American Journal of Nursing|The American Journal of Nursing]]'' included ''The Inner World of Aphasia'' on its list of films screened by the [[American Nurses Association]] / National League of Nurses Film Committee and recommended for screening to nurses and nursing students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 1969|title=Films Screened|jstor=3453849|journal=The American Journal of Nursing|volume=69| issue =  4|pages=854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''The Inner World of Aphasia'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]], a selection of films noted as worthy of preservation by the United States National Film Preservation Board.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''threshold hypothesis''' is a hypothesis concerning [[second language acquisition]] set forth in a study by Cummins (1976&lt;ref&gt;Cummins J. (1976). The influence of bilingualism on cognitive growth: a synthesis of research findings and explanatory hypotheses. Work. Pap. Biling. 9, 1–43 : &lt;/ref&gt;) that stated that a minimum threshold in [[language proficiency]] must be passed before a second-language speaker can reap any benefits from language. It also states that, in order to gain proficiency in a second language, the learner must also have passed a certain and [[age appropriate]] level of competence in his or her first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bilingual Language Acquisition |author=Charlotte Franson |date=2 May 2009 |work=National Association for Language Development in the Curriculum (NALDIC): ITTSEAL website |publisher=National Association for Language Development in the Curriculum |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Truth in Translation''''' is a stage play conceived and directed by [[Michael Lessac]], with music by [[Hugh Masekela]]. It tells the story of the [[interpreter]]s at [[South Africa]]'s [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]. 

The play was written in a collaboration between the interpreters who worked at the TRC, writer Paavo Tom Tammi and the company of South African actors. It premiered in [[Rwanda]], has toured [[South Africa]] and is touring to international conflict zones such as [[Northern Ireland]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[the Balkans]], [[Jerusalem]]/[[Ramallah]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Peru]], and [[Indonesia]]/[[Timor]] to tell the story of the South African experience. The project includes workshops with audiences, exhibitions ([[The Forgiveness Project]] and Jillian Edelstein's ''Truth and Lies'') and filming of the interaction between audiences and the company, and attempts to provoke a global dialogue around notions of healing and reconciliation.

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
'''Twilight language''' is a rendering of the Sanskrit term ''{{IAST|sāṃdhyābhāṣā}}'' (written also ''{{IAST|sāndhyābhāṣā}}'', ''{{IAST|sāṃdhyabhāṣā}}'', ''{{IAST|sāndhyabhāṣā}}''; {{bo|w=dgongs-pa'i skad}}, [[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription|THL]] ''gongpé ké'') or of their modern Indic equivalents (especially in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Hindi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Braj Bhasha]] and [[Khariboli dialect|Khariboli]]).

As popularized by Roderick Bucknell and [[Martin Stuart-Fox]] in ''The Twilight Language: Explorations in Buddhist Meditation and Symbolism'' in 1986, the notion of "twilight language" is a supposed [[polysemy|polysemic]] language and communication system associated with [[tantra|tantric]] traditions in [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]] and Hinduism. It includes visual communication, verbal communication and nonverbal communication. Tantric texts are often written in a form of the twilight language that is incomprehensible to the uninitiated reader. As part of an [[esotericism|esoteric]] tradition of [[initiation]], the texts are not to be employed by those without an experienced guide and the use of the twilight language ensures that the uninitiated do not easily gain access to the knowledge contained in these works.

The phrase "twilight language" has subsequently been adopted by some other Western writers. For example, according to [[Judith Simmer-Brown]]:

{{quote|As has often been said, tantric texts are written in "twilight language" (''sandha-bhasa'', ''gongpay-kay''), which, as the ''[[Hevajra tantra]]'' states, is a "secret language, that great convention of the ''[[yogini]]s'', which the ''[[Śrāvaka|shravaka]]s'' and others cannot unriddle". This means that the texts of Buddhist tantra cannot be understood without the specific oral commentary by authorized Vajrayana teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Simmer-Brown (2002), p.169&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Usage==

===In the Vajrayana tradition===
As Bucknell and [[Martin Stuart-Fox|Stuart-Fox]] state:

{{quote|In the Vajrayana tradition, now preserved mainly in Tibetan sects, it has long been recognized that certain important teachings are expressed in a form of secret symbolic language known as {{IAST|saṃdhyā-bhāṣā}}, "Twilight Language". ''Mudrās'' and ''mantras'', {{IAST|maṇḍalas}} and ''cakras'', those mysterious devices and diagrams that were so much in vogue in the Buddhist culture of the 1960s, were all examples of Twilight Language [...]&lt;ref name="BSFvii" /&gt;}}

Numbers, numerology and the spirituality of numerals is key to the twilight language and endemic to Vajrayana, as it is throughout Indian religions. Numbers that are particularly frequent in classification are three, five and nine. As Bucknell and Stuart-Fox state:

{{quote|The fivefold classification presented in the ''tantras'' is remarkably comprehensive, embracing objects of every conceivable type; it includes the infamous set of "five Ms" (fish, meat, wine, ''mudrā'', sexual intercourse){{efn|On the "five Ms", see Walker (1968), p. 221}} and even a set of five "body fluids" (faeces, urine, blood, semen, flesh).{{efn|On the five "body fluids", see Elder (February 1976), pp. 241–242}} In addition it includes sets of doctrinal principles, such as the five ''skandhas'' (factors of existence), the four ''kāyas'' (Buddha-bodies) and the triad ''prajña'', ''upāya'', ''bodhicitta'' (wisdom, means, enlightenment-mind).  For example, ''prajña'', ''upāya'', and ''bodhicitta'' are identified with the triads female/male/union, Amitābha/Akṣobhya/Vairocana, and so on, and are thus implicitly assigned to the water, fire, and space groups respectively.{{efn|See Wayman (1962), pp. 89-90; also Snellgrove (1964), p. 27}}|''The Twilight Language''&lt;ref&gt;Bucknell, Stuart-Fox (1986), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===In the Pali Canon===
Although twilight language is primarily a feature of esoteric traditions such as the Vajrayana, Bucknell and Stuart-Fox cite the Thai ''bhikkhu'' Buddhadasa as having explored "the importance of symbolic language in the [[Pali Canon]] ... in a number of lectures and publications."&lt;ref name="BSFvii"&gt;Bucknell, Stuart-Fox (1986),  p.vii&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Sonepur literature===
Nayak holds the great fertile locality of [[Sonepur, Odisha]] and its literature is championed by such as Charyapada, [[Matsyendranath]], Daripada and other [[Nath]]s:

{{quote|The growth of literature at Sonepur can be traced to Charyapada, to Matsyendranath and Daripada of the Natha cult. They wrote esoteric poetry in language known as ''Sandhya bhasa''. The local idioms they used are still in currency in this area."&lt;ref&gt;Nayak (2006), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Refutation of the translation of term as "twilight language"==
In 1970, [[Mircea Eliade]] presented evidence that the concept of "twilight" (or "[[wikt:crepuscular|crepuscular]]") language is based on a translation error.  According to Eliade, in 1916 Haraprasād Shāstri proposed the translation of "twilight language". However in 1928 Vidhushekar Shāstri debunked that translation, showing that the term is based on a shortened form of the word ''sandhāya'', which can be translated as "having in view", "intending", or "with regard to". Eliade concludes that: "Hence there is no reference to the idea of a 'twilight language'."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade (1970), p. 250 (see also pp. 249–253, 410–411)&lt;/ref&gt; He continues by speculating on how the term came to be corrupted by scribes who read the familiar word ''sandhyā'' ("crepuscular") for the original ''sandhā''.  Eliade therefore translates the phrase as "Intentional Language". Staal explains, "sandhā means esoteric meaning, as contrasted with ''prima facie'' or superficial meaning," and suggests to translate sandhābhāsā as "secret language".&lt;ref&gt;Staal (1975), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal pragmatics''' ('''UP'''), more recently placed under the heading of '''formal pragmatics''', is the philosophical study of the necessary conditions for reaching an [[understanding]] through [[communication]]. The [[philosopher]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] coined the term in his essay "What is Universal Pragmatics?"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication and the Evolution of Society|last=Habermas|first=Jürgen|publisher=Beacon Press.|year=1979|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he suggests that human [[competition]], conflict, and strategic action are attempts to achieve understanding that have failed because of [[modal logic|modal]] confusions.  The implication is that coming to terms with how people understand or misunderstand one another could lead to a reduction of social [[Group conflict|conflict]].

By coming to an "understanding," he means at the very least, when two or more [[social actor]]s share the same [[Meaning (linguistic)|meanings]] about certain words or phrases; and at the very most, when these actors are confident that those meanings fit relevant social [[expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s (or a "mutually recognized [[normative background]]").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For Habermas, the [[Objective (goal)|goal]] of coming to an understanding is "intersubjective mutuality ... shared knowledge, mutual [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and accord with one another".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In other words, the underlying goal of coming to an understanding would help to foster the enlightenment, consensus, and good will necessary for establishing socially beneficial norms. Habermas' goal is not primarily for subjective feeling alone, but for development of shared (intersubjective) norms which in turn establish the [[Coordination game|social coordination]] needed for practical action in pursuit of shared and individual objectives (a form of action termed "[[communicative action]]").

As an interdisciplinary subject, universal pragmatics draws upon material from a large number of fields, from [[pragmatics]], [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], [[informal logic]], and the [[philosophy of language]], through [[social philosophy]], [[sociology]], and [[symbolic interactionism]], to [[ethics]], especially [[discourse ethics]], and on to [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of mind]].

==History==
Universal pragmatics (UP) seeks to overcome three dichotomies:  the dichotomy between ''body and mind'', between ''theory and practice'', and between ''[[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]''. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} It is part of a larger project to rethink the relationship between philosophy and the individual [[science]]s during a period of social crisis. The project is within the tradition of [[Critical Theory]], a program that traces back to the work of [[Max Horkheimer]].

The term "universal pragmatics" includes two different traditions that Habermas and his collaborator, colleague, and friend [[Karl-Otto Apel]] have attempted to reconcile. On the one hand, ideas are drawn from the tradition of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], wherein words and concepts are regarded as universally valid [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealizations]] of shared meanings. And, on the other hand, inspiration is drawn from the American [[Pragmatism|Pragmatist]] tradition (feat. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Charles W. Morris]]), for whom words are usually arbitrary signs devoid of intrinsic meaning, and whose function is to denote the things and processes in the objective world that surrounds the speakers. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

UP shares with [[speech act]] theory, semiotics, and [[linguistics]] an interest in the details of language use and communicative action. However, unlike those fields, it insists on a difference between the linguistic data that we ''observe'' in the '[[Analysis|analytic]]' mode, and the ''[[rational reconstruction]] of the rules of symbol systems'' that each reader/listener possesses intuitively when interpreting strings of words. In this sense, it is an examination of the two ways that language usage can be analyzed: as an object of scientific investigation, and as a 'rational reconstruction' of intuitive linguistic 'know-how'.

==Goals and methods==
Universal pragmatics is associated with the philosophical method of ''rational reconstruction''.

The basic concern in universal pragmatics is ''utterances'' (or ''[[speech acts]]'') in general.  This is in contrast to most other fields of linguistics, which tend to be more specialized, focusing exclusively on very specific sorts of utterances such as ''sentences'' (which in turn are made up of ''[[word]]s'', ''[[morpheme]]s'', and ''[[phoneme]]s'').

For Habermas, the most significant difference between a sentence and an utterance is in that sentences are judged according to how well they make sense ''grammatically'', while utterances are judged according to their ''communicative validity'' (see section 1). (1979:31)

Universal pragmatics is also distinct from the field of [[sociolinguistics]], because universal pragmatics is only interested in the meanings of utterances ''if they have to do with claims about truth or rightness'', while sociolinguistics is interested in all utterances in their social contexts. (1979:31, 33)

==Three aspects of universal pragmatics==
There are three ways to evaluate an utterance, according to UP. There are ''theories that deal with elementary propositions'', ''theories of first-person sentences'', and ''theories of speech acts''.

A theory of elementary propositions investigates those things in the real world that are being ''[[Theory of reference|reference]]d'' by an utterance, and the things that are implied by an [[utterance]], or ''predicate'' it. For example, the utterance "The first [[Prime Minister]] of Canada" refers to a man who went by the name of Sir [[John A. Macdonald]]. And when a speaker delivers the utterance, "My [[husband]] is a [[lawyer]]", it implies that the speaker is married to a man.

A theory of first-person sentences examines the expression of the ''intentions'' of the actor(s) through language and in the first-person.

Finally, a theory of speech acts examines the setting of standards for interpersonal relations through language. The basic goal for speech act theory is to explain how and when utterances in general are ''[[performative]]''. (1979:34) Central to the notion of speech acts are the ideas of [[illocutionary force]] and [[Perlocutionary act|perlocutionary force]], both terms coined by philosopher [[J.L. Austin]]. ''Illocutionary force'' describes the intent of the speaker, while ''perlocutionary force'' means ''the effect an utterance has in the world'', or more specifically, the effect on others.

A performative utterance is a sentence where an action being performed is done by the utterance itself. For example: "I inform you that you have a moustache", or "I promise you I will not burn down the house". In these cases, the words are also taken as significant actions: the act of informing and promising (respectively).

Habermas adds to this the observation that speech acts can either succeed or fail, depending on whether or not they succeed on ''[[Influence (sociology)|influencing]]'' another person in the intended way. (1979:35)

This last method of evaluation—the theory of speech acts—is the domain that Habermas is most interested in developing as a ''theory of communicative action''.

==Communicative action==

There are a number of ways to approach Habermas's project of developing a formal pragmatic analysis of communication. Because Habermas developed it in order to have a normative and philosophical foundation for his critical social theory, most of the inroads into formal pragmatics start from sociology, specifically with what is called [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]]. Action theory concerns the nature of human action, especially the manner in which collective actions are coordinated in a functioning society.

The coordination and integration of social action has been explained in many ways by many theories. [[Rational choice theory]] and [[game theory]] are two examples, which describe the integration of individuals into social groups by detailing the complex manner in which individuals motivated only by self-interest will form mutually beneficial and cooperative social arrangements. In contrast to these, Habermas has formulated a theory of ''communicative action''. (Habermas 1984; 1987) This theory and the project of developing a formal pragmatic analysis of communication are inseparable.

Habermas makes a series of distinctions in the service of explaining [[social action]]. The first major differentiation he makes is between two social realms, ''the system'' and ''the [[lifeworld]]''. These designate two distinct modes of [[social integration]]:
* The kind of social integration accomplished in the system is accomplished through ''the functional integration of the consequences of actions''. It bypasses the consciousness of individuals and does not depend upon their being oriented towards acting collectively. Economic and industrial systems are great examples, often producing complex forms of social integration and interdependence despite the openly competitive orientations of individuals.
* The social integration accomplished in the lifeworld, by contrast, depends upon ''the coordination of action plans and the conscious action-orientations of individuals''. It relies on processes of human interaction involving symbolic and cultural forms of meaning. More specifically, as Habermas maintains, the coordination of the lifeworld is accomplished through communicative action.

Thus, communicative action is an indispensable facet of [[society]]. It is at the heart of the lifeworld and is, Habermas claims, responsible for accomplishing several fundamental social functions: reaching understanding, cultural reproduction, coordinating action-plans, and [[socialization|socializing]] individuals.

However, Habermas is quick to note, different modes of interaction can (in some ways) facilitate these social functions and achieve integration within the lifeworld. This points towards the second key distinction Habermas makes, which differentiates ''communicative action'' from ''strategic action''. The coordination of action plans, which constitutes the social integration of the lifeworld, can be accomplished either through consensus or influence.

Strategic action is action oriented towards success, while communicative action is action oriented towards understanding. Both involve the symbolic resources of the lifeworld and occur primarily by way of linguistic interaction. On the one hand, actors employing communicative actions draw on the uniquely impelling force of mutual understanding to align the orientation of their action plans. It is this subtle but insistent binding force of communicative interactions that opens the door to an understanding of their meanings. On the other hand, actors employing strategic actions do not exploit the potential of communication that resides in the mutual recognition of a shared action-oriented understanding. Instead strategic actors relate to others with no intention of reaching consensus or mutual understanding, but only the intention of accomplishing pre-determined ends unrelated to reaching an understanding. Strategic action often involves the use of communicative actions to achieve the isolated intentions of individuals, manipulating shared understanding in the service of private interests. Thus, Habermas claims, strategic action is parasitic on communicative action, which means communicative action is the primary mode of linguistic interaction. Reaching a reciprocally defined understanding is communication's basic function.

Keeping in mind this delineation of the object domain, the formal pragmatics of communication can be more readily laid out. The essential insight has already been mentioned, which is that communication is responsible for irreplaceable modes of social integration, and this is accomplished through the unique binding force of a shared understanding. This is, in a sense, the pragmatic piece of formal pragmatics: communication does something in the world. What needs to be explained are the conditions for the possibility of what communication already does. This is, in a sense, the formal piece of formal pragmatics: a rational reconstruction of the deep generative structures that are the universal conditions for the possibility of a binding and compelling mutual understanding.

From here, Habermas heads the analysis in two directions. In one direction is a kind of [[linguistic analysis]] (of speech acts), which can be placed under the heading of the validity dimensions of communication. The other direction entails a categorization of the idealized presuppositions of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=T|date=1984|title=Reason and the Rationalization of Society|url=|journal=The Theory of Communicative Action|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communicative competence===

Habermas argues that when speakers are communicating successfully, they will have to defend their meaning by using these four claims.

# That they have ''uttered something'' understandably — or ''their statements are intelligible'';
# That they have given other people ''something to understand'' — or are speaking ''something true'';
# That ''the speaker'' is therefore understandable — or their ''intentions are recognized and appreciated'' for what they are; and,
# That they have come to an understanding ''with another person'' — or, they have used ''words that both actors can agree upon''. (1979:4)

Habermas is emphatic that these claims are universal—no human communication oriented at achieving mutual understanding could possibly fail to raise all of these validity claims.  Additionally, to illustrate that all other forms of communication are derived from that which is oriented toward mutual understanding, he argues that there are no other kinds of validity claims whatsoever.  This is important, because it is the basis of Habermas' critique of [[postmodernism]].

The fundamental orientation toward mutual understanding is at the heart of universal pragmatics, as Habermas explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The task of universal pragmatics is to identify and reconstruct universal conditions of possible mutual understanding... other forms of social action—for example, conflict, competition, strategic action in general—are derivatives of action oriented toward reaching understanding.  Furthermore, since language is the specific medium of reaching understanding at the sociocultural stage of evolution, I want to go a step further and single out explicit speech actions from other forms of communicative action."&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, 1976, "What is universal pragmatics?" p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any meaning that meets the above criteria, and is recognized by another as meeting the criteria, is considered "''vindicated''" or ''communicatively competent''.

In order for anyone to speak validly — and therefore, to have his or her comments vindicated, and therefore reach a genuine consensus and understanding — Habermas notes that a few more fundamental commitments are required. First, he notes, actors ''have to treat this formulation of validity so seriously that it might be a precondition for any communication at all''. Second, he asserts that ''all actors must believe that their claims are able to meet these standards of validity''. And third, he insists that there must be a common conviction among actors that all validity claims ''are either already vindicated or could be vindicated''.

===Examining the validity of speech===

Habermas claims that communication rests upon a non-egoistic understanding of the world, which is an idea he borrowed from thinkers like [[Jean Piaget]]. A subject capable of a de-centered understanding can take up three fundamentally different attitudes to the world. Habermas refers to such attitudes as ''dimensions of validity''. Specifically, this means individuals can recognize different standards for validity—i.e., that the validation of an [[empirical]] truth claim requires different methods and procedures than the validation of subjective truthfulness, and that both of those require different methods and procedures of validation than claims to normative rightness.

These dimensions of validity can be summarized as claims to ''truth (IT), truthfulness (I),'' and ''rightness (WE)''. So the ability to differentiate between the attitudes (and their respective "worlds") mentioned above should be understood as an ability to distinguish between types of validity claims.

M. Cooke provided the only book length treatment of Habermas's [[communication theory]]. Cooke explains:
:"when we adopt an objectifying attitude we relate, in the first instance to the objective world of facts and existing states of affairs [IT]; when we adopt a norm-conformative attitude we relate, in the first instance, to the social world of normatively regulated interactions [WE]; when we adopt an expressive attitude we relate, in the first instance to the subjective world of inner [[experience]] [I]". (Cooke 1994)

This is fundamental to Habermas's analysis of communication. He maintains that the performance of any speech act necessarily makes reference to these dimensions of validity, by raising at least three validity claims.

One way to grasp this idea is to take an inventory of the ways in which an attempt at communication can misfire, the ways a speech act can fail. A hearer may reject the offering of a speech act on the grounds that it is invalid because it:
# presupposes or explicates states of affairs which are not the case (IT);
# does not conform to accepted normative expectations (WE);
# raises doubts about the intentions or sincerity of the speaker (I).

Of course, from this it follows that a hearer who accepts the offering of a speech act does so on the grounds that it is valid because it:
# presupposes or explicates states of affairs that are true (IT);
# conforms to accepted normative expectations (WE);
# raises no doubts concerning the intentions or sincerity of the speaker (I).

This means that when engaging in communication the speaker and hearer are inescapably oriented to the validity of what is said. A speech act can be understood as an offering, the success or failure of which depends upon the hearer's response of either accepting or rejecting the validity claims it raises. The three dimensions of validity pointed out above are implicated in any attempt at communication.

Thus, communication relies on its being embedded within relations to various dimensions of validity. Any and every speech act is infused with inter-subjectively recognized claims to be valid. This implicitly ties communication to argumentation and various [[discourse|discursive]] procedures for the redemption of validity claims. This is true because to raise a validity claim in communication is to simultaneously imply that one is able to show, if challenged, that one's claim is justified. Communication is possible because speakers are accountable for the validity of what they say. This assumption of responsibility on the part of the speaker is described by Habermas as a ''"warranty"'', because in most cases the validity claims raised during communication are taken as [[wikt:justify|justified]], and communication proceeds on that basis. Similarly, the hearer is accountable for the stance he or she takes up in relation to the validity claims raised by the speaker. Both speaker and hearer are bound to the validity claims raised by the utterances they share during communication. They are bound by the weak obligations inherent in pursuing actions oriented towards reaching an understanding. Habermas would claim that this obligation is a rational one:

:"With every speech act, by virtue of the validity claims it raises, the speaker enters into an interpersonal relationship of mutual obligation with the hearer: The speaker is obliged to support her claims with reasons, if challenged, and the hearer is obliged to accept a claim unless he has good reason not to do so. The obligation in question is, in the first instance, not a moral one but a rational one -- the penalty of failure to fulfill it is the charge not of immorality but of irrationality -- although clearly the two will often overlap" (Cooke, 1994).

This begins to point towards the idea of [[communicative rationality]], which is the potential for [[rationality]] that is implicit in the validity basis of everyday communication, the shape of reason that can be extracted from Habermas's formal-pragmatic analyses.

:"The modern -- decentered -- understanding of the world has opened up different dimensions of validity; to the extent that each dimension of validity has its own standards of truth and falsity and its own modes of justification for determining these, one may say that what has been opened up are dimensions of rationality" (Cooke, 1994).

However, before the idea of communicative rationality can be described, the other direction of Habermas's formal pragmatic analyses of communication needs to be explained. This direction looks towards the idealized presuppositions of communication.

===Ideal presuppositions of communication===

When individuals pursue actions oriented towards reaching an understanding, the speech acts they exchange take on the weight of a mutually recognized validity. This means each actor involved in communication takes the other as [[accountable]] for what they have said, which implies that good reasons could be given by all to justify the validity of the understanding that is being achieved. Again, in most situations the redemption of validity claims is not an explicit undertaking (except in ''discourses'', see below). Instead, each actor issues a ''"warranty"'' of accountability to the other, which only needs to be redeemed if certain validity claims are thrown into question. This suggests that the validity claims raised in every communicative interaction implicitly tie communication to argumentation.

It is here that the idealized presuppositions of communication arise. Habermas claims that all forms of argumentation, even implicit and rudimentary ones, rest upon certain "idealizing suppositions," which are rooted in the very structures of action oriented towards understanding. These "strong idealizations" are always understood as at least approximately satisfied by participants in situations where argumentation (and communication) is thought to be taking place. Thus, when during communication it is discovered that the belief that these presuppositions are satisfied is not justified it is always taken as problematic. As a result, steps are usually taken to reestablish and maintain the belief that they are approximately satisfied, or communication is simply called off.

# The most basic of these idealized presuppositions is the presupposition that ''participants in communicative exchange are using the same linguistic expressions in the same way''. This is an obvious but interesting point, which clearly illustrates what an idealized presupposition is. It is a presupposition because communication would not proceed if those involved did not think it was at least approximately satisfied (in this case that a shared language was being used). It is idealized because no matter how closely it is approximated it is always [[counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] (because, in this case, the fact is that all meanings are to some degree personally defined).
# Another, basic idealized presupposition of argumentation is the presupposition that ''no relevant argument is [[self-censorship|suppressed]] or excluded by the participants''.
# Another is the presupposition that ''no [[persuasion|persuasive]] force except that of the better argument is exerted''.
# There is also the presupposition that ''all the participants are motivated only by a concern for the better argument''.
# There is the presupposition of attributing a ''context-transcending significance to validity claims''. This presupposition is controversial but important (and becomes expanded and clarified in the presuppositions of discourse, see below). The idea is that participants in communication instill their claims with a validity that is understood to have significance beyond the specific context of their agreement.
# The presupposition that ''no validity claim is exempt in principle from critical evaluation in argumentation'';
# The presupposition that ''everyone capable of speech and action is entitled to participate'', and everyone is equally entitled to introduce new topics or express attitudes needs or desires.

In sum, all these presuppositions must be assumed to be approximately satisfied in any situation of communication, despite their being necessarily counterfactual. Habermas refers to the positing of these idealized presuppositions as the "simultaneously unavoidable and trivial accomplishments that sustain communicative action and argumentation".

Habermas calls ''discourses'' those forms of communication that come sufficiently close to actually satisfying these presuppositions. Discourses often occur within [[institutional]]ized forms of argumentation that self-reflectively refine their procedures of communication, and as a result, have a more rigorous set of presuppositions in addition to the ones listed above.

A striking feature of discourse is that validity claims tend to be explicitly thematized and there is the presupposition that all possible [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]]s would agree to the universal validity of the conclusions reached. Habermas especially highlights this in what he calls ''theoretical discourses'' and ''practical discourses''. These are tied directly to two of the three dimensions of validity discussed above: theoretical discourse being concerned with validity claims thematized regarding objective states of affairs (IT); practical discourse being concerned with validity claims thematized concerning the rightness of norms governing social interactions (WE).

Habermas understands presupposition (5) to be responsible for generating the self-understanding and continuation of theoretical and practical discourses. Presupposition (5) points out that the validity of an understanding reached in theoretical or practical discourse, concerning some factual knowledge or normative principle, is always expanded beyond the immediate context in which it is achieved. The idea is that participants in discourses such as these presuppose that any understanding reached could attain universal [[Consensus|agreement]] concerning its universal validity if these discourses could be relieved of the constraints of time and space. This idealized presupposition directs discourses concerning truth and normative certainty beyond the contingencies of specific communicative situations and towards the idealized achievements of universal consensus and universal validity. It is a rational reconstruction of the conditions for the possibility of earnest discourses concerning facts and norms. Recall that, for Habermas, rational reconstructions aim at offering the most acceptable account of what allows for the competencies already mastered by a wide range of subjects. In order for discourse to proceed, the existence of [[fact]]s and [[Norm (philosophy)|norms]] must be presupposed, yet the certainty of an absolute [[knowledge]] of them must be, in a sense, postponed.

Striking a Piagetian and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]an chord, Habermas understands the deep structures of collective inquiry as [[Developmental psychology|development]]al. Thus, the presupposition shared by individuals involved in discourse is taken to reflect this. The pursuit of truth and normative certainty is taken to be motivated and grounded, not in some objective or social world that is treated as a "given", but rather in a learning process. Indeed, Habermas himself is always careful to formulate his work as a [[research project]], open to refinement.

In any case, reconstructing the presuppositions and validity dimensions inherent to communication is valuable because it brings into relief the inescapable foundations of everyday practices. Communicative action and the rudimentary forms of argumentation that orient the greater part of human interaction cannot be left behind. By reconstructing the deep structures of these Habermas has discovered a seed of rationality planted in the very heart of the lifeworld. Everyday practices, which are common enough to be trivial, such as reaching an understanding with another, or contesting the reasons for pursuing a course of action, contain an implicit and idealized rationality.

In other words, communication is always somewhat rational. Communication could not occur if the participants thought that the speech acts exchanged did not carry the weight of a validity for which those participating could be held accountable. Nor would anyone feel that a conclusion was justified if it was achieved by any other means than the uncoerced force of the better argument. Nor could the specialized discourses of [[law]], science and [[morality]] continue if the progress of knowledge and insight was denied in favor of [[relativism]].

====Criticism====
It is a question how appropriate it is to speak of "communication" tenselessly, and of "everyday practices" as though they cut across all times and cultures. That they do cannot be assumed, and [[anthropology]] provides evidence of significant difference. It is possible to ignore these facts by limiting the scope of universal pragmatics to current forms of discourse, but this runs the risk of contradicting Habermas's own demand for (5). Moreover, the initial unease with the classical and [[Liberalism|liberal]] views of rationality had to do precisely with their ahistorical character and refusal, or perhaps inability, to acknowledge their own origins in circumstances of the day. Their veneer of false universality torn off by the likes of [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], it remains to be seen whether "universal" pragmatics can stand up to the same challenges posed by [[deconstruction]] and [[skepticism]].

In the countable sense, a '''verse''' is formally a single [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] [[Line (poetry)|line]] in a [[poetry|poetic composition]]. However, verse has come to represent any division or grouping of words in a poetic composition, with groupings traditionally having been referred to as [[stanza]]s.

In the uncountable ([[mass noun]]) sense '''verse''' refers to  "[[poetry]]" as contrasted to [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wiktionary'', "Verse" (accessed 8 August 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Where the common unit of verse is based on [[meter (poetry)|meter]] or [[rhyme]], the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.types-of-poetry.org.uk/45-verse.htm "Verse"], "Types-Of-Poetry", Screen 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense '''verse''' is also used pejoratively in contrast to [[poetry]] to suggest work that is too pedestrian or too incompetent to be classed as poetry.

==Types of verse==
===Blank verse===
[[Blank verse]] is poetry written in regular, metrical, but unrhymed, lines, almost always composed of iambic pentameters.
&lt;poem&gt;
    Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit
    Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
    Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of Eden, 'till one greater Man
    ....
                                              —[[John Milton]] (from [[Paradise Lost]])

===Free verse===
[[Free verse]] is usually defined as having no fixed meter and no end rhyme. Although free verse may include end rhyme, it commonly does not.
&lt;poem&gt;
    Whirl up, sea—
    Whirl your pointed pines,
    Splash your great pines
    On our rocks,
    Hurl your green over us,
    Cover us with your pools of fir.

                                              —[[H.D.]]

The '''Welsh Language Act 1967''',&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Welsh Language Act 1967|path=ukpga/1967/66/contents/enacted|asmade=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which gave some rights to use the [[Welsh language]] in legal proceedings in [[Wales]] (including [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]) and gave the relevant Minister the right to authorise the production of a Welsh version of any documents required or allowed by the Act. 

==Act==
The Welsh Language Act 1967 is a short Act, consisting of a Preamble and five sections. The Preamble states that "it is proper that the Welsh language should be freely used by those who so desire in the hearing of legal proceedings in Wales". The first section gives the right to use Welsh orally in court proceedings in Wales provided that the person who wishes to do so has notified the court in advance. The second and third sections allowed but did not require Ministers to provide Welsh versions of forms or wordings. The fourth section of the Act repealed the provision in Part 3 of the [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746]] that the term "England" should include Wales. 

==History==
The Act was based on the Hughes Parry report into the status of Welsh, published in 1965, which advocated equal validity for Welsh in speech and in written documents, both in the courts and in public administration in Wales. However, the Act did not include all of the report's recommendations. 

The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542|Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]] had made English the only language of the [[law court]]s and other aspects of public administration in Wales, even though most of the population spoke Welsh and few spoke English. The 1967 Act was the first alteration to this situation, but the [[Welsh Language Act 1993]],&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Welsh Language Act 1993|path=ukpga/1993/38/contents}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to put Welsh on an equal basis with English in public life.

'''ǃGãǃne''' (!Gã!nge) is an [[List of extinct languages|extinct]] language of the [[Tuu languages|ǃKwi]] family, once spoken near [[Tsolo]] and in [[Umtata]] District in South Africa, south of Lesotho. The only material on the language is 140 words collected from two semi-speakers (rememberers) in 1931.&lt;ref name=Traill&gt;Anthony Traill, "The Khoisan Languages of South Africa", in Rajend Mesthrie, ed., 1995, ''Language and Social History: Studies in South African Sociolinguistics''&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[ǁXegwi language|ǁXegwi]], ǃGãǃne is considered an "outlier" among the !Kwi languages by Güldemann (2005, 2011).  ''[[Ethnologue]]'' and ''Glottolog'' count it as a dialect of [[Seroa language|Seroa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|kqu|Seroa}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the two have no demonstrable connection apart from being in the !Kwi family.&lt;ref name="Traill" /&gt;
